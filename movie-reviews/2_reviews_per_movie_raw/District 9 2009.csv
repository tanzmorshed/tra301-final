"NonSequiturL","10","2007","2431","13 August 2009"," The first science fiction masterpiece in years
","I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.<br/><br/>Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.<br/><br/>There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it's all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place."
"Robert_90","9","704","915","13 August 2009"," Expect the unexpected
","Everyone's seen the trailer that kick-started one very fishy-looking viral campaign, interviewing several humans and an alien in quick succession. That marks many people's first exposure to Neill Blomkamp's District 9, and the trailer - which had a decently executed ""mockumentary"" feel to it, which only served to make its sci-fi content seem even more surprising. This same element of surprise is still present throughout the film proper, and it is quite a cinematic treat.<br/><br/>District 9 takes place in an alternate timeline where, twenty years ago, an alien spaceship came to a halt above the city of Johannesburg. The inhabitants of the ship are unable to operate the ship anymore, so they end up being segregrated to their own slum within the city below. Eventually, the government calls for the eviction of the aliens (nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their appearance) from the slum. The film's ostensible protagonist is Wikus (Sharlto Copley), who through a series of events too complicated to recount in a synopsis, ends up undergoing some rather dramatic changes and before long he's thrust into the middle of something far too big for him to handle...<br/><br/>The best thing about District 9 is that it always manages to stay fresh and surprising throughout. As the trailers indicate, it starts off as a mockumentary in order to expose the gist of the story. The film gradually crosses over to being a more conventional film, although still filmed with a very documentarian look and interspersed with occasional news footage or interviews. Despite the unexpected change in presentation, you don't really notice because you're so wrapped up in the ingenious premise. Then you're presented with the plight of Wikus, whose story is one I don't really want to expose too much because watching it all unfold was just amazing to watch. He's a perfect example of the Everyman, trying to survive as best he can in the face of everything that the world throws at him over the course of the film. His development, along with that Chris, the prawn he befriends (who is surprisingly well-rounded for a CGI character) raises this above your average science-fiction film. Even when the film's final third act becomes incredibly action-packed, it still doesn't jar with the mood of the film and doesn't forsake its characters and intelligence for the sake of cheap action sequences.<br/><br/>On that subject, the action sequences are far from ""cheap"". Given that Blomkamp and collaborator Peter Jackson were originally aiming to make a film adaptation of Halo before changing to this, there's still plenty of moments that feel quite reminiscent of Bungie's game, from the alien technology to the frantic battles. The effects work looks great in even the simplest of situations, to say nothing of the bombastic finale. There's just something about the way it all comes together, especially when it is combined with one very uncompromising storyline and subject.<br/><br/>District 9 is a rare find nowadays. It doesn't sacrifice the intelligence or raw power that its story affords it for the sake of appeasing your ""typical"" blockbuster crowd with a lighter rating and less focus on the story. It's a damned fine thriller that is not without its flaws, but is still several cuts above your average summer film and is well worth watching - but only if you can handle the heat. And it does get quite hot."
"Billy_Costigan","Null","432","563","16 August 2009"," District 9 - Not your typical Sci-Fi Action Thriller
","District 9 is a story about aliens who make contact with Earth and the relationships with humans and society. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare. Their sole interest, alien technology and weapons. Weapon research would mean huge profits for the company. Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is placed in charge of the filed operation to evict, remove, and place the aliens in a new holding facility. Conflict and tension threaten the operation as agents move in. <br/><br/>Don't be fooled. This isn't your typical alien sci-fi action movie. What got me was the believability. If there were aliens out there that were able to make contact with Earth, it seems it could have gone something like this. The way the perspective switches from mock documentary style to standard third person certainly contributes to it. ""Real"" news footage and interviewers tell the story in retrospect, as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. I think it all added to the realism of the experience. <br/><br/>Usually in these type of films, it's mostly mindless action and the story is lost. Not the case here. There's so much more to it. It's also about betrayal, loyalty, trust, relationships, and sacrifice. It can actually be pretty deep and thought provoking with many themes floating around. The film's really about the story which is really a fresh, gritty, original concept, which is good to see nowadays. <br/><br/>While the creatures can be most readily described as monsters, though they are like us. Family and friendship are still important ideals in their world. The film explores a fine line between human emotions and monsters. With all the selfishness, hatred, and greed within us, maybe we are the real monsters or at least that's how it can be perceived. <br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp does a tremendous job with the direction and realism of the film. Sharlto Copley blew me away. I was shocked to see this was his first acting role. The action sequences were well done as well. District 9 is a very unique sci-fi film, one that shouldn't be missed. Mind you, this isn't a film for everyone. It's violent, and many parts can be cringe worthy. Be warned but be ready for one of the best films of the year thus far."
"tomcraft000","Null","989","1355","10 August 2009"," Not what I expected
","I attended a promotional screening for this with a pretty good attitude towards all the hype that surrounded it. It was not what I expected, it was much better. <br/><br/>Not only were the CGI top notch, but the narrative is driven through a believable plot. Watching this film made me believe that a situation as such had occurred on Earth, and therefore the far fetched notion of an extra terrestrial race visiting us becomes so close to a reality through a story that is so realistically depicted. <br/><br/>District 9 is a beautifully crafted film which shows signs of great promise for being around for a while, a subject talked about by many people. Can't wait to watch this again with my friends = )"
"dark_fibre","10","678","946","10 August 2009"," This should not be missed!
","Just got home from a preview of District 9. We had seen the previews and were intrigued to see just what the film would be like. <br/><br/>The film style was very much documentary like with lots of sound byte style comments settings the scenes and giving commentary all through the film. These in my opinion took it from being what could have been just another ""aliens vs humans"" film and elevated into the realms of social commentary. The aliens are presented almost as animals yet you rapidly start to sympathize with them and tune into their desperation.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the alien space ship in the background and the poor being alien in every sense, you would think this was a movie about any slum and the people who prey on the inhabitants.<br/><br/>Like other films which cover the worst that humans can do, there is a brutal violence present and the directory has not shied away from depicting it. This is not a film you want to watch after a big meal. Just ask my girlfriend. She thought she would have to leave half way through. <br/><br/>In all, this is a film we worth every cent to see. Right up until the end you are never sure what's going to happen next. The characters are believable and the style of the film just adds to it. This could have happened, and in fact may happen. <br/><br/>For a first effort, Neill Blomkamp has created one of the best SciFi for a while, his future work will be well worth paying attention to."
"Darkslide92","10","873","1227","13 August 2009"," Wow
","I caught an early screening of this movie last night. I went into it with high expectations considering the high ratings it has been getting already. My expectations were not high enough however because this film exceeded my them in every way possible.<br/><br/>I will not go far into detail because I would prefer to not spoil anything. This is unlike any sci-fi we have seen in years. Forget Terminator 3 and 4, forget the AVP movies, forget all those laughable sci-fi movies, this film is what we have been waiting for. An original idea, an original concept, brilliantly executed, great CGI, good acting, it just has it all. We have seen many aliens come to earth movies, but this is different, I will not say why though. That is for you to find out when you see it, which I HIGHLY recommend you do.<br/><br/>This movie, quality-wise, matches up with the popular Sci-Fi films we love. The original Alien, the original Predator, The Matrix, Star Wars, etc. While I enjoyed those ones more because they are classics, this one clearly meets the standards we expect today when it comes to quality. A big driving force behind this, in my opinion, is the fact that high esteemed Peter Jackson is behind this project as the producer. After seeing his masterful Lord of the Rings saga, anyone can see that he knows what he is doing.<br/><br/>As far as movies for this year, this is definitely top 5 so far on my list (Up, Star Trek, 500 Days of Summer, HP6, and District 9). Thank you Jackson and Hollywood for finally producing the best Sci-Fi in years. If this movie does not make its way to IMDb top 250 then I will be in awe.<br/><br/>See this movie!"
"dvc5159","8","474","679","13 August 2009"," Excellent no-nonsense sci-fi actioner...
","Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.<br/><br/>The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their money's worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also non-stop) action sequences in the film's second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docu-drama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, it's an excellent science fiction action film, but not without it's intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichés (these happen near the end of the film) but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel, I'll be first in line to see it.<br/><br/>Overall value: 8.5/10"
"dickjones-91895","8","46","59","29 September 2018"," Nice!
","I watched this again after 9 years. Still as impressive as it was back then visually and otherwise. The soundtrack was great. Reminded of how good South African films can be. Check it out if you haven't already"
"thebackofmyhouse","9","512","763","13 August 2009"," It is just THAT good.
","Saying this movie is good would be an understatement. The movie has it all, a very intriguing deep plot, good acting and great action. If I was to find a flaw in this movie, it would be the shaky cam technique employed at the beginning part of the movie and also at the very end. The shaky parts are supposedly documentary clips telling the story of Wikus, the protagonist. But rather than add to the feel of it, the shakiness is just nauseating. They just over did it. But after a while into the movie, they got out of the documentary mode and things couldn't be any better. And the special effects in his movie will have you believing that these aliens are real.<br/><br/>It's better that you go into this movie not knowing the deeper plot as a big part of the movie's entertainment value for me is the parts when things look hopeless and you really feel the despair and hopelessness of the characters. The only thing you need to know going in is that there are aliens stranded on earth and they are put in slums. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that teases you that it's nearing its end, but inside, you go ""No, I want more. It can't end like this"", and the movie hears you and gives you more. And it's primed for a great sequel. The potential that this franchise has is just enormous. The way they can expand the story is just limitless and all of them can add to it's lore. This is a classic franchise in the making."
"ryan-clements-1","10","536","802","12 August 2009"," Worst RomCom ever!
","I attended a preview screening of District 9 last night, and I am in absolute awe of this film and its director Neill Blomkamp.<br/><br/>Thanksfully, I knew relatively little about the story going into the film. I had a rough idea of the concept and had seen a few TV spots, but thankfully the film delivered so much more than I was led to expect.<br/><br/>What I like most about the film is that it increasingly gains momentum throughout its runtime, starting out as a mockumentary (and thinly veiled social commentary), but then delves into more mainstream thriller territory, before culminating in some thoroughly entertaining action set pieces. If action is your thing, be sure to stick it out through to the latter half of the film. As I was leaving the cinema, I overheard many other patrons saying exactly that... ""I wasn't too sure for the first hour, but I'm glad I stayed"" (personally, I have never walked out of a film at the cinema).<br/><br/>That is not to say that the first half is any less impressive. I am a big fan of realism in films such as this, and as such, I really enjoyed the documentary feel. I think the intention was for the entire film to be in the mockumentary style, but for me the style changes and takes on a more mainstream look (albeit hand-held)... which I think is important to know going in. There are also a few areas where it couldn't be believed that a documentary crew could still be filming (or even alive). But I think the film is much better for this, and definitely more memorable.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that irks me about this film, its that the story moves at an incredible pace... particularly in the earlier scenes in the film, which feel rather rushed, and seemingly at odds with the realistic documentary feel it was going for. Things just seem to happen so quickly, leaving little time to digest the premise and characters. I would love to see a version of the movie that extends the first half to allow a greater look into the reality presented to us.<br/><br/>SFX-wise, there are no complaints. There is the odd bit of artificial blurring on some alien movement, but overall we are presented with a very low-key, realistic CGI presentation that could teach Hollywood a thing or two.<br/><br/>One other aspect that I must mention is the performance of the lead character. Seeing a film of this caliber that has no recognisable actors, with foreign (to an Aussie!) accents just adds to the authenticity... but Sharlto Copley (in his debut performance) is a revelation and one of the most memorable aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie enough, and the wait until the weekend so I can see this film again is just too long!"

","After ""District 9"" was over, I had to run from the theater to the hotel and take a long, long shower. ""District 9"" is a first. We've never seen anything quite like it. A metaphor for a world that's becoming faster and faster a huge melting pot where nothing truly melts. The have and the have not. New ghettos, new forms of life and we have to learn to live with it or, or what? Neill Blomkamp, the 30 year old director, is someone who's exploded into the film scene and I'm sure he'll stay for a long time to come. A commercial director with a refined artistic mind. Accessible without being condescending a real find and who found him? Peter Jackson. A man that I suspect is creating a Hollywood overseas, a Hollywood for the thinking man. I urge you to see ""District 9"" and get used to those aliens, they stand for something that is already here."
"aidanratesmovies","9","6","6","9 February 2020"," Unlike Anything Before
","With some fascinating and wildly realistic worldbuilding, and some well given direction, District 9 is a modern day sci-fi classic that will not soon be forgotten. The film does have its fair share of problems from time to time, whether it is its struggle to find an appropriate pacing, burdening on cliches, or mimicking around plot holes in its story. However, District 9 offers some of the best realistic sci-fi films have had to offer in quite some time, with some splendid performances, mostly good CGI and a harsh but entertaining nature. Highest praise goes to Neill Blomkamp, whose vision for the films shines more than anything, with its gritty and sole picture being the backbone of the film entirely. The writing can vary from strange and complex, to weak and illogical, but it's shining moments are what sticks through the longest. The performances are all well given, although there isn't quite any standouts, as it just feels so lifelike, it's hard to quite pick what actor is truly giving the best work. In the end, District 9 is an unforeseen gem that is not to be missed, and not to be forgotten.
My Rating: 9/10"
"perica-43151","10","15","20","20 July 2018"," A masterpeace
","This movie is so original and nice, that I am not going to take points off for some over the top action sequences that take a bit from its genre and concept cutting nature. Like all sci fi master-peaces, this movie poses quite a few questions, gives us new perspective, that has not been explored enough if at all. And the frightening comments about aliens are even better when you learn that they were genuine, made about the human aliens i.e. refugees. But there is much more going on. This is a must see movie and a defining movie of the 21st century sci fi genre."

","I recently attending a promotional screening of District 9. I would like to give my opinion of the film, but not any of the plot or details.<br/><br/>I went into the theater basically only knowing the genre of the film, being exposed just to the minimal ""humans only"" ads. While I watching the film, I immediately wanted to view it again. It is intriguing and highly entertaining, with a dynamic characters and rich in both humor and action. Once it ended, my friends and I chattered excitedly about the numerous aspects we liked.

"JayFX75","9","42","65","31 August 2009"," Gritty, real, and very entertaining.
","I have never been a huge supporter of South African based movies (this one written & directed by Neill Blomkamp) as I tend to find them a bit cheesy, but this movie was definitely the exception to the rule. Initially, the first 5 to 10 minutes were a bit difficult as my Hollywood brainwashed brain, battled to get past the thick ""Souf Afrikan"" accents and the really gritty & realistic local setting. But my efforts were well rewarded with a fine performance from a truly brilliant cast, and a direction equivalent to even better than what Hollywood can churn out. Neill Blomkamp can a be very, very proud man.<br/><br/>At it's core, I would classify District 9 as a Science Fiction Action/Drama. And without spoiling to much, the movie takes place in a slum in Johannesburg, where a group of aliens (often referred to as prawns!) have been segregated from the rest of the populous after their mother ship breaks down and leaves them stranded on earth. 20 years later the story picks up where Wikus vd Merwe, a field agent for the MSU, is tasked with relocating the aliens to a ""better"" place - 200km's away from Joburg - where they can live in peace and without fear of conflict, confrontation and intimidation by the rather hostile locals. Thats the basic premise, however there is far more to the story than that and I definitely am not going to spoil it.<br/><br/>Wikus vd Merwe, the main protagonist, was brilliantly played by Sharlto Copely. Really, I was most impressed. His character was rich and complex and was played out with sincerity and passion. However, just when you think you have him all figured out, he goes and says (or does) something that changes your perception of him altogether as he alters his behaviored pattern based on the current situation. This depth in character is not often seen in movies, and came as a welcome surprise. Hats off to Mr. Blomkamp for focusing on this through his filming and writing.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is a real treat as well. The setting is gritty, grimy & dirty and really showcased slum life realistically. The special effects present was also exceptional but never over used. The first part (or half?) of the movie was done in the style of a documentary, with interviews and news pieces glued together to enable the viewer to catch up on what has transpired, and with some liberal use of the ""shaky cam"" style. This really adds to the realism but is only prevalent in the first half as the second half tends to settle down on a more stable style of filming.<br/><br/>The movie has a 16 age restriction, and justly so. There is plenty of swearing, and enough gory splats that i found myself going ""yuck"" on one or two occasions. So you have been warned. But if you can handle this kind of thing, you are in for a treat as it's never really gratuitous, but justified most of the time because of the reality that the movie portrays.<br/><br/>After leaving the movie, I was still chewing over the whole concept which clearly indicates this is not the kind of in-one-ear-out-the-other kind of movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say its a thinking man's science fiction, but it definitely does leave some food for thought. Another great thing is that you don't have to be a Science Fiction fan to enjoy it, as my wife who is more into drama's, thoroughly enjoyed as well (she gave it a 10!).<br/><br/>So does it deserve your money for a ticket? Most definitely yes. Niell Blomkamp hit a home run with this movie, and we need to show our support. Go out and see it as soon as you can. I give it a strong 9."
"sarastro7","10","48","77","13 September 2009"," District 9 is more subtle than you might think
","District 9 is a movie to think about. The first (and second) time I watched District 9, I wasn't quite sure what to think. I came at it from the p.o.v. of a science fiction fan, and I thought some of the SF elements were not entirely thought through. But I thought some more about it, and things started to gel.<br/><br/>Movies have been made before that people thought were about racism. I'm thinking of a brilliant film like Pleasantville, which on the face of it seems to be about race, but was much more complex underneath that surface. And I'm thinking of another brilliant 1998 film like Bulworth, where race was used to symbolize rich and poor. District 9, at first, seems not simply to be about race, but about xenophobia generally, and the plight of refugees especially. Penetrating deeper, this appearance however, while effective and admirable, is also deceptive. District 9 is one film that actually IS about racism. This is a South African film. The aliens in it arrived 28 years ago, when the inhuman Apartheid system was still in effect.<br/><br/>So what is this film saying? Get this: It is using aliens to explain to us that there is still effective Apartheid in South Africa today. The aliens symbolize the black South Africans, and how they are still ostracized from much of common/white society and kept in crime-infested and corruption-ridden areas. Having no future and no hope and no voice. That's also why, in the film, the Nigerians are Nigerians - they couldn't be South Africans, because the *aliens* are the South Africans.<br/><br/>The bio-fluid used to power the space-ship represents the life-force and will to live that the black South Africans have lost. In the film, it must be the catastrophic loss of almost all their bio-fluid that led to the big ship's crash in the first place, and to the poor condition of the aliens inside it. The alien technology represents cultural substance; it is a beautiful symbol of all that we have to learn from so-called primitive cultures. If we'll open up to their problems and cultural content, we will all be the richer for it.<br/><br/>Even the documentary form of the first part of the film also makes proper sense in light of this interpretation. The documentary part is supposed to make the audience identify with the whites, whereas when the documentary style of storytelling disappears, the audience is left free to choose a different allegiance. In other words, we start by being shown that *we* are the ones at fault, and then we are given the opportunity to change.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film. I rate it 10 stars out of 10."
"J-Star","10","10","13","1 May 2012"," A fresh, non-sentimental take on a stock story
","District 9 is a gem... a very fresh, believable take on a stock story.<br/><br/>Let me get all the other praise done before I delve deeper into that.<br/><br/>The actors - though all unknown on the international scene - make fantastic characters. Especially Sharlto Copley manage to make a perfect portrayal of the bumbling van de Merwe, thrown into this nightmare that completely upends his life. From start to finish he delivers this anti- hero without making him into something else.<br/><br/>The CGI is very low key and is not made to dazzle and amaze, but rather used effectively as a tool to make the aliens 100% believable. The blending of reality and sci-fi is completely seamless. Hollywood: take note. This is how you do it.<br/><br/>The plot develops in a gripping manner... grabbing hold of you from the start and only occasionally letting go of your neck enough for you to breathe before turning up the pressure again.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a stock story: the unwitting naive handyman sent in to do the dirty-work of others'. But being exposed to the brutality of it all, he switches sides. We have seen it in Avatar, Ferngully.. dozens of other movies. But District 9 has its own take on it and gives it a proper treatment. You don't see it coming... at least not the way it eventually happens.<br/><br/>You don't really sympathize with the aliens. They are ugly... repulsive even. They live is squalor and filth and you just want to leave as soon as you can. Their manners are crude, disgusting... there's nothing to like about them. You become one of the oppressors. And that makes the transition so much more effective.<br/><br/>Above all you do not get a wishy-washy, sugary sweet no-brainer moral choice offered to you with a smile on a silver platter. It's not a matter of choosing between the beautiful sensual humanoids who love in harmony and peace in an enchanted forest one one hand, and the ugly greedy humans on the other... no. You get a gun to your head and is forced down the path. In District 9, the 'choice' is a brutal fight for survival. And not everything turns out beautiful and good for everyone at the end. The real evil doesn't get their just desserts... the oppressed ones aren't embraced with open loving arms... and the hero... well... see for yourself.<br/><br/>District 9 is believable, masterfully made, brilliantly acted and very suspenseful. Don't miss it."

","I just saw an advance screening for DISTRICT 9 with some others from my book club. Half of the 300 people attending were still buzzing about this film-goers' delight when the lights came up after closing credits. Some said its setting in South Africa's Soweto slums reminded them of CITY OF GOD. Others said its mockumentary style was reminiscent of CLOVERFIELD. Someone said it ranks up there with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951, of course) and ALIEN for sci-fi originality. Another fan said it reminded her of IMPOSTOR ""on steroids"" (I looked this up, and it's an obscure 2001 flick starring Gary Sinise, in a moral dilemma similar to Wikus' in DISTRICT 9). At any rate, normally I don't award low-budget ($5 million) remakes of shorts with a ""10"" out of 10 rating, but I found DISTRICT 9 to be enough of an eye-opener to deserve a ""10,"" despite being more flawed than any other top-ranking movie I can think of at the moment. The key to enjoying DISTRICT 9 is to sit back, and not to nit-pick. It may lack the stars and special effects bazillions of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN or STAR TREK: THE FUTURE BEGINS, but DISTRICT 9 will give most people more food for thought than either of those two earlier releases of this summer."

It's great to see aliens choosing somewhere else in the world other than New York or LA as well, and this really still felt like a South African film, as opposed to a Hollywood film on location in South Africa.<br/><br/>if budgets are to be believed, they have put $30m to extremely good use. Perhaps saving money by not hiring famous actors. no matter. all the cast were exceptional anyway.<br/><br/>The interaction between live action and CGI was seamless. Fantastically done.<br/><br/>The whole sociology behind the film was very intelligent, the way that humans would perhaps treat this situation, and a clear critique on apartheid itself. It wasn't rammed down your throat though, and it didn't take away from the actual story.<br/><br/>However, it seems to have split a lot of people down the middle. I don't know what some of my friends were expecting, but some of them absolutely HATED it.<br/><br/>perhaps this is because of the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Some people are annoyed by the main actor in the film, especially his voice (and specifically the way he says the ""F"" word). 2. I've heard some complain about the stupidity of aliens becoming addicted to cat food. 3. The ending (which i won't say)<br/><br/>I actually thought the main guy was totally believable. You went from liking him to hating him to liking him constantly through the film, and this was down to his acting. He was able to provoke very emotive thoughts out of situations which is a great skill. I understand he's not an actor by trade as well. The cat food thing - why not? alien bodies, who's to say the way it would make them react. it's usually full of rubbish anyway so it very well might. they might feed their pets crack cocaine on their planet. have some suspension of disbelief for crying out loud. it's an alien film. And I loved the ending. I won't spoil it though.<br/><br/>District 10 anyone?????"
"MrPink08","9","18","27","29 August 2009"," A New Species of Sci Fi
","Aliens come to Earth. Which means they're here to attack and destroy us right? Usually, that's the case. We've seen it in countless film, like Independence Day, Alien Vs Predator, and even Mars Attacks. However, Peter Jackson and first time director Neil Blomkamp take us in a different direction with their film District 9. Blomkamp avoids all the alien movie clichés, including an all star cast and a major American city.<br/><br/>Instead of a hostile alien species, the aliens in District 9 are leaderless drones who make an emergency landing over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa (rather than New York or LA). The aliens are malnourished and leaderless, so the South African government places them in District 9, which quickly becomes a slum crawling with aliens and South African gangsters who demand to learn how to use the aliens' supercool weapons. The aliens begin causing trouble within the city, sparking a relocation effort led by the evil MNU (Multi National United) Corporation. All MNU really cares about is learning how the alien weapons work, much like the gangsters. However, neither side has learned anything.<br/><br/>Leading the eviction cause is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a enthusiastic MNU agent who passes through District 9 with glee, happily evicting the aliens (who will do anything for a can of cat food) and burning down houses with their unborn young inside. The eviction sequences are what JJ Abram's Cloverfield should've been. Copley ad-libbed all his lines during the ""documentary"" sequence of the film, and he makes feel as if we're watching an actual documentary. Wikus' world goes to hell, however, when he sprays himself with some alien liquid. On the plus (or minus, depending on how you look at it) side, he can operate the supercool alien weapons. He becomes the most wanted man in the world, and hides with a friendly alien (and the alien's cute son) in District 9.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a new sci fi flick after so many clichéd failures (the recent Star Wars Episodes I and II). A native South African, Blomcamp casts mainly his fellow countrymen into his film. Copley, who helped Blomkamp create Alive in Joburg, the short film D9 is based off of, is destined to be a star some day. It's also good to see a sci fi movie set in another major city in another country. And, finally, the aliens are not the bad guys in the film. As lame as it sounds, District 9 may make you embarrassed to be a human."

","What Peter Jackson does with this movie is incredible! I was a little uneasy at the beginning of the movie, thinking it was leaning more towards cheesy sci-fi--and then, out of nowhere, the heart of the story began and I found myself completely sucked in. The movie has a lot of different elements that make it work. I think the way Peter Jackson messes with the idea of empathy is genius. I fought with myself through the movie, trying to decide what emotions to feel--or what emotions were ""right"" to feel. This movie messes with you in a very powerful way. It is, in a lot of ways, very disturbing--and yet, in the same way, powerfully moving. Perhaps, even possibly...beautiful? You decide. It's a must see."
"The-Sarkologist","9","9","12","1 March 2013"," A brilliant movie on so many levels
","One of the great things about watching this film with a South African is that you do get a different perspective of the film that you would otherwise. I saw it first in the cinema and then at a film night when one my South African friend came around as well. Her comments were that a number of the scenes in the film were reflective of what she remember in South Africa, particularly during the apartheid period (despite her being too young to actually remember South Africa then). Also, she came from Johannesberg, so she could also attest to the slums that were there.<br/><br/>I guess the reason that this film was set in Jo'berg was to bring to light the nature of apartheid and also the living conditions of the blacks in the city. Areas like District 9 existed and in many cases still exist today. In fact South Africa is a very dangerous country and many of the whites have been emigrated in mass since the security situation is deteriorating drastically. I has seen images of houses that are built like modern day fortresses simply because crime in the country has risen so high. I even remember as a kid that Jo'berg was described as one of the most dangerous cities in the world.<br/><br/>This film plays on two levels though, because in one level it reflects the nature of apartheid, but on another it reflects not so much our fear, but also our disgust at something that is not like us. The Prawns in the film are strong, but they are also weak. The created an addiction to catfood that pretty much keeps them in poverty. In fact many of the poor and disadvantaged are kept weak through the use of drugs. As a friend of mine said once, the reason that many of the poor remain poor is because they are addicted to drugs and see no way of escaping that endless cycle. In fact people can act against them in illegal ways, but because of their addiction, their will to fight back does not exist.<br/><br/>The film's ending, in a way, is kept deliberately vague. While the film does end, and it ends really well, there is still the question of what happens next. This is not a happy ending, but it is an ending that leaves us to think about what we saw in the film. The fact that some of the aliens managed to escape Earth makes us wonder if Earth is now in danger. The way we treated and abused the visitors is not going to be going unnoticed, but then it depends on whether these aliens were a slave race or not. I have seen other films like that (Alien Nation rings a bell) where the visitors are not some highly sophisticated entities, but come about as rather pathetic."
"batatas31","1","373","759","18 August 2009"," Very disappointed by both the movie and the other reviewers.
","I am appalled that so many people love this film, with many claiming it to be a masterpiece. It was the rave reviews and the high ratings that influenced my decision to watch this film, but now that I have seen it, I honestly do not see what all the buzz is about. This movie failed to deliver on almost every end. The characters were flat, the filming style was annoying, and the plot was unbelievable with too many holes. <br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>While the action isn't great either, the main problem with the film is that it makes an obvious attempt to appeal to the empathy of the audience and horrible fails at it because of absurdity. The success of this movie relies on whether or not the audience actually cares about the main character, Wikus, but there is no character development. The so called bond between the alien wearing the red clothes and Wikus, is laughable. The movie barely shows them together throughout the film, but for some unapparent reason, we're expected to accept that by the end of the movie they've developed a close bond out of thin air. A bond that they are willing to risk their lives for. ""I won't leave you"", says the aliens, ""I'll come back...I promise"". Huh?... What a load of ridiculous crap. Was I supposed to shed a tear at that moment. For those of you who actually felt emotional at that moment, I worry for you. I mean, Wikus was not even a likable guy. The whole time he acted like an asshole and he had an utterly annoying accent. Did the director of this movie expect us to actually care about the guy. I sure as hell didn't. He was a selfish bastard throughout the whole movie, who only cared about himself. The only reason I could come up with for why he protected the alien at the end was that it was his only chance of becoming human again. I can honestly say that I think that he got what he deserved. <br/><br/>The story also contains too many flaws. Gaping flaws that make this movie nearly unwatchable. For this part I'll just ask all the questions that I have. I mean, how is it possible that the aliens got stranded on Earth in the first place and then after 20 some years, the mothership seems to magically work again? Why does alien fuel turn a guy into an alien? Why would the aliens have an antidote for a guy turning into an alien? Why would Wikus only cut off a finger? Why didn't the aliens retaliate with their superior technology? Why would the government allow the aliens to be so loosely controlled? Why do the aliens act like savages even though they are supposed to be an advanced race? Why can't the aliens contact their planet, wouldn't they have the technology? Why are humans allowed to stay in District 9? Why would Wikus's wife actual believe that he performed some sort of sexual activity with an alien? Why is a spaceship buried under ground? Am I missing something? <br/><br/>Yes, I am being a bit too critical, but it's just because people keep saying that this movie is so so great and it bothers me. I have much more to say, but I'll just leave it at this. I give this movie a 4 out of 10."
"james-still","2","161","316","6 September 2009"," Disappointing...
","I had heard enough about this South African film to know that it was an allegory about the Apartheid period. And I'm a huge fan of intelligent sci-fi. What could go wrong? Everything. Can I have those two hours back? The first 20 minutes was interesting. The lead character is portrayed as a passive-aggressive racist who is a part of the problem, smooths over police violence in front of the press, and fails utterly to comprehend the situation around him. In short, he's marked for death. He's the red-shirted security guy beaming down with Kirk and you just know his minutes are numbered. But when something bad does happen to him the movie's logic goes off the rails and melts into a steaming pile of a cheap Chuck Norris action flick where rifles blaze, grenades explode, and there's no motive to any of it other than just to blow sh*t up for the twelve year old kids in the audience.<br/><br/>Question. If you were making an allegory about Apartheid why would your clueless, selfish, white guy racist jailer be the hero and liberator of the oppressed black people? I should think that in the 21st century old ideas about the White Man's Burden is more than just offensive; it's also a tired cliché. The jailer bureaucrat's only motive seems selfish: he just wants to go back to his old self.<br/><br/>The sadistic villain is like a bad penny. He just keeps showing up in every other scene, fires off about a million rounds without hitting the hapless hero, and doesn't have the horse sense to call in enough backup to handle the escalating violence.<br/><br/>I'm supposed to believe that the Most Wanted Man in the Universe, with his picture all over television, can use his old access codes to break into a maximum security biology weapon lab and run off with alien rocket fuel? The plot holes get bigger and bigger, which is forgivable if the story is reasonable. Yet, the problem here is that there are no likable characters at all in the entire film. Also, the violence is way too gratuitous and serves no purpose.<br/><br/>I can't think of anything good to say other than to save your money and don't waste your time on this one."
"il_conde","6","130","254","18 August 2009"," NOT one of the greatest Sci Fi films ever!!
","This is not a negative review of the film. Instead, it is a clarification of why I think those fanboys who rank this movie up there with Blade Runner and Children of Men must have very short memories.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is basically throwaway. Its this mockumentary that supposedly frames the plight of the prawns into some kind of relevance. But its really just a lot of back story. The movie does nothing more for the morays of apartheid, refugee status, or whatever social commentary its trying to make beyond the assortment of interviews meant to set up the second half of the story. It's just a cute premise that serves as backstory for the ""real"" movie.<br/><br/>The ""real"" movie starts the moment Wikus finds the tube of liquid and gets infected. The camera calms down and the ""documentary"" camera gets replaced by a neutral camera and cinematic action style we're all familiar with. The shift in perspective is disconcerting. What POV are we really seeing? It's like a movie within the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is oddly dispassionate and unemotional. While the CG character animation is top notch, I never cared for the prawns, for the most part they seemed like a bunch of random bugs running away and on a rampage and only the father and son prawns were midly sympathetic. There was no villain I really hated - the MNU mercenaries were just nameless thugs and the head of MNU / the father was never much of a character. I loved no characters either. I liked the choice for Wikus - Sharlto Copley - hes an atypical hero, uncaring, selfish, nerdy bureaucratic type. He's different enough to be interesting but I can't say I rooted much for him or loved the guy - except at the very end of the movie when he has a change of heart and has his orgasmic heroic battle like every good action hero must do. His wife seemed hardly a character at all so his empathy with and from her had little weight.<br/><br/>Lots of stuff made no sense. Why did the prawns give up all their weapons? For cat food? Why didn't they just take what they wanted? Why did the command center drop down from the ship when it was such a pain to get it back up again? It was never clear at what point they were at with some/most/all prawns getting moved to the new concentration camp.<br/><br/>Overall it lacked the thematic unity of great science fiction like ""Children of Men"" or ""2001"", movies where I felt deeply involved with the characters. I can't believe some fans and reviews put it in that league.<br/><br/>The mockumentary reminded me of independent and student films like ""American Zombies"" and others of that genre. But the devolution of the movie into a well done but typical action sci fi flick seems to give the movie a schizo personality, with competing tonalities.<br/><br/>Camera work, while not Cloverfield shaky, was kind of wonkishly bad video shaky and can make you sick (as it did my date).<br/><br/>I was mildy entertained by the film, but my review is in response to the surprising laudations given to it by the reviewers and fans. I wonder who wrote those and why?? Possibly one of the most audacious SciFi films of the summer, but it lacks the thought and conviction for it to be anything more."

","Ever since Neill Blomkamp was lined to do the film version of the ""Halo"" video game, he's become a household name with the fanboys. But as we all know, that project stalled and Blomkamp is no longer on board as a director. After that happened, Peter Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever movie he wanted. Blomkamp made this film, and it is a stunning debut.<br/><br/>Normally I despise remakes, but after viewing Blomkamp's short film, ""Alive in Joburg,"" which served as the inspiration for this movie, I can say that calling ""District 9"" a remake of the short film is about as untrue as it is unfair. Even saying that Blomkamp used the short film as a jumping off point is pushing it (a lot). ""District 9"" takes the idea and runs with it, not even remembering to pass ""Go"" and collect 200 dollars.<br/><br/>South Africa, present day. A spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa, for the past 20 or so years. The aliens were brought down and nourished back to health, but people's apprehension with the new beings caused major clashes, and the visitors, known as ""prawns"" were moved into a slum called District 9. Today, the shady corporation Multi-National United has decided to move the prawns to District 10, and to make sure that it's handled legally, they enlist Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) to oversee it. Suffice it to say, things don't go as planned.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is not flawless, but it's so good that I'm more than willing to look the other way at any of its ""flaws."" But the best part of it is that it takes chances. In broad strokes, the story is familiar, but the details and execution are completely new.<br/><br/>One of the best things that I liked is how Blomkamp portrays people reacting to the aliens. Everything that the people do in response to them is completely credible. I don't want to give anything away, but the way that the people ""acted"" in response to the coming of the prawns is so believable it's almost chilling. ""Interviews"" with people who worked with Wikus and were involved in the story enhance this effect.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we have Wikus guiding us through the story. Wikus is eager, but he's not the brightest bulb in the bunch. Sharlto Copley is excellent as Wikus. Copley does a great job playing a poster boy for MNU, but Wikus is also likable, and that's important.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is a mixture of a million ideas all thrown together at once. Past movies have done this and sunk because of it, but ""District 9"" succeeds because they're competently explained and portrayed. A few technical things cause this to get an 8 instead of a 10 (for example, one scene is interesting, but it's out of place, and the film's big transition doesn't go very well), but it's still a highly recommendable film. And for once, the shaking camera is used effectively.<br/><br/>Do I think that Blomkamp should direct ""Halo?"" While there's no question that he could do it, and make a great movie out of the game, I don't think he's the right man for the job. I don't think ""Halo"" would look good as a grainy documentary. But that's just me."
"pontram","9","27","46","19 September 2009"," Extraordinary Surprise
","I have to say in advance, that I didn't hear anything about this movie, there was no hype for me, I'm simply interested in good SciFi. D9 is in a way a SciFi Slumdog Millionaire; if you allow yourself being caught you are totally in. Some months ago I hated Cloverfield for making my head aching and boring me. I hated Star Trek for disappointing me with being more childish (and thereby being so seriously) than Star Wars. Now I love District 9 for surprising me with a good idea and a subversive view. SciFi is rare, because it's expensive. Good SciFi is one of the rarest things, because the massive amounts of money spent must flow back to the investors with profit, and they think, that only mainstream and infantile movies work in that way. D9 was cheap, compared to other top movies of the genre, and so the producer had not many risks to bear.<br/><br/>So the author had the opportunity to use his plot to show us some of the uglier sides of us, by unmasking common accepted behavior, preoccupation, condemnation and greed as essential (and damnable) parts of our daily life.<br/><br/>There is one key scene (for me) where Witus, the main character, describes how Alien fetuses are destroyed resp. burned with flamethrowers and make noises like popcorn during this process. It is obvious that those people don't think that the ""Shrimps"" are worthy beings, despite - or because - they live with them since more than two decades. In this moment you see how easy it is to treat somebody as sub-human. <br/><br/>Another key scene is at the beginning, when they learn that the Aliens are poor and weak (and dumb) beings. After the first amazement there is no benefit from the encounter, no wonders are coming from them, they simply have to be fed. They are a burden and primarily useless. So there is no need to try to understand and treat them in an appropriate way ?<br/><br/>But i don't want to over-interpret this movie. It's definitively not only for ""intelligent people"", but for people who are bored from predictable US mainstream SciFi. <br/><br/>And yes, D9 is political incorrect. The Nigerians are shown like real Idiots who actually think, eating Aliens could make them mighty and powerful, even after this didn't work during the past 20 years. They are villains, cat food dealers like drug dealers, there is no positive aspect in their appearance. It's a cliché, and maybe the author worked up some personal reluctance. But the story needed a color equation for the badness of all those white guys.<br/><br/>I admit that the part which is critical of society is not the real main part of the movie. The movie wants to suggest that, but the main part is the action shootout in the MNU center and the slums. Although this is a bit too long and too tension (= box office) oriented, it intensifies the impression of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I for myself rated back from 10 to 9 because of the 90% happy end, according to my mom who always said ""good movie, bad ending"" ;-)"
"Joe X.","1","137","273","8 January 2010"," Really Kinda Ridiculous
","I can think of worse sci-fi movies to spend 2 hours on, but this movie is really quite absurd.<br/><br/>I can suspend disbelief for damn near anything, but the plot has to make some sense. Why were the aliens so easy to herd into the camp? How'd they get their weapons back? And once they did, why did they not dish out some head-and-chest-exploding destruction on their enemies? Oh that's right, they traded them for cat food.<br/><br/>And how many times did a bad guy have his gun trained on one of our heroes and then proceed to explain in lengthy detail how much they were going to enjoy killing them only to be foiled at the last second because of their ridiculous verbosity? At least four.<br/><br/>And in the scene at the end, when the half human tells his prawn buddy to save himself. After the requisite ""No, you go save yourself"" line, how about a little cover fire there, pal? Just standing there sorta takes away from the whole sacrifice angle, see? You have a freakin' transformer suit that fires rockets. Don't just watch idly while prawnny makes the run with his corrugated tin shield getting peppered with machine gun fire. He makes it anyway, of course.<br/><br/>I could go on, but, well you know.<br/><br/>The little alien kid was cute, though.<br/><br/>4/10 - but 1 star here to try and tamp that 8.4 down (I mean come on, people.

","After hitting 9.0 for the weekend, I broke down and saw it. There are certainly some things to recommend it - excellent CGI, and some fantastic acting by Sharlto Copley in the lead role. It's possible worth seeing if you don't mind watching some splatter-happy violence.<br/><br/>That being said - the story is a complete and utter mess. If you've seen the trailers or viral marketing pieces you know that it's about a bunch of aliens ""refugees"" stuck in a ghetto called District 9. Basically, it's a thinly-veiled apartheid movie with aliens. Expect to be beaten over the head by this through the entire length of the film. You see, it's about how evil people are and how much they hate people errr... things (remember... thinly veiled) that are different from them. People are especially evil if the get together and form large paramilitary corporations that are inexplicably allowed to flaunt every known or imagined law, ethic, and moral code with complete impunity. People are so evil and stupid that they'll concentrate all of their efforts into beating down ""the others"" and completely give up on deciphering the massive amounts of technology the others happen to have. There's no point in trying to integrate them into society, no National Geographic teams in there studying them. Nope, nope, nope, we're just too busy, as a species, being evil. Even though the aliens are very easily bribed into doing whatever, we don't even try to persuade them to use their technology for us. We don't even want to use them as slaves. Target practice, maybe. We're just too darned committed to being evil. The politicians are in on it. The media's in on it. The father-in-law's in on it. It's serious work being this evil.<br/><br/>Does this sound like a ridiculous and over-the-top description? It's not. There's no human in this movie who's not a complete jerk. The hero? He's really a jerk. Everyone around him is an even bigger jerk. There's no human character in this movie that doesn't deserve to be fed through a wood chipper (the alien characters that get any development are, of course, noble, peaceful, and loving). Let's just be honest. There's a certain mindset that just gets off on this mentality - these people will see this movie and say ""Oh yes! yes! yes! We're all jerks! Show us how bad we are!"" It's species-level self-flagellation at its finest if you're into that sort of thing. Otherwise you'll spend quite a bit of time rolling your eyes.<br/><br/>One final word - shakeycam. Yes, it's supposed to be ""documentary-style,"" but this is was just overboard. Think ""camera being held by a person with an inner ear infection having a seizure."" 6 / 10 stars"
"kasperhviid","1","110","218","9 January 2010"," Surprisingly overrated
","District 9 is a buddy movie about a human and a space alien. The human has prejudices against space aliens, which he has to overcome, and then they become best of friends. The human is a hysterical egocentric asshole in most of the movie. This makes it a bit hard to relate to him. The space alien, on the other hand, has no personality whatsoever.<br/><br/>The action? There is a lot of high-tech weapons. And people are shooting at each other. I find it boring, but some might like it. Some reviewers has criticized the movie for having too much gore. Which should be a good thing, right? I truly love gore, but the CGI blood in this movie is so uninspired that it hurts. Toribash clips on youtube have higher production value.<br/><br/>I don't mind that a story is predictable and linear. Tim Burtons movies are great, despite their uninspired story lines. However, District 9 has nothing to distract your attention from the lack of story.<br/><br/>So, this is a scifi-action-gore-buddy-movie, with main characters you don't care about, a stupid story line and boring action sequences.<br/><br/>Is that it?<br/><br/>No. They also tries to do social commentary! Not that there's anything wrong with movies about serious subjects. But when I want to deal with heavy stuff like apartheid or refugee camps, I don't want it to be in a cheap action flick.<br/><br/>At one point, the wife of the protagonist accuse him of having had sexual relations with a space alien! He denies it, arguing that they are far too disgusting for that.<br/><br/>One would assume that the space aliens would feel the same way about humans: That the humans would be too far from the space alien norm to be a likely lay. Not so. The space aliens are doing the nasty with human prostitutes. No, there's no footage. It sounds quite much like ""Black Men are after our Women 2.0""<br/><br/>This would be cool in a Troma movie. But not in a movie that aims for social commentary.<br/><br/>Now to the positive side:<br/><br/>1) I love 'body horror' transformations. 2) The movie has lots of plot holes, and counting them would make watching it slightly interesting. 3) The space aliens are addicted to cat food!"

","""District 9"" is a film I was lucky enough to see in the theater when it first released. The marketing for the movie was remarkably good, posters everywhere meant that before you even entered the theater, you had already been primed to see the ""Prawns"" as a nuisance, larger and stronger than humans, and probably best kept at a distance. The film's opening and narrative bookends being from the perspective of a documentary of news crew meant that everything felt very lifelike when you saw ads running on TV. As a Sci-fi lover, my interest was primed and pumping as I bought my ticket.<br/><br/>Now, 10 years later, my love for this movie is not as strong and has shifted from my previous reasons for liking it, but nevertheless, this is a film I expect will remain on my shelf for years to come.<br/><br/>""District 9"" wowed me in the beginning for many reasons. The first one out of the gate that grabs you is the world building. There are hosts of movies that take similar tacks when it comes to informing the audience about the history or rules of a fantasy, sci-fi, or just slightly left of real, world. Relate everything through news stories that play in the background or are featured in scenes that inform everyone as to what is going on. In fact, this approach is so common that it is considered a crutch by many filmmakers and is classically made fun of in the brilliant ""Shaun of the Dead""<br/><br/>It is truly rare to find films which spin a tried and maybe tired device into something fresh and even featured as a part of their film but Neill Blomkamp delivers a fresh look at documentary news coverage as exposition that simply stunned. Not only does the footage seem real, immersive, and present important concepts to audiences, it does so in a way that they are used to receiving information so that when they are presented with personal stories that contradict the news coverage, it causes them to ask questions about those same sorts of stories in their own lives, but more about that later.<br/><br/>The next thing that stood out about the film was the performance of Sharlto Copley (""Chappie"") which, essentially, launched his international career. One of the most difficult tasks that a writer, director, or actor faces is to make relatable that which is unrelatable. Taking a character like Wikus, who is blind to his prejudice, complicit activities, and general willful ignorance and turn him into someone for whom we have genuine empathy is the essential role of an artist. To not hide from the way that Wikus allows himself to be stupidly used in the beginning of the film and give him a journey which confronts him with the horrific results of his apathy in a way that leaves us hoping for better for him is the essence of good acting and I say Bravura to Copley for his performance.<br/><br/>The reason that I highlight these two aspects of the film is because they are what I find to be essentially brilliant about the film, yet also what was lost on me about it ten years ago. With the way the film tells its story in two ways: through high level news; stories, documentary footage, and interviews with family and friends of Wikus; as well as on the ground personal interactions; between Wikus and his coworkers, the company, his family, and the Prawns; we end up getting the story from two perspectives.<br/><br/>As a young man, I wasn't asking myself the questions I now ask myself so I only saw the interesting story, the horror of realizing something alien is happening to you, and the thrill of some impressive action sequences especially considering the budget. As an older man I realize that while the film is about these things on the surface, it is also about the difference between what we receive through screens, second hand accounts, and media outlets, as opposed to that which we experience personally.<br/><br/>The film is about perception, propaganda, prejudice, and personal connection. It is about what is real and what is not. Questions like this continue to be begged more and more as our world becomes more saturated, debate if you will for good or ill, with screens, vlogs, stories, commercials, news stories, reality shows, and everything in between. ""District 9"" is a reminder that while our world has gotten wider with the advent of new technologies there is always the threat that it may not get deeper as it grows in breadth. We must remember that the tactile person to person contact which is the enemy of prejudice requires us to seek specifically for the individual and to see them for who they are as an individual and not just what group they belong to.<br/><br/>The Prawn in this film is a stand in for all of the things we fear at a knee's jerk whether it is the immigrant, refugee, Muslim, Jew, Christian, Communist, Fascist, Snowflake, or Boomer. May we all seek to understand each other more despite the efforts of the powerful to shape our understanding through media."

","I liked the acting and look of this film, and it comes from an interesting idea, however the entire movie is rife with plot holes a thousand miles wide.<br/><br/>SPOILERS TO COME First of all, why would fuel for a ship genetically modify someone to turn into an alien. It makes no rational sense at all, even if you are trying to suspend disbelief with the old, ""Well its alien, so it can do anything."" Second of all, why are almost all the aliens mindless drones, except the one guy who is actually technologically advanced. Why are these aliens, who live in an area filled to the brim with alien technology only they can use, allowing themselves to be abused like they are? One alien infected human could pick up one of their weapons, and invade a highly protected secret government site...the same guy is able to get into a single battle suit of the aliens, and defeat dozens of heavily armed humans without a speck of training. Yet over two million of them sit around, being physically abused day after day, and do nothing. The aliens are shown being both physically and intellectually superior to human beings, but then made into placid cows only to advance the paper thin plot.<br/><br/>I do not get the gushing over this film. Its all right, but its no better than something like Cloverfield last year. It seems like because a Sci-Fi film attacks a now dead subject like Apartheid, it gets a free pass into the world of Sci Fi elite.<br/><br/>Its not that good a movie, people. Its an all right action film, but it has serious plotting and character development issues that keep it from even approaching being a great movie."

The pointless ramblings and the ridiculous plot holes are what really lost me. I suppose you could say that it was the ""bigger picture"", the apparent commentary on race relations that is what made this film. But even in that, if you have too many unanswered questions in a story, at least to a person who goes to the movies more often then not for a good story, then the message becomes lost.<br/><br/>We are meant to believe that this obviously advance race, just showed up on sunny afternoon, hovered over Johannesburg for a couple of days, only to be ""liberated"" by the altruistic humans, only to be ""forced"" into concentration camps for 20 years, while they scavenge for non-human alien parts, in order to return to their ship, so that they can go home and this whole time, while they not only have numbers and tech that could level the human race in a matter of months, they are doing nothing but hanging out in concentration camps and selling their incredibly advance weaponry (which only they can use due to genetic encoding), that is apparently illegal to have anyways according to the local government who are hosting these visitors as refugees, but they have it anyways, to the local gangs...<br/><br/>...For cat food...<br/><br/>That's about as stupid as saying that the Jews wanted to be captured and tortured and then finally liberated during the holocaust cause they had nothing else better to do for the weekend...<br/><br/>And then the subplot, or I suppose the plot of the social worker who get's a dose of his own prejudicial medicine by becoming the thing that he initially hates whom in the end he looks to as brother...<br/><br/>A movie for pseudo-intellectuals who can look over the apparent questions and only look at the race/prejudice issue, and get meaning out of this. Completely stupid, utterly a waste, and not a shred of intellectualism in it what so ever.<br/><br/>It's a scathing review because I myself am somewhat angered that I was suckered into this. However, PT Barnum speaks to me from the grave and reminds me that a sucker is born every minute.<br/><br/>Oh, and for all of you out there thinking that this is so original and edgy and never been done before, it has. It was done in an episode of the Outer Limits Entitled ""The Grell"". It came out ten years ago. Only difference is that the budget was considerably lower, and the story only needed about 45 minutes to the get the point across, and not nearly 2.5 hours...<br/><br/>However, It's not entirely fair to say that it's unoriginal because the Outer Limits has nearly covered just about every subject imaginable...

","While 'District 9"" is a very original take on the ""visitors from another planet"" idea, when you scrape off that veneer, you will just find another pile of processed pulp. To make it more ""real"", the movie employs a documentary style. While effective in creating that environment, it then drifts into a typical ""Hollywood"" plot structure, that being the standard ""two mismatched guys on the run"" story (Midnight Run, Fled). Is just that this time, they're literally from different worlds.<br/><br/>I didn't buy in. Too many implausibilities, starting with how the Big Bad Villain, a private weapons company, is the only group that has access to the aliens. C'mon, it would be some kind of international coalition, okay? The Big Message points (racism) would still come through. Instead, the movie gets weighted down with very clichéd plot devices such as the buddy chase, the McGuffin (the power source twenty years in the making), and even a moppet-like child prawn. There are plenty more, and it became annoying after a while – although the action was fun.<br/><br/>The fact that it's current rank as of August 20 is the same as Casablanca's is a farce. There's a saying: ""You don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle"". Fanboys who rank this movie so high are too often caught up in the sizzle, and barely notice that the steak is another piece of pulp cranked out by the Hollywood meat grinder.<br/><br/>I give a three: five stars for being engaging, but overall mediocre and annoyingly clichéd; minus two for the big disappointment that is."

Lastly, produce an interesting trailer that misleads audiences into thinking this might be a half way intelligent film.<br/><br/>This is a typically absurd modern movie, just as bad as all the rest that have been produced for the short attention set.

","I can't believe that not only did I allow you swindlers, you hucksters, you bamboozlers to seduce me into watching this travesty, but that I dragged my friends off this precipice with me. A midnight showing no less! Double shame on the knob-polishing critics.<br/><br/>This movie crucifies itself on subtext. The ""social commentary"" this movie builds itself around is about as developed and nuanced as the Vampire/Homosexual parallel in True Blood. In other words, total crap. It's also about half as subtle. I'd have never guessed what the Prawn were a metaphor for if Neil wasn't so nice as to set the movie in South Africa and spare my little brain the strain of making a connection. If you're not going to derive any insight or emotional catharsis from your allegory, why even bother with it? ""Oh look! This vaguely resembles this! It must be profound and equivocal!"" Likewise, why are peripheral sociological plots and issues (e.g. the forced abortion scenes, the interspecies prostitution, etc.) that get little-to-no screen time vastly more interesting than the main plot line we do get?<br/><br/>And why the hell is the black 'fluid' a plot device tour de force? It's simultaneously a fuel (apparently getting 3 light years to the gallon being contained in a canister the size of a cigar), yet the Prawns apparently couldn't stock up on it before coming to Earth, and a gene-altering biochemical agent that metamorphoses humans into Prawns? Really, nao? I understand that Prawn technology is bioengineered, explaining away the seeming inconsistency somewhat, but from a thematic standpoint it's too silly and convenient to have this Dr. Jekyll potion in the middle of a movie that tries to ground itself in realism.<br/><br/>This movie has no plot. Yes, things happen and they do so in sequence, but there's no cohesion or purpose that propels the movie forward.<br/><br/>At first, it's a mundane faux documentary that beats the prawn=refugee imagery to death. You watch people get evicted by the military (about as engaging as it sounds) and the only twist (i.e. remotely interesting thing) is that they're aliens instead of black people. Occasionally the Prawns wild out and kick a guy across the screen or get executed. That's the high point. Worse yet, it's juxtaposed with interviewees telling us crap that either A) hasn't happened yet (way to spoil your own movie) or B)Is in the process of happening thus doesn't need to be elaborated upon or C)describing how stupid/awesome Wickus. Aren't you supposed to show this stuff rather than tell it? I mean Christ, in a movie that's already too long the last thing it needs to do is segue away from the action to explain to me what I'm seeing.<br/><br/>Next, after the lead character gets infected... No. I don't even need to go past this. Having the lead magically (yes, it's magic and Arthur C. Clarke can suck a fat one) become one of the Prawns so we can get him from Point A, an annoying, xenophobic twit, to Point B, Jesus H. Christ, with no personal growth on his part or him even showcasing some redeemable personality trait is sloppy and lazy.. As cheap a narrative device as it sounds and the absolute equivalent of putting a white guy in black-face and having him learn ""a lesson"" about how ""the other half"" lives. We're supposed to feel some sort of emotional impact when Jerk McAwfulperson makes ""the hard choice"" despite his being self-serving only until continuing to do so would actually be counterproductive and his being an obsequious, weasel-faced douche the most positive thing you could say about the chap. And the dick gets a denouement as if anyone actually liked him! Oooh, his making lackluster arts and crafts had a purpose after all and comes full circle! Genius! *teardrop* <br/><br/>Bored? Don't worry. The makers foresaw this and they'll gladly bombard you with NOISE NOISE NOISE and the always-loved SHAKY camera action for the ENTIRETY of the third act. Screw all those ""characters"" and that ""drama"" they pretended to build-up and never mind that it's all amorphous and devoid of aim: Bullets fly endlessly and heads asplode! They have the gall to play this somber music the entire time this ""Go on without me!"" cliché is taking place as if what's going on on screen has any more tension or gravitas than Resident Evil 5 co-op mission gone wrong. While in a mech, the lead shoots a pig at a mook if you had any doubts to how high-minded and mature the filmmakers were.<br/><br/>Finally, aware the faceless evil military (and angry negroes) wasn't cutting it as an antagonist, they shoehorn some Stone Cold Steve Austin lookalike to the front-line to act as the De Facto Big Bad. No character development, no motivation, no personality: he just ""likes watching Prawns dies"" in his words and antagonizing the lead scathingly despite there being no personal history between them. What a villain!<br/><br/>This is a buddy cop movie in Hotel Rwanda's clothing. Two guys from two different ""races"" interact and learn to understand/appreciate the other while blowing stuff up. Lethal Weapon posing as shrewd and earnest satire. I've seen it all!<br/><br/>Lest I forget, Witchcraft-driven African cannibalism!!! In a movie with bloody walking, talking cockroaches they still felt the need to go the ""Scary Voodoo Negroes"" route? Never mind making Mudflap and Skidz look like Nelson Mandela; this makes the zombies in RE5 look racially-sensitive. Yes, I'm aware of the Albino Cannibalism incident, but isn't it shooting yourself in the foot to present the natives so negatively while priding yourself on the ""sympathetic"" allegory? <br/><br/>It's unsurprising, though, considering how even the Prawns, the things we're supposed to sympathize with, are little more than savage brutes The exception is Christopher, of course; He's not like those other stupid prawns. He's a daddy and the second protagonist."
"filmiky","4","76","153","19 August 2009"," Missed opportunity at greatness
","I, too, failed (yet again!) at not falling prey to the hyped up reviews posted herein, and hoped for maybe (what if? what if??) another memorable science fiction experience on the big screen. One of those wrong scenarios ensued - I got interested and invested in the story from the beginning, only to be ""let down"" by the sheer simplicity, occasional stupidity and apparent storyline holes later. And that is my conclusion after all of this mess - what a great story this could have been, but...wasn't. Yes, it will earn the money, maybe they'll get to shoot the sequel...but the history will not blink half of its eye over this one (or two, or three, or whatever number of sequels, which will be positioned only to squeeze a dollar out of a cgi-explosion-gore hungry teenager of these days...).<br/><br/>It's laughable to read here how this film is on par with ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" (excuse me?), even ""Matrix"" (huh??). These people are either on the District 9 studio's payroll or have never seen the movies mentioned.<br/><br/>In any case, what worked great was the set up for the story and the hanging spaceship above the city, plus the story being told initially through the camera crew. Apart from that, the story line had some problems, which the director tried to cover up with lots of explosions, ugly looking aliens and looooots of amunition. (Not since my childhood viewing of Schwarzenegger's Commando or Rambo movies had I seen this many bullets all flying astray...) Character development in the main protagonist was difficult to comprehend - from the initial government bureaucrat cretin (trying to swindle the signatures out of the unsuspecting ""prawns"") to a hero against the whole system, his strongest motivation being his desire to return to his wife (whose character portrait was not so much than a 30 second shot of her showing a rather tacky gift she received from her husband once). At that point, the story begins to loose its 'classic' feel and starts to become more and more silly. The second call between Wikus and his wife was the most weakly executed ""hero"" motivator I've ever seen on screen. From that point, there are apparent places in the story where the writer just patches it up to move it along. Later on, we are served another facet of the story in the desire of the father-son duo of aliens to return to the mothership, which felt like thrown on top of the story at the last minute. There are stoppages in the middle of battle scenes, where the heart-spilling dialogues take place between Wikus and the alien, and one is left to wonder - where do these guys take all that time for it? Mind you, the action scenes and breaks in them can be done very well...but not in this movie. Ludicrous is the final chase in which Wikus escapes in the armoured robot shell, while the alien friend runs along, covering himself with a dumpster cover, all the while an elite commando of sharp shooters wastes about 500 kilos of ammunition on them. And they manage to stop, and say their good byes and then the alien is off, whoosh! Then, as the robot shell gets destroyed slowly, the robot itself spews some black vomit, as if it was Wikus being shot. And I am thinking - why is this robot vomiting? A scene that could be written in a hundred different styles, yet, the writer opts to show us...a vomiting robot. And that is the stuff, where the writer confuses his audience for a bunch of bobble-heads and wants to take them for a ride. Had I know I am going to see another ""Iron Man"", I'd be prepared and wouldn't mind this. But this film pretends in the beginning to be something a little different.<br/><br/>Had this story been developed with a little bit of more intelligence, and rather more classic sci-fi twist, the author had a shot at an ""instant classic"". In this case, the good beginning was turned into a mediocre action packed chase, with some weak spots in that as well."

","I am tired of hearing about the clever marketing campaign, and how cool the preview showings were. <br/><br/>Objectively, this movie was not very good. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a political allegory, and the second half of the movie is an action movie. The whole movie is told with a hand-held camera in a documentary style, that works for a while, and then gets annoying. <br/><br/>The character development is awful, and Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley, is creepy and unlikeable. Copley is competent enough, but he is played as simply nerdy and the performance did not have enough depth. The only alien with a personality was the baby alien. The rest are just targets for abuse. <br/><br/>On the bright side, the art direction was solid, and the initial premise of the story is interesting. I don't know how they animated the aliens, but that seemed realistic throughout. They were pretty ugly, and they spent a lot of time wiggling their facial appendages at the camera. <br/><br/>This is a Sci-Fi, and it does not need to make sense, but this movie makes less sense then most. There are too many plot twists that have no purpose except to advance the story. <br/><br/>There is a tradition of Sci-Fi that is darker and scarier than recent Sci-Fi films. This film is trying to channel that tradition, and maybe it succeeds in bringing Sci-Fi back to its roots -- on the other hand, better dialog, more character development, and more attention to the plot would have helped.<br/><br/>I ordinarily give a extra points for taking on a tough political or moral issue, but this was a heavy-handed morality play. The messages of this movie -- something like, ""People are terrible,"" and ""Be nice or the aliens will get revenge,"" -- do not seem worth the effort."
"Theo Robertson","8","22","39","3 December 2012"," Cronenberg Meets Black Hawk Down
","This is a very strange film . It's one that opened to rave reviews , critical acclaim and picked up several Oscar nominations . Surpringly it was directed by someone who had never directed a feature length film before and the lead actor was someone who never appeared in a film and had no previous professional acting experience . A recipe for disaster ? Certainly and it says something that director Neill Blomkamp and lead actor Sharlto Copley are able to paper over some glaring cracks and make a very enjoyable action packed sci-fi thriller <br/><br/>Like a few other highly regarded sci-fi classics there's something fundamentally wrong with the scenario . An alien mother-ship hovers outside Johannesburg in South Africa where the aliens dubbed "" Prawns "" by humanity live in a shanty town . It's no coincidence that the Prawns land in post apartheid South Africa since the subtext revolves around speciesism . What doesn't make sense however is the fact that an alien race can travel around the Galaxy and for some unknown reason decide to sit around for 20 years in conditions most human being would find difficult to tolerate . There's also something annoying about the way aliens talk to humans in their native tongue while humans reply in English . Put it like this: how many times do you as an English speaker talk to someone who is foreign in English , they reply in their tongue , you reply to them in English , they reply in .... You see what I'm getting at . It's a bit like the film version of THE PLANET OF THE APES where no one notices that either ape or human everyone is able to speak perfect English and yet no one notices this <br/><br/>There's also the element that the film is divided in to three very distinctive acts . There's the first third composed of the mockumentary /biting satire element . The second act of Wikus turning in to a Prawn and the final act of a big battle scene where Wikus and his Prawn ally trying to escape the Nigerians and the security contractors . The second act sits uneasily between the first and final thirds . Possibly because it's not as entertaining . Certainly the first third works very well with its aspects of satire and humour along with the point that everyone is racist when it comes to aliens who look like crustaceans and the end sequences are action packed. As I said Neill Blomkamp could have directed an absolute mess of a movie with three distinctive acts but he manages to pull it off . Copley does over do his geekish charaterisation early in the film but he improves as he turns in to a Prawn and ultimately an action hero and reminded me greatly of Edward Norton <br/><br/>There's not much wrong with DISTRICT 9 . Some flaws are fairly obvious but they're negated by a very talented director . It's slightly derivative but when you stop to consider this cost a mere $30 million dollars you have to stop and ask yourself why do film directors like James Cameron and Michael Bay feel the need to spend several times making movies that are a tiny fraction as involving and as compelling than something like this one ?"
"Quinoa1984","8","17","29","16 August 2009"," a ruthless satire and a (mostly) kick-ass blockbuster
","District 9 doesn't f*** around, mostly. It's a harsh look at a harsh people, mainly us. It asks a question posed countless times before: what would happen if ""they"" came ""here"" and how would we respond and they act. By the end of District 9, a movie where we see an alien ship stalled over Johannesburg and the million or so ""prawn"" aliens taken and put into a slum of the movie's title, you'll wonder deeply about our own ethical state of being. You might wonder also why Neill Blomkamp, the director (first time feature by the way), didn't show more of the aliens, at least until the second half of the film. This is intentional on his part because it's about drawing specific parallels in how human beings will look at a culture that is the ""other"", and I do mean ""other"".<br/><br/>And it doesn't have to be a parallel specifically to South Africa and the Apartheid, though that comparison can certainly be made if one seeks to. What about immigration in America, or even going back to how the US treated Indians? Or how about looking in the movie at the whole vicious cycle of taking a displaced people (without their leaders, by the way, which is why the ""prawns"" are so despondent to do anything on their stranded ship) who are put into a ghetto and basically put there to eventually be just 'eh, whatever, they can go somewhere else, they can die for all I care.' That the humans just shuffle the aliens around- as early on in the eviction scenes with Wilkus Van Der Merwe- lack understanding of them, and it's through these humans (and sometimes through a documentary-lens perspective) we have our point of view. That and, you know, the aliens just want to go home and all of that.<br/><br/>It gives us the story of Mr. Van Der Merwe, a bureaucrat at the MNU, the government group that oversees alien affairs in District 9 and after 20 years makes the decision to do a mass eviction to what is an even more cramped quarter a few miles away. But Van Der Merwe (a very common name in South Africa I'm told) gets infected by some spray in a can that one of the aliens named ""Christopher"" has been using for some special project, and soon poor Wilkus becomes the first human to be fused with alien DNA, growing fingers that can also operate the firearms the aliens brought and that no humans can really operate. A first-time movie actor Sharlto Copley is also revealed to us by Blomkamp in a fantastic performance for any actor; what my friend compared to Michael Scott from the Office turning into Cronenberg's Fly.<br/><br/>Blomkamp said that originally the film was going to have a final third that would have been ""more cerebral"" as opposed to the shoot-em-up that is now in the film. I'm not sure who will agree, but considering that he took the popcorn movie direction, it's not at all a bad course to have taken given the results. Blomkamp isn't the best action direction ever, but he does know something important with this type of story (and having Peter Jackson as producer doesn't hurt and only helps in this regard): visual effects matter. The aliens and their whole world, so to speak, that is brought to Earth looks wholly believable, and we're even given that contradiction of human eyes and a disgusting face (save for the child prawn) that makes it hard to really accept them as something living and thinking but they are. And the ship and its things look much better than other things in terms of crazy-CGI technology from this summer. Just compare, if you will, to last week's GI Joe and get a kick in the nuts as to what can be possible in stunning visual effects. It's here, really.<br/><br/>I can't say District 9 is perfect or even a great movie. It's hard to follow entirely with seeing the humans as being three-dimensional since they're either seen as military hard-heads or one-sided bureaucrats... and, of course, Wilkus the only human who has a transformation over the course of the film from mouse to man-mouse. But what intrigues is intriguing, and the satire is wicked-hot, much like a Romero film. We see an ugly side to nature, and maybe a sliver of hope, but mostly District 9 digs into us to make us ask what we think and feel about these creatures from another world. Would we do the same? Maybe we already have to our own fellow species? 8.5/10"

","How is District 9 getting such critical acclaim? Out of all the big science fiction movies to come out in the last 10 years this has the biggest plot holes, yet no one seems to care...<br/><br/>Let me first start off by saying that I had very high hopes for this movie and was one of the most anticipated films of the year for me.<br/><br/>Yes, the CG is great, the action is intense, but the story falls flat.<br/><br/>Going into this movie you must suspend all disbelief. Apparently I was one of the few people who wasn't able to accept the fact that the human race would allow an alien civilization to be treated so poorly....<br/><br/>20 years on this earth they spent in a slum with humanity's only interest being in their weapons. I find it a little hard to believe that, the aliens would be so compliant on giving up their weapons only be to treated like animals. Throughout the film they definitely show aggression, so they aren't entirely peaceful. Yet they don't start any uprising with their advanced technology. Why? Your guess is as good as mine as we're giving no clear insight on any previous background into the past 20 years of their containment.<br/><br/>When i mentioned you must suspend all disbelief I truly meant it. Here you have these incredibly intelligent aliens forming gangs... having sex with human prostitutes, craving cat food, and otherwise acting anything like you might expect an alien race to behave.<br/><br/>On to the meat and bones of the story.... We don't know why they landed here, we just know they've been here for 20 years and came to earth barely alive. The part that kills me is that in that 20 years they were able to extract enough ""fluid"" from their technology to fly a command vessel (which previously detached for no apparent reason) back into the Mother ship. Meanwhile the fuel that was extracted was apparently also enough to power the entire Mother ship up and then fly away. How the hell? Furthermore, if they were able to extract fuel from their own parts why didn't they do that in the first place before landing on earth? If all that was required was a small canister of black fluid, why wasn't this done prior to landing on this planet, when they could have just flown home.<br/><br/>None of the story makes any sense whatsoever. We're never told why they landed here, why they couldn't just fly home, why they never chose to fight back our oppression. The entire story was horrible.

Also, I was forever stumbling in the big old plot holes and I believe I wrenched my knee on that last one.<br/><br/>Blacks, I mean aliens, have gotten a bad deal in South Africa and their oppressors blame them for the conditions in their slums and slummish behavior and bully them. This is a Very Bad Thing, the filmmaker tells us, over and over and OVER again, just in case you thought relegating a whole species or race to a barb-wire slum and shooting them randomly and aborting their babies visciously was a good thing because you're some form of brain-damaged moron with no morals at all. <br/><br/>Erase that endless awful metaphor, and the story doesn't hold together at all. To detail every way in which it failed totally would take me 5000 words, and I've wasted enough time on this bad movie already, but other 1-star reviewers here have hit on most of the idiocies here. <br/><br/>Based on 50's sf film science, the story had ""aliens"" (with two eyes over a nose over a mouth, which of course will never occur in any other evolutionary system) contaminate a bad guy with alien black goo (shades of the x-files) and he became half alien (like in The Fly). oooooh! Were it 1952 and were I eight years old, this would be a cool thing. It's not, I'm not, and this movie sucks.<br/><br/>There's plenty of crap blowing up, but that doesn't make drama. People, crap blowing up is just crap blowing up--it's not plot or suspense or character development or anything at all. AND YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE! Sheesh, how many explosions can one person stand? And for the girls watching, there's a little baby alien, awwww, ain't it cute and sympathetic, awww. Oooh, and Evil Corporations and their Evil Soldiers and why they didn't manage to wedge in a cliché Evil Preacher, I don't know. I've taught troubled high schoolers creative writing even they don't resort to this many clichés at once. <br/><br/>I have no idea what was wrong with 90% of serious reviewers that they thought this crap was any good. I hope they re-watch it in three years and suddenly understand what total FOOLS they were and feel the shame they should feel over rating this thing any stars at all. Seriously, do they get bribed to do this? This is a bad movie and any adult with half a brain can see it is, so why is there even one good review out there?"
"asgrrr","5","7","10","17 March 2010"," Multi-culti disguised as sci-fi
","This film rather transparently deals with the apartheid era in South Africa, with a wider message on immigration today, only blacks/immigrants/whoever are portrayed as aliens. The living conditions of the aliens, forced on them by the human population, is so accurately modeled on the living conditions of blacks under apartheid as to leave no room for confusion. This message is largely delivered through the main 'alien' character, who serves to remind that despite a group's manifest loutish behaviour, said group is nevertheless composed of intelligent and noble individuals. Also, inevitably, it is revealed that the master race (humans) are much worse than the downtrodden louts (aliens). The final message, the possibility of a declaration of war on the human race by the alien race in retaliation for mistreatment is again a rather transparent multiculti social message: Treat us well or when we are in the driving seat we are going to treat you badly - or alternately this can be construed as justification for what is happening in post-apartheid South Africa.<br/><br/>The film is fast paced and exciting, and no doubt thoroughly enjoyable for anyone able to ignore or stay unconscious of the film's political message. It would be much more enjoyable (and original) if the film had left multicultural politics behind it and accurately focused on the issues that would arise between humans and aliens. In this respect 'Mars Attacks' achieves more - which is saying something."

","This movie seems to be very well liked by most of the folks who've left comments. I, however, was disappointed. Now, I should say, my only a priori to this flick was a trailer I saw a couple of weeks ago at another film. I got the impression, incorrectly, that Peter Jackson DIRECTED this project. Boy, was I wrong (he was producer.) Jackson knows how to tell a story. This guy doesn't.<br/><br/>What the director of ""DISTRICT 9"" DID do well was create a string of very tense moments, many presented in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, but that's not necessarily a story. And I don't care HOW much social commentary is infused into it (and there was plenty.) Here's where I think the WRITERS failed.<br/><br/>Social commentary has been used so much over the past few decades that it should be filed under ""Predictable Hollywood Theatrical Device #37."" It's like salt on movie theater popcorn, there IS such a thing as TOO MUCH, whether the general public realizes it or not. It comes across especially heavy handed in this film, with the South African locale and evil military commanders. I guess I feel social statements are most effective when you let the AUDIENCE connect all the dots, and don't try to do all the mental heavy lifting for them.<br/><br/>Then there was the typical modern sci-fi excessive gross out violence (Predictable Hollywood Theatrical device #23.) My wife had to leave.<br/><br/>I eventually did too, but it was mostly because I didn't like the style of the film. After awhile, the documentary approach came across as inadequate, eventually having to rely on surveillance cameras in the restroom, and other unlikely places, in order to maintain continuity. And when that didn't work, it started morphing into a different style of film, just so it could tell the story.<br/><br/>As I said...disappointing. Can't recommend it."
"h-english-329-216405","10","8","12","21 August 2013"," District 9 - Review
","In recent years, the majority of films from the science-fiction genre have showcased advancements in visual technology. Fuelled with massive budgets, many of these blockbuster films display stunning imagery, however they can often suffer from a lack of substance. Over bloated style, with a Hollywood star cast into the mix makes for a passable summer screening, but hardly one that will last the test of time.<br/><br/>District 9, on the other hand, completely breaches this predictable trend and offers a fantastic revival to the genre. Neil Blomkamp's feature debut has an array of qualities that had gone missing in science-fiction films, whilst also maintaining a terrific caliber of CGI and visual effects. Here we have a film that has a cutting dramatic edge with an embedded sense of reality at its core. An extremely clever version of an extra-terrestrial encounter, that's layered with subtext which appears familiar to the human history.<br/><br/>The story engages from the beginning with documentary style footage, which effectively creates this raw sense of reality surrounding the alien invasion. Through this we are brought up to pace with the developments between the humans and aliens. The outcome being that the humans enclose the aliens into an area labelled District 9, to bide time to learn about them. However developments evolve poorly resulting in the brutal and derogatory treatment to the aliens. <br/><br/>What's truly captivating is the layers of subtext that ensue from this action. The aliens are the misunderstood minority on earth, and are brutally treated by the humans. This terrifying depiction of the human behaviour displays man in his cruellest form. What's especially unnerving about this is how it reflects the treatment humankind has inflicted on one another throughout time. The aliens are not fearsome entity's but instead victims, who are dwarfed under the powerful human regime.<br/><br/>The unique script, adapted by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, is a fantastic triumph. The story takes an original, ingenious approach to alien-human relations. Rather than the aliens dominating their new environment, they are instead imprisoned by its inhabitants. Sharlto Copley does a terrific job as the lead man, whose transition is both tormenting and frightening, whilst always remaining endearing.<br/><br/>District 9 is a terrific film by Blomkamp – an incredible debut feature. It is most certainly one of the best science-fiction films in recent years and without doubt will remain a genre gem as the years pass by."

"aerishime","3","48","99","8 September 2009"," Disappointed without any expectations
","They say that if you go to a movie not expecting anything, you cannot be disappointed. Well, they have just been proved wrong. I saw the film without knowing what to expect, only that it was about aliens and supposedly action packed. Oh, and that Peter Jackson had something to do with it.<br/><br/>We went there and after a couple of very interesting trailer a pseudo documentary started. Using stylistic devices such as ""I can't believe he did that"" without ever referring to what they meant they built up the tension to have you expect someone to do something really terrible. So after the utterly realistic ""rescue"" of countless aliens and their relocation to a township were unveiled dramatically, the main focus of the story changed to a new relocation project. Then to the protagonist, an MNU worker who just got promoted. He gets depicted as this really sweet, if not overly clever guy who got lucky a few times. Cut to the operation where he now is the reckless idiot who doesn't seem to care for the safety of his comrades. Then he's suddenly a guy showing empathy (""No shooting""). Then he's suddenly all into violence. - And that's just the first 10 or so minutes of the film and it goes on and on and on. None of the characters were believable and it was impossible to identify with any of them. At least one could FEEL with the alien characters Christopher Johnson and his son (who...which? was really cute). But even they ... what's their back story? And also, why did the huge mother ship come to earth, why was it hosting countless aliens, why were they starving, what was their aim? If the humans managed to cut their way into the damn thing to ""rescue"" the aliens, why not examine it closer? Clean it up, get some light in there etc. If it doesn't work due to the missing control unit (and some other missing element, apparently), how can it stay in the air then? Or are alien ships exempt from gravity? And if the control unit from the airship was missing, how come they could make it react and beam stuff up all of a sudden? Seriously, if there is a control unit ready to accept commands on there and act accordingly, surely they could have fixed it sooner than... after 20 years.<br/><br/>Anyway. The soundtrack was okay, the action itself was alright, too (some of the weapons were actually pretty cool albeit strongly reminding of 3PS and FPS games...), the plot was full of holes and forced content (like the way the so called ""Nigerian Scam"" clan was set up), the acting was often terrible - Johnson and his son were okay - and all in all it was really just not that good."

I guessed right most of the time, and literature is my worst subject.<br/><br/>The camera shake gave me a headache. They do this for effect, as if the action is being recorded as it happens, but it made me assume they were too cheap to buy an image stabilizing camera. It made me nauseous.<br/><br/>I enjoyed my $6 popcorn and $5 soda more than this movie. And I got refills on them both. The worst part is the story is left open for a sequel. Please... don't."
"FlippingVideos","1","64","136","17 August 2009"," This is the worse film that I've ever seen (**SPOILER ALERT**)
","This movie is trash for so many reasons that I can't fathom why so many are championing it aside from the possibilities that 1)they have totally underdeveloped critical faculties concerning film and/or racism or 2)good special fx with a touch of gore and big guns trump good screen writing for them. I know some of you have probably already stopped reading this now, but those who dare continue, lemme break it down.<br/><br/>1) D9 is supposed to be about racism yet is totally bigoted against Nigerians. There's not one redeeming Nigerian character in the whole movie. Nigerians are shown as thieving, superstitious, alien-eating and f*cking (the hookers) savages. The actors don't even do real Nigerian accents (and why are they subtitled speaking English?) and use a Swahili word for ""white man"" at one point--Nigerians don't speak Swahili! <br/><br/>2) Moreover, every non-Nigerian black in the movie is subservient. None of their characters are drawn out, none have substantial lines, not even Wikus's 2nd in command. Why didn't he play a larger part after Wikus was declared a fugitive, either as a bad guy or uncovering the truth?<br/><br/>3) All Wikus basically says the second half of the movie is a variation of ""f*ck."" I don't care about cursing, but it's just weak writing.<br/><br/>4) Filmmaker manipulation: The ""good, smart"" alien is one who's most human - wears full, gender-appropriate clothes, speaks eloquently (better that the Nigerians!), has, somehow, the only kid in the whole camp (aside from selling the audience with cuteness, no refuge squat has only kid. NONE.) Why not give him a pet kitten too? <br/><br/>5) Every damn action movie cliché in the play book is used here. And Wikus turning into a alien, logic aside, was predictable as hell."
"gentendo","9","14","24","12 September 2009"," Poignant Themes, Values, & Aesthetics
","What critics are calling a ""scathing social satire"" in conjunction with what I will call a culturally well-informed platform, District 9 is an extremely intelligent vision that no doubt will spawn many intelligent conversations. The film surprisingly comes to us from first time director, Neill Blomkamp, who, despite his limited short-film repertoire, will most likely attract many eyes in future years.<br/><br/>Blomkamp gracefully employs a very raw, very visceral, docudrama style not much unlike the dust bowl feel of cinéma vérité. He takes it, however, several steps further by combining photorealistic CGI to gain the film's expressionistic quality, with shaky, hand-held documentary edges to expose more of its naturalistic elements. In this way, the film is uplifted with a highly chimerical imagination while simultaneously grounded in the grime of worldliness. Poetically speaking, it is both real and fake at the same time, or, as McKee puts it, it's a ""fantasy-reality hybrid"" of a film, which, in my view, makes the best of films. Also, as an added benefit, the form (though definitely not content) of the film was reminiscent of Tom Tykwer's Lola Rennt for those who deem themselves internationally savvy.<br/><br/>There's lots to consider in this one: xenophobic attitudes, government consolidation, immigration laws, unabridged intolerance, atoning foreign cultures and ideas, reconciling ""separate but equal"" amendments, scapegoating the many faces of otherness, the physics of entropy, war inebriation, evolutionary mutations, media manipulation, and the role reversals of friends and enemies to name a few. Though the film is not strictly immersed in philosophical thought—indeed, much of the action-packed sequences resemble an astronomically greater version of Transformers meets Starship Troopers—I will focus on a few of the film's subtextual philosophies that I found particularly timely.<br/><br/>Blomkamp plays the role of what I will call the ""revelatory manipulator"" quite flawlessly. He cleverly crafts the revelation—the drawing back of the curtain so to speak—of information to the audience that forces them into an ironic, self-reflective state of mind. For instance, the film opens with viewers most likely on the side of the humans as they infiltrate the negatively perceived, alien project homes. No doubt to this media spun projection, viewers will identify with their own kind: humans as the good guys, aliens as the bad guys. If we aren't careful though, we fall easily into this trap and are later reminded of the danger of segregated, binary thinking.<br/><br/>Using the ancient Greek logos and pathos storytelling devices, Blomkamp works on the audiences sensitivities by evoking sympathy for the aliens, much of which I believe worked. The tables turn and it is the human participants—those watching the film—who slowly begin to side with the alien paradigm, despising now their own kind. Another way of saying this is that those who watch the film are confronted with their own ugliness and self-destructive behaviors. To grasp this, however, we must sacrifice our need to be right simply because we're human, focus on being kind, and look beyond the sci-fi alien spectacle. Ironically, we're just as much alien as is the flower to the rock (intelligence not included of course).<br/><br/>The use of the concept 'alien,' not as some Ridley Scott, galactic creature, but as that which is foreign, weird, strange or scary, pervades the story, allowing us to ponder upon our own aliens in the attic. Blomkamp exposes our human frailties in such a remarkable way, essentially showing us that we don't have to build walls of separation, let alone fear the strange, if only we would seek understanding via candid communication and welcome that which is alien with loving, forgiving hands. Much of the film is riddled with politically charged atoms and secret mysteries of the human condition, and I believe it will best serve the public by being thoroughly talked about immediately after watching.<br/><br/>Spread the word."
"symmachos","1","44","90","17 August 2009"," Incredibly overrated
","I'm flabbergasted by the amount of positive feedback this film has received. It's more of a straight-up action movie than anything resembling science fiction, and while it has plenty of explosions and lots of splattering blood & guts, DISTRICT 9 is severely deficient in story, characters, ideas, and surprises.<br/><br/>In fact, you could argue that it doesn't have any characters at all, just a few types: the nerdy Accidental Protagonist, the Inscrutable Alien, the Executive Villain, the oddly unkillable Grunt Villain. Everybody else is just an intermittent talking head.<br/><br/>There's almost no story, and what plot developments do emerge are predictable way in advance.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I can say that the basic premise is a lot like that Outer Limits episode starring Robert Culp, with a slight twist. To that slender premise the script adds various clichés from recent SF films and series. But the movie never does what good SF does best: it never presents or explores big ideas, it never portrays alien worlds, and despite its CGI creatures, it never explores extraterrestrial psychology or culture.<br/><br/>DISTRICT 9 is also lacking in internal logic. As in the Star Wars series, aliens speak Alienese (with subtitles) and humans speak English, yet each species easily understands the other's language (even though the humans can't even read the subtitles!). Now I might buy into the notion that the aliens have special senses or faculties that enable them to understand English without speaking it, but I really can't believe that the humans somehow learned fluent Alienese without also learning SOMETHING about their biology, culture, technology, etc.<br/><br/>The aliens' physical appearance is strictly Motorized Action Figure. They are humanoid bipeds, yet they have bug-like or mollusc-like features. Somehow they are perfectly capable of breathing the Earth's atmosphere and eating terrestrial food. It's even suggested that they can have sex with humans.<br/><br/>Now when is the last time you had sex with an octopus or a cockroach, y'all? <br/><br/>At one point we are told that all the aliens we see are members of a worker caste, without any intelligence, yet we quickly learn that this isn't true. But if it isn't, why do the aliens usually behave as if they aren't sentient? <br/><br/>If I'm supposed to trust that the sequel clears all this up, well, you've already lost me. No way do I spend another dime on this franchise! <br/><br/>The film's portrayal of the aliens is somewhat less xenophobic than the handling of the bugs in STARSHIP TROOPERS or the scary creatures in INDEPENDENCE DAY, but its portrayal of black Africans seems downright racist. I'm a bit surprised that there hasn't been any noise about that.<br/><br/>The movie that DISTRICT NINE most closely resembles is BLACKHAWK DOWN. If you loved that one, you might get a little out of this one. But even then, you'll find yourself wondering -- why don't the aliens just shoot down those darn helicopters? They get plenty of opportunities! <br/><br/>In a word: yuck."

The layers go deep, all the way to the nothingness where the core should be. There is no kernel of truth, wit or cool in this monstrous failure. It is hard to single out the problems with the movie because literally every concept in the film is either outright stupid, banal or utterly nonsensical.<br/><br/>At first blush, one might think that a child wrote this script, and that a child directed the movie.

","Here Be SPOILERS!!!! <br/><br/>Proceed with caution! <br/><br/>There's a lot to love about District 9. And all of it is tech. It is beautifully and realistically shot on steadicam and hand-held cameras. It has the grainy look and ""just-this-very-second-edited"" feel of a documentary. It shouts this is real...this happened. The weapons are awesome. The aliens are cool and odd and ALIEN and REAL. Kudos to the CGI guys! Let's take a look at the rest. We were lead to believe that the story was original. Original storyumNOT! Been thereDone that. Alien NationHello?? Alien Nation tackled the 'stranded alien' story 20 years ago and did it better. Other TV shows have tackled it. The ONLY original part at all was the ship hovering over South Africa. We already know the movie is a thinly veiled commentary on the South African history of Apartheid. It is supposedly a socially conscious movie that doesn't bang you over the head (too much) with preachiness. Instead it gives us a doltish ordinary bloke named Wikus who has been promoted into a job that everyone but him realizes he is ill suited to execute. He's a pencil pushing weasel elevated to supervisor and has no idea what to do.<br/><br/>Wikus is embarrassingly prejudiced and blithely racist. You can almost hear his friends making excuses for him. 'He doesn't mean any harm, you see. It's just the way he is.' It is the everyday ordinariness of his prejudice that is so frightening. It is so alarmingly close to the way we all are that it is difficult to watch. His condescending superiority in the face of his ignorance cuts to the bone. We are, all of us, guilty. How can any of us judge? Is this one side of this coin? This Everyman allows us to see the alien residing within us. That is the true horror.<br/><br/>Part of what befalls the main character is engineered by his employer and father-in-law. Part of what happens is because the main character is an idiot. Again, everyone is aware of this but him. When he begins to transform into what he despises he finally begins to get a clue...but it is too little, almost too late. After he bonks the good alien on the head, hijacks his ship and kidnaps his son. Wikus wants it all to go back to the way it was BEFORE. But it's much too late for that. I won't go into the enormous plot holes because others on here have kicked that horse.<br/><br/>I don't get the comparisons to Blade Runner or Matrix. I justdon't. This movie is not that important. Blomkamp shows promise but he's not Ridley Scott and he's not Wachowski material either.<br/><br/>My one serious downer is the excessive 'squishiness'. There is waaaay too much body fluid tossed about. Humans get squished. Aliens get squashed. The movie is awash in yuck and gore. I don't do yuck and gore so I was a bit taken aback.<br/><br/>DO. NOT.

It's a pity, because the story itself had immense potential - aliens stranded on Earth and forced to live in slum-like concentration camps, human ignorance, violence, etc. Sadly, the story never gets more complex than that - pretty much the entire plot line, except the ending, is told in the trailer. The film has so many plot holes, that you eventually get used to not asking questions.

The abhorrent levels of ""bad"" were such that I genuinely fear that the next film I watch will be ruined by the echoes of this ""film"".<br/><br/>To be fair to the film and indeed as kind and constructive as I can, I think I should take a 'complement sandwich' approach. So to begin with, the special effects were (unsurprisingly) very good, not to mention the directing, which can hardly be held accountable for the plot line with which it had to work. <br/><br/>Now to move onto the more pressing issue of the plot: I slate it quite heavily in my summary, but feel that this is in no way unjustified. Its lack of explanation throughout left me nothing short of annoyed, with the apparent logic for progression of a situation in the story being almost universally – ""this next bit happens because it says so in the script"". It would be reasonable to say that the plot never flows, but rather just happens. It would be forgivable to give no explanation as to why things were as they were if such facts were not essential to an understanding of the film that was deeper than ""for 108 minutes some things happened on a screen I was looking at"". The denial of any catharsis at the end could be considered ""artistic"" were it not for the lack of quality in the plot preceding it to adequately back it up. <br/><br/>To complete the 'complement sandwich', another good thing about the film was that it finished.

An advanced alien race comes to earth, for some reason visits only Johannesburg, South Africa, has ""car problems"" above the city, lets the technologically and physically weaker humans smack them around, they live in slums, eat cat food, and dive around in trash cans. Sounds like something a 3rd grader would jot down in his X-Men notebook.<br/><br/>If I had gone to the theater to see this, I would have walked out. How this mess has an 8.4 rating is beyond me. I will be using the DVD as a coaster on my end table, because at least the artwork was decent."

","Very Very Good.<br/><br/>I'm still processing the film. It will need much thought and a second viewing. Not because it was bad, rather because even being told what the film is and how it behaves (it bounces between documentary style and narrative film style) the film is not what I expected. It doesn't help that the trailers and commercials only gave us a taste of the film, there is so much more to it.<br/><br/>The plot is that the aliens came to earth 30 years before. They are stranded here and have been placed into District 9 which devolves into a ghetto. The humans living around them don't want them there any more so they are forcibly moved...and thats when things go sideways as the man in charge of the move ends up sprayed with something and begins to change. Part documentary part action film this is a unique film that does and moves in its own way.(The basic plot is not new, but what it does with it is) A couple of months ago Moon was being tossed about as the next big thing. I thought not. This is certain to get a similar buzz and I think this is a better candidate. At the same time this is bound to be over hyped but as some one who was ready to knock the film down for being over loved by critics and scifi fans, the over hype is heartfelt and not that far from the truth. Its a very good film, is it great I don't know but it certainly doesn't suck.<br/><br/>Yes you want to see this if you like scifi or action films."

Therefore, the movie feels politically accurate. I mean, the whole eviction situation is real and I'm proud to say that I can verify it because I work for the government. Also, it give us a real vision towards how politics rule the world and decide everything for people's lives.<br/><br/>The settings are beautiful taking in account that the post-apocalyptic scenarios are dreadful.

","CLEVER, REFRESHING PARODICAL COMMENTARY ON RACISM AND APARTHEID<br/><br/>If you are expecting another Independence Day flick with stereotypical aliens and heroes, don't bother. For the film connoisseur, however, District 9 will prove to show a thrilling, refreshing angle on this crucial aspect of South African history. <br/><br/>""District 9"" refers to the forced removal of tens of thousands of coloured South Africans from ""District 6"" in Cape Town during the early 70's. Luckily these referrals aren't pushed too explicitly down the audience's throats. The parallels are clear and worked out very well. But unlike many other South African movies, the audience is not spoon-fed moral judgments or explanations. <br/><br/>True, Wikus is not a very likable character. He got the job only because he married the boss' daughter, he is a racist loser and not at all your typical sci-fi hero. His geekiness does, however, occasionally provide us with some hilarious scenes. When he gets the alien gunk on him, though, he becomes one of ""them"" and gradually realizes the error of his ways. Another nice referral to South Africa's socio-cultural context wherein many white South Africans eventually realize they (or their forefathers) acted inhumanly in the past towards people with another skin colour. It shows that everyone is capable of change, but hopefully people realize that they don't need to become the 'other' in order to see their points of view more clearly. In short, to fully appreciate District 9, it is rather necessary to view it against its cultural backdrop.<br/><br/>The writing is intelligent, the acting is decent and the special effects are surprisingly good. A definite must see for all those remotely interested in South Africa, racism or aliens."
"DICK STEEL","10","21","39","14 August 2009"," A Nutshell Review: District 9
","South African director Neill Blomkamp, who co-wrote this film with Terri Tatchell, and an extension to his short film Alive in Joburg, will be someone on my radar for this thrilling roller coaster ride that blew my expectations many times over with its concept and slick delivery of an action piece with plenty of social commentary about the negative human conditions that easily plague the best of us, especially when it comes to self-preservation where we are likely to go on autopilot to ensure our interests and survival over and above others. Not forgetting too that the aliens portrayed here are rather peace loving, perfectly fine with living within the confines of their assigned territory and not take advantage of their weapons, to say, take over our world.<br/><br/>For someone who had grown up during the apartheid, it is easy to notice how Blomkamp had included elements of those conditions into his narrative. From a bigger picture perspective as well, the extreme negativity in humanity's flaws stemming from fear, also got itself a place in its criticism, which Blomkamp intelligently crafted into the underlying narrative passage. We fear the unknown and what we do not know, and often name-call others whom we don't understand just to stand on a perceived moral high ground, as well as constantly looking for avenues to exploit any situation for money or power.<br/><br/>As a concept though, Blomkamp adopted from the best of science fiction, and put them all together in an eclectic mix containing the best of the best. One can't deny that homage to The Fly, where a character through his own complacent doing, gets to see himself turn into something he despise initially. Then there's this overgrown conglomerate in MNU (someone say OCP?) which has its finger in many pies, such as the provision of security contractors and mercenaries and interests in high-tech weaponry, with corrupt bosses who would sell out their own children to make that extra penny.<br/><br/>But what I felt to me was familiar ground in the setting up of its basic introductory premise, is that of the 1988 film Alien Nation. In that film, USA got visited by a mega spaceship which hovered in the air, and as my memory of the story goes, the aliens on the ship, slaves in their own planet, got welcomed to live on Earth and integrate with everyone, quite unlike the segregation in District 9. The Newcomers have a penchant for fanciful names which give rise to some comedy, and while they don't boast powerful weapons, they are in many ways stronger in intellect and in physical aspects than the average human, which allows for fear and prejudicial behaviour towards the new citizens of Earth.<br/><br/>The distrust in District 9 is more pronounced of course, which consists of setting up concentration camps within which the aliens are forced to live in. Sharlto Copley stars as Wikus, a newly promoted employee of MNU (and son-in-law to the company's head honcho) to take charge of evicting the aliens from their current District 9 compound, to a supposedly better District 10 hundreds of miles away from Johannesburg, where the city folks are getting increasingly frustrated in their attempts to move the aliens out of their backyard. Excited by his appointment, we follow Wikus around in the first act, which is about something similar to the original short film in treatment, providing the basis in which we learn more of their environment the characters all operate within, with interesting nuggets thrown up that is testament to a science fiction world carefully created.<br/><br/>This documentary feel soon dissolved into an action-adventure that's pretty much expected, if not for how the story made you feel for Wikus as a hunted man desperate to escape from the clutches of scientists and board room stiffs who see him not as a human, but as a commodity to be mined for research and weaponization. And it is in this desperation that perhaps a sliver of hope and humanity could arise from his rather arrogant yet timid outlook and self, which Copley portrayed with the experience akin to a veteran thespian, shuttling between various emotions over a wide spectrum.<br/><br/>In fact, Copley's performance provided that extra push almost single-handedly in engaging you to the character and the premise that Fate has thrown him into, as we journey with him on a strange ride involving the symbiotic relationship he has to strike up with one of the ""Prawns"", and through this interaction which involves everything from family to an eye- popping, edge of your seat action sequence that seem to continuously top its own earlier scenes as it charges toward the finale, we see the change in Wikus from despair, to one coming to grips with, and eventually learning to respect differences. Like Alien Nation's cops of different cultures who learn to compromise and even fight for each other, District 9 also evokes those same sentiments, which Copley aces perfectly.<br/><br/>Adopting the kind of Cloverfield and REC concept as well with the fourth wall periodically broken, I thought the cinematography here was extremely subtle in its transition to and from that documentary feel of unsteady cam, to the steady tripod shots for the more traditional capture of big action up close. WETA is responsible for the wonderful looking creature and technological designs, and once again proves itself as a premier effects and creature creator.<br/><br/>District 9 brings plenty of fresh perspectives, narrative maturity and teaches contemporary filmmakers a thing or two about shooting exciting action sequences, building of tension, and just about what makes a film so awesome that it just begs for a rewatch. Definitely highly recommended stuff that you cannot afford to miss, and if you're planning to view just one film in this noisy blockbuster season, then look no further than Districct 9, which gets my vote as one of the worthy favourites of the year!"
"jonnygs","4","29","57","17 August 2009"," Review for Humans Only!
","I walked into District 9, Niell Blomkamp's eagerly awaited sci-fi film/apartheid allegory, not knowing what to expect. From the advertising campaign that consisted of Jim Crow-like signs that read: for humans only, to the action packed trailer, I was curious to see if Blomkamp could successfully incorporate both elements. The allegory to the apartheid in South Africa is quite clear for the first hour of the film, especially due to the fact that this all takes place in South Africa. While Blomkamp was successful in creating an interesting allegory, he was not able to make a good, or even interesting film. The first hour of the film is long and boring, features newscasts that tell the audience essential background information, and unfortunately, also tells them what they are seeing. The story is as follows. In 1981, an enormous UFO mothership appeared mysteriously over Johannesburg, and its alien inhabitants, called by humans ""Prawns,"" have since been moved from their airborne craft to a slum, which is controlled by voodoo-practicing African gangsters. The main character is dorky civil servant Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley, in a fine performance), who is put in charge of relocating the aliens away from Johannesburg by the company that he works for, Multi-National United (MNU). These plans go awry, however, when Wikus is contaminated with a black alien fluid, and begins transforming into a Prawn. Thus begins his fight with MNU (which secretly craves his newfound ability to use alien weaponry) and an unlikely partnership with a Prawn named Christopher. While this is a fairly interesting story, District 9 takes a long time to set itself up and loses the audience in the process. After all this exposition comes the action packed second half, of which only some is interesting. One of the film's biggest flaws is its inability to explain why the aliens don't resist the humans when they have advanced weaponry that only they can use. While the prawns and the humans speak entirely different languages, they are able to understand each other. Even more confusing, they aren't always able to understand one another. Sometimes there is miscommunication, sometimes not. It's a pity that this wasn't explained within the first hour. But it's a science fiction film, you say, not everything will be realistic! That's correct, but everything has to be believable. If you can somehow get past these inconsistencies, you'll probably be put off by the gruesome nature of the violence. There are many scenes where people explode, and their body parts collide with the screen, and there are many instances in which lots of close-ups of wounded flesh are paraded around for the audience to sink in. If you can sit through all of this, the ending will leave you disappointed. After almost two hours of exposition and subsequent action, the film's conclusion only resolves a small part of the main plot line. This makes it obvious that there will be a sequel, but the question remains, why should I, as a member of the audience, care enough to sit through another film to discover what I already should've been told in the first film? My answer? You shouldn't."

","This movie actually got me to write my first review. The movies current rating is just absurd.<br/><br/>Just read the few other reviews that aren't positive and got completely spammed out.<br/><br/>My biggest problem was the plot though. It has all been mentioned. But just to repeat, after 3 years not touching an alien ship (3 years????) they just drill in? Without looking around outside a bit? Sensors, anything? Then they are inside, get the aliens out, and say, alright kiddos, that is it, let's go? Nobody stays in there to look at the ship? Look at the technology? Anything? Or picture this. A gazillion bad guys shoot with rifles on a heavily armed tank. The tank kills them all slowly one by one. After an eternity, the bad guy decides maybe rifles aren't the smartest thing to use, and decides to take it up one step. Yeah. Take that. You tank. He turns around and orders a sniper to fire precisely into the middle of the armor. Wtf? After that surprisingly doesn't work, and all his gazillion guys are dead, including the sniper, he thinks again. With all the weapons of the world at hand, helis, armored vehicles, and rifles and snipers not working, what to do? So he grasps to his left, pulls up the missile launcher, and shoots the tank. Done. Except, to finish the tank off, he has to shoot the tank one more time with his rifle. Wtf? Except that the tank really was a heavily armored robot.<br/><br/>This movie is ridiculous. What a waste of time. Apparently you can't quite trust IMDb ratings on technology related stuff where nerds just spam the rating. Which is what got me to post."

In addition, we are led to believe, that an alien species that is capable of traveling incredibly VAST VAST distances in space to get to our planet, would behave the way they do in this movie- like the common human trash you see appearing on Springer.<br/><br/>Not to mention, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY, such aliens would be sent off to internment camps; up to and including being in a third world country in wide open spaces where local drug thugs operate with impunity. And I didn't even touch the suggestion of alien prostitutes.

","I watched this junk for about an hour before I finally gave up. I found no redeeming qualities whatsoever in the film. It plays like an unfunny gross-out comedy done on the cheap by amateurs. There is nothing here to keep you watching the screen. The aliens are actually first-rate CGI, but are completely wasted due to their sickening looks, slavish actions, and general lack of any apparent purpose than to shock and disgust. We may be shocked at first appearance, but that wears off in about 15 seconds. The disgust does not wear off.<br/><br/>There does not seem to be any plot, any decent camera-work, any acting, any direction, any reason to care about anything on the screen. It is as if a middle school film project to create the worst movie possible was responsible for this mess. Actually, that insults middle-schoolers.<br/><br/>I had been warned by every friend that saw this steaming pile of reptile excrement that it was absolutely awful. I decided to see for myself --- how awful it could be? My friends were actually very kind. Mankind has not yet invented adjectives to describe this level of terrible.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that no one in the movie even deserves mentioning, nor does the ""director"", but knowing that Peter Jackson was in some way involved tells volumes, and the fact that critic Roger Ebert liked D9 clinches it. No wonder it is bad, really bad, really really really bad. Worse, the worst, horrible, despicable, nauseatingly bad. And I am being quite charitable!"
"jdub421","1","28","55","19 August 2009"," The concept of this movie could have been so much better.
","The concept of this movie could have been so much better.<br/><br/>The fact that the aliens had all those weapons but didn't use them to gain food or better living conditions makes no sense. It says in the movie that they have no concept of property ownership. The writers should have made it so all the weapons were confiscated from the mother ship which would make more sense as to why the aliens would be subjected to a shanty town and such abuse.<br/><br/>Second the movie would have been much more interesting if the topic of integrating the aliens into society vs. moving them to district 10 has been addressed more prevalently. They showed protesters with signs saying 'I love PRawns' etc which would have been a good opening to expand on this topic. I could see a parallel that could be drawn with that to the apartheid government of South Africa which would make the setting of Johannesburg more prevalent.<br/><br/>What about the competition between governments for control of the alien technology.. China, NATO, Iran ..etc ??? couldn't the aliens negotiate for more then cat food? or are we to believe there South Africa is the only one to be in control or that there was a combined effort by all humanity represented by the MNU except for a small Nigerian gang to manipulate and try to gain an upper hand in acquiring alien technology.<br/><br/>Flaws...<br/><br/>There is no way any government would have not had an impossible amount of security at a HQ dealing with the kind of experiments they were doing. Simply running out of the building by taking a person hostage would not have been possible. IF we are led to believe that the MNU top officials are ruthless enough to kill Vikas to harvest his body certainly they would kill a hostage or anyone else for that matter to stop him from leaving. If he had escaped it should have been through a more ingenious way like stealing alien weapons to blast his way out and using his knowledge of the building. Once out of the building couldn't they track his frequent cell phone calls? Containing the aliens would have been more logical if there was a major multinational military presence outside district 9 with more then a small fence severing as a border fence. We should have seen tons of tanks and military hardware not just a small group of mercenaries and helicopters. Where was the UN or the United States? The mother-ship would be the real technology that people should have been interested in. Come on it's fcking huge!.. it can travel outside of our solar system.. possessed some kind of anti gravity technology.. etc etc. Were there MNU agents in the ship working to obtain the technology it possessed. I can't imagine that it would be just sitting there for 20+ years empty so that when the aliens flew up to the ship that they could just leave and no people would be on it. I mean they made a big deal of finding alien technology in the camp but look how much was floating over the city.<br/><br/>I could go on but i guess when the alien comes back we will have a new movie DIstrict 10 in a year or so."

I had heard that District 9 was to be what the Matrix was in 2000. Let me be the first to tell you that this movie does not so much as scratch the big toe of the Matrix (and I doubt any modern-day sci-fi movie ever will). Wikus, or whatever his name is, is portrayed as a weak, frail man who runs away at problems and cries at calamity. Wikus could use some severe training sessions with Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie is a joke. The characters are all personalities I have experienced in other movies at greater calibers which produced greater results. Such as that soldier guy who is killed last. If he does not remind you of Arnold Scharzenegger in Predator or Terminator, than I don't know.<br/><br/>Wikus's wife betrayed him, but we never learn how, why, or if that was purposefully done. As I read in a review before mine, how can an alien race fly millions of miles through the galaxy topping warp speeds to even reach Earth and then ""run out of gas""? Like you would think they would have highly sensitive metal plated boards that suck up gamma rays or something of the sort from the sun.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is torture, a waste of time, and should be avoided. While watching this movie, I was hoping something meaningful and intuitive or catchy would happen and I was left in dire disappointment. Considering watching something entertaining? Then please continue searching, this is NOT the movie for entertainment loving persons.<br/><br/>EDIT: rewatched this movie as a 29 year old guy. The writing isn't as bad as I said when I was younger and wrote the above review.

But - like 2001, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, ALIEN, STAR WARS and STAR TREK - DISTRICT 9 is revolutionary! All extraterrestrial alien movies must now bow down before DISTRICT 9.<br/><br/>Like the deformed child of a documentary and a reality show; a psychodrama with a tongue-in-cheek sense of black humor. No world domination or alien armies, no mighty deathships or hyperspace star streams, no cantina scenes or darth Cheneys - just a real world grit and bureaucratic spit, coupled with racial allegory that holds up a ruthless mirror to mankind's black soul. Much like BRÜNO, only totally Not Gay.<br/><br/>They arrived 20 years ago in their broken spaceship. And just hung in the sky, unthreatening, unknown, un-Spielberg. Luckily, they didn't break down over the country with the biggest percentage of closed minds per boob job - America. But even over Johannesburg, South Africa, livid with the unlearned lessons of apartheid, they became pariahs. The government rescued these one million malnourished, harmless, ""worker class"" aliens from their own ship and overcrowded them into a Johannesburg shanty town called District 9.<br/><br/>Squalor, crime, interspecies prostitution and black market arms deals between the aliens and Nigerian gangs prompt Johannesburgers to demand ""apart-hood"" from the aliens.<br/><br/>Multi-National United (MNU), a military/government body, appoints nerdy cubicle boy, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley, in his first major role), to oversee the massive relocation of the aliens 200 miles from Johannesburg.<br/><br/>Wikus storms District 9 with bogus ""eviction forms,"" like Orwell's Thoughtpolice by way of Ricky Gervais, as we try to figure whether this is high comedy or uncomfortable racism. It is both.<br/><br/>Bigots call the aliens ""prawns"" for their crustacean-like faces, and the unflappably jaunty Wikus seems to be the biggest bigot of all, as he orders the burning of a shack brimming with alien eggs, telling jokes about the baby prawns inside bursting like popcorn as they're trying to escape.<br/><br/>Director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp has assembled a cast of brilliant unknowns, and forged a movie of veteran quality, creatively lensing the story's development through security cam and surveillance formats and news footage; aided by producer and fantasy god-king, Peter Jackson (LORD OF THE RINGS, KING KONG 2005).<br/><br/>It can now be said that Jackson's special effects company, Weta Digital, blows every other effects house back to the age of Pong - this goes for prominent A-Listers like ILM (STAR WARS), Sony Imageworks (SPIDER-MAN), Giant (INCREDIBLE HULK). In DISTRICT 9, we never doubt the veracity of the city-sized spaceship hanging in the sky, the thousands of aliens in full daylight, the 3D holograms, the weaponry...<br/><br/>Alien weapons (which the aliens trade for catfood and hookers) is attuned to alien DNA, so humans cannot use them, which of course, the humans try to do, by mutilating aliens in MNU underground labs in attempts to combine their DNA with humans. (The analogies with Nazis' human experiments are not lost.) While in DISTRICT 9, the Nigerian gang leader (on advice of his witch doctor) eats fresh aliens for the same purpose.<br/><br/>Wikus unwillingly becomes the most wanted man amongst the aliens, the Nigerian gangs and the MNU, when a vial of alien fluid accidentally spurts in his face... Flashbacks to THE FLY, as his fingernails and teeth gradually fall out, nubs of exoskeleton poking through his flesh... alien DNA combining with his...<br/><br/>And an alien that Wikus was terrorizing, named ""Christopher Johnson"" (wearing a red vest, so I shall call him Red Vest, rather than use his slave name), and his smart little alien son, become unbidden allies to Wikus.<br/><br/>In any alien film, language is the credibility downfall. Here, both parties have learned the basics of each other's speech, but since their throats are constructed differently, do not try to imitate each other, speaking fluently and authentically, picking up snatches of concepts.<br/><br/>Even when DISTRICT 9 tips into ""blockbuster"" and suffers a TRANSFORMERS moment (when Wikus is inside a giant CGI exoskeleton), the reason for him being inside the robot suit is to save Red Vest to reunite him with his son. Amidst the hail of gunfire from muttonhead military drogues led by a vindictive officer (David James), poignancy blossoms as Wikus almost tenderly (yet with firepower to stop tanks) tells Red Vest, ""Let's get you to your son."" And by the way, don't humans know by now that regular bullets can't harm alien robot suits? DISTRICT 9 is ultimately a Grande Tragedie, as Wikus transforms into that which he despised, taking ""seeing things through another's skin"" to a whole 'nother level.<br/><br/>Laden with these metaphors and allegories, DISTRICT 9's stylish brutality may in fact distract from its message: it doesn't take extraterrestrial aliens to bring out the barbarism and racism in humans. Any nominally alien race will do.<br/><br/>Humans were no less brutal in 1948 when apartheid laws were institutionalized; were no less inhumane when burning Jews in 1944 (and probably laughing as internal organs burst with popcorn sounds); are no less single-minded in their brainwashed murder when eradicating Iraqis in George W. Bush's ""holy crusades"" undertaken by Xe (nee Blackwater) in 2006...<br/><br/>When worlds collide in DISTRICT 9, the beings displaying the most inhumanity - are the humans."
"redfro17","2","21","40","29 June 2010"," District 9: Worst-Best Movie Of The Year
","The fact that this movie generated as much hype as it did is ridiculous. No one seems to be able to put a critical eye on this film. It is an absolutely awful film...and here is why.<br/><br/>The story: Basically aliens are stranded on Earth after their ship crash/float lands? on Earth. They are found aboard their ship dying of hunger and are relocated to district nine which eventually becomes a slum. First problem I have is the fact the movie states there are 1.8 million aliens here and yet all you ever see is empty houses. Throughout the entire movie, you can count the number of different aliens you see and it works out to be around forty. Where are the overhead shots with millions of aliens wandering around? Instead all we get are the expansive slums which appear empty. Next issue is the way it was filmed. What the heck is so unique about it? It is filmed as a sort of past/present interview style throughout, some of which is real time and some of which is in the past. It is a mess and does not make this movie special. Anyone who is amused by it clearly has too much of a fetish for Peter Jackson or Neill Bloomkamp. I mean, this movie was the go-to option for a scrapped Halo production...its a useless bunch of junk produced on low budget leftovers. The spaceship is the only cool image throughout the entire film...that and some of the overhead shots of the landscape. That is it. The rest is like a cheap B or C movie. One guy going out of his way to help three aliens, one who dies and one who is a kid. So much about this movie is left unexplained...what or where do these few aliens find that black goo? I assumed it was from that piece of their spaceship that falls off, like maybe its the fuel tank or something? Either way, why are there remnants of this black goo scattered about the slums? If this piece of the ship fell it would break in one area, leaving the search for this fuel or whatever relatively easy. Furthermore, why are ONLY three aliens looking for it? The other aliens don't even seem to care about getting home. It just seems very stupid. Oh and don't forget the goo turns humans into aliens. This just all seemed like it was dreamt up while someone was on the toilet...okay, lets have aliens and call them prawns, they can eat cat food and there are these three who wanna get home but they have to search for this magic fuel and there is the guy who gets it on him and the stuff turns him into a prawn. That is the movie in a sentence.<br/><br/>Now I get the reference to the apartheid that occurred in South Africa but I would much rather see an actual film on it. Why twist in aliens? And bad aliens to boot...anyone who thinks they looked ""cool"" is just being ridiculous. These aliens were the most uninteresting aliens I have ever seen. CGI was well wasted there. Back to the historical reference, I just failed to connect or even care. There was no emotion which should and could have been drawn from a properly written plot. You get to cheer for one alien, one kid alien and a guy with an alien arm. Oh and to ruin the ending, the two aliens get away and the guy turns into one and becomes a brooding prawn plucking petals from a plastic petunia. Ta daaa. I commend Jackson and Bloomkamp for duping almost everyone who has watched this into thinking it is astounding...it is not. I hated it, I fell asleep because the action was so cheap and underwhelming. This movie never should have received the praise it has gotten. It just underwhelmed me to the max. I mean, Mikus (the main human character) wanted to relocate the aliens until he was infected with black spray/goo. Then he wanted a cure for himself so he helps two aliens (not the entire race) escape. Some people will say the deeper meaning is that he becomes more humane the less human he becomes...all I see is a greedy little office nerd who wants his arm back. Great message.<br/><br/>To summarize...bad CGI aliens, bad film style, weak plot twist on a historical event, low budget look (seriously we see slums that look more empty than full, hardly any aliens anywhere...not that I want to see them as they are poorly created), typical/predictable outcome and a lot was left unexplained (the fuel/alien spray, the guns, why they landed/crashed, why the didn't fight back if there was 1.8 million of them...oh right there was actually only 40, why they didn't use their weapons since the humans could not). Basically this is a pansy alien movie for pansy moral seeking deep minded blow hards who THINK this movie means more. Well it does not. It is simply the remnants of a scrapped Halo film pieced together by Jackson and Bloomkamp in an ""oh-look-interviews-film-style-this-is-so-unique"" style that is really just cheap.<br/><br/>Watch it...you will probably like it. If you do, you are simply a slave to cinema, accepting that because someone like Ebert says its good, then it is. Think on the dark side of the moon for once, and just remember what Pink Floyd said."

","I think it was trying to be Children of Men. with aliens. My complaints are too much graphic violence and too long. The aliens aren't very biologically plausible, either, but it's only a movie.<br/><br/>The plot's not really SciFi. It's more a comment on how humans treat large groups of refugees, minorities, and immigrants settled in their midst (I told you it was trying to be Children of Men). Similar ground (using aliens as a metaphor) was covered before, albeit differently, in Alien Nation. The story is set in South Africa, and the country's pre-Mandela history resonates throughout the film.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing in the movie is its lead, Sharlto Copley, whom I suspect will be the next big international actor everyone wants for their upcoming production. He turns in a helluva fine performance as a dorky stooge in the beginning, but a true hero in the end. If this movie's a big hit, everyone will be chasing him.<br/><br/>I don't want to be a plot spoiler so I won't elaborate on the story. Aliens or not, District 9 could be a refugee/minority detention camp anywhere on earth today."
"vailsy","1","41","86","22 August 2009"," woefully overrated movie. true sci-fi heads should watch Moon instead
","Visual effects enthusiasts will love this movie. For me though the effects were nearly too good, causing the film makers to be lazy in the key areas of story and acting. The film makes very little sense and apparently tells us how intolerant humans are? Actually it doesn't, because there is no way we would invite an alien species onto our planet in the first place <br/><br/>The contained area they get to live in is not secure at all, and the way that native South Africans and aliens interact with each other to develop weapons and so on is ridiculous. These creatures would be 100% quarantined<br/><br/>A huge space craft hovers above our planet and yet there is no urgency felt and no international response to this landmark event; the whole business is administered by South Africans. Would the UN not be there or the USA? <br/><br/>How humans and aliens are able to chat with each other in their native languages also goes completely unexplained.<br/><br/>It's only a movie though right?<br/><br/>Okay so are people on this board who say this is a commentary about how white people treat other races serious then? how so? No in the real world humans, black/white/orange, are a lot more intolerant than depicted here. If you think this is some kind of racial commentary then you are a victim of marketing because that's what the film makers would like you to believe.<br/><br/>I've heard a great deal of awe toward the sound in this movie, especially with the creature voices. When I closed my eyes during this film, as I did several times, I would often hear conversation going on between humans and aliens. My first thought was how wonderful the human voice is. How subtle, tonal and rich it is. The alien voices were interesting for no more than 5 minutes and didn't develop dramatically. Ben Burtt et al created dozens of voices as good and better nearly a quarter of a century ago <br/><br/>The sound mix is distracting to the point where things coming out of the surrounds make no sense and completely detach you from the movie. An alien is in a cabin and outside only to the right we hear the main character outside, why? Is sound not supposed to be supportive of the story, the drama? if so why should sound distract us from that story <br/><br/>What a tremendous waste of great visual effects work. Because if they were there to support a great story, acting, character development then what an outstanding movie really could have been made<br/><br/>If you're a true sci-fi enthusiast do yourself a big favour and watch Moon instead"
"Turfseer","2","24","47","3 June 2010"," Alien Nation meets Waiting for Guffman meets The Fly
","Right away 'District 9', with the giant alien mother ship hovering in the sky, reminded me of the earlier movie and TV series 'Alien Nation'. That TV Series actually was an improvement over the original movie as the characters had some wonderful idiosyncrasies and you could easily identify with them as they represented a new (and also familiar) ethnic group. Not so with District 9. The aliens look part insect, part crab and have an unintelligible language consisting mainly of clicks and other weird sounds (somehow the aliens can easily understand English but we viewers must watch subtitles; it's not very clear whether humans in the story can understand the 'prawns' very well—you never see any interpreters assisting any of the soldiers when they enter District 9 and attempt to evict the prawns). Even worse is the fact that the prawns are not a very likable bunch as they are scavengers and as we are informed from the outset, constantly committing crimes against the human population which leads for the call for them to be relocated.<br/><br/>The first half hour of 'District 9' is devoted to what I would call a mockumentary (similar to the film 'Waiting for Guffman'). The film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and various people are interviewed providing the back story of the alien arrival and subsequent colonization on earth. The filmmakers were lucky to find an abandoned shantytown in Soweto where set designers ably created a massive junkyard inhabited by the prawns. During the mockumentary, it's established that some kind of command module floated down to earth from the mother ship but for some reason, after 20 years, it's never been located inside District 9. I would think that if an alien ship actually landed here on earth, there would have been a huge team of international investigators searching for that module and no doubt finding it after a short search.<br/><br/>District 9 becomes more confusing when we're introduced to the protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe. He's a bureaucrat who also happens to be the son-in-law of the director at MNU (Multinational United), the corporate group of military contractors who have been awarded a contract to relocate the prawns to a cleaner district outside of Johannesburg. I could never understand why the company needs to have the prawns EACH sign an eviction notice before being relocated. The explanation is that it's a 'cover' but how could the company possibly have 1.8 million uncooperative creatures sign an agreement? If they kept the operation closed to the public, there would have been no need for those eviction notices. Wikus looks ridiculous traipsing around trying to collect signatures and he's such a buffoon of a character that one wonders if the filmmakers were actually going for comedy toward the beginning of their narrative. Certainly the prawns' ravenous desire for cat food adds to the comedy and a group of Nigerian criminals also get short shrift here too as they have no regrets about living inside the odious District 9 and scamming the prawns for alien weapons (which they don't know how to use) in exchange for cat food.<br/><br/>The mockumentary is pretty much dispensed with as we break into the second act of the story. A prawn and his son have been working for years developing some kind of fuel to power the command module back to the mother ship. Wikus manages to ingest some of the black goo and much like the movie 'The Fly', he grows a prawn hand. The bad guys from MNU (they're all bad!) decide to cut Wikus up and sell his body parts to the highest bidder (there's some mumble jumble talk about how his 50-50 human/prawn DNA will sell very well on the black market). Wikus of course escapes and begs for help from the prawn and his son inside the underground module. The prawn can possibly help him in three years after returning to the mother ship but only if they can get the container containing the black goo from MNU headquarters which Wikus had confiscated when he first found it. Much like Terminator 2, Wikus and the prawn break into the impenetrable building and grab the container, only to be chased by MNU's top killer.<br/><br/>Wikus is then captured by the Nigerians but manages to escape by fitting himself into a giant robotic fighting machine (shades of Transformers and Iron Man!). Our Bad guy killer from MNU manages to finally disable the robot and Wikus falls to the ground almost unconscious. Wikus however is saved when a bunch of prawns rip the MNU guy's head off (fortunately there are no close-ups). Oh yeah—the prawn and his son use the goo to power the module back to the mother ship. Everyone's thrilled when the ship leaves our atmosphere. Back to the mockumentary where we learn the prawns have been resettled.<br/><br/>From a confused and awkward stab at comedy, District 9 tries to get real emotional when Wikus and the Prawn and his son BOND! Suddenly the prawns are actually sensitive creatures and Wikus is a hero for saving them! None of it works, since we haven't been invested in the unsavory Prawns from the beginning nor do we care about Wikus, despite all the pseudo-heroic machinations.<br/><br/>If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that the script was patched together by the director and a co-writer on the fly and that the director really didn't have much of a clue as to what he was doing as he went along. I'll confess that the editing team saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Nonetheless, it's clear that the filmmakers tried to straddle between the worlds of both comedy and pathos and ended up with a hybrid of pure goofiness."

","I went to the movie to be entertained. However came out quite irritated.<br/><br/>Irritation was due to the fact that movie seemed very ignorant, as it tried to be somewhat intellectual? I have studied African matters in great extent, and I found that the movie was just playing on the stereotypes from there. Like the Nigerians, who are blamed for everything in South Africa (even though most migrants are not even from Nigeria). There are hundreds of big crime syndicates in South Africa that are very violent, but they are not all Nigerian.<br/><br/>Then what I found irritating was the fact these beings were altruistic? So human, even when they come from a completely different planet. I like real movies, but this was made for ignorant people playing on their stereotypical thinking, and little added glory and goodness for the viewer... happy endings make better bucks I read from a Hollywood marketing book.<br/><br/>I just found the fact that movies that simulate suffering, and displacement of people due to conflicts and hunger are the only ways that people can somewhat even see the real problems. This movie is testimony to the ignorance of the general public on almost all matters... reality is so terrible that people cannot face that. It could also be that I'm getting old, and too aware of reality.<br/><br/>1 point for good looking RED ONE material 2 points for good Violence 1 point for good CGI + lots of tracking"

"deathshammer","1","29","59","20 December 2009"," The wrong direction for sci-fi to be going
","I guess sci-fi can't be cool anymore without copious amounts of blood and gore and intense character studies of characters that aren't even interesting. The main character of the story is a guy named Wikus. He is just an ordinary guy doing his job moving aliens out of the slums of South Africa. Then one day someone alien fuel supply changes his arm into an alien one. If that isn't a major plot hole then I don't know what is. This plot hole is gigantic enough that it detracts and distracts from the rest of the movie and what there is of a story. Obviously, once Wikus begins his David Cronenberg-esquire ""The Fly"" transformation, we already knows what's coming. He's going to be alienated(no pun intended), fight for the aliens while all the people he used to know are going to fight against him and the other aliens. And... that's basically all that happens. The writing is never clever, the characters are not interesting or developed at all, and all of this just for a very ridiculously shameful hint at a sequel. The movie is shot like a documentary, which is probably its greatest weakness. This kind of filming doesn't allow for character development or hints at subtle and compelling story points. Instead, we get a climax that is way too familiar*cough*Iron Man*cough*! Then we are treated to more blood and gore, which doesn't lend more credibility to the movie as it does convey the idea that they did it just to make the movie R-rated. I also find it annoying that the cliché that Aliens would be enslaved and exploited is still popular and meant to reflect the sickening concept of apartheid. It's not unique, it's not interesting, and I honestly don't believe this allegory makes for any kind of entertainment. Basically, film-makers need to stop investing in the idea that every damn movie needs to be made into something like Cloverfield. Cloverfield sucked, and this crap isn't any better."

The quick pacing also heightens the sense of urgency and thrill. The amazing story kept me engrossed and captivated by the last one hour of the movie. Computer animations are so perfectly real.

"enfant_perdu","6","22","43","16 August 2009"," Disappointing
","I had high expectations for this movie, and I've been looking forward to it for a long time, but I was a little disappointed once the credits started to roll.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see that a movie like this even got made with a decent budget, a wide release, and good marketing. I'm thrilled that it came in first place at the box office on its opening weekend and is getting good press. Having grown up in the 90s, I miss the former place of prominence aliens had in the popular culture. Hopefully the financial success of this movie will encourage the studios to green light more films in the same genre.<br/><br/>Overall, District 9 is creative and entertaining, but not as original or intelligent as I'd hoped. The trailers seemed to promise the film's main storyline would explore the societal impact of the aliens' arrival and the rich history that preceded the film's main action.<br/><br/>But the story that emerges from its great premise is pretty standard. It hardly develops the aliens' history or psychology. What little development we do get is uninspired, incomplete, and self-contradictory. It also doesn't explore the cultural impact of their arrival with the kind of depth that I'd hoped it would. <br/><br/>And none of the characters are particularly well-developed. Read a synopsis of the movie, and you'll have about as deep of an understanding of the main characters as you would if you'd have watched the whole film. Aside from a unique name and a slightly amusing quirkiness, the main character is relatively forgettable.<br/><br/>My other main criticism is that the narrative isn't as cohesive as I would've preferred. The story jumps from one scene to the next with little or no effort to establish the setting or the purpose of the action. It all ends up feeling less deliberate and focused than it ought to, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something essential missing from the mix. The faux-documentary style seemed arbitrary and without a clear purpose. I wanted to be able to forget that this was the director's feature film debut, but this thought kept popping into my head again and again.<br/><br/>District 9 does have a great premise, and its presentation is pretty solid. The first few minutes of the film do an excellent job of making this fictional world feel believable and realistic. But since the filmmakers did an excellent job in some departments, it makes the film's shortcomings in certain crucial areas that much harder to forgive. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a worthwhile use of two hours' time and the price of admission, and it's certainly more deserving of success than most other films currently in theaters. However, it's not the intelligent, insightful, engaging, allegorical story I'd hoped it would be. Instead, it comes off as an ambitious misfire: an entertaining-but-simple story with a handful of interesting ideas. <br/><br/>Hopefully, though, District 9's critical and commercial success will help pave the way for a resurgence of well-funded, high-concept sci-fi films (especially alien invasion ones)."

","When a giant spaceship surprisingly appears over Johannesburg, the South Africans find that the aliens are famishing in the ship. The entire alien population is brought to a camp in District 9 and the humans realize that the survivors are workers, and the skilled aliens have died. Twenty years later, the camp has become a huge slum and the confined aliens are marginalized and pejoratively nicknamed ""Prawns"" by the locals. They are explored by the Multi-National United (MNU) Corporation that has interest in their weapons that are activated only by their DNAs, and by the Nigerians that exchange their armament per cat food since they are addicted in this pet food. When the clumsy and intellectually limited family man and MNU employee Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is assigned to evict the aliens to a new camp outside Johannesburg called District 10, he is accidentally exposed to an alien chemical inside a metallic cylinder. Wikus delivers the object to MNU and feels sick; a few hours later one of his hands transforms in alien claw. The MNU brings Wikus to their laboratory to use him as guinea pig in their research, trying to discover how to activate the weapons. Wikus manages to escape from the facility and he is hunted by MNU agents. When he meets the alien Christopher in District 9, he sees the only chance to return to his human form; but the alien needs the fluid in the cylinder confiscated by Wikus to succeed in his attempt to reach the mother ship. <br/><br/>""District 9"" is an original sci-fi that uses elements of many other movies like ""Transformers"", ""Independence Day"", ""Starship Troopers"" and works. The aliens look like the ""Predator"", and despite the location in slums, the special effects are pretty good. The story has an ironic beginning, when the narrator tells that the spaceship appeared not over Manhattan, Washington or Chicago, but over Johannesburg. The idea of the apartheid governs the plot and the writer shows what might happen (actually what happens) to a marginalized community after twenty years of segregation, abandoned by the authorities and living in bad conditions. The awkward Wikus Van De Merwe is the real anti-hero, selfish, stupid, betrayer and taking the wrong decisions most of the time. The story ends with a hook for a sequel. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Distrito 9"" (""District 9"")"

Critic stops dead in his tracks: "" most amazing, beautiful movie I have ever seen! 10 Points!""<br/><br/>I don't know, perhaps age makes suspicious but I tend to approach movies where the largest part of the poster says, ""Celebrity X presents a Y movies"" with suspicion. Say, for example, if the poster exclaims ""Quentin Tarantino presents a movie by director so-and-so"", it's a virtually guarantee that the movie is guano. (Same goes for film-posters where the directors' name is spelled bigger than the actual title but that's another story). <br/><br/>So, what we got here? You're average run of the mill science fiction flick (of course PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON!) that does a whole lot of borrowing. <br/><br/>Did I just say borrowing? Pardon me; I'm having too kind a day. Let's call the rose by its name then and call it outright stealing. Why, surely very few people have ever heard off or seen David Cronenbergs ""The Fly"" or ""Aliens"" or ""Robocop""? ""Rambo"", ""Transformers"", ""E.T."" or even ""Dance with the wolves"", who'd every notice a young aspiring director 'borrowing' from such obscure flicks? But perhaps I'm reading too much into the film and those little borrowed moments are pure coincidence – and perhaps PETER JACKSON, who PRESENTS this film, has simply missed those parts. <br/><br/>To be honest, after having seen uncounted war world 2 and apartheid dramas, watching another SA apartheid film (even if it's thinly veiled as science fiction) provoked the same sentiment as watching another apologetic German movie about Hitler: utter boredom sets in. Alright, we all got it: apartheid was wrong, a great crime against humanity and all that  now, could we get on with something fresh, please? Pretty please? <br/><br/>But let's speak about the main-factor of the film: it's being PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON! What makes this a Jackson film? Well, primarily gore – which is a good thing if you have a taste for cinematic gore but the blood and entrails here are obviously and painfully computer animated, it leaves the watcher with the same expression a meat-connoisseur might have after being presented with a tofu burger. Plus, there's a scene where a soldier is hit by a flying sheep – if that isn't a tribute to New Zealand, I don't know what is. <br/><br/>I'd give a couple of points but only because that is one of the few South African science fiction movies, so here goes for the exotic factor. Not to mention a bonus-point because this film was PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON!<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention that this film was PRESENTED BY PETER JACKSON? You know PETER ""Lord of the Rings"" JACKSON?

","Judging from the reviews given, I am surprised how easily people are intrigued by special effects and cinematography. Sure, the movie is quality due to the realness of the aliens and how natural they belonged on set, but the movie itself left so much to be asked for. Each scene was rushed, leaving the main character any real obstacles to overcome (basically, it was a series of action scenes in which the main character manages to succeed without too much effort), and each scene felt as if it was simply there to lead the way for the next scene; there was no real brilliance or flair or meaning in any of the scenes itself.<br/><br/>As an intellectual viewer, I thought a lot of the film was rushed and lacked any real quality or depth in meaning. Just another action flick but with aliens I suppose (one with a poor progression in storyline). I would have given this film a four rather than a five, but I was amazed by its effects and how natural the aliens looked. But Im not a sucker for special effects and mindless action, and the sooner people begin to realise that movies are not made of special effects alone, the sooner people will get good movies in their cinemas."

The trailers also make you think that the humans are just evil people doing horrible things to the aliens and so forth which is kinda true but not completely true..The humans do have greedy and bad intentions for the aliens, wanting to harness their technology and weaponry and what not, but in the film there isn't a huge focus on the humans mistreating the aliens...its not like what you would see in a film about the Holocaust or something like that.<br/><br/>Since the film dosen't use any Hollywood big shots it feels very realistic..the CGI effects are fantastic and the aliens are very realistic and the interaction with them and the human characters is very convincing and well done..<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everybody though.

","District 9 is highly derivative - I can't help but think that the flood of 10s awarded to this movie must have been given by younger people who haven't seen a lot of movies. Basically, this is Alien Nation meets The Fly, combined with a half-baked, out of date political allegory.<br/><br/>Worker bee aliens arrive over a major city and take up residence in a local slum after a period of years. This is of course the exact setup of Alien Nation. Our hero, initially broadly played as a geek, and later fluctuating between geek and self-interested hero, is sent to move the aliens further outside Joberg. He is infected and begins to become an alien, which his fingernails peeling off and his teeth falling out. These portions, which went on WAY too long, were identical to the transformation in The Fly. I mean exactly the same - fingernails and teeth. The portion of the film devoted to our hero's transformation consists of him vomiting and tearing off new pieces of his body for 45 straight minutes. Um, we get it. The director is clearly a master of restraint.<br/><br/>Aside from ripping off other movies (in the case of the Fly, much better movies), the style of the film is reflective of some bad cinematic trends of the past few years. A documentary style (which disappears for the middle hour of the film, only to reappear in the last five minutes) adds something for a little but eventually provides an unfortunate excuse for a lot shaky-cam. At least a dozen people walked out of my small theater, including my wife, because they thought they were going to throw up. Also, the main villains of the piece (the standard evil corporation seeking weapons technology from the Alien movies and some heartless mercenary types) are incredibly one dimensional.<br/><br/>The political allegory doesn't make a lot of sense, considering that the aliens are meant to represent native Africans suffering under apartheid. The aliens are not native, and were rescued from their ship and given a place to live, which they proceed to tear apart. I found myself wondering what was owed to these creatures - but every human is so despicable you are given no choice with respect to a rooting interest.<br/><br/>Basically, I didn't like much about the film until the last 30 minutes, when the action kicked in. Alien weapons are employed and cause considerable havoc. And you are meant to enjoy the site of humans being slaughtered by this technology. My enlightened San Francisco audience loved seeing people burst apart when hit by laser beams. The effects are good, and you feel for the hero's plight, if not the aliens.<br/><br/>By the way, nothing about the aliens is ever explained. I don't need every last bit spelled out for me, but the film proceeds as if the aliens and humans have never communicated in 27 years. Yet they can understand each other's language. No one knows why the aliens are here, if we could help them leave or prosper, who had enslaved them, anything about other aliens, etc. It just makes no sense, and its lazy.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you want to see a confused gross-out ripoff of a few other sci-fi movies with a couple of good action scenes at the end, this is your flick.Watch for the score on this one to drop quickly once people older than 20 start to report in."

","If you were utterly disappointed that 1988's Alien Nation turned out to be a very uninspired buddy-cop movie about aliens who get high on Liquid Tide laundry detergent, then this is the movie you've been waiting for.<br/><br/>Actually, I've been waiting for a movie like District 9 for a long time: it's a gritty, realistic, and compelling science fiction blockbuster that addresses serious issues. It injects some much needed gravitas into the genre in the same manner The Dark Knight did for the superhero movie.<br/><br/>Rating this thoroughly thought-provoking and entertaining movie is tough. In many ways, District 9 is a better film than other new classics like Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Star Trek. However, it does have its flaws, and I'm not sure I am compelled to see it again immediately, as I was with those others. I don't feel like I missed any part of its message or action the first time - but that is more likely because it was so well directed, photographed, and presented than because it lacks depth.<br/><br/>I don't think District 9 deserves a perfect rating, but I can understand why anybody would put it on their list of all-time favorite films. I can't decide between 9 or 8, so I'll give it an 8 just to balance the number of 10s it has already received on IMDb.<br/><br/>After you've seen the film, come back and compare your list of positives and negatives with mine. Don't read any farther before you see the movie - it deserves to be seen unspoiled.<br/><br/>**** SPOILERS BELOW **** <br/><br/>Positive: The documentary style is very well done; it does not obscure or distract from the action in any way. Even those scenes that are clearly not meant to be from a tag-along cameraman's point of view have a documentary-like quality, but it is not really fair to call it shaky-cam. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield are way off base.<br/><br/>Negative: The stereotypical badness of both major ethnicities in this movie lacks subtlety, and makes you feel like you've been clubbed over the head with the movie's moral. The blacks were brutal, heartless, and primitive, while the whites were brutal, heartless, and well-organized. Is this the reality in Johannesburg? Is it OK to present things this way because both groups got their collective asses kicked by alien technology? <br/><br/>Positive: The alien effects are astonishing. This is a new high-water mark for the intermixing of computer animation and live action. The aliens themselves are a disgusting-looking mix of insectoid and humanoid, but at least they aren't slimy.<br/><br/>Negative: Since the aliens are so creepy-looking, it is somewhat hard to believe that humans would interact with them so nonchalantly, and treat each one as just another warm body with a government issued ID number that needs to be managed by the welfare state.<br/><br/>Positive: Many sci-fi movies with pretensions to epic scope start on a global scale but quickly devolve into very localized, small-scale encounters in a few claustrophobic sets. District 9 flips this formula on its head: it intentionally focuses on one small area of land in a city most Americans know little about (Johannesburg). Yet the production values, wide camera angles, and frequent city shots make it feel much more epic in scope.<br/><br/>Negative: Even considering what I said above, the idea that the world's superpower nations would allow an entire race of aliens to be managed by the government of South Africa along with a private security corporation is preposterous (more preposterous than a spaceship full of aliens). Still, every film has to limit its scope somehow...<br/><br/>Positive: The alien weaponry is awesome. This movie out-transforms the Transformers, and out-terminates the Terminator. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>Neutral: The anthropomorphification of the aliens is a bit silly and applied inconsistently. Behind closed doors they have the same familial relationships as humans, and they know exactly how they should interact with the government, yet most of them come off as tire-chewing, hive-mentality insects. To be fair, this type of dichotomy is necessary to make any sci-fi aliens interesting, so I'll call it a neutral, not a negative.<br/><br/>Positive: Plenty of cool armored vehicles and helicopters. From MRAPs to Super Pumas to EcoStars, the fuel costs must have been a big part of the film's budget.<br/><br/>Biggest negative: The various and sundry other hard-to-accept premises peppered throughout the film, such as ""Wikus can intuitively operate alien weaponry and vehicles just because he has the necessary claw"", ""The prawns would allow themselves to be subjugated when there is so much alien weaponry still in working order lying around"", ""Nobody could find the mother ship command module for 20 years even though it is buried just below one of the shacks and there was video of where it fell"", and many, many more. The preponderance of absurdities - even after allowing for the ""fiction"" in science fiction - is the reason I could never rate this movie a 10.<br/><br/>Biggest positive: The transformation of Wikus from a sniveling, uncaring government bureaucrat to a self-sacrificing, heroic victim of inter-species prejudice elevates District 9 to a much, much higher level than that of ultimately meaningless films like Alien Nation and Independence Day. <br/><br/>Sure, the moral was telegraphed without subtlety throughout a significant portion of the film. Still, the penultimate scene, which reverted back to footage of the ""weakling"" Wikus fawning over a photo of his wife - forcing the audience to consider that his internal transformation was nearly as startling as his external transformation - was masterful film making and powerful, powerful stuff. <br/><br/>To Peter Jackson, I say: This totally makes up for what you did to King Kong! <br/><br/>And to Neill Blomkamp, I say: Bravo!"
"Murmur_Of_The_Bart","5","10","17","8 December 2009"," Nobody really knew what this place was
","It is rare that films have as much ambition or audacity as District 9. But it is even more rare that such ambition and audacity actually pays off, which is unfortunately shown once again with District 9. The set up of the film is told to us through interviews, documentary style; we learn that twenty years ago an alien ship came to a halt over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa and has not moved since. The aliens were eventually coaxed out of the ship and given places to live in a camp known as District 9. The camp is kept under extreme military surveillance in order to prevent the aliens from disrupting everyday human activity.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley plays Wikus Van De Merwe, a government employee recently put in charge of evicting the aliens from their homes in District 9 to a new, more secure camp. While giving out eviction notices, he discovers a mysterious canister that sprays a strange mist into his face. This sets off a mysterious chain of events that leads to Copley slowly transforming into an alien himself. The remainder of the film focuses on Copley's attempts to reverse the process before it is too late. But the film takes far too long to get to this point and is never absorbing nor do we get any insights into any of the characters. They are simply strangers that are experiencing horrible and extreme events. Copley is fairly strong, but because of the lack of depth of his character, we never completely come to care enough about what is happening to him.<br/><br/>The film tries to be far to many things at once; a mocumentary, a social commentary, the next sci-fi classic and a summer action flick, and none of them work, not by themselves and not together. The mocumentary technique comes and goes when it's convenient, sometimes within the same scene. This becomes particularly confusing when in one cut we are seeing footage from an acknowledged cameraman documenting the evictions, and in another, normal film footage. The film is clearly going for some social commentary, especially concerning Apartheid, but it handled in such a heavy handed and inauthentic way we never have an emotional response. The film has a couple moments with the aliens in which we feel we are seeing something truly unique. However, there isn't enough context, back-story, a sense of realism or mythology for this to join the ranks of the great sci-fi classics. And finally, when we get to the action sequences, they are underwhelming to say the least. Repetitious, excessively violent, and completely unabsorbing, the action sequences never come to their full potential.<br/><br/>There are moments when there is an incredibly raw, gritty and powerful feeling; a scene in which Merwe is being forced to shoot alien weaponry while being shocked with a cattle prod. But those scenes are completely overshadowed by the increasingly ridiculous and silly story. We get scene after scene of the same shooting, the same explosions and it simply gets boring fairly quickly. And something that has always bothered me in films, blood splattering on the lens happens over and over. This increasingly popular technique is unbelievably distracting and completely takes the viewer out of the story. It makes the audience so aware of the camera and the fact that we are watching a movie.<br/><br/>Although the set up of the film is interesting, and the effects are quite impressive considering the film's low budget, the film falls flat at almost every turn. Everyone in the film becomes extremes, and action movie cliché caricatures that are frankly laughable. There is even a moment when a character says ""I won't leave you behind,"" not exactly fresh dialogue, but the laughability (yes, I know it's not a word, just go with it) is basically hidden because the line is in subtitles.<br/><br/>I applaud Blomkamp for making such an ambitious and interesting film, but he has a long way to go before he can become a great director. The film shows some promise for Blomkamp and hopefully his next project can achieve what this film failed to do.<br/><br/>5/10"
"bramb600","9","10","17","31 August 2009"," A brilliant science fiction/action film.
","I had very strange expectations for this film. It was originally shown in the trailer to be a documentary or mockumentary. Generally, I don't see those types of movies but in this case it was a very interesting way to tell the story. It also looked like there was going to be a lot of shaky-cam which I feel got old after Cloverfield. There wasn't as much of that as I expected. Now the trailers gave very little information as far as the plot goes.<br/><br/>The story is basically about an alien spacecraft that lands in South Africa and after a few decades the people decide to send them away to a concentration camp known as District 9 because of their hostile behaviours. There's a lot more to the story, but that shouldn't be revealed before you see the film.<br/><br/>The main star of the film is a complete unknown. Sharlto Copley from South Africa. I don't think it matters that District 9 has no major stars, these people are all South African and give great performances. It's directed by Neill Blomkamp who is a first time director and produced by Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>The reason I thought District 9 was an effective film was because it was going a different direction with the alien movie. In all alien themed movies in the past, the aliens have been the enemies. In District 9, we are the enemies. I refused to believe that I would actually be rooting for the aliens in this movie, but District 9 achieved it. In my theater, there was applause when a group of aliens ripped a human apart. That's another thing. It's actually a surprisingly gory movie. It's not too bad but it could be quite bloody at times and you should be aware of that.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing on this film. It's hard to believe that they made the aliens look completely realistic on a 30 million budget. That was just incredible.<br/><br/>My major complaint with the movie was that the first half hour was strictly a documentary and then after that it suddenly becomes more about the characters. It's too sudden when the documentary ends and it changes the tone because I was really enjoying the documentary. Also in a way, I'm glad it ended because it became it became a very entertaining action movie at that point.<br/><br/>To conclude my review, I think you should see District 9. It's definitely the best summer blockbuster because it even has a few things to say about xenophobia and racism. I saw it twice, but I don't think it's necessary, once is enough to absorb all the information in the movie. Although, the final shot of the film completely flew over my head both times, but once I figured it out, the movie was so much better in my mind. I give District 9 a 9/10."

","In 1982 a spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find an alien population of ""Prawns"" and put them in a concentration camp called District 9. After 20 years, the local population has had enough of the aliens and plan to relocate the aliens to a location far away. Wikus van der Merwe is a meek bureaucrat who is given charge to organize the relocation plan by private corporation MNU. District 9 has become a vast lawless place with alien technologies. While rounding up the Prawns and getting signatures on paperwork, Wikus is infected with something that is slowly morphing him into the alien.<br/><br/>What an amazing debut effort from director/writer Neill Blomkamp. It is richly original and so very human. It uses the documentary style to elevate its realism. The CGI Prawns are brilliantly grotesque without being a ridiculous horror. Wikus is such a wonderful comedic character. It is a scathing indictment of the treatment of the disenfranchised. The movie works on so many different levels. It is audacious beyond anything a big Hollywood blockbuster should be."

Seeing this in theaters would have made it that much better.<br/><br/>At first, I was expected a good action and thriller movie, which I got, but I also got a lot more: a good story, great characters, and an intriguing idea. I could have just settled for an average action movie with no plot, but I'm glad the director chose to do a lot more than that.<br/><br/>He changed our opinion on the ""prawns"" from disgusting to sympathetic. Even with the excessive use of the ""f"" bomb, the main character was also one to watch, as he made us change our mind.<br/><br/>There were many suspenseful moments, making the movie even more amazing. I couldn't wait for the ending, yet I could. Speaking of the end, it left me hanging, wishing for a sequel that I could watch. Except for the fact that it's been awhile with no sequel. The director said he wants to make several more movies before even considering going back to this one.<br/><br/>In the end, the cursing and some errors did not stop me from giving this movie a well deserved ten.

","A not-so-subtle science fiction parable on South African apartheid infusing stranded aliens known as the derogatory ""prawns"" trying to get home. I'm no fan of science fiction and I do not think I'd call the genre beautiful, but District 9 defies the genre in that way. It embodies horror, comedy, drama, and romance under this science fiction saga. <br/><br/>Blomkamp crafts a brilliant story and manipulates its viewer throughout the film. At first, these prawns look like animals and are almost revolting to look at. Yet, at the end of the film they become human, both in their actions and in their physical appearance. No longer do they look repulsive at sight. Furthermore, while the apartheid theme is not subtle at all, the viewer still realizes the horror of the movement. <br/><br/>The journey, presented wonderfully as a documentary, of Wikus Van de Merwe, our main character, is though provoking and thrilling (and Copely portrays his struggle perfectly). The visuals are incredible as well, and unfairly overshadowed by those of Avatar, considering the $30 million budget."

","We've all seen sci-fi films and stories before, where aliens come to Earth and lay down their dominance through superior technology and intellect. But in the case of District 9, we have something else entirely; it's a rough and brutal film, where aliens are not as the sleek, powerful, awe-inspiring beings from heaven. Instead, these aliens are wretched, and humans treat them like dirt. Therein lies the strength and power of the film; it serves to showcase modern issues concerning refugee camps, shanty-towns, and social corruption, while simultaneously demonizing humanity. With themes like these, District 9 proves to be a truly unique, sobering, and thought-provoking experience.<br/><br/>The film's first half is purely rough documentary-style, with interviews and news footage cut in throughout. Then the second half resembles an actual film with lots of action (and some very gnarly violence). The movie runs at an even pace, and it is consistently entertaining throughout. It does a great job of using the mock interviews and footage to introduce the concepts and all the background information, before progressing into an intense and explosive climax. In spite of this, the plot is well-structured.<br/><br/>Within this framework, the story is quite decent. It starts off a little random, but the film sharpens its focus as it goes on, building a solid narrative from its characters. The characters aren't particularly likable, but they serve to reinforce the stark themes concerning corruption. It gets very interesting to see the main character mutate into one of the ""Prawns,"" practically forcing him to feel the aliens' plight. In this manner, the audience also comes to feel the plight of District 9. These themes and allegories aren't particularly subtle, but they are noble.<br/><br/>Photography is solid half of the time and pretty shaky at other times; it's good all around, and there are plenty of invoking images. Acting and writing are not bad. Production design features some great sets, props, costumes, creature effects, vehicles, and weapons. Music is decent too.<br/><br/>District 9 is one of the most uncompromising sci-fi pictures to date; it's an ugly film that forces us to behold the ugliness of the slums, and the inhumanity of just sweeping it all under the rug for a profit. The gnarly settings, bloody violence, and rough footage may not sit well with many viewers, but if you can handle it, it's a must-see.<br/><br/>Recommended! 5/5 (Experience: Perfect <> Story: Very Good <> Film: Very Good)"
"poolandrews","6","5","7","5 June 2012"," Surprisingly quite good.
","District 9 is set in Johannesburg in South Africa where a huge alien mother ship hovers above the city, after entering the ship which seems unable to leave a million alien creatures are discovered & brought down to Earth & kept in a slum like area known as District 9. Human feeling against the aliens which become nicknamed Prawns grow in the city & the Government hire an outside security company named MNU, or the Multi National United, to evict the alien Prawns & move them outside the city limits away from the human population into another slum like camp. The sheepish Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Coley) is put in charge of the operation, while trying to move some Prawns from their shack Wikus is sprayed in the face by some black fluid hidden by the Prawns & soon begins to undergo a change, his arm starts to turn into an alien claw & his whole DNA structure begins to change. The men in power want Wikus because he can operate the alien weaponry which relies on alien DNA to activate it but the aliens want the fluid back so they can go back home while all Wikus wants to be be human again...<br/><br/>This American, New Zealand, Canadian & South African co-production was co-written & directed by Neill Blomkamp & was a big success when it was released, a somewhat surprise success too since District 9 as has already been said is the complete opposite of what Hollywood suits appear to think what is required to be successful. The fact that it has no big names, it has no-one attached with any proved track record, it has a first time director, a leading actor who has never been in a full length film before, it is set completely outside the US with all the actor's speaking in foreign accents & it deals with moral issues in a thoughtful yet still entertaining way. The simple fact that District 9 is a good film probably had a lot to do with it though, & to be fair I think it is although it's maybe not the classic that some make it out to be. From the big budget sci-fi action blockbuster angle there's plenty of aliens, explosions, fights & action to satisfy that section of the audience although it's not perfect like if that alien could operate the mother ship at the end why couldn't it at the start before they were all placed in District 9? How could it have kept that spaceship concealed under his shack? Where did all the alien weapons come from? The alien don't seem particularly intelligent enough to have created all that technology so where did it come from? However District 9 has obvious parallels to real world events, in fact writer & director Blomkamp has said that District 9 was inspired by his time in South Africa during apartheid & you can easily replace the alien Prawns with many ethnic minorities now that face persecution in certain parts of the world & the script does a good job of making the situation & events as they unfold seem fairly believable & credible. At just under two hours long the film flew by & I was quite emerged in the story.<br/><br/>Filmed in large parts like a documentary complete with interviews & such District 9 has a sort of new report feel to it, luckily Blomkamp decides to keep the shaky hand-held camcorder crap to a minimum & you can always tells what's going on. Add that to security camera style footage & additional Hollywood set-pieces & District 9 has a unique yet natural feel to ti that works surprisingly well & is never too distracting. The CGI computer effects are very good actually, from the aliens themselves to the huge mother ship constantly hovering above the city to the robotic suit that Wikus wear at the end. A full length feature film remake of the Niell Blomkamp short Alive in Joburg (2006).<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this had decent money spent on it & I though it was a lower budgeted independent film rather than a big studio one. Actually film in Johannesburg in South Africa. Although District 9 was nominated for four Oscars back in 2010 it didn't win any of them. The acting is very good from all involved.<br/><br/>District 9 is a great sci-fi action thriller with obvious real life political & social parallels & while it's not perfect it's a good way to pass a couple of hours. Better than I had expected for sure."
"giles-hearn","6","5","7","5 September 2009"," Not bad, but not a masterpiece
","If you prefer ""intelligent"" Sci-Fi (2001, Blade Runner, Moon etc.) then this isn't going to push all your buttons. It's more akin to the fast-paced, action and FX-heavy movies like Transformers, the latest Terminator movies and J.J Abrams' Star Trek.<br/><br/>So why all the hype? One reason might be the cinematography. It's extremely effective; set against the dusty Johannesburg backdrop of ghettos and garbage, one can almost feel the heat and smell the decay. Another reason might be the originality. Despite the heavy nod to Alien Nation, the idea of a segregated society of aliens living in human-imposed exile, while their seemingly broken-down mother-ship hangs uselessly above the city, is presented in a novel and darkly humorous way. And, finally, the CGI is the best I've seen. There's so much to like here, in a Cloverfield kind of way.<br/><br/>But there's also so much missing. While the lead character is well developed and the acting solid throughout, there's a real lack of support from everyone else. It's pretty much a one man show. The shaky, hand-held camera work in the first reel becomes tedious and unnecessary. The editing in places is surprisingly abrupt and the whole film suffers from 'political metaphor overload'.<br/><br/>Had the pace been slower at the start of the film to allow the supporting characters to establish themselves and the alien back story given a chance to breathe, the frantic final third would have been more in balance.<br/><br/>But life isn't perfect and Sci-Fi is a difficult genre to get exactly right. Striking the balance between slow, introspective intelligence and explosive CGI action has eluded all but the best directors; lessons can be learned from Spielberg, Lucas and Scott. But, such movies are rare - so ""District 9"" gives us something to watch while we wait for the next 'classic' to come along."

","When aliens invade the city of Johannesburg the people start to get uneasy. The humans waited for 2 decades for something big to happen, but nothing ever did, this making the humans racist against the things they do not understand. The aliens, or ""Prawns"" as the humans referred them as were subjects of District 9, a slum of the city. Wikus, a field agent for MNU, gets exposed to alien DNA that starts to change him into something he despises. This makes him one of the most hunted people and it leaves him with no one left, except for Christopher, a ""prawn"".<br/><br/>In District 9, there are also Nigerians who want to take advantage of the aliens. They want lots of money for food and weapons. The Nigerians also hurt and kill the aliens for their body parts. The humans outside of district 9 want nothing to do with the aliens, so if they come into contact they want to fight with them and they yell at the aliens. MNU sends their agents, including Wikus, who is the head of the operation, to evict the aliens into an even smaller ""camp."" The humans believe the aliens to be feeling less wastes that aren't as smart as one would think, when the aliens really do have feelings and they are smart.<br/><br/>I believe District 9 could be compared to a Nazi movie. It is almost as if MNU is Hitler and the aliens are the Jewish people, who MNU tries to seclude or kill. This movie uses great effects from the great dialog to the lighting and the colors. There were many colors used throughout the movie, from the sun rising and falling, to the colors on the aliens' bodies. The dialog was strong in this movie; there was a lot of emotion shown throughout the movie through the things they said. All of these elements reflect on the racism in some way or another.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the action to me is strong, the character of Wikus was very convincing, from the start when it seemed he had some respect for the aliens, to the middle when he wanted nothing to do and hated everyone, lastly to the end when it seemed he understood and befriended the aliens.

And in demanding that, it does color some of that world with a broad brush that undeniably leaves those infamous ""plot holes"": though in fairness, many of them are simply the result of the immensity of the backstory, and will linger because the storyline works, and your imagination has been piqued.<br/><br/>So you'll have to get passed the validity of the criticisms.

"yfguitarist","4","41","90","17 August 2009"," An over-hyped, manipulative, and clichéd wasted opportunity
","Over-hyped, overrated, badly written, badly shot, badly acted, and badly directed. The writing is manipulative, clichéd, and relies on dues ex machina and coincidence. The first 20 minutes is ""documentary"" footage and interviews, which starts off interestingly with thought- provoking social commentary, even though the shaky camera-work is very annoying (it doesn't improve). What could've been a compelling and intelligent science fiction classic turns into a dumb, ridiculous, laughable action flick that has plenty of crowd-pleasing mayhem. Once the action starts and the MacGuffin is introduced the social commentary is thrown out the window and becomes generic and stereotypical. The action is done well, though. It's entertaining, gory, and satisfying. This is pure nerd-fantasy, with cool weapons, tough guy shouting, and a kickass robot suit. In an effort to obtain realism apparently, none of the actors are recognizable. This could've worked if they hadn't have been terrible (except for the lead). The characters are shallow and one-dimensional. The antihero is entirely unlikeable which makes for low suspense because you don't care if he lives or dies. The only sympathetic characters are (predictably) the aliens, who are more human than the humans. I was hoping they ended up destroying all humans. The story is somewhat unpredictable and original, so it deserves credit for that. But don't expect a masterpiece like the critics and fans are raving about."

I LOVE sci-fi movies but this one absolutely stinks, the ending is anti climatic , ugh i cant say enough how bad it is. The visuals are somewhat nice but are no better than the original you-tube video. The story is extremely under developed, they start to explain everything but stop halfway, its is filmed documentary style but who has a camcorder on an alien spaceship or a warlords tent in the slums of Africa???

"jack-115-853599","10","6","9","22 August 2013"," Very Disturbing But Some of the Best Science Fiction I Have Ever Seen!!!
","District 9, science-fiction at its absolute BEST, revolves around the attempts to relocate aliens, currently living in slum conditions in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a more suitable place - living alongside humans has obviously deteriorated. A bureaucrat, Wikus, appointed by his father-in-law, is tapped to lead the relocation efforts. Unfortunately, in the process, he becomes infected with the DNA of the aliens. (oh you KNOW the South African government has been performing ""tests"" to study the aliens!) Of course, Wikus will eventually turn into one of the aliens and the government wants/needs to ""harvest"" his body parts all, of course, for the sake of science.<br/><br/>The movie is intense, gritty, and disgusting. It pretty much evokes the same emotions in the viewer which is where the power of the movie lies. It takes the viewer on a VERY uncomfortable review of one's own biases/prejudices/apprehensions. In the beginning I was horrified watching the amount of firepower humans enlisted to implement the relocation policy thus making me dislike Wikus almost immediately - especially since he benefited (for lack of a better word) solely because of nepotism. I was immediately moved to support the aliens but, GEEZ, they're so ugly!!! Then Wikus becomes infected, becoming of intense interest to the South African scientific community, and becomes the hunted rather than the hunter. Now Wikus is as sympathetic as the aliens and thank god, not NEARLY so ugly.<br/><br/>It was INDEED startling to be reduced to making assumptions about someone SOLELY on the basis of how they looked. The aliens here are quite intelligent. Moreover, they only want to get back to their own planet and have no ill-will toward humans, unless, of course, provoked. So in most cases they do NOT deserve the inhuman (no pun intended) treatment they are often subjected to.<br/><br/>Their just god-awful ugly!! And it is disconcerting to have to admit AND deal with this. Compound this with a language barrier and we find ourselves looking at some veeeeeeeeeery similar situations we find ourselves in in our everyday lives.<br/><br/>The special effects are mind-boggling and the interactions between aliens and humans recalls social conditions we are all entirely too familiar with. Yes, it uncomfortably evokes the reasonings behind immigration, integration, segregation, minorities, cultures/situations we are unfamiliar with, and forces us to take an historical perspective of just how well (or how badly) we have dealt with similar situations.<br/><br/>The movie is fast-paced, action-packed, gross, poignant, revolting, and THOROUGHLY entertaining. It is reminiscent of the best that the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits had to offer and quite frankly, trying to categorize the movie not only is difficult but ultimately unfair.<br/><br/>Hands down - one of the BEST movies of ANY genre I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Oooooooh yeah.....I INDEED recommend!"

","A sensational and monumental genre-bending film that does everything right, throwing all the Sci Fi stereotypes out the window and keeps the plot smart and thrilling. The design of the ships and prawns are all very original and creative. District 9 also features themes that are horrifyingly familiar but are dealt with in new and inventive ways. Featuring a breakout performance from powerhouse Sharlto Copley, phenomenal CGI and an amazing sense of realism, District 9 is an unrivaled slice of brilliance and originality. It's one of my favorite films of all time, because it dares to do something truly unique and succeeds incredibly well at everything it sets out to do. An Incredible film."
"itamarscomix","7","6","9","23 September 2011"," Could have been better
","Like many other sci-fi films before, District 9 starts with a fascinating premise and great story and concept, that unfortunately are only enough to hold about thirty or forty minutes of film. A sci-fi mockumentary is a great idea and for the first half hour it holds great. Then, sadly, District 9 turns into a pretty standard sci-fi/action affair with a pretty standard story arc about an anti-hero who starts out as a villain, then learns the error of his ways and goes through a process of redemption. Really not much to write home about. Still - the story is more original than that of Avatar, and even the action scenes are more well-paced. It's just a shame that it could have been a great film and instead it's just okay."
"tomsan84","3","22","45","10 September 2009"," Lets start with the Good
","I can, somewhat, understand the high rating of this movie. Its action packed, takes you along from the start and keeps you with it the entire movie. I definitely like the documentary/news style filming. The cuts to normal camera work are smoothly done, and the non-static camera work contributes greatly. <br/><br/>Being a relatively low budget movie I think the use of CGI is great. Its not superb, but definitely good enough. The acting is pretty good also, with a touch of surreality/absurdness in it (ie the parents and stuff).<br/><br/>While that's all great and stuff, imo the story itself is the most important. making an action movie gets you so far, its the story line that needs to make sense.<br/><br/>and in that this movie definitely fails. There are many...MANY.. smaller plot holes, which are sometimes forgivable, but not in these numbers. And there are large plot holes which aren't forgivable at all. To be fair, its like a story of a 7 y old totally awesome, but totally lacking consistency. <br/><br/>****spoiler warning*****<br/><br/>Lets just name a few obvious ones;<br/><br/>alien ship hangs there for 3 years (I forgot I thought 3). apparently the aliens cant get out and need to be saved by the humans. No explanation as to why, but a sentence is given 'leaders all died' oh oke! how many were there?<br/><br/>Aliens are like redneck hillbillies? there are a lot of them but all expect once seems to have any intelligence. Still they are pretty human like with human emotions and such.<br/><br/>They are a bit aggressive, but not really hostile, yet they have a lot of big guns. Which they trade for crap with gangsters. Oke so the aliens are not really taken care of and gangsters come in and sort of control the alien population. Very unreal situation!<br/><br/>one alien is smart though and even seems sophisticated. he spends 20 years looking for some stuff. He could find that while in the mothership? I seriously have to believe he had to spend 20 years roaming a dump for an uncertain amount of black mutagen/gasoline?<br/><br/>That stuff is pretty awesome, if inhaled by another species it will turn him into an alien, but if put in a ship its star travel material baby... ridiculous.<br/><br/>when Wikus mutates the hospital is immediately evacuated, yet in the research center they touch him without protection, and force him to do all kinds of stuff. I don't know why really.<br/><br/>apparently human hookers have sex with the aliens.. Jesus Christ.. really? you could let that part out? its totally uncalled for and doesn't fit the movie at all, but it gets worse they try to f***k wikus over by saying he had sex with them too. Such a lame part of the movie very childish. <br/><br/>back to the smart roach; so the world gets tired of them, but people and roaches can to some extend speak to each other (atleast some). So there was no possibility that the humans could help them out, you know by trying to help find the black stuff.. no that all needs to be very secret. Its slightly backed by the EVIL BIG CORPORATION which has a hit team with a very evil hunter leader (cliche at its best).<br/><br/>The part where wikus enters the robot is weird to me to. So he fits the suit oke, but this mega tech units has emotions and feelings?? did 'they' want to add somewhat more drama to the movie, like there wasn't enough? the whole movie was packed with drama but they topped it with the robot scene. every time he was hit wikus moaned and seemed to be hurt. the robots movements where human like and also seemed to express feelings... it even barfed (black stuff!¿). But wikus, suddenly turning into rambo, kept the robot up because of his powerful mind. its not that the machine broke down, no when wikus's spirit broke the robot broke... at least that is how it looked to me. <br/><br/>also when wikus heard that the fixing of would took 3 years he just decided to knock out the only one who could possibly help him at a very crucial moment.. why is that? seriously dumbest decision ever. But miraculously enough he is able to fly an alien plain anyways. almost as miraculous as the roach being able to survive intense crossfire defending with a small metal plate. <br/><br/>another failing moment imo is when the roach is in the lab (the suicide mission that goes extremely easy) he is flabbergasted when he sees a dead alien.. uhm I don't know, I see aliens being killed and harassed all the time, that really blowed your mind? btw how come wikus had passage to that room? he wasn't really in the position for that, he never seen it before.<br/><br/>well I got a little carried away with this comment, I'll stop here but I assure you I can come up with many more weak sport in the movie. The fact is, the story is so weak its like seems made up by a child. an excited one that makes up stuff along the way.<br/><br/>Well if you managed to read all this you probably know I am not liking this movie, yet it wasn't hard to sit it out. The constant action keeps you drawn. I wont recommend it, but if one wants to see it I wont try to withhold you either.<br/><br/>poor movie with great camera work and good acting, but with one of the weakest story lines I've seen so far."
"domadilla","7","16","31","6 September 2009"," Noteworthy attempt at something different but still left seeking asylum
","I watched District 9 last night in a brimming auditorium in London on the second night of its general release and to be totally honest the audience reaction was mixed. I speculate about half the attendees went home satisfied - these would have been science fiction fans mainly but anyone who has a taste for the alternative will certainly have got a kick out of it (I categorize myself as the latter).<br/><br/>In my humble opinion District 9 is a solid attempt to create an original sci-fi film and it deserves credit for approaching a somewhat stale 'Alien Invasion' genre and inoculating it with some innovative ideas.<br/><br/>District 9 is not without its faults however, and there are more than a few. In my opinion the film falls down in a few key areas...<br/><br/>1) Narrative/direction: This is not consistent throughout the film i.e. the style of storytelling alters as the film progresses but this is not done in a smooth or convincing manner and does more to confound than impress. To elucidate on one annoyance - part of the film is shot with shoddy hand-held cameras and then suddenly it switches to standard camera type.<br/><br/>2) Plot: Laden with holes to be honest! OK so I don't expect any sci-fi film to be backed up by rigorous science or even governed by moderate rationality. But there is only so much you can expect the average audience member to buy... There are several inexplicable plot holes in the film. For instance, the earth-bound aliens appear to harbour highly advanced weaponry, which for some bizarre reason they choose not utilise. Instead they accept their impoverished circumstances and choose to trade their over-sized weaponry for cat food. Meanwhile the alien mother ship has been hovering above Johannesburg for 20 years, languishing in wait, seemingly unperturbed by either alien or human intervention - this is a ridiculous scenario if you stop and think about it. There would be a global response to alien invasion and there would no doubt be hordes of scientists up there investigating it.<br/><br/>3) Acting: The protagonist, Vikus, is highly entertaining and I'm not criticizing his performance at all by mentioning the acting. The rest of the cast were quite woeful. Sometimes I agree that its good to get fresh faces onto the big screen but in all honesty I think a lot of the actors in this film were promoted above their station - This probably has something to do with trying to use a 100% South African cast.<br/><br/>Apart from the distended asides this film really is worth watching if you fancy a turn away from the polished but predictable and usually tame Hollywood efforts at science fiction.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I remember being in South Africa when this happened about 10 years ago. I'm very happy that someone finally decided to make a movie about this actually. It was all over the news, all anyone could talk about for a long long time. The movie itself is really great, but I must admit that it fails to completely cover everything that went down there. I guess that's the way it is in show business, take out the boring stuff and add some creative editing (*cough* additions *cough*) to the story to make it interesting. I would advise people to go and enjoy the movie, but if you're interested in what really happened try to read up on it using the internet or go to the library."
"rtbr222","8","12","22","26 August 2009"," Reviews May Be Slightly Overboard
","Because of my natural skepticism towards modern sci-fi movies, I went into this movie expecting SOME disappointment. I have to admit, I wasn't nearly as disappointed as I expected. However, I've read over a dozen reviews heralding this movie as one of the greatest the viewer has ever seen, and I just can't agree with that.<br/><br/>While I agree the movie offers a unique setting (something other than post-apocalypse USA or a futuristic NYC), it doesn't offer nearly as much insight or commentary into racism and class structures as I had been told it did. Typically when a sci-fi movie lacks special affects due to budget constraints, more effort will be spent on an engaging plot. Although compelling, the plot lacked what I think would make it a great sci-fi movie; a message.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's tons of fun and very fresh. I love that this is one of the first movies that shows humans welcoming aliens to earth (albeit their attitudes changed quickly) and attempting to co-exist. I also enjoyed the human-like characteristics of the aliens. The story seems to suggest that in a slum-like environment, all species react the same way...leaderless anarchy, broken family structures (few exceptions), violence, gangs, crime, and drug abuse (cat food).<br/><br/>Despite how much I enjoyed the movie, I feel like critics that enjoyed this movie have gone way overboard. It was definitely entertaining and left SOME room for reflection, but on the whole, the movie must be taken for face value."

Shot in a type of first person, home movie style, with occasional security cameras thrown in for  effect? ... (I hesitate because the ""effect"" was lost on me.) <br/><br/>The story had potential,but it fails to deliver the goods. It substitutes cheap special effects, gratuitous violence and gore in place of intelligent writing. It substitutes faux home movie/cheap documentary ""styling"" for actual cinematography.<br/><br/>And it fails to wrap up the story, leaving no doubt that there will be a ""District 10"", even if it were to go direct to home video (which it won't, but it should no it should be scrapped and District 9 should be recalled and placed in the hands of capable writers and directors, in a perfect world!).<br/><br/>The dialog consists mostly of an expletive repeated ad infinitum. Perhaps the writers are shooting for the record on the number of times the f-bomb has been dropped in a movie? There was a man snoring in the theater.

Things get really scary really quickly for Wikus as he is captured by the MNU and is begun to be experimented upon, he escapes and returns to District 9 in hiding from the MNU.

","The best thing about ""District 9"" are obviously the special effects. They are VERY impressive and help you forget that your just watching a movie. The idea for this movie isn't exactly new (""Alien nation"" from the 80's was first) , but still makes for an interesting and quite original movie . The action scenes are done well and entertaining. The acting is decent.<br/><br/>The movie is obvious allegory for apartheid /racism. We see peoples lack of empathy , ignorance and sometimes pure cruelty (the scene with burning house with alien eggs). It's even quite frightening to see black people being hostile towards aliens. The vision of humanity's reaction to aliens is pessimistic , but unfortunately realistic one. This is no ""Independence day"" or ""Close encounters of third kind"". The movie works best when it concentrates on human's nature. It's too bad that ""District 9"" very quickly concentrates on special effects and action. It too easily becomes another ""innocent man on the run"" movie , only with aliens. More depth , less action please.<br/><br/>The screenplay is rather mediocre. The story is really simple and after 5 minutes you can easily guess what will happen and who will be important. The characters are terribly thin . The main hero is one-dimensional unlikable asshole . His change of heart isn't one bit convincing. We have also awfully cliché characters like evil father in law , evil soldier/mercenary (who is strong and stupid) or evil gang lord. Even the main alien characters are lame – kid alien is basically a sweet child , while the big alien is 100% boy scout.<br/><br/>What is worse there is some stupidity here . The main hero doesn't seem to understand what ""hiding in plain sight"" means and is acting VERY irresponsible . Anybody with half of brain wouldn't make the same stupid mistakes he did. There is also one quite big plot hole involving entering the city.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is quite good movie , but overrated. The idea begs for something more complicated than simple action movie. It begs for something like ""Blade runner"" or ""Brazil"". The authors of this movie had good idea , but in my opinion they wasted it a little bit. It's a good movie , but could have been a LOT better. I give it 7/10."

Although ""District 9"" has an excellent story line and a lot of potential to be a good movie, someone twisted this movie into yet another profanity infused gore bath that seem to be become ""all the rage"". The positives of ""District 9"" were that it put a new spin on ""aliens"" which have a history of invading Earth and graphically eating people. In ""District 9"" the aliens (called Prawns in a derogatory manor) are portrayed as almost human despite their outward appearance. They have feelings and are intelligent, have their own way of behaving and for the most part get along with humans. That's about were the goodness stops. After the introduction of the movie is past, the blood, gore, and profanity is kicked into a gear so high, the only other movie I know of that used it was the latest ""Rambo"" flick. The excessive violence is unnecessary and not entertaining in the least. The movie didn't need it, and would have been much better without it. I would have even been OK with it if they didn't have a shower of blood and gore fly all over the camera lens every time a person was ""popped"".<br/><br/>The swearing is also unnecessary and detracts from the movie as a whole. I give this turd of a film **** stars (out of ten). I don't recommend it at all unless you have a fetish with blood and enjoy hearing the f-word repeated over and over countless times. I have no idea who would give this movie more than 6 stars, but hey that's just my opinion. However, I have no doubt that this film will leave most of you with an expression on your face of, ""Why the heck did I just waste an hour and 45 minutes on this?"" and the question in your mind of, ""Did I just watch an epic battle scene or an alien warbot taking a shower in ketchup?"""

In short, he's marked for death. ...But when something bad does happen to him the movie's logic goes off the rails and melts into a steaming pile of a cheap Chuck Norris action flick where rifles blaze, grenades explode, and there's no motive to any of it other than just to blow sh*t up for the twelve year old kids in the audience.<br/><br/>Question. If you were making an allegory about Apartheid why would your clueless, selfish, white guy racist jailer be the hero and liberator of the oppressed black people? I should think that in the 21st century old ideas about the White Man's Burden is more than just offensive; it's also a tired cliché. The jailer bureaucrat's only motive seems selfish: he just wants to go back to his old self.""<br/><br/>He couldn't have said it any better... The film's noble attempt at political critique of neoliberalism/neoconservatism (privatization of militaries, the administration/bureaucratization of populations, refugee politics, interventions, multinational corporations, etc.) is directly REPLICATED through the racist representations of Africans and by sustaining (for no reason) our identification with a white racist bureaucrat. This critique is then completely lost when the transformers-style Hollywood action takes over.<br/><br/>If you could take the three aspects of the film and divide them up into: -Socio-political critique -Hollywood Action -Hollywood Racism Then the film would be successful in each of its prospective parts.<br/><br/>But it didn't.<br/><br/>And it turned out to be pure garbage of the worst kind."

","I am into almost all movies, but this one was the worst I have ever seen. It was Dark, Gory, had too fast camera shots, and a documentary mode. It would have been better without a documentary mode and didn't have bad camera shots and more of a movie look. Most of all that made me hate it is there is no character to like; they are all mean.<br/><br/>This movie wait sorry not movie fake documentary was so bad I had to make an account to say how bad it was.<br/><br/>I first wanted to watch this thinking it would be like Independence Day or 28 Weeks Later something with that feel, but I got a piece of junk that I needed to leave the movie theater. I gave it more than I wanted too, I sat in the movies for 35 min or so thinking it would get better but got worst. The first few min I thought it would be a bad movie."

","I doubt whether Peter Jackson or his cohorts will ever read this, but this is aimed at them.<br/><br/>I am thinking that you wanted to make a socio/economic film that incorporated alien existence rather than the other way round. You make that fairly obvious in the introduction emphasising Johannesburg 1982 as the setting for the alien ship's berth, not Manhattan, Washington or Chicago. Good, no Hollywood ""Escape from New York"" shenanigans here, just a novel idea of placing a put upon minority within a put upon majority. Stand back and watch the results. Even better, the loathing of the long-term slum dwellers towards the new intruders is clearly brought out. What a brilliant premise with which to explore how a manipulative minority power over a course of time wields its authority via the divide and rule approach.<br/><br/>From there on you badly got it wrong. First, you ignored the 26 years of history between 1982 and 2008. South Africa has not changed, Nelson Mandela never existed. By 2008 don't you think that a task-force engaged to interact with the aliens would not be led by remnants of the old apartheid regime? Also, why not develop the context of hate between the 2 oppressed populations? Having to share the same limited resources, having to live together cheek by jowl could have been a perfect scenario for exploration of forging relationships by necessity despite mutual distrust. Instead you give us forced removals where the only indigenous resistance is undertaken by a migrant group of Nigerians whose only virtue for doing so is greed and perceived benefits from eating the aliens they do not profit from.<br/><br/>Do you wonder why the film was banned in Nigeria? So I give you no credits for inventiveness and for continuing the status quo of the oppressed having their problems frame worked, analysed and dealt with externally. If you really wanted to be innovative why not have the alien ship hover over the West Bank and mix the aliens with the indigenous communities there? Now that would be inventive, and brave.<br/><br/>Lastly, to those who consider this film to be so good, how can the last third of it, which is a direct amalgam of Total Recall meeting Robocop ED 209 with Sigourney Weaver inside, excite any self-respecting film buff? One vote for the writer who thought of the term ""prawn"", it is a fitting summation of the whole project."

","This was on the positive side of science fiction for me, if only because not everything was extreme. There was no flawless babe, no effortless superhero nonsense. It was obvious that there were efforts to have some distinction.<br/><br/>But we are still stuck with your run of the mill evil megaweapons corporation with secret labs and thoroughly compliant technicians. An alien society that has superior technology but all of which looks like something we already have or have ""invented"" for our prior movies. A set of social and human commentaries that I encountered in pulps fifty years ago. And gosh, we must, must, must have anthropomorphic aliens, right? With nerdy, precocious kids?<br/><br/>The narrative stance was strange. It is cast in the form of an investigative journalism report about two years after the events. Much of it is clearly meant to be read as found or stolen footage from surveillance cameras. Some of the scenes which clearly cannot be, are still treated as if they were with annotations. Interwoven with this is conventional observation, though often with human or creature blood spattered on ""lenses."" I assumed that with Jackson's sponsorship, WETA would do its most amazing stuff. They did not. The compositing and creature animation is fine, but that WETA ethic of advanced spatial camera movement is gone. <br/><br/>Perhaps it was just too hard with all the production players. That's the usual barrier. But it may also have been the knowledge that too novel a camera would have messed with the faux documentary feel. <br/><br/>So we are left with holding tight to a few of the amplified strokes. The main character is true enough, ordinary and klutzy in a way that works. It would have been better for me if we had been given more than the trivial connections he has with his environment. The wife, father in law, coworkers are stereotypes albeit with a South Africa twist. The technology is highlighted, but never explored. There is a balance among mystery, novelty and comprehension that ""Alien"" got so right they defined that balance. A new balance is not justified here and I am left unsatisfied. <br/><br/>In particular: the heads up computer displays were pretty cool animations. But here was the place where we could have had some hints of organization, some coherence. This, I believe, if done well could have spawned a subculture of fans, like those who pore over plans of the Enterprise, or who map plot implications of Memento. What we get is what we have seen before and roughly promised from lumbering technology companies like MNU.<br/><br/>So like the hero, it is good enough, but it leaves us on Earth while the interesting promise sails away.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Maybe I was a bit put off by all the hype, but I found myself very disappointed in D9. I enjoyed the effects, and parts of the movie, but overall found it a big let down. There are way too many plot holes for me to ignore SPOILERS such as the fact that these aliens didn't land in some super-power nation and still were so easily contained and controlled, especially with all their superior weaponry. How??? Wikus and that other Alien very easily broke into a heavily guarded facility with a few of those weapons, but that same heavily guarded facility was able to police over 1.5 million of these creatures all with access to the same weapons? And I have a hard time believing they were on earth for 20 years and other countries from around the world hadn't become actively involved with them. But more importantly, these aliens would clearly do anything for that cat food and were totally persuadable, and yet the humans who are only concerned with using the alien's weapons and nothing else, haven't over the course of the last 20 years figured out a way to get a group of these aliens to act as soldiers in their interest? How about offering them some...cat food. The whole thing with Wikus changing slowly into an alien off of alien fuel seemed pretty far-fetched...especially since he was sprayed in the face but began to transform at his arm...why? And truthfully, the acting in the earlier non-alien scenes was fairly bad and the whole relationship thing at the end felt totally thrown in. Overall, a real let down."
"ilikeimdb","2","24","52","17 August 2009"," A misadventure of social sci-fi schlock
","I just saw this film with five other sci-fi buffs on Friday Aug 14, 2009. We all had the same opinion: Wildly overrated, absurd plot, over-the-top political PC message that gets garbled with the underlying and ultimately unimportant alien sci-fi plot line, and finally an overreaching script and director that focuses on short-term shock value and FX rather than the need to integrate plot lines in a new and innovative manner. So many scenes and concepts ""borrowed"" directly from other movies (space ship shots straight from Independence Day; transformation scenes from The Fly; vivisection footage from more than one Nazi war movie; robotics right from Transformers; building raids from Bourne Identity), etc.<br/><br/>The plot holes are huge: Alien weaponry that the aliens just don't want to use unless necessary? Aliens stranded in space except for one smart one...and why didn't that alien do something? Then why were there so many weapons on the ship in the first place? The unnecessarily inhuman treatment of the aliens in such an extreme way as to not make any sense whatsoever. The absurdity of the government's relocation asking the aliens to sign papers? I mean who thinks up this out-of-context ridiculousness? The entire weapons angle screamed of stereotyped 1984-think as though Neanderthals were in charge of everything and the unnecessary scene where the protagonist shoots an alien with one of their weapons (as though he should complain much) is there only, again, for the shock value.<br/><br/>Sorry, I can't give this movie points just for trying to shove a bunch of apartheid PC points down my throat in an incoherent and unconnected manner. Never did the movie highlight a coherent point of view or give any socio-economic insights as to the relationship between humans and the aliens that would provide adequate underpinnings for justifying their horrible over-the-top prejudicial treatment."

The gritty desperation of the ""prawn's"" (the aliens of the movie) situation stands out in quite the artistic fashion.<br/><br/>Now the bad: The humans of this movie were crazily stupid (i.e. the MNU soldiers goons walking up to high tech alien Mech machines that have demonstrated deadly unmatched fire power, shooting sub machine guns at them as if the fifty soldiers the mech killed a second earlier was just a fluke...).<br/><br/>The main character has some strong acting points in the first half of the film, but his moronic babbling acting in the second half just became annoying as he demonstrated time and time again his inability to use common sense (maybe it was the script...).<br/><br/>For some reason the aliens, were brilliant and physically more dominant than humans, and had amassed high tech weaponry, but were crazy scared and submissive to the humans...could not understand that one.<br/><br/>Basicilly: Character development and realism not in this movie...but boy does it look cool.

You didn't really care about any of the characters until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I did not like that the movie was narrated to me (in parts). If you have to tell me what's going on then it must be to complicated to enjoy.<br/><br/>Seemed like the same old alien stuff that I have seen over and over where they take aliens and dissect them to learn more about them and harness their weaponry. Wait for the DVD if you must see it.

","What kills this vastly overrated film from the start is that it is the most nonsensical plot I've ever seen in sci-fi cinema. What's more, it has the most hapless extraterrestrials ever seen on screen since those water-phobic melon-heads from ""Signs.""<br/><br/>The story is allegorical to mankind's cruelty: genocide, racism, and intolerance. But the aliens should have been smart enough to known that before the came to this backward little planet.<br/><br/>These masters of the universe live in shantytown slums and eat cat food, even though they brought far-future weapon technology with them. What demolishes credulity is that an alien species is advanced enough to travel light-years to Earth and then inexplicably gets stranded in South Africa of all places. In all of anthropology there has never been a case of an advanced society being subjugated by a less advanced society.<br/><br/>Their city-sized mothership, inspired by the film ""Independence Day,"" just hovers like it's out of gas. The Air Force does not even tow it to Area 51, despite the fact it clutters airspace for 20 years.<br/><br/>Even more bizarre, the aliens' ticket home relies on a pint of some inexplicable black liquid that also inexplicably turns humans into aliens. Gee, a floor wax and a desert topping too!<br/><br/>This is so outrageously nutty, that for the first 30 minutes I though it was some tongue-in-cheek parody, like ""RoboCop."" The plot just lunges along with lots of bullets and mayhem. The cinematography and editing is modeled after a Halo-style shoot-'em-up video game. Not doubt to hook younger viewers.<br/><br/>The aliens are very well done as CG characters, even if they look like the Terminix man's worst nightmare.

"doctorsmoothlove","4","13","26","30 September 2009"," The wrong media
","District 9 was directed by Neil Blomkamp who was originally going to direct an adaptation of Halo, the famous first person shooter video game franchise. District 9 isn't Halo, but it might as well have been. Blomkamp's film shares many storytelling elements with popular action videogames and shares their most severe weakness.<br/><br/>As many action or shooter gamers will admit, ""gameplay is more important than story."" When someone is designing a video game in either of those genres, player interactivity must be given the most resources. Many times a story is literally attached for no other reason than giving players an excuse to find a new environment. This method is employed in District 9, and is permissible only in films with no aspiration for greatness. Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor or any of Takashii Miike's films is pure entertainment. No one really cares about the artistry or intelligence involved in their production, even if the films are creatively redundant. The video game genres I've mentioned can get away with this if environments are carefully constructed and players can interact with them in many ways. Story is emphasized in other genres.<br/><br/>District 9 fails to impress me because it takes an idea that would have been a great video game and reconstructs it into a media that doesn't suit it. The entire movie is an obvious allegory for Apartheid, with numerous scenes of intense bloody violence. What scant storytelling occurs is formally presented and then ignored. A District 9 video game could have slowly introduced us to the protagonist (an inspector of the non-human zone District 9), and included character development when ""tragedy"" befalls the protagonist. He actually partially transforms into an extraterrestrial and gains their ability to use machinery. It's very similar to Prototype. Later levels of this video game would permit players to control the extraterrestrial hero the protagonist befriends.<br/><br/>As a film, the idea doesn't work. Because the story is so brief, Blomkamp is forced to depict too many shootouts. They become boring after the first hour. Nifty camera angles, including a first person perspective, occasionally break the tedium, but serve to remind me of what this film should have been. Summer is over and now we are finally starting to see films which people put effort into creating. District 9 is one of these films yet it is so uncomfortable that it falls into the end-of-summer blockbuster category. To my knowledge there is not yet a video game time-in to this film and that's a shame. A Syphon Filter approach would have suited this story nicely. As a film, though, I delegate it to the rent-it-and-return category so many blockbusters find themselves after their theatrical release."
"just_imagine_89","Null","7","12","30 December 2009"," District 9
","In recent times, an original idea for a science-fiction movie is a rare thing. With little more than the endless rehashes of the classics and outrageous, over-elaborate nature-docs courtesy of M. Night Shyamalan to quieten our inner geek in 2008, it seemed the genre could be beginning to die out, leaving the comic-book hero sub-genre to hit its stride and take the helm for a while. However, with the throwback to classic sci-fi in the form of Moon, a brand new Star Trek movie, and the success of District 9 having since emerged, 2009 looks set to see an unprecedented resurgence in the genre.<br/><br/>In 1982, an alien spaceship arrived over Johannesberg, bringing one million alien lifeforms to earth with it. Leaderless and malnourished, the aliens were initially offered asylum, but were quickly overpowered and crowded into District 9, a segregated and highly-policed slum. After receiving public pressure, the Multi-National United Corporation are forced to relocate the aliens – dubbed 'prawns' due to their similar appearance – to a new camp further afield and we follow Wikus (Sharlto Copley) as he enters the town to hand out eviction notices. After encountering a mysterious black liquid in one of the shacks, he discovers his superiors' desire to examine him for use of alien technology and is forced to become a fugitive, befriending prawn Christopher Johnson along the way.<br/><br/>At first glance, District 9 is a straight-forward man on the run film, an updated version of North by Northwest or a hybrid form of Alien Nation/The Fly. On closer inspection however, it attempts to form an allegory for the events of 1970s Africa, combining the events of apartheid with an otherworldly spin for a modern western audience. When the visuals are good, they are outstanding. The state of the art special effects are simply beautiful, effortlessly merging the real with the unreal, and rooting the story within a world that will seem as real to a post-reality TV audience as anything you'll see in a documentary; posing the unsettling idea that this could all too likely happen. Its unique visual style is fast-paced and exciting, taking us along for the ride and delicately crafting every scene to enhance the story. Protagonist Wikus is a wonderful concoction of flawed personality and skewed moral judgement, with a driving force of panic and desperation still managing to capture the audience along with him.<br/><br/>While the film achieves in many areas, the first time director's success seems hit and miss at times. An engrossing documentary set-up introduces the film, only to be abandoned and picked up at various points, creating a jarring effect and hence losing a great sense of the realism it so painstakingly strives for. Thrilling, thought-provoking and oh so much fun, District 9 is nonetheless destined to become a sci-fi cult classic and, judging by Blomkamp's recent comments, a long and successful franchise. Although a flawed film in many ways, its sheer ambition cannot be faulted and the director seems to be one to watch in the future. The game has changed, playing with our expectations in an unwavering dedication to real world issues, and leaving us with the feeling that, in times of panic in the face of the unknown, we may just revert back to the mistakes of our past."

","Unlike many people, I was disappointed with this movie. The extended documentary-like opening (which, in many ways, ran through the whole movie) was too much. It might have served a purpose if it had been a brief way of introducing the basic story, but to film a movie largely in this fashion certainly detracted from the development of the main characters. You certainly feel sympathy for the aliens in general, and even for Wikus eventually, but it takes a while to develop that, which made this seem like little more than watching CNN coverage of a major news event. You watch to see what's happening, but you're not really drawn into the story. By the time the end came, although sympathy was developing for both Wikus and his new alien friend Christoper, the movie took on a certain comic-book feel as Wikus dons the alien suit and takes on the appearance of a sort of alien super-hero. It didn't work that well, and actually felt a bit silly.<br/><br/>There were aspects of the story, mind you, that would have been interesting had they been better developed. It was very interesting to see a movie depicting aliens arriving on earth not as evil conquerors but as pathetic refugees - and everything about them seemed pathetic, as they were forced to live in slum-like conditions in what was essentially an internment camp, denied any basic right, and having their needs exploited by the less savoury elements of South African society (where the movie was set) - although I found myself wondering why there was such a focus on ""Nigerian"" gangs? Why Nigeria? The movie effectively puts a new spin on the desperate plight of all refugees by making these refugees aliens. Still, the movie didn't really capture me. It was an interesting idea, but I didn't find it particularly well executed."
"LadyLiberty","9","10","19","16 August 2009"," District 9 More than Entertainment
","District 9 takes place in South Africa where an alien space ship suddenly appeared in the skies above Johannesburg almost thirty years ago. The aliens didn't attack nor did they offer technology or trade. In fact, there was little contact at all until humanity took the initiative. But first contact isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially not if you're an alien. Humans ""rescued"" the aliens from their ailing ship, but segregated them into a gigantic shantytown known as District 9 where they remain, monitored by a constant police presence.<br/><br/>Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for MNU, a corporation that oversees much of District 9 and engages in most of what the rest of the world sees as alien relations. MNU has ulterior motives, of course. It wants desperately to get some version of alien weapons technology up and running. In part because humans are fearful of the aliens, MNU undertakes to move the entire population from District 9 to a location well outside Johannesburg. Van De Merwe is put in charge of the relocation effort, and that's when things suddenly get complicated.<br/><br/>District 9 is presented as a documentary film. Some footage appears to come from news organizations while other snippets are apparently culled from security cameras. There's also video of various persons who are interviewed—of the anonymous ""man on the street"" variety, MNU employees, and friends and family of Van De Merwe—and their comments woven into the rest of the material. Though there are obviously some scenes that couldn't have come from the aforementioned sources, those are also skillfully edited into the plot line here and there. Taken as a whole, the delivery is striking to say the least.<br/><br/>Director Neill Blomkamp grew up in South Africa, and I suspect his intimate knowledge of the country during apartheid contributed greatly to District 9 (which is based on a 2005 short made by Blomkamp). Famed director Peter Jackson had originally tapped Blomkamp to direct a movie version of the video game, Halo. When that didn't pan out, Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever he liked. He expanded on his earlier idea, and co-wrote and directed District 9; Jackson is credited as a producer.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn that leading man Sharlto Copley hadn't acted before this, but I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, in a documentary-style film, he could probably get away with not being very good. The reality, however, is that Copley had to be far more than just another interviewee. He had to portray a variety of very strong emotions under a number of extraordinary circumstances. Copley wasn't adequate to the role. No, he was positively fantastic. I feared for him, I cheered for him, I loathed him, and frankly, I wept over him. He may not have acted before, but I sure hope he does again! <br/><br/>It's painful to type the word ""only"" in front of ""$30 million,"" but that kind of money for this kind of movie is a pittance. I fully expected mediocre special effects and other shortcuts which, in a film relying on at least some effects, could very well have resulted in dragging the movie down. Once again, I was delighted to see that Blomkamp (and Jackson's own WETA Workshop, which handled everything from special effects to props, and from vehicles to make-up effects) came through, and in a major way. The CGI (by Image Engine, a company in Vancouver, Canada where Blomkamp attended and graduated Vancouver Film School) is flawless, and the integration with live action is just terrific. I wasn't merely satisfied by the depiction of these aliens, I was awed. I never doubted for a moment that they were real.<br/><br/>From a somewhat lower tech standpoint, I loved the cinematography. Some scenes were filmed with hand-held cameras, and the jouncing and jiggling were perfect touches and added genuine realism. Other shots with broader scopes were awesome, beautiful, and horrifying by turns. I credit excellent direction combined with talented cinematographers, good editing, and some more of that superlative CGI work for the cohesive and dramatic end product.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: It's obvious I recommend District 9 to movie goers as a unique new action movie. But I must confess something else as well: When the movie was over and the audience making its way out, I was still in my seat. I sat there, alone, in the dark, weeping. I've talked about movies before as ""entertaining"" or ""exciting,"" and this one is both. It was also, to my lingering amazement, profoundly moving. Good for Mr. Blomkamp, and good for movie fans, too.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: District 9 is rated R for bloody violence and pervasive language. Because this is science fiction, though, I don't see that the violence would be too much or too graphic for kids of about 13 or 14 and up. The language (and plenty of it) is going to have to be your own call.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: I didn't know it before I saw the movie, but the shantytown filled with shacks occupied by aliens is real. Its human population was in the process of being relocated to government housing, but people still lived there when the movie was being made. Even had it been a product of set decorators, the living conditions there were appalling. That it's real is almost unfathomable. While there are the all too obvious lessons here where poverty and apartheid is concerned, I also think it's important to point out the motives of MNU, motives which echo those of many governments, up to and including a ""the ends justify the means"" attitude. The notion that some lives are considered less valuable than others is also brought home, sometimes in particularly graphic and horrific fashion. That's another lesson some could do with learning, particularly by those currently considering health care reform in this country."

"bob the moo","Null","12","24","15 September 2009"," Not as insightful or intelligent as some claim but makes for an entertaining summer blockbuster
","There is a tendency for critics to do things to extremes. If you watch enough films you will find that, like most things, there is a massive quality bell-curve with the vast majority falling into the middle ""it was OK"" section of that curve. When big blockbuster films shift one way or the other in that spectrum critics take the opportunity to put the boot into it or lavish it with praise depending on which side it is on, making it seem like it is further to the end of the scale than it is. This should be kept in mind when coming to District 9 because while it is a very good film indeed, it is still a blockbuster sci-fi with all the action, plot holes and noise that they come with.<br/><br/>It is built on an interesting idea though, with political parallels and a setting that is for once not a major US city with landmarks and it does make it more intriguing and interesting than the obvious comparison of the summer which is the pointless Transformers 2. However this is not the same as saying it is as insightful or intelligent as some have claimed. Like the short film that I watched a few years ago, the metaphor is not really worked with as a subject but rather used as a base. There is nothing wrong with this but let's not pretend that the film is this wonderfully clever allegory that makes for the most intelligent subtext and discussion that we have ever seen – it most certainly does not.<br/><br/>What it does do though is provide more in the way of involvement in the focused story that makes up the film. This is the story of Wikus joining with one of the Prawns to try to save himself and, along the way, seeing them on a moral level for the first time. It is not earth-shatteringly insightful but it is smart and it makes of a good base for a thriller/action plot that delivers for everyone. Amazingly made for $30 million this film has a great look and everything looks ""real"" like it is really in the shot - unlike the technically impressive effects of Transformers. Like Empire Magazine said, Michael Bay has dreams that cost more than $30million! There isn't really a bit ""money shot"" here and indeed it is easy not to be impressed by the effects simply because they don't feel like CGI in the way too many action films these days impress technically but don't grip. It is surprisingly graphic for the rating but it is not unpleasantly violent because the characters are engaging enough and the action thrilling enough for you to be carried along rather than focus on the gore.<br/><br/>The film is delivered in a range of ways. It starts out as a documentary looking back but then starts to throw in dramatic scenes where no camera would have been there, before giving up on the idea and going dramatic with only bits of news footage etc thrown in to provide another camera angle and add to the realism of the scene (the action sequences at the end). This is not as jarring as some would suggest and, while it does feel a bit odd, it does mostly work because I don't think it has to be ""one thing"" throughout the film. What works particularly well are the performances – or rather the lead one. Copley is not an actor but yet he is able to improvise a character that is convincing as a dorky bureaucrat and as a man fighting for survival. He isn't dropping one-liners and he doesn't have a total change from his ""anti-prawn"" views during the majority of the film but yet he feels very real and not like someone giving a good performance. Likewise the Prawns feel real on the screen and the effects are more than good enough to allow convincing interaction with the human actors and also make them be characters rather than effects. This doesn't extend much further than that though and the head of MNU, the head mercenary and the head gangster are all fairly obvious pantomime villains – although to be fair this is what is required of them and they produce the thriller aspect. Speaking of the gangsters I will say that, while not a massive problem, it is a shame that Nigerians are portrayed 100% as they are in this film – it would have been just as easy to have a criminal gang in the role of criminal gang, there is no narrative reason for them being Nigerian in particular.<br/><br/>District 9 is a great summer blockbuster. Like the short film it builds on a base of an interesting idea to deliver effects and thrills that are amazing considering the (comparative) shoestring budget. It isn't as smart or as insightful as some have said but the film never claims to be and it is just the critics and those expecting something that isn't there that have said this. Engaging and thrilling with an engagingly interesting idea at its core, this is well worth seeing and I hope that the sequel will be as good (which will surely happen as the numbers more than make sense – which is normally all that matters)."

Hollywood says: ""100 million, bargain basement, to make an epic film!"" South Africa says: ""30 million!"". District 9 is an intricately crafted, intensely hypnotic, cinematic collage of numerous disparate elements. The film itself seems to go through several different stages of metamorphosis.<br/><br/>Initial minutes of the movie have an authoritative, documentary or docudrama feel. Gradually, District 9 transitions into a socio-cultural Sci-Fi drama, adding a totally new dimension to the term ""Apartheid""! Next, it's more of a gripping police thriller. The last 15 or 20 minutes are non-stop, adrenaline-pumping action! None of these shifts are awkward or contrived in the least; they flow and mesh quite seamlessly and naturally. District 9 is made to order for those of us who crave Sci-Fi epics with unique, original, character driven stories; something light-years removed from same old, same old contrivances and clichéd conventions.<br/><br/>Mr. Kafka might ponder, ""What is one of the key questions put forth by many of the best movies?"" How about, ""Precisely what qualities make a being human?"" Solidarity, loyalty, respect for others and other sentient creatures, empathy, sympathy and the ability to suppress personal short-term goals for long term ones beneficial to the group, are all important traits that come to mind.

","Amazing how far we've come in the Sci-Fi genre, thinking back to the 1950's of all those alien movies that always somehow involved an improper joke about the Russians. Nevertheless, since then some incredible movies have come out and one after another each one has either been groundbreaking or just.. Battlefield Earth. District 9 brings in a new audience with many current issues we have today that include immigration, segregation, capitalism and hopes of a better future then the current. District 9 was showered with nothing but positive reviews and was even offered the Best Picture Oscar. I'm not so sure I see it as the best thing as sliced bread as some other critics praised the picture to be, but I really did love this film. Back in the 1980's, a film called Enemy Mine came out and seemed to be overlooked. The film has a similar plot and had to be carried by two great lead actors, only difference being the setting. So I don't look at District 9 as highly original or groundbreaking, however it's still a great movie that I was very impressed with. So used to the image where most Sci-Fi movies have a clean stainless steal look to the aliens and their home, this film is dirty. The aliens are ugly, but have personality and are friendly with humans, to those who don't fight their unfortunate situation having to stay on Earth. The humans however are mostly evil, almost to a fault where it will take just one human to be put in place of being as isolated as the aliens are.<br/><br/>In District 9 a gigantic alien mother ship comes to Earth, hovering above Johannesburg, South Africa. After three months, a team breaks into the ship, discovering a group of over a million malnourished aliens, who are then given refuge on Earth. The aliens, derogatorily referred to as ""prawns"", are confined to a government camp inside Johannesburg called District 9. The camp is secured with a massive police presence, and it soon turns into a slum. Wikus, a young MNU employee, is promoted to an MNU executive to lead the relocation with the serving of illegal eviction notices. Meanwhile, three aliens, one named Christopher search for alien technology from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. Later, while raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the container, which when tampered with sprays a substance onto his face. The mysterious fluid makes him ill and consequently begins to turn his DNA and body into a prawn. MNU finds out and they force Wikus to test various weapons which he succeeds. Wikus, overpowers his captors and escapes. Now a fugitive, Wikus finds refuge in District 9 and eventually seeks help from Christopher. Christopher reveals to Wikus that the canister he was sprayed with is causing the mutation. He also states that the canister would allow him to reactivate the dormant mother ship and, using its equipment, he could reverse Wikus's mutation. Only problem is that the fluid was taken from Wilkus when he was put into the lab and they must now go back to retrieve it otherwise the aliens may never go home and Wilkus may never go back to his human form.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp, the director of District 9 is really a mile stone in this fine film, he was only 28 years old when he made it. He has a true talent and a great eye, making the film partly into a mockumentary which I absolutely loved. It helped us get to know our anti hero of the film, Wilkus. Sharlto Copley who played Wilkus did a great job carrying the film, making us root for him at times but also hate him for all he did to the aliens in the first place by trying to evict them from their homes. Speaking of which, that was one of the best movie sequences I had seen, the aliens fighting their eviction and seeing how they live and are trying to adapt to the human's way of living. The one flaw to the film as I mentioned before is the human behavior, it's too evil to a fault. It's unbelievable that almost all the humans treat the aliens as trash, that the government was more interested in their technology vs. knowing the culture and life of these creatures. But District 9 was a great film and I would say that this is the best Sci-Fi film of the decade that I have seen. Very well done and a new classic that I'm sure will be mentioned in the future.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I enjoyed the first half of this film a great deal more than the second. This has to do with the screenplay being very inventive in it's set-up but becoming diluted by the audience-pleasing trope of having your main character run and shoot and blow stuff up. The first 45 minutes are expertly directed and motored along nicely as I got caught up in the main character's story with it's occasional twists and flashes of heart. I wanted to know what happened to him next. I even leaned forward in my seat a little...but I saw the direction the climax would take, however, I began to care less. Whatever emotion I had invested was left with nothing to do but evaporate. All the character defining moments get bulldozed aside by a sort of mecha love-fest which takes you loudly all the way to the sequel-made ending."
"csa-mengo","6","5","8","25 April 2010"," Good first half, terrible conclusion
","""District 9"" was one of the ten nominated movies for best picture in the last Oscar. Produced by Peter Jackson (director of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and directed by the out comer Neill Blomkamp, the movie got a lot of good reviews and became the most surprising film of the season, not only in USA, but also in Brazil.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is very interesting: an alien starship stops over Johannesburg, South African capital. Instead of attacking the humans or trying to colonize Earth, the aliens are moved by humans to a district (named ""nine""), which is protected from human invasions. Global leaders decide to invest money and time in taking care of the aliens, what causes diplomatic problems. The district expands to a slum as chaotic as some of Rio De Janeiro's slums. Because of that, the humans decide to move the aliens to a new district (named ""ten""), away from the urban centers.<br/><br/>The special effects of ""District 9"" are stunning, specially when we consider the cost of production (US$ 30 million). The aliens never seem full or unbelievable and the have their own developed language. The first part of the film is very exciting because the director decides to tell the story in a documentary form. Besides, there's not an obvious chronological order, which makes the spectator think and try to understand/predict what's coming next. The sound editing is brilliant, mixing the aliens' voice and the sounds of their weapons with the dialogs and a sad soundtrack.<br/><br/>However, the second half is disappointing. The film follows the main character in his survival journey, becoming an ordinary and predictable action movie. The discussions that the district 9 itself could make are overlooked by a boring character and his adventure - that is sometimes over-exaggerated, even dealing with a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""District 9"" could be much better if the story had taken the intelligent way and not the standardized one. In spite of it, I recommend it to sci-fi fans, specially because of the form the aliens are shown (not only visually, but also psychologically)."

","OK so there I was. Ready to be blown away. Having heard the whispers from everywhere; ""The Movie of the year"". I had already started to wonder why there weren't really any black people in the trailer, except for one or two strolling around in the background.<br/><br/>Now after having watched District 9 I am mostly upset and wondering if maybe I am from another planet too, or maybe I saw another movie than the rest of the critics did? So this is what I have been told now.<br/><br/>Nigerians are scum. They can't speak English in an understandable way!?! Their English conversations were subtitled in the US. They roll their eyes frequently and they are all bandits with no real emotions. Also it seems like they speak a few languages that are perhaps not too common amongst Nigerians!!!! (Swahili?) The whites are people who are performing cruel and hateful deeds but they are, never the less, just so much more developed and intelligent than any black person can ever hope to be. Only white people are cast for the high rank roles, oh yes except for the guy who is Wikus Van De Merwe's 2nd in command, but not even he hardly gets to talk at all. He is though, the only guy who's not getting a bulletproof vest in the helicopter and he just happens to be black. Well this might just be a sad coincidence but since the movie has been marketed as an anti xenophobic movie it just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>The ""Prawns"", whom are supposed to be a metaphor for some of the black people (who are now still living in places like Soweto where this movie was filmed) during the apartheid, are described as workers, not very intelligent creatures, who have lost their leader and thus their direction in life. Oh my!!! <br/><br/>Also there are two women! That's it. Two women who have about four lines each throughout the whole movie. There is Wikus Van De Merwe's wife, this bleak personality described as an angle is white of course and then the witch doctor, this caricature like character who is of course black. The other women existing in the movie are either running by the camera in the turmoil of MNU lab explosions or screaming in the background because they are being raped. By whom? Can you guess? Yes of course, by the Nigerians with their rolling eyes! Oh yes forgive me I forgot, there are is one woman shown as a prostitute for a split second too. 112 min and that's it? What has happened to all the women in South Africa? The Marabou Stork must be burned out by now.<br/><br/>While watching I was trying to defend the movie with that it was not long ago since the apartheid system thankfully ceased to exist. Thinking maybe they really can't see how discriminating they still are. But what really bugs me is the rest of the worlds reactions. How come the critics seem so completely unaware of the obvious problems with the movie? As a story it was kind of thin, over-emotional and with a lot of gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>Rent it if you are curious or just spend your money on something more interesting instead."

","When it comes down to things alien, I'm on board.<br/><br/>Well, most things involving aliens.<br/><br/>During the previews for 'District 9' some alien abduction flick with Milla Jovovich came on, 'The Fourth Sign' - and it looked like total crap. Not because I dislike the idea of alien abduction but because it was a stylized and over-done looking piece of Hollywood hogwash. With screeching sound effects, manic editing, and ridiculous over-acting, said Jovovich sci-fi flick appears to be a lame attempt to cash in on this possible booming genre.<br/><br/>Funny, 'District 9' had two of those attributes, yet it still managed to turn them into positives instead of negatives.<br/><br/>As you know by now, 'District 9' revolves around aliens landing and subsequently becoming trapped on Earth. They're eventually sectioned off and forced to live in slum-like conditions. After 20 years of this, the people of surrounding Johannesburg are fed up with the aliens and want them out. So MNU (Multi-National United) hatches a plan to move the alien species hundreds of miles south. But that's easier said than done. While during a preliminary phase, our lead character is delt an unfortunate hand and is treading in deep water that encompasses shady corporations and alien welfare.<br/><br/>Neil Blommkamp is, without a doubt, a bright spot in the world of cinema. If you've seen any of his previous work there should be zero doubt of this man's imagination and his talent to wield such creativity. From a simple sneaker commercial that dazzles the eyes; to a short about a robot who's dealing with human emotions; or to an action-packed short movie which was made for Halo 3, everything he seems to touch is special. And with District 9, it's no different.<br/><br/>Blending social commentary, action-packed fire-fights, ingenious weaponry, slimy and awesome special effects, he is everything a fan of sci-fi/action movies should be waiting for. And when it comes down to the special effects, they truly are a spectacle. He uses this somewhat out-of-focus approach of CGI, fused with remarkable make-up effects to create scenes of tremendous impact.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, obviously, but what it does do, it does well. Very well.<br/><br/>I would have loved a more in-depth story, with more answers (concerning the aliens), but I can easily settle for this, as it ended on a note that I was very content with. The acting was all pretty good for the most part as everyone involved was obviously very dedicated and gung-ho to be apart of this film. But the characters themselves and some parts of the dialogue felt a tad cliché at times.<br/><br/>Overall, 'District 9' delivered a true cinematic experience that I haven't seen in a long time. It felt like an awesome mix of 'Starship Troopers' and 'City of God'. Now how cool is that? <br/><br/>With Neil talking about creating a scifi epic next, the sky is truly the limit for this dude."
"MovieZoo","9","8","15","14 August 2009"," District 9: Hug an alien today
","A science fiction movie that makes one relate more to the aliens which remain mysterious from beginning to end, still should have explained why the aliens were on Earth in the first place. Not knowing that bugs the heck out of me. But in the end, as it was in the beginning, my attention was never lost.<br/><br/>My admiration for this movie is unexplainable to say the least. I can truthfully say that this movie has the realism that sci-fi often understandably lacks. A spaceship from outer space? Yeah, its there! Why? Who knows? We just accept it because the real story is going on all around it and us. We get to see the documentary build its tale of ""truth"", which is one dimensional because the truth is only what we humans know. When one of ours is forced into a life never expected and inconceivable to everyone(including aliens), we then become involved by trying to relate to what we do not understand and understand what we cannot deny.<br/><br/>The action is not a big part of this movie because this movie has too much going on for any one aspect to get all of the attention. But what action there is, will keep you engrossed and distract you from reason as I am sure it was intended. But, action or not, I was seat-bound in hope for resolution. Watching one man trying to remain a part of his heritage but forced to accept an unforeseen destiny was, for me, the biggest part of this movie.<br/><br/>These aliens did not seem so foreign to me which is why I loved their look and the way they moved. I think the creators of this movie did a great job of making them ""?loveable?"".<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with this movie that I can think of other than the one point I made earlier - I don't know why they were here. Maybe that will come up in the prequel or sequel if there is one or the other.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 because it deserved more than an 8 and because a 10 would be pointless without a certain explanation. I really hope to see a continuance."

","I can't think of any Sci-Fi movie that I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot, including all the famous one) that I'd rate as highly as ""District 9"". It has a perverse, twisty, original, and unpredictable plot that made the nearly two hours fly by. Obviously its budget was only decent, not blockbuster level, which actually enhanced the emotional effect. The plot is layered with philosophical, moral, and political complexity--pretty blatantly, at least in my opinion, successfully riffing off apartheid, Nazi medical experiments, the ongoing slaughter of albinos in Africa for witchcraft purposes, African politics, and more. My only significant quibbles are that the overall body plan of the aliens was too humanoid, as was too much of their behavior (although these two factors were probably intentional and part of a larger point that was trying to be made about ""different"" people), and, after showing a reasonable amount of restraint throughout the film, it almost appears as if they called in Michael Bay to produce the grand finale. Still, all things considered, these issues to me were only minor, and this film is my personal new high-water mark for Sci-Fi."

But it has, as basic virtue, the science to present the near reality in the most inspired manner. That defines it as one of films who are , in same measure, bitter and gentle and impecable work. It is a pledge. Foor a lot of causes. But, more important, it is a simple story of an ordinary man changing everything. A film about noble courage. Almost, wise use of an old fashion recipe. In fact, a great film. In few scenes, the film who you expect from a long, long time."
"nakchan","5","3","4","30 May 2016"," An average action sci-fi film with some special effects
","I was inspired to watch this film after seeing good reviews and watching the trailer, but it left me quite disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, I think the director did an average job. There are many scenes where he took the easiest way possible. First, incorporating a literal context presentation into a dialogue instead of subtly conveying a message and letting the viewers figure it out. Second, unrealistic reactions of extras. Third, plot holes and incomplete background story (which I could talk about in more detail, but don't want to spoil).<br/><br/>Also, I was completely unconvinced by the main actor. He seemed irrational, out of context, and also making primitive choices regarding dialogue and reaction to surroundings. If it was a comedy his acting could have made more sense, but it would still make an average comedy (also, weird considering that he would have been the only actor in the film playing in comedy genre).<br/><br/>It all started to fall into place when after watching the film I learned that it was an expansion of a short film. This was the first Neill Blomkamp's full-feature film. The same is true about Sharlto Copley as well. Considering this, it's a really good attempt at a first full-feature (remember Emmerich's ""Moon 44""), but it is far from being a cinematic sci-fi masterpiece."
"yunnacrystal","6","3","4","1 October 2013"," I'm not feeling it
","I tried watching District 9 for the first time some time ago, and i just lost interest in the first 15 minutes or so. But then i saw how high it was rated and decided to give it a shot. So i watched it today and i guess it's not my cup of tea, i just didn't like it. <br/><br/>The entire movie was unpleasant: the way the cameras moved and the recording style was sickening; i found the main character not to be very likable, he had an annoying accent and high pitched voice that made me hate him from beginning to end; there were also many disgusting stuff all the time (alien body fluids, mutating arms, blood everywhere, people eating crap...and so on), things that made me have a disgusted expression on my face throughout the hole thing.<br/><br/>I thought the story wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't put in a way that i thought was pleasing or interesting. I even got sympathetic with Christopher the alien and his little son at some point, but that was it, i just spent the entire movie wanting it to end. And so i don't really understand why it's so high rated, i guess it might really be a matter of taste...Although i like sci-fi movies, this one wasn't my style at all!"
"joshua-303-92778","1","12","25","8 July 2012"," An insult to any intelligent viewer
","I have to chuckle at the fact that this movie is getting an 8.1 average rating. I suppose these are the same literal fanboys who consider ""Inception"" a masterpiece because it was directed by the same person who made ""The Dark Knight"". Same people who like television shows like ""Firefly"".<br/><br/>This is essentially ""Sex and the City"" for guys.<br/><br/>Another viewer said this film wears its politics lightly. I wonder if I watched the same movie. More likely, the other viewer is just not very discerning, and loves anything with spaceships in it. The fact is, the symbolism couldn't be more obtuse if it hit the viewer over the head with a brick. It is obvious to point of being contrived. (I mean, it takes place in South Africa. How much more obvious can it get?) <br/><br/>This is a good example of a new breed of film tailored to the dumbed down viewer. It's a lame, campy sci-fi movie disguised as a film with a socially redeeming message. Don't waste your time."

"asda-man","10","4","6","12 April 2012"," Get yourself as many tins of cat food to see this sensational gem!
","Please don't be put off by the fact that this is a sci-fi film about aliens. Of course if you do happen to be a complete sci-fi boff then you won't need telling twice to go down and see this, because you've probably spent your whole life trying to find that next great alien invasion films. And here it is. But, I hate sci-fi films, especially those with stupid aliens in them because you just can't take them seriously. Alien films are often a load of rubbish as well unless you're looking at family-orientated ones like ""ET"" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". But, adult alien films (don't!) are often bad or just don't get it right like ""Signs"" which turned out to be really naff. So when I heard the hype surrounding ""District 9"" I looked at the trailer and thought, ""This looks like complete tripe!"" But when I saw it Asda for a fiver, all I could see was the raving reviews from pretty much everybody! Even Chris Tookey and Chutch claimed to adore it, so in the basket it went.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much, but what I did get was something phenomenal. I've now seen it three times and each time it's still managed to leave me breathless. ""District 9"" isn't your ordinary alien invasion film, or at least it doesn't seem like it. It's a complete masterpiece from start to finish. Neil (the director) plunges you straight into this alien world from the very first frame and its impossible not to get seduced by it. Everything's told using a ""mouckumentary"" if you like, and it's really clever and sometimes weirdly believable. Maybe, it's because of the fantastic parallels concerning today's society and apartheid? The opening comes thick and fast and immediately grabs the viewer and pulls them in to the world of Johannesburg but not as we know it. I think that truly great films should make the viewer fell like they're their and not actually watching something on the telly. Films like ""Black Swan"" and ""The Artist"" have done this to me, and also ""District 9"".<br/><br/>The film also seamlessly transitions from a sort of found-footage stroke ""mouckumentary"" and actual film. I suppose you could sort of look at the camera crew following the main character, Wikus, as a metaphor, of the humans seeing the aliens through lenses that aren't don't show the aliens truthfully, then when we're transported into the world we see what is really happening with the aliens, and we get the frustrating truth. It's a film that ""Avatar"" wanted to be, only ""District 9"" is one hundred million times better than ""Avatar""! It explores themes about apartheid and treating people right without shoving it down your throat in a patronising way. It's extremely poignant and handled beautifully. When Wikus ends up becoming friends with one of the aliens it's extremely touching and you end up caring for both of them.<br/><br/>That's another great thing about ""District 9"" it has fantastic characters. I'm sure if this got a Hollywood re-do then they would make the character of Wikus as someone who has no flaws, a bit like the paraplegic man in ""Avatar"". Some sort of hero who knows exactly what he's doing. Whereas here, Wikus is the definition of a lovable tw*t. He isn't at all perfect but he has such a kind heart and is good-natured. It's only until he knows how it feels to be an outsider that he really starts to understand these aliens. He's a complete idiot and the film does have some really funny moments, although it does help with him having a south-African accent as some how everything they say just sounds so much funnier! The aliens are also in most aspects, more human than the humans, and you really want them to succeed, especially with that incredibly adorable baby alien!<br/><br/>""District 9"" is not just only superbly written but also fabulously directed. It's fast-paced and the final third or so of the film is just complete non-stop exciting action that is just handled beautifully. Oh, and I'm not talking stupid, pointless action where the director decides that it would be better to just blow up something to make it look cooler (hello Michael Bay). No, this is action with a point. The characters have a motive and its a motive that you really want them to succeed with. It's breath-taking to watch and the special effects are literally out of this world! It's like the end of ""Avatar"" only much more exciting because the characters are so much more likable (and some appropriately unlikable). It also manages to take itself seriously without making it look ridiculous. That might be because it managed to poke fun at itself at the start which was also refreshing to see. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>So whatever your view is on aliens, get down to your nearest supermarket (or maybe there's a nice cheap one on ""Amazon"" or ""Ebay""!) and buy it! Because this isn't just a film about aliens, it's a film about people and I think that's the point. You see the aliens and think ""Oh god, here we go!"" but as the film goes on you see them as people too. The cinematography is also sometimes breath-taking, especially with those iconic shots of that incredible mothership, which really must've been a spectacle to see at the cinema! ""District 9"" is a shot of adrenaline, straight into the heart and I didn't want it end."
"stu9003","5","4","6","6 February 2010"," Mindless action
","I've heard District 9 hailed as intelligent sci-fi. To me, this was the exact opposite. It was a movie that took a fascinating premise and then basically ignored every single aspect of that premise to present us with what amounted to a video game movie.<br/><br/>The movie actually gets off to a solid start. It opens in a mockumentary style whereby they introduce the whole scenario of the alien ship coming to a halt over the city of Johannesburg. We learn about how there were about one million alien refugees who were offloaded and eventually segregated from the human populace by placing them into District 9, where they live in squalid conditions. We then follow Wikus, our main character, as he runs a team whose purpose is to relocate the aliens to District 10. This section of the film is really interesting. We see firsthand how cultural misunderstandings can have tragic consequences. All sorts of interesting questions and possibilities about the aliens are raised.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film basically decides to ignore every single one of these interesting questions and possibilities in order to present us with a closing 45 minutes of some of the most dumbed-down, over the top, and mindless action sequences that you will ever see. Forget about the story, the aliens or any of the characters. Basically, what you've got is a video game movie - imagine Half-Life if George Freeman was wearing alien armour - complete with body parts flying everywhere and featuring one-dimensional characters who just seem to get stupider and stupider with each scene.<br/><br/>To be fair, the whole concept for the movie is so different that I have a feeling if they hadn't gone this route, this movie probably never would have gotten released. Still can't believe it got nominated for best picture though."

","What I expected from DISTRICT 9 was miles off, the film painted an interesting picture of aliens that have not invaded the U.S as you might expect but have invaded the city of Johannesburg in South Africa and have taken refuge in the city's slums.<br/><br/>The film was different in terms of the setting, where instead of another major American city we have the capital of South Africa, where you get a completely different culture of people that are your typical South African and that along with the setting is what sets this film way apart from other Sci-Fi films.<br/><br/>Being a resident of South Africa myself and I'm also familiar with a lot of South African films and actors, I have never seen any of the actors in this film before but they give stellar performances throughout.<br/><br/>However, I have spoken to people that didn't like this film and I've spoken to people that did like it, which almost makes it difficult for me to recommend to others, I did like the film of course but my expectations were different, but overall I thought the direction was great the story was also great as well as the acting and the action scenes were thoroughly entertaining but if I was to recommend it I would say lower your expectations because this is the kind of film that will get mixed reactions, so it will be best to watch it with an open mind."
"teachermark","5","4","6","26 September 2009"," A slightly better version of ""Alien Nation""
","What can I say that hasn't already been said? First of all this film is not original - from the potboiler 70s ""Alien nation""(which at least had no intellectual pretensions) to ""the fly"" to episodes of outer limits(as someone stated before) this film is almost completely derivative. <br/><br/>It is in no way great science fiction like Blade Runner, 2001, Solaris(the original), Gattaca or more recently, Sunshine.<br/><br/>It doesn't even have the campy entertainment values of schlock like the old deathrace 2000. Though it does have a lot of explosions.<br/><br/>As for the plot, we have a black goo that turns people into prawns and can also power a spaceship. Hmm. Well, i guess that is campy so maybe there IS some camp value. But it doesn't fit in well with the ""social message"" of the film which is fairly obvious.<br/><br/>Then we have prawns who seem to be well, prawnish looking aliens that can understand English, though of course can't speak it due to their different vocal structure. Hmmm.<br/><br/>The protagonist as bureaucratic nerd is somewhat interesting but not sympathetic.<br/><br/>We have the end where the ship blasts off with enough fire power presumably to fry the planet and yet no attempt is made to rescue the rest of the prawns. What's up with that? There is simply no emotional impact with neither alien nor protagonist. At the end do we even care?<br/><br/>Contrast the underrated(and forgotten) ""Enemy Mine"" which also has a fairly obvious social message but at least engages emotionally.<br/><br/>In summary this is a film cleverly aimed at the vast majority that do not know or understand great science fiction(or great movies) with enough explosions and a thin social message to appeal to their intellectual vanity. I saw it in the big theater but now I wish I had simply downloaded it."

","Call me simple but there was nothing to like about this movie. My expectations may have been raised due it's award nominations and positive reviews here but dang, I really didn't like it.<br/><br/>The filming/editing was fine. But the story sucked.<br/><br/>Wikus being first portrayed as a naive dork with an attractive wife and then changing rather quickly to a prickish idiot was the biggest thing that I couldn't get over. He did have his moment of redemption which for better or worse didn't happen on the time-table of a typical block-bluster but it just made the movie even less satisfying for what could have been a semi-enjoyable movie. I kept waiting for the moment where I could get behind what was happening but the ridiculousness of the plot points just tripped the movie up from becoming a good story. The acting was above average to below average which is fine by me. However the main characters of Wikus and Christopher had no clear consistency where you really wanted to see the rest of what was going to happen in the story. Christopher's character was so out of line with the rest of the aliens that it was distracting. I also don't see how if cat food was stronger than catnip that there could any lying around for Wikus to find. It's details like these that just break a movie. That and then the alien mech-suit. So if you were in Wikus' situation you wouldn't just clear out the MNU troops that were waiting around to kill you while you basically had an unlimited arsenal at your disposal? The movie did highlight immigration and the current situation in America but it didn't really resolve or even pursue anything deeper than what it presented on the surface.<br/><br/>The movie took an unrealistic view of an alien encounter and touched on immigration but anyone looking for anything deeper than discrimination (I mean the alien were an insect-like species that didn't speak anything close to any language) is, to put it lightly, stretching it.<br/><br/>The movie had potential and the effects/filming/editing certainly weren't sub-par and I can see where liberals would like to make a deeper connection but jeez it's sub-par B movie at best!

","OK, this isn't the worst movie ever made or that I've seen, there are plenty of other candidates out there. But nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture??? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Oh, that's right. Anything with the appearance of major originality always catches the minds of Academy voters. That's the only reason this piece of crap could get nominated.<br/><br/>And it does have the *appearance* of some serious originality. But where the hell is the story? Answer: There essentially is no story. This is a movie with a lot of visuals, but no substance, no plot, no characters you give a sh*t about. And PLOT HOLES galore.<br/><br/>Here's a few of the plot holes and unbelievable story points:<br/><br/>1) Alien ship is adrift over planet Earth, full of brainless aliens who act like cockroaches, eating garbage and stealing. So apparently they'll all stupid or of very low intelligence. Except for one alien, out of 1.8 Million. WHAT??? One alien is smart enough to be able to create some special fluid (that took him 20 years to create) that will get a craft/module back to the Mother Ship. But the other 1,799,999 aliens are dumb and act like cockroaches. Okaaaayyyy.<br/><br/>2) If this alien is the only smart one, how the hell did the ship even end up here? With a ship the size of a small city (based on the scale of helicopters that fly around it at the beginning of the movie, plus 1 Million aliens came here on it), it would take more than one smart alien to run that thing.<br/><br/>3) The special fluid Smart Alien creates to run the small craft is ALSO capable of turning a human into an alien. Give me a (expletive) break. Could the director/co-writer not come up with a better angle than that??? And something just a tad more believable?<br/><br/>Well, according to the behind-the-scenes footage, he and his co-writer came up with 10 story lines for their premise. I guess they settled on this one by default, and it shows.<br/><br/>4) Why are a band of Nigerian hustlers/hoodlums allowed to live within this quarantined place for the aliens?<br/><br/>There are probably more, but those are for starters. And one does not care about any of the characters, there's no development of them, and you just don't care if they live or die. The attempt near the end of the movie to have one or two of the aliens show emotion is ludicrous.<br/><br/>How so many IMDb users could rate this movie high enough to be in the top 250 films is just mind boggling."

The main character was foolish and nerdy yet entirely unsympathetic, which made him totally unlikeable and uninteresting. The fact that he had a beautiful, loving wife was not nearly enough to make him a round or curious character in the least. In fact, it would have been nice if he'd been killed off very early in the film so that we could see her marry someone with a hint of personality. <br/><br/>In this movie, every piece of dialog that was supposed to convey excitement -- be it terror or joy -- sounded the same.

"zardoz-13","1","25","61","15 August 2009"," What Is All The Hoopla About--Worst Sci-fi saga in Ages!!!
","Director Neill Blomkamp's freshman, feature-length, dystopian sci-fi thriller ""District 9"" qualifies as both grotesque and ghoulish. Worse, heavily-laden with anti-apartheid messages, it emerges nevertheless as an uneven blend of Monty Pythonesque humor wrapped around a serious polemic about alien rights. Does anybody remember director Christopher Columbus'""Bicentennial Man"" (1999) with Robin Williams and lack of concern for alien rights? Despite some visceral action sequences that attest to Blomkamp's expertise at staging action, this nimble but numb-skulled nail-biter puts the protagonist in a thoroughly impossible position. Essentially, ""District 9"" exemplifies those supernatural films that occur primarily on Earth with the 'aliens are among us' theme. Mankind knows that aliens have arrived. In fact, not only have we accepted them, we have grossly taken advantage of them! These aliens are neither as lovable as ""Wall-E"" lovable nor as cunning as the ""Terminator."" Indeed, given their slender, emaciated bodies that resemble naked Jews in a Nazi concentration camp.<br/><br/>You could call ""District 9"": 'The Day the Aliens Stood Still.' Blomkamp and co-scenarist Terri Tatchell encapsulate the action in a fictional expose television documentary. Intermittently, Blomkamp indulges himself with adrenalin-laced dramatic footage that no documentary film could have captured without staging it. At other times, Blomkamp cross-cuts black & white footage from surveillance cameras to eavesdrop on our woebegone hero at weak moments. Essentially, he is imitating ""Cloverfield"" scenario, except for those few sequences that do not dovetail into the documentary. Not surprisingly, ""District 9"" borrows from a number of sci-fi fantasies. A gigantic alien spaceship visits Earth like in ""Independence Day,"" but this spacecraft cannot leave. The spaceship hovers over Johannesburg, South Africa, for three months before the authorities board it. The skeletal aliens that humans find inside suffer from malnutrition, and the good folks in Johannesburg, confine these destitute aliens in what constitutes a huge slum. Humans treat the aliens like second-class citizens and allow them to sink into squalor. The aliens resort to crime to make ends meet and are often at odds with the authorities. No, ""District 9"" shares little in common with the conventional ""Alien Nation."" These aliens look like they walked off the set of a ""Predator"" movie and--unlike most alien invaders--they are not as intimidating as their counterparts. These aliens remain largely at our mercy, and Blomkamp renders humanity as brutal and unscrupulous in their treatment of the aliens.<br/><br/>""District 9"" opens with several talking heads as part of a documentary about the scandal involving the protagonist. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copely) is an ordinary field representative for Multi-National United, (MNU), a private company that has dominion over the aliens. Escalating alien crime and violence has prompted the government to move some 1.8 million aliens to the new District 10 camp located outside of Johannesburg. Backed up by armed helicopters hovering overhead, MNU field representatives serve eviction orders on the aliens. Our hero' s father-in-law, Piet Smit (Louis Minnaar) assigns him to head up the mission. During an inspection of a domicile, Wikus discovers a suspicious cylinder among an arms cache. When he fumbles with it, a vile black liquid sprays his face, contaminating him with alien DNA. <br/><br/>As the story open, Wikus is already under investigation. The tabloids carry pictures of him mating with aliens. We are given a recap of the story and then the second half opens as Wikus grows flippers on his left hand. Suddenly, Wikus becomes the most prized human alive with the alien DNA polluting his bloodstream. Alien guns that scientists could never have fired now discharge at Wikus' half-breed DNA touch. Mind you, Wikus refuses to fire the weapons, but his captors shock him with cattle prods until he accommodates them. Wikus goes berserk and escapes from the laboratory. He joins forces with an intelligent, inventor-type alien named Christopher. Christopher wants to rekindle the energy of his command capsule so he can get back to the spacecraft overhead and haul freight.<br/><br/>Basically, ""District 9"" appropriates the 'what if' sci-fi theme and employs it as a metaphor for a social consciousness sermon about racial xenophobia. Neither Blomkamp nor Tatchell regard humanity in a sentimental light. Worse, we are asked to sympathize with a hero who is a complete imbecile. The theme of man's inhumanity to aliens comes through 'loud and clear.' Imagine a science fiction movie that takes place in a third world country and you've summed up ""District 9."" These aliens aren't cool. They look like big bugs and they speak in guttural language. Everybody refers to them contemptuously as 'prawns.' Blomkamp translates the alien lingo in white subtitles. <br/><br/>The prawns are as pathetic as the hero who behaves as if he were in a Woody Allen comedy. He is a naive moron, a laughingstock, a fall guy. The important part of the plot transpires when he undergoes a quasi-alien metamorphosis a la Franz Kafka meets ""The Fly."" Blomkamp lenses ""District 9"" like a documentary, and its bureaucratic hero makes an ass out of himself. He couldn't be any more abject if he were John Cleese in a Monty Python skit. Eventually, after he gets contaminated, he begins his transformation into an alien with one hand turning into an alien claw. Yes, the aliens do resemble huge insects which make them appear less hostile but far from appealing. Indeed, Blomkamp creates a very convincing alternative universe in that the story is credible and as down to earth as any sci-fi you can imagine. Eventually, the alien along with the Wikus Van De Merwe bureaucratic hero launch a one-man/one-alien war against the repressive organization MNU that keeps the alien cooped up in the worse circumstances. The section between Merwe escaping and then teaming up with Christopher is action packed, but there are no surprises in this flat movie.

A movie like this does *not* require this pathetic technique to hide poor plot or special effects, so why use it?

","I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares! <br/><br/>A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that? <br/><br/>If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.<br/><br/>THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!<br/><br/>Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!"

Then, they're kinda forced by humans to live like animals in some place called 'District 9' and are trading their superior advanced weapons and machinery to highly evil portrayed black Nigerians for a few cat's can food, to keep themselves alive!

"YouFightLikeACow","10","11","23","14 August 2009"," A Gritty Commentary. And Much More.
","What a choice to pick Johannseburg as the setting. It really set the stage for a very poignant film on society, while incorporating lots of actions, especially towards the end. It's obviously a statement on apartheid in South Africa, with the aliens playing the role of the discriminated race. It's about how in any society slums develop, how crime explodes, how certain people take power over others and control them (in this case, the Nigerians over the aliens). It's about government corruption and how we have no power to stop it sometimes. It's all about that. And what a backdrop to put it in.<br/><br/>But there's so much more than that. It's also about betrayal, loyalty, trust, relationships, and sheer kickassness. It's about doing what is best for everyone, and not just yourself. The whole movie had a thread about selfishness, which I found extremely affecting. District 9 is about capturing the raw grittiness of all these elements (it frequently uses security camera footage, camcorders, and more), about the aliens, about the humans, about how we're not all that different. Just look at the aliens' eyes. They show just as much emotion.<br/><br/>But don't overlook the action part. It is full of great action sequences, though it builds slowly. I love how the blood splurts on the camera. Yes, it is quite violent, but it's a good for a kick. Some of the death scenes are quite awesome and pretty funny, actually. The war scenes are very well shot. There are many tender and emotional scenes as well, particularly the end. There are father-son overtones as well, and brother-brother too. My favorite aspect of the movie is the grand, epic sense/feel I get when we see the mothership, how it completely dwarfs the helicopters that fly to it. I love the endearing bass we hear ... and feel... when it moves. Great direction. The movie has a little bit of everything, with some very funny humour and a fantastic ending, as I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a commentary. But the director offers so much more. A fantastic viewing experience."
"ramair350","5","14","31","21 August 2009"," Incredibly disappointing (yes, call this review ""District Whine"")
","As an avid movie fan, in particular the science fiction genre, I had high expectations for this film. The last two sci-fi movies I have seen (Star Trek and Moon) were both top caliber films, easily eclipsing anything within the last few years. Based on the fantastic reviews and the association with Peter Jackson, I thought the summer sci-fi's would be three for three. But was I so wrong.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that it just isn't plausible whatsoever. I am a mid-30's engineer, so for a teenager who loves ""Transformers"", I can understand that this movie would have incredible appeal. And even for me there were parts of the film that I really liked. But the outrageously unrealistic scenes outnumbered the plausible ones with a ratio of about 5 to 1. There were so many issues with realism, I don't know where to begin. When I see science fiction (vs fantasy), I expect realism ... this isn't Lord of the Rings. And I felt alarm bells going off a few times on ""social commentary"" using aliens as a metaphor for illegal immigrants (""aliens""), and I think that also could be driving some of the high ratings.<br/><br/>So if you love C+ action movies (hey, I have enjoyed plenty ... including parts of this one), give this a try. I think there are aspects of the movie that most people can enjoy, but just don't count on seeing a movie that is currently sitting around the top 30 movies of all time as ranked on IMDb. It isn't even close. Statistically speaking, with roughly 100,000 movies out there, I would say it belongs in the top 50,000."
"walkereb","2","14","31","17 August 2009"," I really didn't like this movie.
","Actually, I hated this movie...from start to finish. And I didn't want to. It's received numerous favorable reviews, several friends loved it and I certainly sympathize with any work designed to expose bigotry of any kind. But I still hated this movie. I found the premise silly, the aliens cheesy, their infatuation with cat food trivializing, the Nigerian mafia stereotypical (at best), the ending a rip-off of the worst of Transformers and the characters completely unlikable. In fact, I rooted only for the alien child who has about five minutes of air time, and then only because it would be sacrilegious to wish ill on a kid.<br/><br/>The opening news scenes drag on and on. Yet, I found myself longing for their return when the ""action"" started. I felt like I was watching yet another remake of ""The Pink Panther."" The ""hero"" is a bumbling moron on the order of Inspector Clouseau. He finds the pink panther diamond, which is a magical canister containing fluid that both turns people into aliens and simultaneously powers the alien ship (one of countless absurdities). Despite being borderline retarded, he somehow knows how to operate the aliens' ships, weapons and even Transformer-like robot. But despite his valiant efforts to save this film through special effects involving laser-gunning humans for a few fleeting moments, the film, for the umpteenth time, shows it does not want to be saved by having him eventually mimic Jeff Goldblum in ""The Fly."" <br/><br/>This movie is like ""The Sneetches Meet the Jetsons."" While Peter Jackson may have been necessary to the modest special effects, Dr. Seuss could have written a better script. Frankly, the outpouring of praise for this movie leads me to believe many critics will support even the worst sci-fi if it tries to be politically correct."

"jhuni_x","4","7","13","28 January 2010"," Over-rated!
","There is a species known as ""Prawns"" originating from a planet with seven moons in the Andromeda Galaxy. Prawns are adept in developing biotechnology, such that they have made their spacecraft, their guns, their fuel, and practically the rest of their technology dependent upon their biology. If they are so adept at it, why didn't they develop the biotechnology to transform their species of drones into highly intelligent independent individuals?!?<br/><br/>Sparing that, they could have at least brought along some other individuals independent from the hive mind, that way they wouldn't have to be completely screwed when the hive mind dies or when someone launches a biochemical attack. In Star Trek they bring along Klingons, Vulcans, Betzaoids, Androids, etc, so if one of them falls to a virus that causes mental retardation, at least the rest can continue on. The Prawns could at least build a few robots like data and make their spaceship highly intelligent, again so that they wouldn't have to be screwed over when the hive mind dies.<br/><br/>Okay, so somehow it ends up that their hive mind dies and their crew is completely direction-less and screwed over. Their spacecraft should still communicate back its status to the other Prawns, or did they lack basic communication technology?!! Why would the prawns forget about one of their own spacecrafts? NASA keeps pretty good track of its spacecrafts, so why can't the Prawns with all their technology do just as good of a job??<br/><br/>Okay so their crew is screwed and the rest of their species forget about them. The last thing they should do is land on a foreign planet! They have no idea how advanced or hostile that planet is, or what sort of deadly viruses and toxins that planet might contain. In reality they would just sit around the sun and harvest its energy to power their spaceship. I am sure the comfort of their spacecraft and their alien technology would be far superior then the slum-like conditions they had on Earth.<br/><br/>Granted they do use biotechnology a lot, I simply do not see how biotechnology could be used as fuel. Besides that why on Earth did the fuel turn Wikus into an alien?? In addition, why do they have the technology to reverse the transforming effect this fuel has on humans?<br/><br/>Moving along to when the aliens are on Earth in the film, why didn't the aliens, with the exception of Christopher Johnson, use their guns to retaliate? Why do the Prawns like cat-food in the first place? Why would they trade their guns for cat-food, and why would Nigerians stockpile guns that they can't even use? Why does the government approach the situation so poorly and why does the government allow human beings to stay with aliens in district 9? What about inter-species prostitution?!?! What is that about and why isn't the U.N dealing with these things, to at least protect the welfare of the people on the human side?<br/><br/>Now lets consider the completely unlikeable protagonist: Wikus. There is little to no character development and his plot is just as ridiculous as the plot for the rest of this movie. He does an abortion on aliens like it is funny or something? It isn't, the audience doesn't laugh with him so that scene is just stupid. He finds some volatile black fuel and that one of the retarded aliens failed to hide, and he gets exposed to it, why doesn't he go seek medical help immediately? Then when he is transforming why does his very own wife believe that he had ""sex with aliens""? Come on, sex with aliens, that is just ridiculous! Then he moves to District 9, because the idiotic government has completely failed to place any decent security in the region. He meets Christopher Johnson and they are somehow supposed to bond? Even though Wikus attacks Christopher Johnson, and even though he committed countless crimes against the Prawns, Christopher Johnson still bonds with him? Come on that is just ridiculous!<br/><br/>Finally, what is the take-home message of this film? Treat retarded aliens that land on Earth with respect? Perhaps it is that human beings are cruel because everyone in this film is cruel to an incredibly fictitious extent. Even if it is that human beings are cruel, that does not really teach anyone morals, people are not going to leave this movie with an increased understanding of ethical theory so this film does not really have much of a take home message.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is highly over-rated. Some people praise it for being ""original."" It is not, this sort of theme has been thoroughly explored in films such as {Alien Nation (1988)}. Besides that the visual effects and CGI are not that good, they were done on a poor budget and there are many flaws, just check the Goofs link under ""Fun Stuff."" It doesn't contain plot holes in that link though, because there is simply too many of them to possibly fit in a single page."
"thesar-2","9","7","13","15 August 2009"," Forget Phoning Home
","Honestly, when I first saw the trailer for 'District 9' in the theatre I thought it was either one of those commercials for people to cease calling/texting during the theatre (I half expected the somewhat fake looking alien to pull out a cell or bash someone making a call) or an advertisement for the upcoming 'V' reboot. I was surprised that it was an actual movie, and since it looked fake and definitively unoriginal, I was going to skip it. I decided to give it a chance due to the very high ratings. Boy, I couldn't have been anymore wrong on all points. Fake looking? Not when you watch the movie and learn to see them as living beings. Unoriginal? Sure, it was part 'Cloverfield,' 'The Fly' (1986), 'Diary of the Dead,' and, not surprisingly, a lot of Jackson's previous involvements, such as 'Dead Alive.' But it took all the right ingredients and wonderfully spliced them together. Overall, it's an extreme human story, albeit the negative side, from either the aliens (or prawns) or human's POV. So negative, in fact, you honestly yearn to hope for something good to happen, but alas, it's based solely on human's dark side and history. If anyone leaves this and thinks this would never happen, good luck. Prejudices and hate are part of our nature, unfortunately, and unlike fictional tales such as 'Star Trek,' though entertaining and positive, 'District 9' truly showed honesty in how selfish and small we are. Despite some flaws (such as why a wanted man's security codes weren't revoked) it was truly a great movie: action, suspense, creativity – it never felt small budgeted; in fact, it was enormously realistic and horror/gore (it certainly earned its 'R' rating.) Certainly one of the best I've seen in 2009."
"Xyre7","9","7","13","15 August 2009"," Makes you wonder about human nature,,,& D10!
","The set up was somewhat dry, but the 2nd half made up for it, and I perked up when the documentary's commentators started referring to Wikus in the past tense. When the transformation commenced, I immediately thought of Jeff Goldblum in ""The Fly"" with the fingernails, teeth, and skin falling off. Except Wikus doesn't lose his 'humanity' or his mind by the end the way Brundle-fly does. Instead, both of those elements grow stronger as the film progresses. It's weird. Wikus becomes more 'human' as his body becomes less human. There were gross happenings (e.g. people are left liquefied, in chunks, & other blender settings). These scenes are broken up with gawky-Wikus behavior like when he idiotically knocks out Christopher after he's told it will take 3 years to change him back; then proceeds to jump into an alien cockpit that he doesn't know how to drive (""No buttons!""). The aliens aside from appearance (you be the judge) they were diverse in behavior like humans: Some were determined & intelligent, some were vicious, some were bottom-feeders, and some made dumb decisions. Imagine aliens coming to Earth & they judged the human race based on one American town—yikes. Gosh, there are governments that make some wicked weapons, but I wouldn't automatically link that with superior judgment/intelligence/tight teamwork. This film is memorable, especially Wikus & his sociopathic hunter. It made me speculate and wanting more-->the unanswered questions (why didn't the refugee aliens just vaporize us why did they run out of gas over Johannesburgwhy did they run out of gas at all if their weapons are so sophisticated-wouldn't they know better to keep spare fuelwhere is CJ Jr's mamawhat's keeping the mothership suspended, earth's magnetic fields?...is it really a mothership or a penal colony-exiled from their homewhat's with the cat foodetc.). But I figure the way it ended, we'll find out IF CJ comes back in 3 years in District 10 with ""help"". I wonder if Wikus will take him up on the offer to 'fix him' by then. -PS- *It's like when I speak to my Nana in English & she responds in French, and I respond in English... **THANK GOODNESS they didn't show us how ""interspecies prostitution"" worksgeez, they might be saving that for sequel too though. ***The xenophobia, voodoo, the beatings & lab research are NOT pretty, but DON'T mire the film in oppression, explicitly give a S.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","7","13","15 August 2009"," Exciting concept and committed storytelling triumph
","Alien invasion stories can often seem a bit far-fetched, but making a great action movie with a compelling story for just $30 million shouldn't. If ""District 9"" scores at the box office, maybe it will drive home to Hollywood that eternal message that great films come from great stories. ""District 9"" is a sci-fi movie that takes a great concept and runs with it behind committed visionaries who believe completely in what they're doing. If carefree producers with fat checkbooks had been involved, this story of aliens stranded in Johannesburg, South Africa, forced by the government to live in slums would feel about as hokey as ""Starship Troopers."" Instead, it's a gripping action blockbuster accompanied by a running social commentary.<br/><br/>The only big name attached to ""District 9"" is producer Peter Jackson (""Lord of the Rings""). South-African born Director Neill Blomkamp makes his debut based on a script he wrote with friend Terri Tatchell. The star is Sharlto Copley, who you've also never heard of before. So aside from Jackson, what's the draw? Blomkamp's premise will simply capture your imagination and glue your interest. Most people can't sell a film with just that, but Blomkamp is so firmly in control of this fictional scenario that anyone can easily believe it for just a couple hours. If you think you can tell that from the trailers, just wait, there's more.<br/><br/>Starting out as a fictional documentary, ""District 9"" explains how the aliens, termed ""prawns"" for their shrimp-like appearance, showed up hovering over Johannesburg in their mothership and were eventually forced to relocate to Earth. The South African government gave policing permission to Multi-National United, a corp that claimed it wanted to study the species scientifically, when it was chiefly interested in decoding its incredible weapons technology.<br/><br/>Eventually the film shifts gears into full-out action mode as Wikus van de Merwe (Copley), who was put in charge of a new operation to relocate the prawns 200 kilometers outside of the city in new refugee-type camps for MNU, becomes infected by an alien substance, making him a walking piece of scientific research.<br/><br/>Carrying the historical weight of Apartheid in South Africa, ""District 9"" essentially plays out a social drama in many aspects, wondering exactly how things might turn out if aliens came to Earth without the goal of taking over our planet. How would we treat them? Segregate them? Kill them without just cause? There are several bumps on the road to fully realizing this concept, but the idea of it and the details Blomkamp gives the aliens -- such as an affinity for rubber and an almost drug-like addiction to cat food -- cover up the mistakes with ease, keeping you interested in what's going to happen next or what else you might learn about the aliens and their circumstances.<br/><br/>As an action film, ""District 9"" picks up halfway through, giving plenty of blood-soaring body- dismembering gore (sometimes to a comical degree) to those viewers that bought tickets just to get what they expected from the genre. It does not cheat those looking for just entertainment. But ""District 9"" clearly strives to earn more respect with its audience. The movie doesn't flaunt its weapons inventions, for example, but incorporates them naturally into the plot in order to generate intrigue, then pulling the trigger and giving us the long- awaited spectacle. <br/><br/>It's the kind of respect that a serious storyteller has for his or her audience, and Blomkamp has it. Many plot points and dialogue exchanges are predictable, but the presentation is highly original and the concept is fresh, modern and head-smart compared to the '90s garbage of ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black,"" as wildly popular as those films were. The documentary feel and the hand-held camera action might be the trappings of low budget, but they really tell this story in unique riveting fashion.<br/><br/>It amazes me that Michael Bay can take $200 million and make the dizzying piece of scrap metal that was ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" yet an unknown pal of Peter Jackson can take less than a quarter of that money and make thought-provoking and exciting science-fiction with some of 2009's most original storytelling. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

Films that have a budget of 5 or 6 times of this film are not as convincing. The special effects are top notch, and the writing/screenplay leaves no holes. The 30 million dollar budget is used more efficiently than any film in recent memory. Finally a sci-fi film that doesn't shy away from violence to achieve a PG-13 rating to fill the seats.

","OK, let's pretend that aliens arrive on earth, and for some strange reason don't immediately want to destroy us. what would most likely happen then? the answer is: probably what happened in this movie.<br/><br/>despite the fact that this movie was about aliens, i found it extremely realistic. the entire time i was watching, i never found a single moment that made me think: ""oh that'd never happen in real life..."" that, in addition to the almost 'documentary' type style of filming, made the entire situation seem highly believable. in my opinion, the movie accurately portrayed the anger, fear, and prejudice that people tend to show when they don't properly understand something, as well as the politics and manipulation used by others to gain influence in rough situations like these.<br/><br/>On that note, despite the movie's focus on sending a message, the action was still plentiful, and very well done at that.(and let's just say it was rated R for a reason). But while most movies are remembered either for their special effects OR their plot, this movie managed to pull off both. In the end, it was definitely more than just another sci-fi flick.<br/><br/>(unfortunately, as i was leaving the theater, i heard too many ignorant people criticize the movie's attempt to show them something more than just mindless action and violence. hopefully that was just the group i ran into, and not what most people were thinking)"

District 9 is widely being hailed as the best movie to come out in 2009. I wouldn't argue with that claim one bit.<br/><br/>The visuals are outstanding, the plot/ideas are groundbreaking. Your heart becomes very heavy for these ""Prawns"" (a racist term for the alien refugees). They are treated very savagely throughout the film. It feels a bit overdone, but given the grim reality of the state of the African continent... some could say that the level of violence and cruelty wasn't too much.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are almost too cruel to have on-screen. If you were to replace the scary-looking aliens with lets say, a human ethnic minority - I think the movie would almost be too much for even the most hardened viewer.<br/><br/>In the end I found myself a bit choked up. I left the theater asking myself questions that were left unanswered (on purpose, possibly to set up a sequel).

"Mpchri2","6","9","18","6 September 2009"," A film that never reached its potential
","I am going to have to disagree with the rave reviews that I have been reading. The first twenty minutes of the film, seen largely though the eyes of the media coverage, sets up something wonderfully original. It is the story of first contact that happened by accident, leaving the human world, particularly Johannesburg, faced with a humanitarian crisis. It shows corporations taking control of the shelters for the Alien populations and exploiting them, it shows the conflict that comes from different cultures clashing and it shows how callus humanity can be. Then there is a twist early in the film and from that point forward the film is about showing the audience one futuristic way of killing people after another that does include a friendship between a human and an alien but is nothing we haven't seen before. From this point onwards almost every crossroad where the story could either get lost in a Hitchcockien riddle surrounded by suspense or explode a person with a gun so that blood hits the camera, it takes option two. Although it does come to a worthy conclusion I can't help but feel that there were forty-five minute to an hour of killing people with lightning guns and other futuristic weapons, while awesome in an overly gritty kind of way, could have been better spent on the promised, ""Many secrets in District Nine,"" while still providing a violent, action packed thrill for the audience.<br/><br/>The film is very realistic until you look closely at certain things. I will give one example: cat food is like drugs to the aliens. While this is a funny scene there is nothing in cat food that isn't someplace else and the chemical components of cat foods very as much as from one cat food to another as from cat food to dog food but dog food is not dealt like drugs. The fact that I was thinking about the chemical components of cat food during this film says that there is something a little wrong with me, but it also says something about the film.<br/><br/>On a positive note both the rookie director and the rookie star did phenomenal jobs for their first time out and we should all be watching to see where they go from here. The story of the film got lost in mostly senseless violence but Blomkamp's direction, coupled with great production values, keeps the film interesting. It is a great conversation starter and worth a viewing if you don't mind gore but is not at the level of greatness it has been proscribed."
"likegoodmovies","10","9","18","3 September 2009"," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","I watch a lot of movies and I really enjoy a good movie, but I'm quite critical of lame predictable, boring typical Hollywood plots etc. So I'm known to be a lot harsher on movies than my friends.<br/><br/>I've only ever given one other movie a 10/10, and that is Samsara (very diff genre), there might be others but I'm just including that to show that in hundreds or thousands of movies, I've given a 10/10 probably twice.<br/><br/>The movie is just brilliant, perfect. There was not one part which was badly made, or they could have done better. Its a masterpiece. Its extremely original, the characters are brilliant, the aliens are brilliant. The CGI is thrilling and brilliant. I'm really amazed. This movie is not just money thrown at crap like most big budget action movies.<br/><br/>If there is a sequel, I really hope they have a plot as solid as this before they make it. Sequels are generally a disgrace to the original.<br/><br/>I'm also really impressed with this as a South African movie. So far SA movies have been at best decent or semi-decent. 4-6 out of 10. I really hope its a catalyst for the SA film industry. I'm sick of seeing the big Hollywood actors playing lame characters in predictable roles and overused themes.<br/><br/>Forget everything you've read, expect nothing, then go see it."

","If you are a person who sees some social commentary in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, then you will dig DISTRICT-9. It is a story full of action on the screen, and full of thoughtful context to contemplate later.<br/><br/>After years of reading IMDb reviews, this is the movie that inspired me to sign up to post a review. I walked out of the theater today and started calling people I know who might see a SciFi movie. Almost every conversation started with me saying, ""Without a doubt, DISTRICT 9 is the best SciFi move so far in 2009."" At least, it is my favorite. (GOODBYE SOLO, LEMON TREE and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN are other current non-SciFi raves of 09.) I might go see it again before opening weekend is over! Before seeing D-9, I enjoyed ""Live in Joberg"" and the on-line advertising, all work with great detail that is interesting in itself. I also appreciate how the trailers and web-based features compliment the movie, contributing to the world of the movie without giving away spoilers from the movie itself.<br/><br/>I understand the people who do not like camera techniques that use interviews, hand-held ""news"" footage and security cams to build up the story. Before going, I was worried the movie would be in ""fake documentary"" style. It is not, at least not from beginning to end. The style should be very familiar to most people. Try flipping through your TV channels at home, particularly the ""news"" channels, and you might be surprised to see other stories about non-Humans that involve neither science nor fiction."

","Attention potential viewers, I don't regularly give out the 10 stars but this time I did. Just like Phil Jackson's touch that wins NBA championships for the Lakers, Producer Peter Jackson puts his golden stamp on this movie ensuring an epic film and an Oscar for something.<br/><br/>Of course, hats off to Neill Blomkamp for directing and co-writing this science fiction masterpiece.<br/><br/>This movie has the perfect balance of action, comedy, drama, sci-fi, plus a touch of human (and alien) emotion. What you see on screen is believable. None of that Transformer crap where a technically advanced robot can't kill a human running on foot.<br/><br/>You get the feeling you are on location watching everything unfold. You are engrossed in the movie from the start. Not one audience member made a sound in the theater I saw it in. This movie is intense.<br/><br/>Once again it goes to show that to make a great movie you don't need to waste money on over-rated & over-paid actors and actresses.<br/><br/>A must see!!! There will definitely be a second movie to this one!"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","9","18","14 August 2009"," A classic in the making.
","Modern warfare is a tough genre to master in terms of film. There's no doubt about it. What's even tougher is futuristic warfare, especially when dealing with aliens. When it comes to that, it's easy to make mistakes and make your film extremely cheesy, unrealistic, and boring. Fortunately, Neill Blomkamp's ""District 9"" is none of those things, and may be one of the most innovative and genre defining films of all time. I might even go as far to say that it's the most innovative and potentially classic science fiction film of the decade. ""District 9"" is immersing and absorbing in the beginning, and once Neill Blomkamp firmly grounds us in his reality, he takes us on one of the most exciting action packed rides I've ever been through.<br/><br/>I think one of the major selling points of this one is the extreme realism. Like ""Cloverfield"", it starts out as a documentary style film, however, the interviewed subjects tell the story in retrospect, as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. The hand-held camera is always present, though the film doesn't rely on it for cheap effects, nor does it remain a pure ""day in the life"" type of film that ""Cloverfield"" did. It tells a compelling story that is never cliché, and the narrative is what ultimately drives the film, not the action...which is more than I can say for most of the recent science fiction ""films"".<br/><br/>The story here is more than just about the alien presence on Earth. It's a common story: a fight for survival, on both sides. Both the humans and the aliens are unfamiliar with each other, therefore it results in the more powerful of the races (the humans), almost enslaving the aliens into a pseudo-prison, District 9. Rather than taking the cliché action movie approach, Blomkamp's incredible storytelling ability allows him to focus on a select story within this massive existence. ""District 9"" is so immersed in an alternate reality that Blomkamp could easily tell numerous stories from within this world he has constructed, but he chose the most human and natural of stories to connect to the audience with. It is because of this that the audience not only becomes totally pulled in by the story, but is able to connect with the characters on a different level, especially the non-humans. There are clever parallels between this and modern racism, apartheid, and of course, World War II, but the similarities are never broadcast right into the viewers face, so it is acceptable.<br/><br/>It really is rare to find a film that tells such an immersing story that ensnares the viewer in addition to providing top of the line entertainment. If you're looking for the most thrilling action of the year, look no further. Forget about mutant humans, transforming alien robots, Skynet, or teenage wizards. Blomkamp's simply stellar direction makes the last 40 minutes of the movie one of the most riveting 40 minutes of any movie I have ever seen. While the film is a bit slow in the beginning as Blomkamp sets the foundation for his immersing reality, the final act of the film is almost non-stop action that will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is definitely amongst the most well made movies I've ever seen. The aliens, while they might look like colorful ripoffs of the main villain from Men In Black, are incredibly detailed and meticulously put together. You really can't tell if it's CGI or a guy in a very well made suit. The set decoration and art direction...wow. You want to see what a slum looks like, forget about ""Slumdog Millionaire"", it's this one. The titular District is part of what makes the film so realistic, and the look of everything in it is simply stellar. Makeup also plays a large role in the film, and it is very well done. ""District 9"" also has an incredible sound mix and edit going on. To put it simple, it's definitely one you need to catch in the theater. I'm not really going to discuss the acting in the film, though I will say the film's protagonist and antagonists were all very good, well written characters with very human and realistic actions running through them. In the end, however, despite all these other great benefits it has, ""District 9"" is driven by the story to the very end.<br/><br/>I really believe that I watched a classic tonight. It's a film that will revolutionize everything we know about the classic ""alien invasion"" story, and carve out its place amongst the all time action classics like ""The Terminator"". In fact, in the end, I felt like ""District 9"" was a ""Terminator"" for the modern age (I'm not talking about the two post-2000 entries in the series). The film is a can't miss for anyone who enjoys science fiction, or the art of film-making. I really can't find a flaw in this incredible work from Neill Blomkamp."

","Oh dear, where should I start? This film is complete and utter crap! I am literally amazed that I was swayed into watching this by the fact that it is so critically acclaimed. Why are so many people blinded into believing that this film is good? Can the critics not see what is so glaringly obvious to myself and any other person with a bit of common sense in regards to recognising character and plot development? There are no likable characters in this film even though we are supposed to feel empathy towards the passive aggressive aliens. They are depicted as being some sort of helpless subordinate creature that has unfortunately been held captive in South Africa for 20 years and now the Nigerian mob have been allowed to move in and trade cat food for weapons. Whoever wrote this storyline must have been high because I just don't get it, and don't get me started on the cringe worthy acting. The main character doesn't seem to fit at all and is so uncharismatic I've already forgotten his name.<br/><br/>I tried to convince myself to look at the positives of this film, and yet as I scratch my head I still can't think of any. People might say it is a realistic portrayal of what might happen if 1.8 million aliens decide to plonk their arse on earth, but why would an army of aliens advanced enough for inter galactic travel be just bumming around living like pikey's and trading their vastly superior technology for cat food. Would the American government not step in and have these aliens quarantined or taken to area 51. Na, I suppose the entire world would just turn a blind eye and let a gang of Nigerians sort it out. Seriously, the holes are there for everyone to see. just don't conform to the majority's point of view and pull the wool from over your eyes. This one stinks!"
"philip-fancher","5","12","26","16 August 2009"," At face value
","This film is good at first glance, having the feel of a documentary and a sci-fi movie at the same time. The feel that I left with is that the story did not explore a lot of what would go on. What of the rest of the world? If aliens landed anywhere, there would be interventions from any number of countries, and South Africa would take careful steps to not allow what happened in the movie. Also, what of the views of the humanitarians (which on any subject there are some)? There was not any pro-alien ideas presented, so the documentary angle did not work in that respect. The realism of the movie suffers on these accounts.<br/><br/>What I did like of the movie was the way that it threw you into the middle of the problem, giving you back story by showing you news clips of the years prior. The setting of South Africa was a different place to set such a story, which was good in my opinion, and the aliens seemed to take on the way of life. The humans taking advantage of the aliens made the movie feel more realistic, or in the suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is fun to watch, but it fails in the sense that it does not cover the scope of what would happen if this situation would arise, or a situation close to this. 5/10 stars."

How can a movie that pits African Indigenious people against a minority alien species make for a good movie review. It is plain reverse racism and the movie appears to have little in the way of a plot other then show how a impoverished community would deal with a minority group from another planet. The special effects in the movie were well done without going over the top, but the plot was missing much detail. Out of 10 - I would give it a 2. The 2is for the special effects that were average."

","FINALLY there's a good example of a perfect sci-fi movie. Genre seemed to be dying, but thanks to people like Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson it still is alive.<br/><br/>Movie got my attention from the teaser trailer back in may. Actually, i was kinda worried: movies that look great on trailers usually suck in general. But the movie proved to be an amazing exclusion from this rule.<br/><br/>Firstly, its completely non-standard. I was surprised when i figured out that the clumsy, nerdy, annoying bureaucrat is actually a main hero. You don't see very often a protagonist lacking any kind of ""screen cuteness"". If he'd die in the beginning i'd be totally fine with that (shouting ""in your face!"" meanwhile) and the way the movie was going i was thinking he will indeed die. <br/><br/>Second, amazing CGI. Every computer generated object blended in the scene and that was very nice. All the ""prawns"" were real-life like. Panoramic view of main ship looked just incredible. <br/><br/>Cinematography deserves a lot of credit. Its not ""Blair Witch"" and ""Cloverfield"" type crazy moving ""hand-held"" camera, which gives nausea. It balances between hand-held shots and cinematic shots, what creates a balance between a movie and documentary.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some flaws in the story, like why aliens had so many weapons and not use them, or why they could be used only by aliens (gun could identify DNA?! that's too much even for alien technology), or why Wikus wasn't ""collecting"" the bullets when he was in the alien suit, like the suit did that before. But i loved how director kept these questions unanswered, just by showing them irrelevant.<br/><br/>Would love to see more movies like that. And to find out if Christopher kept his promise. <br/><br/>PS: they mentioned ""prawn hookers"", but never showed how it works :)"

","There used to be a time, oh, about 5 years ago when I would use IMDb reviews to decide whether or not a movie was worth my time. In those days, reviews were rarely higher than 7.5. So if something got a 6 or 7 that meant it was a quality movie. Those days are gone.<br/><br/>Nowadays, many, many substandard, sophomoric, lousy, boring, cheesy (I could check thesaurus.com for more of those type of words but you get the idea) films are getting ratings of 8.<br/><br/>This is one of them.<br/><br/>I like the premise of this movie: a nerdy-type, fish-out-of-water gets put in charge of something big & militaristic & political that he has no business being involved in and ends up over his head and we get to see how he handles it; the plight of space aliens is used as a stand-in for human racism; its filmed outside of Hollywood with no Hollywood actors; there is an aspect of realism to it; the main character grows and has a change of heart.<br/><br/>But other than the premise, there is not much I enjoyed about the actual movie. There's a plot that's full of holes (its never explained why that guy is put in charge of an operation that potentially involves billions in weapons. Why didn't the aliens use their technology to either communicate with humans to ask for help or help themselves? Why is there only one really, really smart and compassionate alien while the rest are like brainless, swarming insects?); flat characters (Why is the model married to the nerd? We never see what makes them love each other); wall-to-wall violence and gore; silly action scenes that make no sense (the military villain guy just keeps going and going while 100's of cronies standing right beside him get blown away); nausea inducing camera work (really, its not artistic or original or gritty to do that anymore); the main actor's use of high-school-play mannerisms (he's supposed to be nerdy and the way we are made to know this is that he stutters out every second word 'ah, an, and, and, and.....I c, I ca, I can't, I can't do that....wh, wha, wha, what?) <br/><br/>If you like blow ups, gore, no character or story development, extensive use of the word fohck, a hero its impossible to give a fohck about, and lots of CGI, this one's for you and you'll be sure to give it a 9 in your review.

","Aliens land in Johannesburg and are kept in encampment for two decades before they start running amok. The first half an hour or so of this movie plays like a comedy - like a spoof of sci-fi films. It then turns into a silly sci-fi film that is mildly entertaining but rambles on much too long. The aliens are portrayed as thug-like and they look quite ridiculous. Apparently the film has some serious underlying message about apartheid and discrimination, but the plot is too silly to take anything here seriously. Even within the ground rules established by the film, the central plot device involving spaceship fuel makes no sense."
"shaw-simon","9","6","11","8 September 2009"," Instant classic of the genre...its that good.
","District 9 feels like a very original cinematic experience; more so in tone rather than content. Alien arrival and body shock elements are classic sci-fi but the way this film manipulates the familiar is both new and exciting for the genre. Aliens aren't threateningly unfamiliar here - they are persecuted and put into asylum! A designated shanty town to segregate the ""prawns"" from the humans - now there's a great concept and one that manages to speak for human intolerance, racism and all the inadequacies that stem from our self appointed ruling dominance over all other living things.<br/><br/>That brings me to how misanthropic this movie really is; thats not a slight against it, but the protagonist is a barely redeemable character whilst every other human is emblematic of the more disgusting traits of human nature. You really are rooting for the strangely likable aliens all of the way. The pseudo-documentary feel implies that the film makers believe 'this is what would happen, if aliens arrived', and the grim actions of corporate agencies lend the film a disconcerting believability. Little Miss Sunshine this ain't, you will leave the cinema fascinated, thrilled, awe-struck and yet appalled! I certainly have to see a film this year that has made such an impression.<br/><br/>There are a few hokey elements that rather hack handedly force the characterisation but D9 wouldn't necessarily be a better film without them. For the sake of this review, I'm trying to think of flaws but thinking of District 9 really just wants makes me want to see it all over again."
"daveygandthekeyboard","9","6","11","16 August 2009"," Thoughtful, violent, awesome sci-fi flick
","This movie starts off in a bit of a jarring style, like an episode of ""COPS"" meets ""the X-Files"" meets CNN as it fills in the background of the story: Alien ship hovers over Johannesburg, earth people eventually decide to intercept it, finding scores of malnourished and sick aliens aboard. These aliens are taken to the planet surface and interred at a fenced in area known as District 9. Twenty years go by, the aliens live among the trash in what has grown into a crowded slum. Enter the new head of the ""eviction"" process, Wikus Van De Merwe. This eviction is designed to move all these cat-food eating trash-dwelling aliens into a facilitywell, a little further away from the city. What follows is then a terrifying story about transformation, violence, intolerance, and ultimately, salvation. At times this is a hard movie to watch, with all the vomiting and noise and very jarring narrative style. It settles in to a more conventional story about halfway through, as we see the main character and an alien named ""Christopher"" working together, and then we see the horror inflicted upon the aliens in District 9. There is a lot to like here. This is a visually interesting movie with a lot of real-world parallels, and it has many elements of other sci-fi: Alien Nation, Aliens, Transformers, The X-Files, and maybe any number of Outer Limits episodes come to mind. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but anyone who is into thoughtful science-fiction should definitely check it out."
"LiquidDynamite","9","6","11","15 August 2009"," Incredible!
","I just saw this at a promotional screening through my college. It was fantastic.<br/><br/>As the movie description states, a giant flying saucer comes to earth in and does nothing. Eventually we brake our way in and find starving and seemingly unintelligent insectoid like aliens which then are housed in a ghetto like slum within Cape Town called District 9.<br/><br/>I knew almost nothing about the film when I entered the cinema. Regardless however, there is little anyone can say to prepare you for how fantastic this film is. After beginning as a 'mock-u-mentary' style film following a member of MNU (the company contracted to administer District 9) as he ludicrously serves eviction notices to Aliens to be resettled, the film breaks away from this (and thankfully the shaky cam) after the main character is exposed to Alien bio-technology and is forced to flee into District 9 after becoming hunted for experimentation. While this sounds a little like a lame B grade Sci-fi, there is plenty of clever humor added in at the right parts and the story is very concise and well told. Whether it is the Aliens being addicted to cat food or the hilarious final scene where the robot combat suit in the trailer is used your never too bored. Our bungling hero is perfectly cast and constantly dropping the F-Bomb in his South African accent.<br/><br/>The acting is solid with Sharlto Copley nailing his part. The special effects are almost flawless despite the incredibly modest budget of 30 million. The pace is good and just as scenes started to wind down for me things moved along quickly so I was never bored. The comedy is at times priceless, like gangsters peddling cat food to Aliens.<br/><br/>This is a must for sci-fi fans for sure, and I think it'll be incredibly successful, but if you don't mind being a little freaked out this one is a good film to catch. Instant top 10 as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it's worth watching to see what happens when the alien weapons are used, simply hilarious."

","Saw it last night and understand some of the critiques about the handi-cam footage. I don't think it was overdone or too shaky but I did have a moment of doubt at the beginning on how long it would continue -- setting mood is one thing, a whole movie would have been overkill. I feel bad for the folks that gave up on that and walked out early; once it transitioned into mainstream shooting style the story really took off.<br/><br/>The plot was easy to follow, and was much deeper and darker than I had even hoped. The main character, much more like a real person than a Hollywood character, had a wide range of emotions and his personality wasn't clear-cut or overly predictable. The film gives you the feeling of someone really making decisions on the fly and reacting to the events in the best way he knows how (not THE best way). That might be the best aspect of the film (cookie cutters belong in the kitchen, not the cinema).<br/><br/>The CGI effects were done well enough to let me suspend disbelief and enjoy the story. The alien weapons impacts were definitely intense. Folks will either detest the gore or be awed by it... I was definitely awed and most of the audience at my screening seemed to be also.<br/><br/>Overall, it was thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi, with a lot more story than the average summer shoot'em up. Highly recommend to anyone looking for something fresh and intense."
"RichardSRussell-1","9","6","11","14 August 2009"," Mud, blood, crud, and genius
","District 9 (R, 1:52) — 9 — SF, 2nd string, original<br/><br/>Years ago I read a story by Joan D. Vinge (possibly ""The Outcasts of Heaven Belt""?) that was set on a decrepit old space station. Metal was rusted. Walkways were worn. Things were broken. Stuff didn't work. ""Yessss!"", I said to myself, ""this is the way things would really be, not all shiny and efficient the way they're usually portrayed."" And, when it comes to SF movies, by ""usually"" I mean ""always"".<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>District 9 is grittily realistic. It's smeared with mud, covered with blood, and littered with crud. It's set in a slum and totally looks it. This alone would make it stand out from a crowd sufficiently to be remembered distinctly a decade from now, which is the minimal requirement I have for a 9 rating.<br/><br/>But it gets better. While the slum is on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa, it's occupied not by the traditionally oppressed black people of that nation but by an alien race that undoubtedly has a name for itself but which is known to the humans as prawns, based on their appearance — human-sized and bipedal, but with features like a cross between a shrimp and a cockroach. The humans speak nothing but Afrikaans-accented English, and the prawns speak in their own guttural, croaking tongue (with subtitles), but we focus on characters of both races who have previously interacted with each other, so they're mutually intelligible.<br/><br/>The prawns are a desperate lot. Their gargantuan starship is parked above Joburg, where it's been stranded since 1982. It came to rest there and, after months of inactivity, humans had to cut their way in, where they discovered about a million starving, sickly aliens, apparently workers (or maybe slaves) on their way to someplace else, none of whom has the vaguest idea of where they are or how to run a spaceship. Out of humanitarian concern, the international community moves them into a refugee camp in the shadow of their spacecraft.<br/><br/>We advance to 2010, by which time most of humanity has turned its attention elsewhere but the South Africans haven't been able to, since District 9 and its now 1.8 million alien refugees are a constant presence — and possible threat. The government hires international megacorp MNU (Multi-National United) to relocate them to District 10, a much more comfortable 240 km away.<br/><br/>We see most of this in what appears to be documentary film and video clips, and that style continues as we follow MNU's Wikus Van De Merwe, head of the relocation team, as he begins the bureaucratic process of serving eviction notices. Things do not go well. Wikus is separated from the rest of his team and (without giving too much away) ends up in personal possession of the secret behind the aliens' weaponry, something that had baffled Earth scientists since they 1st tried to decipher the highly effective technology decades earlier. This makes Wikus a marked man, wanted by MNU, the government, the Nigerian crime lords who control commerce within District 9, and the prawns anxious to get their secrets back. Left with nowhere to run, Wikus finds an unlikely ally in ""Christopher"", a prawn with a bright, curious tagalong offspring. (Wikus refers to them both as male, but it's not at all clear that the term is either applicable or relevant.)<br/><br/>The video-clip style continues with the use of surveillance cameras and TV newscopter footage, but eventually that style fades out in favor of straight filming, albeit with a continuing hand-held style that's highly effective for the chaotic events depicted.<br/><br/>Again, the movie goes for a look and feel that are totally realistic, and it achieves those goals. It's riveting. It meets John W. Campbell's challenge to ""describe to me an alien that thinks as well as a man but not like a man"". The prawns are as memorable as Niven and Pournelle's moties.<br/><br/>While you've undoubtedly never heard of writer-director Neill Blomkamp before, nor any of the highly effective actors (notably Sharlto Copley as Wikus), the names of the producers and FX house may ring some bells: Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, and Weta Digital. Yes, just as good as you'd expect.<br/><br/>This is an absolute mustn't-miss film for SF fans and is likely to redefine our expectations for future SF films at least as much as The Matrix did. The audience at the midnight showing I attended broke out into spontaneous applause at the end. Deservedly so."

","This is such an incredibly weird movie that I am not even sure if I can adequately describe it, but I'll try. The film is, through the first half, a mockumentary about a problematic alien problem that will supposedly be happening in the near future. In 2010, an alien ship appears over Johannesburg and just hovers there. When humans eventually decide to cut through the hull, they find the ship packed with over a million aliens--aliens that are starving and look like giant bugs. Well, there seems to be no one in charge and they all are apparently workers who have no real purpose other than to work. When the UN decides to finally do something about it, the aliens are herded into a giant ghetto like those used during apartheid. And, for the most part, they are reviled or exploited--and kept as a permanent underclass.<br/><br/>The film mostly centers around a rather dim civil servant, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). He is the leader of an organization sent in to move the bugs to a new facility that also totally sucks--but is away from the humans--who have come to totally distrust and hate them. But, in the process he accidentally infects himself...and where this goes next is just amazingly weird! And, once infected, the film stops being a mockumentary and follows his new life as a wanted man. Why is he wanted, who wants him and what this is all about is just too much for this short review--really.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the film. I used to think that movies like ""Happiness of the Katakuris"", ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" and ""Delicatessen"" were weird films, but ""District 9"" clearly sets a new standard for weird and creative. You simply cannot find anything like it--and it's wonderful to find a film that is this unique. Plus, like good sci-fi, this one is a great allegory with deeper contemporary meaning--with a lot to say about us screwed up humans! By the way, this movie is rated-R and it clearly deserves this. The language is very, very rough but the film is also very gross--with lots of blood, guys, vomiting and the like. It is NOT for a person with a weak stomach or children...seriously...do NOT let the kids see this one! Because of this, although I loved this film and was blown away by it, I also cannot see it as a perfect film--hence my not giving it a 10. It's just unnecessarily adult when it could have been a great film for a much wider audience."

","The first ten minutes of this movie were promising, but after that it was basically a zombie romp genre piece - and not a good one. I appreciate a good, campy zombie movie, but this was dumb without being either fun or interesting. Just picture all the worst elements of Avatar without a shred of what's good in Avatar. That's just too much to swallow.<br/><br/>One thing that was done well: Things looked really grimy, and that was cool. The closest movie to this (and superior) is Braindead - also associated with Peter Jackson. But that movie never forgot that it was not meant to be serious. This one started off interesting, then outed itself as a zombie-style humor piece, and then completely lost both threads and spent 60+ minutes being stupid while forgetting to be funny."

The action is phenomenal and the story is excellently paced and structured. All the acting by the unknowns are really great and the excellent transition from documentary style in the beginning to narrative is excellent!

","I was excited to see this flick, but 10 minutes into it the disappointment overwhelmed me. Everyone should be warned that while this movie has some interesting plot points and good FX, it is told lazily in that Blair Witch / Cloverfield mockumentary style complete with shaky camera and actors ""pretending"" to be in a real situation (which is rarely believable). I understand that the lead actor improvised most of his lines. It shows. Furthermore, he was an extremely distracting, unlikable Steve Carrell type. This style of storytelling may appeal to our pre-teens and our reality show buffs, but it does not make for a good film experience for the rest of us who love SciFi. So just be warned. If this is your cup of tea, you'll love it. Otherwise put this one low on your Netflix queue. I believe now that the quality of this movie mirrors a majority of the kind of folks who are defending it in this pre-pubescent manner with their flaming insults and dismissals. I've never seen a whinier bunch of defenders -- as if the movie will be ""unmade"" as a result of folks who criticize it (although that's not a bad idea). Waaa! Waaa! I ask: Aliens wearing bras delivering a touching social message of apartheid shot with a shaky cam complete with bad improvised dialogue and acting? This is what they defend so vehemently? Laughable.

","District 9 isn't in any way a masterpiece or epic in any case. But instead is highly overrated trash than can only seek good reviews from the air-heads that look at District 9's viral marketing. That aspect is the only reason why people have liked the film. As it suggests in the trailer that District 9 is going to be an epic sci-fi masterpiece, they were wrong! So many people fall for this trick. Firstly, the use of a hand-held camera completely takes the audience out of the experience unlike Public Enemies. But then again the director (Michael Mann) was experienced. Unlike Neill Blomkamp who directed District 9, and is an inexperienced director despite under the guidance of Peter Jackson who should have taken over the project from the start and should have scrapped Blomkamp.<br/><br/>Secondly, the direction is awful. I mean what humans can's understand Alien language and then respond to whatever it is the aliens are saying. The shot's in individual parts are repetitive and lousy. And finally the acting is shameful and embarrassing and the hand-held camera doesn't help in any way either."

I am now convinced that people stack ratings on films in current release to generate interest. This film was horrible. Horrible CGI; horrible acting and an extremely inane premise. Don't waste your money. Next weekend, The Time Traveler's Wife.... Things wrong with this film: 1) South African dialect is nearly impossible to understand. 2) The ""documentary"" format of the film detracts from the story. 3) While pretty to look at, the female lead is a horrible actress. 4) Like a lot of horror films today, this film can't decide on whether it wants to be a comedy or a dramatic film.

I'm sure I'll get thousands of ""unhelpful"" votes for this review, but this movie, for me, was quite the disappointment. The fanboi base must be voting this film up BIG TIME. Take the blacks under apartheid in South Africa and substitute funky aliens and you get this film. I gotta admit that the look of the aliens was well done. The portrayal of the human response to the aliens just was not well done at all. It is the absolute antithesis of how it would be done in a big budget film. The portrayal is amateurish. Humans probably would have the general mindset shown. Again, how the script portrayed the human response was bush league ... and the acting was as good as the script."

It's a boring film that falls into people's body's splitting open, and overlong gun shoot outs too frequently. It's really a boring movie, and also very stupid. People are raving about how the aliens are fully developed- I didn't find them even close to developed. Everyone's also talking about the great twist at the end-there is no great twist- just an obvious ending. Everyone's talking about how it's a late, great summer action-sci-fi-thriller, I just found it boring. It's not thrilling, it's not action packed, and the special effects are just plain awful. The main character is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a jerk who locks up the aliens who deservedly gets accused of doing sexual things to the aliens.

"mao-54","3","10","22","20 August 2009"," All hype... juvenile... no classic sci-fi here...
","Maybe it's because I'm not a computer gamer, but I just don't get all the praise about this movie. The herky-jerky, documentary style camera work got old really fast. There was no need for it once the cameraman was obviously not in the scene. And then there were a few times when the camera actually was locked down -way too few- so what gives with that ? I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, alien or human... no connection, no empathy, nothing to move me whatsoever. And the constant F bombs -hey, I'm no puritan, but it's like the movie was targeting 14 year old Beavis & But-heads. The lead character was more irritating than Jar Jar Binks. I didn't find any suspense, surprises -it was all pretty predictable. And definitely no human drama. And was there really any science ? This might have made a decent Outer Limits but, c'mon, some liquid gets sprayed on a guy and his arm mutates into a giant shrimp arm ? The deal with the weapons having to be operated by the alien race -that's old school Star Trek stuff. This was no sci-fi masterpiece. Movies like ""Contact"", ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Dark City"", ""Gattica"", ""Close Encounters"", even ""Solaris""... these are so much better. District 9 must be a setup for a shooter computer game. All I know is, District 10 will be rental only, at least for me. But then, I still remember the first ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Forbidden Planet"" ! You know... I'd have given it 8 stars if it was totally produced independently on a shoestring budget. But this had Peter Jackson's stamp on it..."
"kenneththaarup","3","7","14","23 December 2010"," Something else...
","I liked the first Peter Jackson movies. They were low budget and terribly badly made - and that's what made them funny. I wasn't a big LOTR fan, but given the material he had to make movies from, he did a pretty damn good job. King Kong was just bad - who the hell takes a big ape back to USA when there are f*cking dinosaurs?<br/><br/>So Peter Jackson's movies got worse, but when I saw the trailers for District 9, I was excited. I was hoping for some action, some comedy, and by the looks of it, a portrait of our hostility towards foreigners - in this case aliens, which I saw as a metaphor. This movie delivers none of the above.<br/><br/>The movie starts as a documentary - a bit odd, but potential to be good. Special effects are great, we're all satisfied. The movie goes on and nothing at all happens. As I got impatient and wanted at least some plot, the main character starts turning into an alien and drops his camera. Until this point the movie was a documentary of how the aliens were living and how awfully they were treated. We only saw the aliens when the cameraman (main character) were filming them.<br/><br/>After this point, we still see the damn aliens - now with subtitles, and I've seen you-tube clips with subtitles on little stupid animals that had better dialog than this. The movie turns into an immature and meaningless flick where the main character, who is turning into an alien, tries to fit in with the aliens while fighting the government who wants to run tests on him while he is trying to escape the planet with some aliens. And problems keep on coming; he has a girlfriend who he wants to be with even though he's a f*cking alien - get a grip dude!<br/><br/>So to sum up, this is a documentary that turns into a... Uhm... Not a documentary when the cameraman loses his camera. It has no plot, no meaning, has no action (which is one of the three genres), and it only relates the aliens to foreigners in the beginning - that part goes bye bye with the camera.<br/><br/>I give it 3 stars: 1 for the pretty special effects. 1 for tossing 30 million dollars in the toilet (I wanna do that, and yes it was actually that expensive!) 1 for at least being better than all of Julia Robert's films.<br/><br/>Wanna watch a good sci-fi film with pretty effects? See Star Wars Episode 3 and don't waste time or money on this piece of garbage!"
"masterjk2","3","7","14","8 October 2010"," Drivel
","Although Peter Jackson is a talented man, his talent was clearly subsumed by moronity. But have to give the progenitors of this nonsense credit, it's an audience pleaser, if you're under 20. The lead actor was good. The animation was OK, but hardly original. It was a combination of Transformers and Dead Man's Chest, both superior to this attempt. And the music was a limp attempt to copy Hans Zimmer. The biggest problem? The immaturity of the whole thing. I don't need to see ANOTHER movie with mechanical creatures, mechanical acting and a mechanical plot probably written by a computer. People who have allowed computers to become their promary mode of communication and have little true interaction with other human beings, except on Facebook may think this is great writing. It's not. I see that the movie got a very high rating. If it's a rating based on Video game plots, acting and ""human"" emotions, fine. If it's based on an art form which really represents the classic elements of great writing, it's woefully lacking. I gave it 3 stars for the prawns, who seemed more ""human"" than the humans."
"Naurya","3","7","14","24 September 2009"," Plot could have been so much better, if they had focused on cultural clash!
","I admit it, I really fell for the marketing campaign! Those postcards saying ""Toilet use only for humans"", etc. were just hilarious and I instantly put one up on the toilet door in my flat. My flatmates all had a good laugh and so I decided to see the movie that gave us the funniest marketing stuff in years.<br/><br/>Actually, I didn't really look up the plot before going to see the film. I just had these ""No aliens allowed"" and ""No humans allowed"" signs in my mind and I concluded that the movie must be about alien discrimination. As I knew from the trailer it was an action-packed, I thought it would probably be about aliens striking back after years of oppression, defeating the humans and then putting them into a slum district - certainly mixed with a lot of action, fighting, shooting and probably blood and alien guts - but never losing the message of racial discrimination.<br/><br/>Well, that's what I expected, but not what I got! What I got was a rather lame story with non-credible characters. Not only was the alien race portrayed as the ones with superiour technology, but none the less stupid and just senselessly violent - the humans were also very weak flat characters, all of them. I never really sympathized with Wikus, I didn't really get an image of how he lived and what he believed in. His wife was little more than an extra. Also, more generally, you didn't get much insight into the two clashing cultures of the humans and the aliens. The only ""cultural information"" was that the aliens are addicted to cat food. Hmmmmm, very clever idea! When you choose to have dialogue with an alien speaking to another alien (which I found difficult to follow sometimes, as I didn't always get which alien was speaking now, because the voices all sounded pretty much the same and I can't read subtitles and at the same time look which alien is moving its mouth or rather those tentacles!), then why don't you at least let them talk about their culture, how they became oppressed, how terrible they feel under this discrimination, and how it is their dream to return home? The father-son pairing would be the ideal opportunity to do that. The father could tell his young son, who has never seen his home world, how it is at home and how he longs to be back there. This would give us so much more insight into the aliens' feelings and motivations. But none of that!<br/><br/>SPOILER Instead of working on the issue of a cultural clash and its consequences, we're just given this rather boring chase for an alien liquid! And why the hell isn't there more inner conflict in Wikus as to where he really belongs? I mean, when he's turning into an alien, obviously this isn't affecting his way of thinking, which would be far more interesting! He could begin to understand the way the aliens think and feel and regret what he did to them earlier, even try to mediate between aliens and humans against all obstacles.END SPOILER<br/><br/>You see, I've got a thousand ideas how to make the plot more interesting, but the producers opted for the most boring alternative and though everything would be fine, if they include a transformer-like robot-thing in the end and have a lot of action and shooting... For me, it was a huge disappointment. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's just that it could have been so much better. And I agree with other reviewers here: I definitely won't watch ""District 10"", if it is ever released."

I think its well worth seeing.<br/><br/>I would have given this a 10, but there was one massive plot flaw that undermined much of the motive force of the plot. Simply put, why the hell didn't the aliens use their weapons?????? They clearly knew how powerful they were, in this vein, there was something incomplete about the movie, the super precious liquid was made in a grungy shack and hidden carelessly by these clearly very smart aliens. Such inconsistency is fine is a typically lousy summer movie, but this movie is better than that. I get the fact that this was inexpensively made and solving the plot for a more nuanced ""weapons"" situation would have made this a better movie. To be clear, typically oppressed populations do not have access to weapons of this caliber, if they did, they wouldn't be oppressed. For example, if the Palestinians had a real military, real power, there wouldn't be an Israeli occupation, there might be a real war, but it wouldn't essentially be a war of prison guards against prisoners. Hezbollah, no matter what one thinks of them, had real weapons and backed Israel down. Although, this seems off topic for the movie, the movie is actually trying to say something foundational about humans. I think it mostly works at this level, but the plot simply blows up regarding power."

"wickerman1972","8","7","14","16 August 2009"," Very good but one nagging problem
","I just got back from watching it (Was only $2.25 for matinée, cheapest that I know of. My drink cost me $1.50 more than the movie did.) I'll try to not write anything that is a spoiler but I have to mention some plot points in order to express my opinion of it.<br/><br/>The movie has two different feels, the first half has a lot of docudrama stuff and more comedy than I would have guessed. The second half is action packed and is a real nail biter. I didn't find it as depressing as some people have described to me. Because of what they'd said I was expecting it to be a real tear jerker. But really it wasn't. Sure, it does tug at your emotions and you find yourself rooting for the aliens (It's hard not to cheer for the guy getting kicked around.) but there are much, much more depressing movies out there.<br/><br/>There were some things about it that seemed a little odd. For one thing with the exception of one of the aliens and his son most of them behave as though they are barely intelligent. It kinda' left me wondering how in the heck this race was able to build a spaceship and travel to other star systems. Many of them parade around beating their chests and behaving like gullible children when presented with cat food, etc. The movie never really explained why the one alien seemed so much more intelligent than the majority of them so I found myself imagining my own reasons, like maybe most of the smarter, more scientific ones were killed off in the ship when they started starving to death. Perhaps it was mostly physically strong but not very well educated workers that survived. Or maybe the aliens have never been presented with deception before, perhaps don't even understand the concept of it, and that's why it is so easy to take advantage of them. Beats me, but I wish the movie would have given me something to explain their ignorance and naivety. It didn't even try to. Instead I'm left making guesses as to the cause of it. Basically it comes down to you look at them and you look at what they've built and it doesn't appear to add up. It seems like oil and water.<br/><br/>So my biggest problem with this film is that it seemed to me that the aliens presented in it didn't seem smart enough to be able to travel here in the first place. Humans have total control of the situation and bully around these space travelers as easily as they would a colony of monkeys. The aliens are armed to the teeth with sophisticated weaponry that blows ours away but instead of using or at least threatening to use it to demand better treatment of themselves they sell them...for cat food! I don't know, this part of the movie just really didn't wash with me. Seems to me that if aliens capable of space travel are no smarter than that then when mankind develops similar technology it would be able to take over the entire galaxy with ease.<br/><br/>What I did like about the film is the portrayal of humanity's reaction to the aliens. I think this is presented quite realistically. It is expected that the aliens' appearance would revolt them and the behavior of the visitors doesn't help their cause either. As mentioned before they spend most of their time carrying on like animals rather than sentient beings so people not wanting them around them makes perfect sense to me. In fact, the film actually depicts people as being quite patient with them. After all, it takes two decades before the humans in the area start demanding that they be moved. The military is shown to act in a comically evil way towards them but bare in mind that it took many years to escalate into that. At first people, even the government and military, embrace them with open arms. But because of the aliens' behavior I don't see how things could have ended up any other way. Over time I think people kept getting a lower and lower opinion of them, a feeling that they were dealing with something barely intelligent (Hey, that's the way I was feeling so it was pretty easy for me to identify with them thinking the same thing.). And this probably led them to start viewing them as animals and we know how we treat animals. Once a feeling of superiority was achieved it isn't hard to imagine that exploitation, hard treatment, experimentation, killing without feeling remorse, etc., would follow.<br/><br/>I suppose the aliens' apparent brainlessness was necessary for the director to tell the kind of story he wanted to. After all, if the aliens were carrying on in a brilliant manner how could he portray humanity abusing them with such relative ease? But I just can't see how a race like that could build such amazing technology. It just didn't seem to make sense. Yes, there is one alien and his son who appear appropriately intelligent but all the others act as though they've been lobotomized. They can speak, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I did like this movie despite the one major criticism I have of it. The second half is especially fun, like a roller coaster ride. I recommend it. I'll give it an 8 out of 10. Btw, I think a sequel is very likely. It had the type of ending that left a lot of questions unanswered and plot points unresolved. Hopefully a part 2 will explain why most of them were so freakin' stupid!"

","Just like last year's CLOVERFIELD, TriStar Pictures have surprisingly managed to avoid giving away too much of the film in the trailers and TV spots. This is fortunate, because this is one of those films that is better the less you know about it, like ORPHAN, A PERFECT GETAWAY, and KNOWING. To continue this trend, I'll try to give little to no information about the movie in this review. The movie is about an extraterrestrial race being forced to live in slum conditions in District 9. That may give you a very vague idea of what's in this film and that's all I'll reveal.<br/><br/>I must also add that this is nothing like CLOVERFIELD nor BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The film is shot documentary style for most of the first few minutes of the film, but, overall, it's a straightforward narrative. What makes this such a great film is that it's fresh and original in its approach. It's an effects-heavy flick, yes, but it has a heart and soul. It's not a dumb action flick like TRANSFORMERS 2 or G.I. JOE and, on top of that, it deals with themes like prejudice, apartheid, greed, and several others that is too numerous to list here.<br/><br/>However, if you're not that kind of a person who likes themes or allegory in their action movies, the film can be seen as an entertaining action flick with a plot and characters. Newcomer Sharlto Copley certainly does a swell job playing a quite multi-layered character. He's our protagonist in this film. The visual effects are surprisingly seamless, considering the fact that it has a relatively low budget ($30 million to be exact). I also liked the unique design of the aliens.<br/><br/>The length for this review is shorter than most of my other's because I want you to walk into this movie with a clean slate. This is one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen this year and it's a fresh and unique take with aliens coming to Earth. After all, they didn't land in New York. The film is carried by a strong performance by Copley as well as a fantastic directorial debut by Neill Blomkamp. It also deals with some heavy subject matter, unusual for a summer flick, but it also has all the action that will satisfy your needs."

","Science fiction is often perceived as a genre dominated by explosions and spacecraft chases strung together by mere whispers of plot. However, there are some science fiction films that transcend this stereotype and use the genre as a forum to discuss a larger issue. District 9 belongs to this upper echelon of science fiction movies.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp, District 9 transports us to world where aliens referred to as Prawns have landed on earth some twenty years ago and after the tension between the two races escalates to violence, the slum District 9 is created to house the Prawns. This is the backdrop of this incredibly well crafted story. The actual plot I will not discuss, as it is better to walk into District 9 knowing as little as possible. District 9 achieves an incredible balancing act that few blockbusters even attempt. It is blends science fiction and political drama flawlessly, fusing them together with a healthy does of in your face action and violence.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's script does not shy away from the complex and deep themes that drive the film. Running just under two hours, the film has a brisk pace but is by no means in a hurry. Blomkamp takes the time to set up a believable political and social backdrop for the mayhem to ensue. And even as the bullets fly and spectacular action sequences unfold, it still never loses sight of it's original intentions. That being said, District 9 is no pensive drama, it's a solid action film. It just so happens to have something to say as well.<br/><br/>Filmed for an amazingly cheap 30 million dollars, District 9 is a sight to behold. The film looks and sounds amazing. The films star, first time actor Sharlto Copley does an outstanding job as the film's hero Wikus. The performances are strong and fill out this completely convincing reality. <br/><br/>District 9 is both exciting and thought provoking. Something few blockbusters can manage. It is without a doubt, a must see film."

","I never take the effort of posting or rating anything on IMDb. I just can't leave this one.... It was so horrible! I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi! Sometimes its just fun to watch, it tickles your imagination. Sometimes you have Sci-Fi movie that gives you an inside in ""what if"". This film tries to do the latter and fails miserably at both. OK, the concept of how poorly people might react to aliens seeking asylum is an interesting concept, this was just a caricature of human behavior! And the changes in the behavior of the characters both alien and human were sudden and unrealistic.<br/><br/>I want to go into detail but that would make this comment be flagged as containing a spoiler and I want to warn people about not seeing this movie. There are too many comments being so positive and being voted for. The histogram gives you a perfect 10 score, the budget was 30 million. For a lot less there are enough people willing to vote and write positive comments! SO please watch for yourself and leave comments and ratings like mad, ty!"
"MBunge","5","5","9","24 January 2011"," I may not be the best judge of this film
","District 9 is a brutal and uncompromising film with a wonderful concept and real visual flair. It's also not nearly as smart or bold as people say.<br/><br/>I should preface this review by acknowledging that my opinion of this movie may be colored by the fact that it made me physically ill. It's yet another pseudo-documentary shot in the style of hand held video, so the camera is constantly swerving and jerking and shaking about. Before it was halfway over, my motion sickness kicked in and I spent the rest of the film with a headache and an upset stomach. If you were bothered by The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield, you'll be bothered by District 9.<br/><br/>And besides making me ill, the camera work is also the single biggest problem with this movie. Parts of the film are clearly supposed to be ""real"" footage shot by a ""real"" cameraman, yet there are other parts of the film where no camera or cameraman existsand it looks exactly the same as the pseudo-documentary footage. It completely destroys the illusion of verisimilitude that's the whole point of using the pseudo-documentary approach. Because the ""real"" footage and the stuff the audience sees as omniscient observers looks exactly the same, it only emphasizes how artificial everything is.<br/><br/>The story is about aliens forced to live in a segregated slum when their spaceship basically parks itself above Johannesberg, South Africa. The aliens, called ""prawns"", live in an apartheid state of oppression and abuse. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is a nebbishy middle-manager for the agency in charge of the ""prawns"" who, because he's married to the boss' daughter, is assigned to lead the effort to move the aliens to new and even harsher living arrangements. Then something happens to Van De Merwe that makes him appreciate the horrible things being done to the aliens and he resolves to do what he can to help them escape.<br/><br/>This is an excellently made film from most of the technical perspectives. The special effects are amazing and innovative. The story is reasonably well thought out. Sharlto Copley does a very good job portraying Van De Merwe as a realistically non-heroic character. There are a bunch of really interesting ideas alluded to throughout the script.<br/><br/>It's hard to get emotionally involved in the movie, however. Besides the artifice of the pseudo-documentary style, the only significant human character in the story is Van De Merwe, and he's so unlikeable and unsympathetic that it's hard to care what happens to him. When the most appealing person in a film is a computer generated, 7 foot tall, repulsive insectthat's kind of a problem. District 9 also never does more than allude to interesting ideas. It doesn't do anything more with the ""aliens living in South African apartheid"" concept than the James Cann/Mandy Patinkin buddy movie Alien Nation did with the ""extraterrestrial immigrants trying to assimilate in America"" concept. And there's nothing in this movie about aliens being mistreated by humans that we haven't already seen in at least 7 Star Trek, 37 X-Files and 43 Stargate episodes. <br/><br/>I fear I'm being too negative about District 9 because it made me want to throw up. It's a graphically violent and somewhat simplistic morality tale that's a bit like the Star Trek remake. It has flaws, but overcomes them to be fairly enjoyable. As long as it doesn't make you puke."

","The fact that this movie is already on IMDb's top 250 and on such a high position is surreal.It goes to show you what hype can do for a movie and unfortunately it also shows that IMDb is losing credibility. District 9 tells the story of an extraterrestrial race that arrived at our planet in the 80's.These aliens are since then forced to live in slums and they have to withstand terrible conditions of living. Man have named this place District 9 and it holds more then a million aliens.The movie starts in a documentary-style showing what is happening in the slums and what is the opinion of several individuals about this aliens.Then the film focus on a government agent who was exposed to the aliens biotechnology...First of all, there are a ton of plot-holes,and I'm not talking about little things,these are major aspects of the plot that affect the story in a large scale. I do like the science fiction genre and I always go into these movies with an open-mind but when things just don't make sense its hard to enjoy a movie. Even Sci fi movies have to have some coherence and logic. District 9 is also filled with clichés. From the mother ship who looks exactly like the ship in Independence day to the aliens who look like insectoids.I mean, this has been done so many times.Break the mold already.Also the storyline of the government agent helping one of the aliens, so that he can help him in return isn't really that interesting to be honest....I think that if the director had chosen to focus on the coexistence of humans and aliens for instance and the possible struggle between the two races this movie could have been somewhat interesting and more importantly, original. Don't believe the hype,District 9 is just another summer blockbuster, lots of explosions, noise and gci but little interest,no substance and no originality whatsoever.<br/><br/>6/10"

I was pretty excited during the TV previews and then went online to the viral sites, extended trailers and the few reviews that were out there and was completely stoked to go see it. This film has sooooo many holes in it that I can't even explain them all without going into two or three paragraphs and spoiling (???) the ending (and the beginning, middle). Trust me on this one, it's not a highly intelligent Sci-fi film with great social commentary or finally a great Sci-fi film like the reviews lead you to believe ... wait for this one on DVD or better yet cable!!!"

Most of the time I was completely disgusted with the crap they were showing.

Definitely a must see movie, i loved the mockumentary style at the beginning it was just brilliant, full of action and the aliens are phenomenal. The facial expressions the aliens is give is just an awesome experience. For a lower budget (30 mil) the graphics are incredibly real and precise. The action picks up a whole lot in the second part of the film and it keeps you paying close attention. This is an incredibly real story line that is a little scary that it could actually happen but none the less a fantastic film from Jackson and Blomkamp. Very will written as well and very original!!!

I registered on IMDb specifically to warn people to ignore the empty hype. It tries to be CloverField, Blairwitch while trying to be an intelligent film. It is NOT. Great premise, absolutely horrible execution, if any at all. There are many bad movies out there, but this one should win an award for reaching new heights of stupidity. I have seen others on here compare this film to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" (1951) Don't insult the intelligence and brilliance of that timeless film, it had a great premise and it was brilliantly executed. District 9 is a whole lot of noise I am sad to say because I believe those involved in this project had good intentions. Nonetheless: epic fail and easily forgotten. Don't waste your time or money."
"talkymeat","7","9","20","20 August 2009"," Highly Overrated!
","District 9 centers around the slum of the same name that a race of aliens were sent into by the U.S. government. During a relocation effort the main character is infected with alien DNA and he must join up with and alien and his son so they can get home and he can get back his humanity. <br/><br/>Sounds interesting right, well it really isn't. Don't get me wrong the concept is extremely original and the way it is done is also not like any other sci-fi movie I have ever seen, but in the end it just doesn't work that well.<br/><br/>To start with none of the characters were interesting or well developed. The main character was extremely weak. First of all the actor portraying him wasn't very good, and Second of all his personality would change from scene to scene. At the beginning of the movie he was portrayed a silly and somewhat comical character and then suddenly things get serious and the audience is supposed to care what happens to him. He was defined by what was happening to him instead of what type of person he was. If something funny was happening then he was a funny character, if something sad then he was a sympathetic character. The only back story we were given on the character is that his step dad wasn't very nice and he occasionally made things for his wife. <br/><br/>Connecting with any of the alien characters was also difficult as they were completely CGI and just spoke in weird sounds. How can you truly connect with a character with no voice and no real face. The villain was absolutely absurd and out of nowhere as well as having the magical unkillable gene that so many dumb villains do. He narrowly escaped death more times than I can count and of course they had to have the cliché showdown between him and the main character at the end. The audience was given no explanation for his hate of the aliens and at one point in the movie he actually said ""I can't believe I get paid for this, I love watching you aliens die."" Now that's just bad writing. <br/><br/>Despite the interesting concept the plot was no picnic either. Most of the action scenes had almost no setup and in essence no meaning. And with every good point there was a plot hole to cancel it out. <br/><br/>I was also left with a number of questions, for instance: Why was Van De Merwe not sedated when they were going to operate on him? Why was it so easy for Van De Merwe to escape the military base, didn't he run out into a crowded street? Why did it take so long for them to find him when he not only had his phone on but continued to call his girlfriend? How did Van De Merwe and the alien escape once they had the tube? Where was Van De Merwe planning to go when he flew the spaceship away? How did he figure out how to fly it so quick? Why did the Nigerians want a bunch of weapons they couldn't use? How come one second the spaceship is crashed and Van De Merwe couldn't fly it then the alien jumps in and it is just fine?<br/><br/>At many points the drama felt like drama for drama's sake. Not only do they have to cattle prod him to get him to shoot but they also make him shoot a live alien? <br/><br/>So overall it isn't by any means one the worst movies I have ever seen, but not near one of the best either. This should not be on the Top 250, let alone at 28 or wherever it is, and I don't see what exactly sets it apart from so many other mediocre sci-fi epics we have seen over the years."
"fsjodin","6","9","20","15 August 2009"," Soso - Could have been much better
","The first part of this review does not contain any spoilers whatsoever. In the section **Spoilers Below** there are spoilers.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this movie. I consciously avoided all trailers, reviews and articles written about the movie, all I knew was that it was a Sci-fi and that Peter Jackson was involved which was enough to set my expectations pretty high.<br/><br/>The movie also starts out in a very interesting fashion, the premise is not like your regular sci-fi movie and the way the story is initially told was interesting and well done with some pretty good acting. However half-way through the movie it turns somewhat derivative and some stretches towards the end made me think of Independence Day and believe me, that is *not* a compliment.<br/><br/>Another disappointment with this movie is that there are just too many inconsistencies and loose ends. I like sci-fi and horror movies and I don't mind suspension of disbelief but only to a certain point and only if the movie is good enough to warrant it. In this case the movie was just not good enough to have oversight with the inconsistencies and 'requests to check your thinking at the door'.<br/><br/>In all it was an OK movie, if I had not had such high hopes for it I would probably have enjoyed it more. The acting and effects were good an especially the first half was enjoyable and well acted. It is however not a masterpiece and I am a bit surprised with the endless gushing reviews. Then again I was equally surprised with the non-stop positive reviews for King-Kong, another movie that utterly disappointed me.<br/><br/>**Spoilers below** **Spoilers below** **Spoilers below** **Spoilers below**<br/><br/>My main issues with this movie, in no particular order:<br/><br/><ul><li>Out of over one million 'prawns' there are only three that are reasonably intelligent? Does that really make sense? These three guys are smart enough to create the technology to re-enable the mother-ship but the rest are as dumb as sacks of hammers??</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>These 'prawns' spend 20 years trying to create the 'fluid' that can power the mother-ship back to their home planet and when they finally achieve it, one of them does not have the smarts to say 'OK, I will sign your piece of paper' to get rid of the humans??? They could have taken off in the dormant space craft five minutes later if that had been the case. There is too big of a discrepancy between their purported intelligence and that stupid behavior. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The aliens are smart enough to create immensely powerful weapons that only they can use, but they don't use them and instead sell them for 100 cans of cat food. Come on. They are living in these slums for 20 years and there is no one among them who would say, 'hey, we have these weapons that make the humans weapons look like pea-shooters, why don't we go get some respect!'. To have these weapons play such a big part of the latter half of the movie and to somehow suggest that no one thought of using them for 20 years is silly!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How can it be that aliens that are dumb as sack of hammers somehow all learn to understand English in a period of 20 years? And how can it be that the main character understands their language without issue, even before he is 'infected'??? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When they decide to go raid the headquarters to retrieve the 'fluid' I felt like I was watching an episode of Alias (and that is not a compliment either). - ""Hey, let's go get the fluid. It will be very dangerous etc."". - ""OK, let's go do it"". Then, instantly they are blowing their way into a building. No planning, no obstacles, just a cheap cop-out by the screenwriter. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Once they are in the building looking for the 'fluid', the main character's access codes and finger-print access still works! Oh how convenient. Come on, talk about cheap.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One of the biggest and cheapest setup for a sequel I have ever seen. - ""I will be back in three years"". - ""We do not know if they will be back""... Oh, I think I have the answer to that. If it does OK at the box office it will be back alright.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The main protagonist has no knowledge of the alien technology but still he is able to fly one of their spaceships. This was when I felt the most like I was watching Independence Day. OK, so their technology can only be *used* by anyone with their genetics, fine, I have no problem with that, but to suggest that flying one of their spaceships does not require any kind of training whatsoever is *stupid*. The rest of the prawns are dumb as sacks of hammers but this guy sticks his hands in the controls and somehow just know how to operate the spacecraft? s-t-u-p-i-d</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 'mech' sequence in the end was just too formulaic. The typical 'bad guy who just will not die' syndrome followed by the 'let me talk for long enough while I point my gun at you instead of shooting you on the spot' cliché. I felt like I was watching Iron Man (which was a good movie but there I was expecting a popcorn flick).</li></ul><br/><br/>There was just too many inconsistencies like this throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The initial setup was good and interesting but they should have spent at least some time on the social structure and aspects of the alien community. Provide some sort of motivation for the inconsistencies above. It felt like someone started out with an interesting idea and a smart script but then the 'marketing heads' decided it had to be 'dumbed down' and 'actioned up' for the summer crowd."

He was so weak, played like he'd understand nothing and had almost no development throughout the story. He ruined the whole film. But the story line also got worse and worse.

The plot is incredibly shallow; it's as if one chapter were taken out of a novel and expanded into a 2-hour movie! It is a typical Hollywood shoot-out with nothing spectacular in the special effects department, and nothing groundbreaking in the plot department.

First of all I liked this movie better when in came out in 1978 and was called Holocaust. There, in that movie, the characters that play the Warsaw ghetto imprisoned Jewish population didn't have to wear left over Predator costumes. And the Nazi's weren't lead by a bumbling Frenchman with a heavy accent and a mustache. I expected at any point for the lead character to sneak back into one of the ghetto shacks and have to confront Cato.<br/><br/>If I wanted to watch some jerky camera action I could just turn on my local cable high school program and watch them ""spray the garden"" just as effectively.<br/><br/>When I saw this was a Peter Jackson film - I expected quality, but as I discovered he only produced it.

"kg2006","4","6","12","2 February 2010"," Amazingly overrated weak comedy or terrible drama?
","If this movie was meant to be mostly humorous or silly, I give it a 4 out of 10. I did laugh a couple of times, but for most of it I was just smiling at the absurdity of it. If however, this was meant as a serious movie, then I would give it a 1. Please tell me it wasn't meant to be serious. Please tell me when I heard them say ""human rights groups would be monitoring the evictions closely"" that they actually said ""nonhuman rights groups,"" because having a human rights group at the evictions of alien cockroaches makes as much sense as them being present at a whale hunt. If it was meant to be comedic, it is still pretty lazy in writing. Peta would have made more sense. But that's a sloppy line if I heard it right. If this movie was meant to be taken seriously it had many more problems. Such as the idea that the US and other countries would leave an alien ship and weapons in the hands of South Africa. Never. They could have written a few lines to explain it away well enough but they didn't bother. Or that any country would tolerate such obnoxious looking and behaving aliens on the doorstep. They would have been quarantined right at the beginning unless they were worried an alien ship would come back looking for them-a few lines would have explained it. The refugee scenario worked OK in Alien Nation because the aliens acted more human like and it was a cop drama anyway--but here, there wasn't much done in an effort to make such a scenario realistic. And the idea that one was supposed to feel sad for them--I am afraid the director didn't do a good job making me feel that way, and I avoid stepping on insects when I walk! I felt nothing for them. Spoiler: When the main character gets sprayed with goo and has a change, it was so clean and perfectly done that it reminded me of 1950s cartoons where someone drinks a potion and their head changes into a frog (while their hands stay normal). If this was serious, the guy's face would at least have had a rash! And the way they stick him in the gun for the test--it just made me smile. It was ludicrously presented. So i have to believe it was mostly meant as a comedy, but it didn't work for me. Also the use of shaky cam annoyed me, and the docudrama style was inconsistently used. I had heard it was like this generation's 2001, Robocop and Star Wars. Big praise. The movie borrowed a few elements from them but wasn't fun like those movies. The aliens spoke in a bizarre clicking fashion and the humans could perfectly understand it--in Star wars this was done in a comic book manner, and the Stormtroopers were wearing helmets that may well have had a translator device. That was cartoonish. The alien arm transformation was cartoonish. I know it was a bad summer for movies, but really, was this that much of a breath of fresh air? It only came about because the video game movie Jackson had planned was canceled-and they needed to do something with the money they had. It wasn't as if the director had a script about alien race relations sitting on a desk. And there was precious little about that in the movie. I cant remember one quotable line of dialogue. I keep coming back to it being a comedy--even the idea that Nigerians would prostitute themselves for the aliens as suggested in a line--hard to imagine. Seems more like they just threw everything they could at the screen and hope it stuck. Lucky for them they had the backing of a big studio and director. The effects were quite good though-I just wish they had used them in a better story."
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","6","12","28 August 2009"," In spite of some impressive visual effects, the action is not enough to carry the entirety of the narrative.
","District 9 begins as a mockumentary, accounting for how in the the last twenty years an alien spacecraft has hovered over Johannesburg in South Africa and how an alien inhabited camp has been established and militarised on Earth. Following violent protests from the humans however, an organisation called the MNU (Multi-National United) is established to handle all alien matters. One of the MNU's most significant tasks is to move the alien colony into a new area that is described as more like a concentration camp. Heading this operation is a newly promoted member of the MNU, a nerdy and clumsy man named Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). Many of his colleagues describe how surprised they are by his promotion and even his father-in-law assures us that it was not because of his family connection. With the unlikelihood of his promotion, Wikus' authority over the operation is tested by the military personnel who are also assisting with the eviction.<br/><br/>The opening quarter of District 9 is easily the most impressive of the entire film. The films mockumentary aesthetics, such as the inclusion of interviews, hand-held camera shots, grainy security footage and the decision to cast unknown actors, lend the film an immersive and almost believable quality to the fiction. This is not merely a gimmick however as writer and director Neill Blomkamp seems to have a real interest in the political and moral aspects of the alien camp. Along with the impressive visual design of the aliens, he has portrayed them with a real sense of humanity. They live with their own alien children in shacks, scavenge for food, engage in experiments of science and technology and participate in trade bargains. It is difficult not to feel something for them. The real monsters of the film are the humans. From the military personnel to the Nigerian militia gangs, the humans are shown are cruel and unmerciful, labelling the aliens with derogatory names such as prawns or shooting them down at will. Even the films main protagonist Wikus is not entirely clean. In one scene he attempts to blackmail an alien into signing an eviction notice by saying that he will have the alien's child taken into welfare custody. It is this level of inhumanity, in trying to force these alien immigrants out of their homes, which allows the film to echo the same social and political problems we have witnessed in recent years. With this moral conscience, the opening quarter of District 9 is not only fun in its originality, but it's also a thoughtful experience as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many of the political and social ideas are not developed throughout the rest of the narrative. Once the film runs out of things to say, it loses its mockumentary style in favour of action and visual effects and becomes more the equivalent of a video game. Though the action at the beginning of the film is often exciting and intense, its frequency ensures that it becomes rather monotonous by the end, with a minimal sense of character development. The film also suffers from the predictability of several key plot points. When Wikus accidentally sprays an alien device on himself and begins coughing up thick black good, it is clear what will happen to him, who will help him and where he has to go. The influence of Peter Jackson, who was one of the producers of the film, is visible in many of the film's gross out moments, such as Wikus' transformation as he starts losing his teeth and fingernails and and also through many of the films exploding bodies. It is the same mixture of horror and humour that evokes memories of the early Jackson horror films such as Bad Taste, which will surely excite some and repulse others.<br/><br/>It is because District 9 starts out so strongly, with a thoughtful and interesting concept that it is all the more disappointing that the film cannot sustain its political and social subtext. In spite of some impressive visual effects, the action is not enough to carry the entirety of the narrative. With its critical praise and box office success however, it would be optimistic to believe that the inevitable sequel – hinted at by the end of the film – will be much of an improvement."
"dking1583","8","6","12","19 August 2009"," Movie Review: District 9 (2009)
","Produced by Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings), District 9 is also the directorial debut of Neill Blomkamp. It is a stunning and mesmerizing work of science fiction that dazzles the audience not only with its visuals, but also with its brutal, and often times disturbing passion. The movie is based on a short film by Blomkamp titled Alive in Joburg. With all of the brilliant effects and CGI in this film, it is hard to believe it was only made for $30 million. In a summer filled with big-budget, no brainer films such as Transformers and G.I. Joe, District 9 is a movie that uses its modest budget to the fullest effect, and, as a result, looks like a film that was made for $100 million.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a series of interviews describing how a species of aliens came to live in District 9. Apparently, twenty years ago, a ship halted above Johannesburg, South Africa, and when humans cut their way in, they found a group of malnourished aliens. Thus, District 9 was created to house the aliens and keep them separate from the humans.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, a field operative for Multinational United (NMU) named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is assigned the difficult task of transporting about 1.8 millions aliens to a new camp located 24 km outside of Johannesburg. This mission does not go as planned, and Wikus becomes the recipient of an alien virus that turns him into a sort of human-alien hybrid. As a result, the government wants to use him on experiments, and, more importantly, to learn how to operate the alien weapons that are useless in the hands of humans.<br/><br/>Copley delivers a gut-wrenching performance in the lead role. He is likable and also heartbreaking. I suspect that most audience members will be surprised as how emotional this film can get. It is also an incredibly disturbing film, not so much in the violence, but in the savage nature of the humans depicted in the film. The aliens, and van der Merwe for that matter, are treated like subjects and objects and the pain they go through is discarded by the government workers. <br/><br/>I would say that the first hour of this film is as good as anything I've seen all year. Copley is actually at his best in the first half of the film, and the movie follows suit. It is fast-paced film-making that is as good as any science fiction film we've seen this decade. However, the third act is quite problematic. The action climax at the end of the film, even though it is well shot, goes on way too long, and it seems like the ending cheats a little bit. The first half sets it up so well that the ending it a let down that doesn't really seem to solve that much.<br/><br/>However, this is still a film that is more than worth seeing. It features two brilliant debuts from director Blomkamp and Sharlto Copley. The CGI is first rate and the movie will seem even better than it truly is when one compares it to some of the weaker efforts this summer. District 9 is really quite an achievement coming from a first-time director, and even though it falls just short of classic status in the sci-fi genre, it's still one of the best films of the summer."
"dee.reid","10","6","12","17 August 2009"," Hands down, the finest sci-fi film since ""Children of Men"" (2006); also, it's what ""Alien Nation"" (1988) could have been...
","You read my summary correct, folks: ""District 9"" is the finest sci-fi film I've seen since ""Children of Men"" (2006). Now why is that astounding? Because the genre of science fiction, while well-known for its occasional brilliance, is also rife with movies that are just flat-out terrible. Science fiction is a genre that takes both intelligence and originality combined with some impeccable skill to truly master. Of course, not every sci-fi film can be ""Star Wars"" (1977) or ""Blade Runner"" (1982). Likewise, not everybody can be George Lucas or Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>That is where ""District 9"" comes in, so far the best movie I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Since ""Children of Men"" depicted a future in which mankind was on the verge of extinction due to a worldwide infertility pandemic, the movie skillfully made a case for humanity to survive despite our past atrocities against each other. Here in ""District 9,"" humanity is again seen at its absolute worst, because we have reverted back to one of our most basic, cruelest instincts: our ability to hate.<br/><br/>What I just typed means to suggest that ""District 9,"" as a science fiction/action film, may very well be one of the most socially conscious sci-fi pictures ever made. ""Alien Nation"" (1988) had almost the exact same set-up as this film; I DID like that film, BTW. But where it went wrong was in the way it backtracked on its principles of how we treat each other just when things started getting interesting. What started out as a sly social commentary on how human beings will react to an extraterrestrial race's integration into the human populace, devolved into a standard buddy-cop movie with a slight, slight hint of social commentary.<br/><br/>In ""District 9,"" it's been over 20 years since an alien ship washed ashore on Earth, settling over the skies of Johannesburg, South Africa. Now for all of us history buffs, the significance of South Africa as this film's setting is not a random, isolated incident: South Africa has one of the worst civil-rights histories of any nation in the industrialized world, due largely to their government's apartheid policies that kept the native majority black African population oppressed under a white minority for over 40 years and those policies were only just abolished 15 years ago (as of this writing).<br/><br/>The alien creatures, derisively nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their appearance which is a combination of insect-iod and sea crustacean, in ""District 9"" could of course be seen as a stand-in for any oppressed people or immigration population. What's most disturbing about this set-up is that formerly oppressed black South Africans are amongst those speaking negatively against the prawns, that they live like animals and that they should go home (how they're supposed to do that exactly is never explained by the South African people) - they're partial to eating cat food - in District 9's crowded, run-down slums, of which could very easily be seen as any ghetto - from South Central L.A. to the Bronx to, well, Johannesburg, South Africa - which is of course ruled by a strong military/police presence.<br/><br/>Things get underway in a mock-u-mentary-/documentary-style fashion involving the promotion of a hapless tool named Wikus van de Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) from corporate office drone to field manager overseeing the relocation of the prawns from District 9 to a new home 240 kilometers away. Wikus is not your typical action movie hero; he demonstrates fairly early in the picture during the raids that he is in fact a coward, and only with his newfound status as relocation manager does he really seem to have any sense of power and authority over another life, human or alien. Without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus comes into contact with some potent alien bio-technology that quickly makes him an enemy of the state, and he is forced to go on the run into District 9 to evade his captors. It is here that he soon comes to discover, much to his horror, that he may very well be the only thing stopping a full-scale Earthbound intergalactic conflict between Us and Them, but more accurately, Their systematic annihilation by the powers-that-be in Johannesburg. And only then does he seem to make a gradual transition from coward to (marginal) hero.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) produced it, but the real strength of this picture lies within the watchful, socially conscious eye of director Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp makes no attempt to hide the strong parallels between the events of ""District 9"" and human society. The allegory is pretty in-your-face, but the movie does not bog itself down too much in its real-life parallels. Instead, he plays on our emotions - he makes us feel for the prawns, no matter how disgusting they may appear to be, and their conditions, and to a lesser extent Wikus - and also lets us have it with some explosively violent action sequences in the last quarter of the film, all undercut with some sly, and pretty damn funny, social satire.<br/><br/>Just as I wrote two years ago about ""Children of Men,"" ""District 9"" may yet be another link in the chain that will pull science fiction out of the gutter. This is by far the must-see sci-fi movie to see so far this century. I was genuinely moved by this picture, not just by its action sequences, but by the message, about our cruelest, basest instincts, and it's these qualities that makes Them far more sympathetic than Us. All I can say is that I'm glad I had the opportunity to see this film today, of all days.<br/><br/>10/10"
"rdambroso","7","6","12","17 August 2009"," Good but disappointing
","I had read many of the critics reviews prior to seeing this. My expectations were set very high based on that. I was expecting a blade runner, the thing, pick a sci-fi classic, and it was supposed to rank with those. Unfortunately, this didn't quite make it in my mind. It was a good movie. The lead actor did a very good job. The CGI and special effects were excellent, and the story line was overall good. But for some reason, the one thing that the movie failed to do was to get me emotionally involved. I don't know why. It could have been the format of the film which had a lot of news clip type coverage. Heck, Starship Troopers had that but it was very good in a quirky way. I'm just having a hard time putting my finger on it. I also had trouble suspending disbelief at times and thought that parts of the movie were too implausible to buy into. I know a lot of people have raved about it. This may just be a case of some people not liking vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't discourage someone from seeing it. I just think it was a bit of a letdown."
"Jobflabadob","3","4","7","7 September 2013"," District disappointment
","Wow. It's movie is just bloody awful. I was very interested in seeing this after hearing good things but not knowing really what to expect. I knew it was a sci FI movie so I was excited at the least. Well if I hadn't of gone with someone else I would've just walked out after an hour of this movie. I recently watched it again to see if its as bad as I remember and it's even worse.<br/><br/>To begin with the characters suck. The main character is suppose to have a gift of some sort, be different but in this movie the main character is just a big pussy. It's very hard to watch because the main characters role is just so bad. All the aliens speak their own language but can understand English. All the humans can understand the alien language but speak English. If everyone understands the same language why don't they just speak it throughout the movie?! Also the ""love"" between the man and his wife is badly construed. I didn't even know they like each other till half way threw the film and she still doesn't seem to like him much till even later.<br/><br/>The directing is horrible as shots are too shaky, too many close ups, and the documentary style filming is over used and really boring in this film.<br/><br/>The plot is terrible. Well I mean all 4 of the plots are because there's a million things going on a once and non of witch make any sense. Most websites say that the plot is this man has half alien DNA and can operate alien weapons so the military tries hunting him down for this very reason. It's hard to see this as the plot considering it doesn't it doesn't come in till 45 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE! The absolute dumbest plot element has to be that the aliens gasoline can turn things into aliens. Think about that. Their gasoline TURNS PEOPLE INTO GASOLINE. Not only does it power their space ships but it has magically the absolute perfect biology to turn human DNA into alien. They're aliens, not viruses and even for a SCI FI movie, this is poorly thought out and unbelievable. Something else that's stupid is that all the humans want is to get rid of the aliens and send them back to the mother ship. As it turns out the only thing the aliens want is to get back to the mother ship so it can be fixed. It seems however that the writer forgot about this fact as the humans go threw great length to ""evict"" the aliens which somehow have human rights now. If everyone hates everyone why don't the humans just take the aliens back to the mother-ship and be rid of them? Then there would be no point to this horrible movie. There are so many plot wholes and too many things don't make sense. I wonder when they threw the plot together if they actually thought about or were crushed for time so just said ""F this"" and moved on.<br/><br/>It's a shame that it was so poorly thought out and produced because there's something here that old have been great. The last 30 minutes are good but it's not enough to save the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In short this movie is absolutely horrible. Utter trash. There's something good hidden in the film but its surrounded by horrible characterization, bad plot, and other bad ideas. I could rant for hours about how bad this film is and all the things that don't make sense but it just comes down to skip this film and its a shame that is wasn't thought out well."
"adv808","3","7","15","28 March 2010"," Garbage
","No, really – literally. This is what you'll be seeing for a better part of 2 hours on the screen - garbage. Lots of it. Aliens digging in it, the hero being repeatedly thrown into it, the inevitable cliché ruthless mercenaries fighting in it.<br/><br/>I won't even bother describing the weak social message the movie tries to get across (or at least we are told that it does, I tried to look for it but could not figure it out). It is hopelessly lost in the incredulous plot, pointless action and piles of garbage.<br/><br/>There is only one full-time human role, that of Wikus – the main hero. The ""prawns"" are of about Cronenberg's Fly quality, but what was acceptable back in 1986 just does not cut it anymore. The only, as I said, full-time human character's performance is impressive if you are impressed by an actor with only one look on his face – permanent desperation, and two ways to deliver his words – pleading breathlessly or screaming hysterically. I hope that Sharlto Copley can do better than that, because here the screenplay did not leave him much room for any other emotion. Not a lot of room when you are standing knee-deep in garbage.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is substandard for a 2009 flick of any budget. There is an alien ship painted in the sky, a few alien guns with action so familiar from Doom and Half-Life, and even a (spoiler?) ubiquitous battlebot. Its movements are about as lifelike as those of the first Terminator. The jittering ""handycam footage"" style is hard on the eyes even on your TV screen. I'm glad I did not go to the theatre – the motion sickness prone spectators could barf. On the other hand, there is enough visual content there that can cause the same reaction. Remember – garbage.<br/><br/>I cannot believe that IMDb audience rated this movie so high, almost on par with Avatar. The latter was often criticized for a weak screenplay. I can agree to an extent. Nevertheless, Avatar compensates with scenes of incredible beauty. With District 9 the gaping holes in the plot are landfilled with garbage.<br/><br/>PS -- I read a few more reviews to try to understand why could anyone -- capable of writing a review -- like this film. I could not. People call it Sci-Fi. Excuse me, there is most definitely no Sci here. Aliens living in garbage -- not Sci. There is also no Fi -- fiction is something that assumes a coherent story. No folks, still nothing but garbage."
"gws-2","10","7","15","14 August 2009"," A work of genius!
","District 9 is inspired film-making. In some ways, I suppose, it is an allegorical tale, but it is NOT a Message Movie. Thank heavens for that because I detest most such films. Although I feared that this film might be a heavy handed anti-Apartheid drama, I saw instead a brilliant sci-fi film, in a class with Ridley Scott's classic ""Alien."" <br/><br/>The protagonist of the film is Wikus Van De Werne, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley from whom I hope to see more in the future. Wikus is alternately, stupid, naive, and funny, but ultimately loyal and brave. The movie traces his assignment as the man in charge of an operation to remove aliens from a squalid camp near Johannesburg and resettle them in a remote location. How all of this is developed and plays out is fascinating and consistently interesting, trust me on this.<br/><br/>District 9 is directed by young Neil Blomkamp -- he is only 29. This is the only film of his I have seen but he has convinced me already that he is a force to be reckoned with. He made District 9 for little money, at least by the standards of most modern special effects laden films, and co-wrote the screenplay, too boot.<br/><br/>This is a smart film; it is also sometimes moving and often funny. Highest recommendations!"

","My excitement about this film was tantamount to a Jonas brother's concert and I was not disappointed. It was exciting, engaging, empathetic and enigmatic.<br/><br/>I was glued to my seat the whole time. The CGI was flawless and I couldn't tell the aliens weren't ACTUAL alien actors. The humans were vibrant and the acting was so real as to evoke true emotion, not the fake Hallmark card type of acting at all.<br/><br/>The direction of this supremely well written script was without reproof and it is obvious that the director truly understands his subject matter without turning it maudlin and false.<br/><br/>My one warning would be if you are squeamish, consider yourself prepared. The gore factor is extremely high, though all within the context of the film. Just so you know, there is vomiting, eating of cat food, blood, guts, exploding bodies and body parts, vivisection, graphic violence and none of it is isolated. The gory bits go on and on and on and on....and on. That is not to say there are ONLY gory parts. Think STARSHIP TROOPERS and you have the right amount of gore factor.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed so realistically, even the aliens, that you truly believe these people exist, which is the point of any good actors job.<br/><br/>See this movie if it's the last thing you do. You won't regret it."

The ugly cinematography serves only to rub salt into the combined wounds of an aimless, uncompelling story and a heavy-handed, uninspiring attempt at an allegory on contemporary issues which horribly shoots itself in the foot.<br/><br/>For a film that un-subtly trumpets itself from the off as a commentary on racism, District 9 scores a spectacular own goal with its vulgar and offensive portrayal of Nigerians. The pacing of the storyline is appalling and after the half-way mark I was looking for ways the film could end, only to be confounded at every turn by another unwelcome plot-twist which prolonged the mediocrity to a painful degree.<br/><br/>There isn't a single likable character in the entire cast, and Peter Jackson's fondness for long films means your patience will really be tried as you sit this one out.

","If you are a 20yr old male into bloody video games you will love this piece of junk. But OH mercy, that was the stupidest movie ever. It was a merge of abuse-type issues with computer graphics generated machines and weird aliens all mushed up into a stupid VERY predictable plot with a dialog that included the F-word every 3 second. It would have, at least, helped if the characters used other foul language than the word of choice. This movie works better as a video game but it flops on the big screen. Waste of time and money! It was SO STUPID......<br/><br/>For example, why the heck would the family of the main character continue with their surprise party for him when he comes into his home obviously in pretty bad shape; Oh no, the family just continues on with ""cut the cake honey"" kinds of dialogue. You know, if it's a documentary, then the sense of ""realness"" is lost by scenes such as the one above. And it's like this the entire movie. Also, I did not see 1 million aliens around; I guess the movie budget just could not afford to show them all, so you see maybe a dozen at a time, a dozen human-army guys all acting like Rambo, and it just makes zero sense. And the ending, what the heck? I can't comment on it cause I will give the movie away. But if you are curious about the ending, you will have to sit through a good 2.5 hours of boring absurdity.<br/><br/>Please don't waste your money."
"themanamp","1","8","18","24 September 2009"," Overrated, massively frustrating and unimaginative
","I just wanted to say I really hated this film because it promised so much and lacked so much. Here are my major issues: <br/><br/>1. Lack of any real focus on the alien civilisation.<br/><br/>This is the real crime of this film, any story which includes a 20 year period of prolonged contact between humans and aliens should surely have a go at getting a bit deeper into the alien experience than District 9 did. We hardly learn anything about the prawns at all. They aren't even imaginatively thought out aliens, they're just like a prawnish version of humans. Now OK, you can say 'Well that's district 9s brilliance, what if aliens are just like us? ' And yes, that's a valid point, but if they're gonna be posited as 'very similar to us' in behaviour etc. Then we need to have that justified through back-story, their culture, their history, their personalities, their technology etc. Look at all the conflicts humans of different ethnic groups have with each other, all the variances of sex, religion, work, leisure, war, education, food, music, etc etc. These would be multiplied on a MASSIVE scale if aliens landed tomorrow. But no, what do we get with District 9? Aliens that like cat food and have 7 moons instead of 1. It's just superficial.<br/><br/>And I do understand that these aliens are meant to be 'workers'. In fact, that's actually good plot idea, if a little cheap, what I'm trying to say is that if this actually occurred the 'workers' would still be a lot more complex and dynamic than how they are presented in this movie.<br/><br/>Can you imagine if our working class got stranded on a alien world? OK, there might be a few 'pissing in the street' moments but they would generally be a unified, motivated and complex force. Any isolated ethnic group would be.<br/><br/>2.<br/><br/>The documentary style REALLY ticked me off. It kept interrupted the good bits with unnecessary exposition ('then wikus did this, 'now we're at the lab' etc etc), even though it was really obvious what was happening, why do most new sci-fi films assume people are idiots like this? Also, the acting wasn't actually that good in those talking heads snippets. No way did they truly communicate the gravitas of making contact with alien civilisation.<br/><br/>3.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this film has one only character who isn't a two-dimensional stereotype. And this character is pretty unlikeable! ....Which I liked, in a way, its nice to see him find his honour (or something close to it)..... but given that he has no one else to really interact with, the 'character landscape' of the film is a bit too cold and inhuman.<br/><br/>See reason 1 for why I don't think the prawn Christopher has any kind of believable character.<br/><br/>4.<br/><br/>It is a little bit racist. It's set in an African country and doesn't have one truly sympathetic black character, apart from the token scientist at the start, who is on screen for about 5 seconds.<br/><br/>5.<br/><br/>The transformer bit was terrible <br/><br/>6.<br/><br/>The back-story was far more intriguing than the main story of the film<br/><br/>7.<br/><br/>It had a very juvenile storyline for the most part. I mean, who really gets tortured and experimented upon by their own father-in-law without a moments hesitation? Very little dramatic plausibility and consequence. <br/><br/>8.<br/><br/>It could have been brilliant with a decent writer. That's always annoying.<br/><br/>9.<br/><br/>There are far too many plot holes to enjoy this film scene to scene. The thing about plot holes is they don't matter unless there are loads of them and then they constantly impair your 'plasuibility' meter.<br/><br/>Imagine you have a lovely fresh bucket of 'plot'. A plot-hole is a hole in that bucket.... plot that you lost enjoyment on because it went through a plot-hole.<br/><br/>Take a film like.......hmm star wars. It's got a fair few plot holes here and there, but they don't feel like they occur in every scene, and this allows one to drink from the 'plot' bucket with enjoyment unimpeded.<br/><br/>District 9, on the other hand, has tonnes of plot holes and the writing is so poor they jump out at you in almost every scene.<br/><br/>Now I know, one can explain 'plot holes', but lets face it, when you have to explain internally to yourself at almost every scene, it does somewhat damage the experience of a good film.<br/><br/>Thus, district 9, left me gasping at the bucket of 'plot' eager to drain some of its wonderful premise moisture, only to have it all spill to the dry ground through the mass of plot holes.<br/><br/>10.<br/><br/>I never once really felt like I could believe the situation was 'real' apart from the opening shots of he hovering starship. Which, to be fair, was beautifully done."

","I went into this film not knowing anything about it (on purpose) other than having seen the teaser trailer. During the first 15 - 20 minutes of the film I was thinking, get to it already, but then when the plot with the prawns began, and we were hanging out with just them, it was brilliant all the way through to the end, and I could then see that the slow pacing at the beginning was actually beneficial to the film.<br/><br/>What an amazing first feature film for this guy! The effects were 100% spot on. When I see other CG, for example the werewolf in the Twilight: New Moon trailer it makes you realize that the director definitely dictates how good the effects are.<br/><br/>People were cheering all the way throughout the movie, as there are many 'FUCK-YEAH!' moments, and the story went exactly where I wanted it to go. The choice of having a comedic character as the lead role for this kind of film was very refreshing, and made for more of an impact when things start to get serious and brutal for him.<br/><br/>It doesn't feel too long, and ends with you wanting more.<br/><br/>I can't wait for 'District 10', as this is clearly the first chapter in a masterful trilogy. I can see another equally talented director taking the reins for part two, reminiscent of James Cameron continuing the Alien franchise.<br/><br/>Cannot think of one thing I would change in this film.<br/><br/>10/10"

It's supposed to be an 'inside look' at what the agents go through and what happens to one agent in particular. Yet what we end up with is the same old, redone, repetitive yawns. Ten years ago when ""The Blair Witch Project"" came out, it was revolutionary. But film after film later of the same thing, it gets old after a while. There's only so much of the jiggling camera I can take. The story got really old really fast and I just kept thinking it has to get better. But it never did.

Although, if they had the warning, I'd know to sit way back.<br/><br/>I had heard a lot of raving about how good District 9 is, especially since it features an unknown cast and director and doesn't have a huge budget (relatively). And yes, if I consider all those factors, it's quite impressive. If I didn't though, I'd think it overrated. I get what it's going for, using aliens to stand in for unwanted, uneducated immigrants and all, while being a pretty good sci-fi movie - I just don't see how it's groundbreaking. It's all been done before, though perhaps not in this combination of elements. But I don't mean to put the movie down - like I said, it's a good sci-fi movie, even if I'm SO VERY SICK of ""reality"" hand-held motion sickness-inducing camera work."

I will admit it was worth watching maybe once, but unlike the Lord of the Rings, harry potter or star wars its will really be a very dark and dreary day before I pop it back into the DVD player.

"The_Rogue_Phoenix","7","5","10","11 September 2009"," Almost Perfect... Except for Hollywood
","Through gripping gritty visuals of a social war between humans and ""prawns"" (aliens), District 9 reveals a riveting story and demonstrates the reality of human history and present. We begin with a back-story of an alien ship that has been hovering over South Africa. Upon investigation people find a population of starving aliens inside. Humans traffic them into a camp which develops into a ghetto, a chilling parallel to the Holocaust, Apartheid, and many other occurrences in history. <br/><br/>With characters aware of the camera and before/after interviews, director and writer Neill Blomkamp provides the audience with a fictional documentary. It was an intelligent choice to narrate the story in documentary style; not only does it ground the film in its own reality but everything occurs as if this very scenario is happening in the world as we know it today. Aside from the interjecting interviews we follow the character Wikus, an agent of the MNU (Multi-National United), which controls and contains the prawns through faked legal procedures and military force. Wikus begins as an unsympathetic, stiff character doing his job to relocate the prawns to a camp with worse conditions. He takes us deeper and deeper into the human treatment of these creatures, which are so near to us in every way except for appearance; they have their own language and technology. <br/><br/>The premise alone holds enough weight to promise an enlightening film full of warning to the viewers. It would have succeeded in such a warning if the story didn't give a happy and sappy wrap up that does not fit the first three-fourths of the narrative. It feels like an inspiring independent film with a Hollywood ending tacked on last minute. If you want to watch a film that tells it like it is without giving false hopes and conveys a message for people to change, then this is not the film for you. If you want ridiculous over-dramatized fight scenes, obvious dropped lines indicating a sequel, and an unrealistic ending then this is your film.<br/><br/>Everything before the ending had me on the edge of my seat hardly blinking between the graphic violence and character transformations, but I cannot ignore the unfitting ending which ruined a definite award-worthy film. Aside from the ""Hollywood"" ending the film was the epitome of fantastic. My advise? Watch it, and see what you think."
"devonblue","8","5","10","8 September 2009"," Almost Perfect
","This one has it all, well almost...The acting is excellent, Peter Jacksons Direction is top notch, the story starts slow and after about the hour mark takes off, lots of guns and explosions, CGI was nigh on perfect, and full of nice moral dilemmas, with a nice touch of anti racism in which no-one could be offended. But IMHO and only in my opinion it seems, is that the characters were very despicable or shallow, all of them except Christopher and his alien kid did I feel any emotion for, sure the main character Sharlito Copley played his role perfectly and deserves an award, but I did not care for him or the predicament he got himself into, but as blockbusters go, this is a winner, and I am looking forward to the sequel which must follow soon!"

The special effects were awesome, the action was really neat, and overall it was a fun, action-packed sci-fi thriller that all lovers of the genre should see.<br/><br/>The aliens in this film are iconic, kinda like strange beetle ant like things that talk like Jabba the Hutt's cousin's brother's uncle. The acting by such actors like Jason Cope was fantastic, and the way they interact with the alien invaders was far beyond alien interaction.<br/><br/>I'm gonna wrap up this film up saying that it was spectacular.

There hasn't been a breathtaking, fresh and intelligent sci-fi movie in the recent history. This one just blows the mind! There have been several sci-fi/fantasy movies out this year, but this one just tops them all. Transformers was left in the dust for me while being a fan of it.

","I started seeing this movie at about 1 am. After the movie ended I sat in bed for another 10 minutes shocked by the amazing new genre. Then I said to myself ""Now I can die"" , it seriously was that good. The title of the movie ""District 9"" is so simple and perfect, sounds SciFi and a bit dark which it is. I was so impressed that I started reading reviews and made this IMDb account. After a while reading, something caught my attention. It was something like this : ""if the fans liked it, there will be for sure District 10"" . Just imagine the beauty of a second part with a higher budget. Now let us talk a bit of this weird genre.I have seen a comedy a while ago about a music artist called It's All Gone Pete Tong.People say it is real cause it was made like a documentary, what they didn't know is that it was a mock of a documentary. Mockumentary or mock documentary is a genre of film and television, or a single work of the genre. District 9 is done in exactly the same way and guess what, it worked perfectly."
"helmutty","7","5","10","15 August 2009"," Interesting and intense.
","It is not as good as a masterpiece as what others have said and definitely not a bad movie as some die-hard sci-fi fans said. It is good but not a masterpiece, it manages to keep you engage to the screen with its raw intensity and realistic feel. I was afraid that it will become Cloverfield, with its shaky hand-held camera. But I was proved wrong. This is far more interesting and intense than Cloverfield. This has different views of different characters unlike Cloverfield-it is filmed with only one hand-held video camera.<br/><br/>The story: Humans disrespect the new aliens that came to Earth. The aliens live in slums in South Africa. The aliens have emotions, their faces express their emotions. The acting is natural and it adds to the overall realistic feeling in this adventure movie. The adventure may not be that unique but the raw intensity will keep you on the seat and makes it more watchable. The effects are good, better than Dragonball Evolution with a budget of 45 million.<br/><br/>Overall: Though it may not be an unique adventure, it is an unique experience. Those who want an unique experience and raw intensity, this is worth the money. This is one movie that does not hold back the brutal violence and language, it is more violent than Cloverfield."
"hg_b1","8","5","10","15 August 2009"," Sure it's a SciFi film, yet it has little in common with the typical movie we are used to,
","After reading favorable reviews I dragged my wife to the nearest movie theater for the 2nd day of introduction. Well... this movie started out as a documentary with shaky hand-held cameras and then takes off in a complete other direction. It starts with the main star Wikus having been selected by his father in law to head the group that is to relocate aliens that landed in the area about 20 years before and are now undesirable and must be forced to move away. Wikus is a by the book type of person and does his best to retain his composure as the man that does the job. He is accompanied by men with guns that are to enforce and protect him from any aliens that don't behave. Wikus comes across as a nice guy, a bit naive and somewhat dorky and certainly not a hunk. As the movie progresses we are shown how the confined aliens are mistreated by the humans. It somewhat parallels the treating of the black citizens by whites years before and that is not well. Wikus gets into deeper trouble with the aliens and then his own people throughout the film and without divulging the plot suffice it to say he's got his Hand full. I don't know how he understood the weird gibberish the aliens uttered, but without his perception and interpretation,the movie could not function as it did. The aliens are really nothing we can identify with as humans. Let's say they are every bit as handsome as the Predator character, once he removed his mask. I do not recommend eating shrimps during this movie. As a matter of fact it reminds me of Gallagher, the physical comedian, where fruits and vegetables flew towards the audience during the show,...here we have other parts flying. I never understood how the aliens built what they had, because with their claw hands they couldn't even hold a cigarette. The film is certainly fast paced and keeps one entertained throughout. The sound and stereo is phenomenal and in our theater it was somewhat loud, yet that depends were one attends. The graphics are realistic and that gives credibility to the whole genre. The actor that portrays Wikus is in almost every scene and carries the movie. His performance in my humble opinions deserves recognition. As for the other actors I can't identify them - for they are unknowns... at least here in the US and that eliminates any distractions. For a budget of $30 million it is quite a film. I recommend seeing this for any and all that appreciate a good Sfi-Fi film with the exception of younger children because of them being exposed to the excessive violence."
"the-most-ignored","8","5","10","13 August 2009"," District 9 is one of the best this summer. Do NOT skip out on seeing this movie
","District 9 is a good movie. District 9 is also a movie that didn't let very much info out to reveal its plot during the trailer. So District 9 is going to make this a movie very hard to review, without me spoiling anything (and I won't). The movie plays as a documentary of District 9, but don't worry there's no shaky cam. It goes into what the District actually does, and how the aliens got on earth. The movie is very gritty and realistic. Honestly, if events in this movie were to happen in real life; I wouldn't be surprised much of what the government was doing in this movie they would do in real life (and yes it is f#*&^d up). Also, because it's realistic, the action is gritty and some scenes are slightly gross, so weak stomach people watch out. The story also has some elements of slight horror and torture. While the movie stands on it's own it is also an analogy to illegal aliens in the country and also racism, but in this case I would more say ""species-ism"" or some other made up word. In my humble opinion the aliens were definitely more likable then the humans in this movie, even the main character at some points (who was a good character) but I have a feeling the movie was made for me to respond like that.<br/><br/>Another great thing about the movie is that it does not run too long; it ends ""naturally."" It wasn't forced, or cliché, the ending really made the movie for me. The CGI is really nice as well; the aliens didn't look fake like they did in the movie ""I Am Legend."" It reminded me of the early summer blockbuster Star Trek in the special effects department because it looked so real and top notch the whole way through. The aliens fit perfectly with the District 9 environment, which looks slightly dull and sick ridden, picture Resident Evil 5.<br/><br/>There is more I want to say about this movie but if I do, I will spoil stuff. So to wrap it up, see District 9 in theaters as soon as you can! But be aware, this is an actual story, that doesn't sell itself short, it is not action action action all the time. District 9 reminded me much of the movie The Dark Knight in that retrospect— Damnit, see I'm about to go off on a tangent again. Just see the movie.<br/><br/>There is also another spoiler free review that goes more in detail, you can find it here if you are interested: http://comichaven.net/?p=458"
"jackvanseven7","9","5","10","14 August 2009"," Not what I expected, but...
","District 9 was astonishing. Do not expect a preachy social commentary, a conspiracy film or a mock documentary. District 9 is none of these. District 9 is an action film. And extremely gritty, creative, and even touching, action film. One might compare it to last month's Hurt Locker, but this is so much more than that film was. You will feel for all of the characters on the screen, more so for digital ones. The prawns are amazing. The creatures are never presented as purely defenseless victims. They are different, in the worst way. They are gross in every sense of the word. Yet, as the film goes on you accept them, and really feel for them. They never feel like cgi, simply because they constantly interact with real world objects and people. They are rude, and sometimes funny, but in a way it's their differences that make them, dare I say, cute, and to the audiences, very likable.<br/><br/>I will avoid spoilers, but the film is epic. Very gritty, very real, very intense. It is one of the most unique movies you will see this summer, and trust me, you will want to see it again."

See...if something like this would happen on our boring little planet for real, it would definitely break the ennui. I wait for this every day, but I guess I have to settle for the big screen for now, and wait patiently for 2012. Yet, when one finds oneself rooting for a bunch of insectoid-like creatures that look like every other alien we've seen since Starship Troopers, one has to really examine his perspective of humanity. At any rate, I think there's going to be a sequel, and the way it was set up, I think its going to be payback time for the human race. I can't wait!"
"tryn","9","5","10","14 August 2009"," Definitely worth staying up to see
","Saw the 12 o'clock showing of this film tonight and was glad I did. You can read other reviews for more specifics on the film, but I wanted to add a couple of bits of relevant info: On the way out of the theater I heard two different comments. 1) The way the cameras were used gives an almost ""handheld"" effect throughout much of the movie. Several young men seated near me complained they felt queasy from the effect of the camera movement. You may want to consider this when choosing where you sit or whether or not to see it in theaters. and 2) it was gory. I agree, the movie was gory. When considering whether or not to allow kids to see you should know that everything from the content of the POV (the ""moral of the story"", if you will) to the gore and the very free use of f-bombs all throughout definitely make the movie an ""R"" all the way through. It was not even CLOSE to a PG13. Some of you won't mind that, some of you will.<br/><br/>Still - with those things in mind, I think the movie was fantastic. The story didn't skulk about trying to slip its moral center in undetected. It was quite in-your-face. I appreciated the direct approach, though I've read some people calling it heavy-handed. Quite frankly I appreciate a movie that isn't afraid to delve into the grotesque behavior of which humans are capable. This movie does that unapologetically.<br/><br/>A very fine send-off for the '09 summer movie season."

","Peter Jackson.....director of one of the greatest trilogies of all time ""Lord of the Rings"", has finally taken a step outside of the directors circle. Numerous movies have been thrown his way.....""The Hobbit"", even a Halo movie. He finally settled on directing ""The Lovely Bones""......but before doing any of that, he took a liking to a small time directors short film. He loved the concept so much, that he gave this director all the funds he needed to make it a full length feature........this is Peter Jackson people, he doesn't put money into something unless its good.......especially if its coming from a director that has done virtually nothing. Needless to say, i had to see what all this was about. Everyone dreams of the idea.....aliens coming to earth. But the question that everyone always ask is ""What would we actually do?""......this movie finally answers that question. Im sure everyone would like to believe that it would somewhat resemble ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".....but we all know thats not true. No no no.....this movie zero's in on just how crude mankind can actually be. Now i must admit.....the first 30 minutes had me a little in-different.....because it creates this alternate reality for you, so at first, it was a little hard to swallow, because they are throwing so much at you, and you want so many questions answered.......but thats the beauty of it......you only see it from a media standpoint.....which we all know is somewhat corrupt. But once the plot outline is established, and the characters are in place, the movie just takes off.....and this alternate universe is now incredible. But it just doesn't stop there......once you sort of figure out what is really going on, and you are actually rooting for the 2 main characters, that is when the movie has you by the balls. I don't want to say too much without giving the movie away......but by the end of this film, i was in complete awe. Almost every aspect of this film was done to perfection.......every angle was covered, which is key to a movie like this. The story was not only original, but brilliant at the same time, and told just as such. I must tip my hat to the director Neil Blomkamp......because this was his first big production, and he went above and beyond. Bottom Line......oh my god, this is easily the best movie i have seen this summer, and easily one of the 5 best movies of the year so far. If your looking for a deep story with your action, which i have been for a long time now.......you will certainly find it here. This film brings such a different idea to the table, and it has so many levels to it........this movie has just brought life back to the summer blockbusters.....thank you god. Im sick and tired of everyone saying how ""You just have to let go, and enjoy the movie for what it is"".......NO.....YOU Don't......i don't want to pay money just to watch crap blow up all the time, i want depth damn it. And up until now, that is all i have seen this summer. Finally, an action movie with heart, humor, awesome action, and a brilliantly told story. Not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.......yeah, i said it.....because its true. Don't waste your time, go and see it."

"wricketts","3","6","13","21 October 2009"," Just in case you were convinced it was impossible to make a silly film about apartheid
","I can't imagine what kind of viewer would find this film deep or metaphorical or anything other than a grand, slow-moving, grimly adolescent bore, but there are apparently many who have considered it a great work of art on themes of racism, immigration, and apartheid. It isn't. It's a smarmy, unnecessarily gory (and I have no objections whatever to gore), low-rent (in feel, if not actually in budget) scifi flick along the lines of Alien Nation (but about 50 times less adroit) that is so insecure of itself that it reminds you (constantly, nervously) who the bad guys are and who the good guys are and whacks you over the head every other scene with its deep and righteous sense of morality. If this is the best Metaphor for Xenophobia they could come up with, I am so scared. What no one seems to notice is a) that the aliens for whom we're supposed to be all filled with sympathy are actually pretty gross; the ""good"" alien (Christopher Johnson; a single father, to boot) who forms an uneasy alliance with Wikus van de Merwe doesn't even begin to make up for all the scenes of aliens doing things that are downright creepy and for which the film provides zero cultural context that might allow us to understand them in a different light; and b) that the actual blacks in the film are animals, almost literally. In other words, the great anti-racist ""message"" gets a little lost. Add to that the fact that Sharlto Copley (as van de Merwe) plays his scenes as if he were Sacha Baron Cohen and you get yet one more silly, superficial movie about racism that can't stop congratulating itself for how hip and meaningful it is."

","The Positives: <br/><br/>1. It starts off well,and the newscasts give it a certain sense of realism.<br/><br/>2. South Africa is a refreshing choice of location (not in America,for once).<br/><br/>3. the idea of aliens struggling here on Earth seems quite plausible.<br/><br/>4. occasionally,some eye-pleasing visuals are on offer. <br/><br/>The Negatives: <br/><br/>1. Alien creature design is flawed,it makes it very difficult for them to emote - which in turn makes it hard for us to relate to them until very late into the movie...quite frankly their look evokes disgust throughout,which lingers on for hours after the film. <br/><br/>2. No character (be it human or alien) was given sufficient depth,they just run around like in a cheap action movie. <br/><br/>3. The storyline is totally linear and thus totally predictable,offering the same kind of message as seen in bucket-loads of other action movies.Plot holes abound.<br/><br/>4. Visually,the sets are decidedly CyberPunk,whilst props,robot,weaponry and action sequences are mired deep in video game references...detailed and trendy but not original or groundbreaking by any standard. <br/><br/>5. Self mutilation and graphic injuries is another attempt to tick the trendy boxes...the time could have been better spent developing the character. <br/><br/>6. this is,in the end,just another alien movie - it would have been just another zombie movie if it had zombies in it instead of aliens - but it is cliché none the less. <br/><br/>7. Predator had only one alien,with a lot less screen time given,yet its character was infinitely more developed than 2.5 million aliens we saw in this movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>Weapons,costumes and CG explosions do not automatically make for a good movie...it isn't terrible to watch because it has its moments,but overall it under-delivered."
"Matt_Layden","9","6","13","15 August 2009"," One Of This Years Best.
","District 9 has been getting a lot of hype and praise to equal that hype. Not many films can do this. I decided that I would try my best to go into this film not knowing much about it. I've seen the teaser and a couple TV spots and knew the basic premise. What I did not know was what a balls to the wall film this is.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp has mixed great sci/fi with themes and issues plaguing our society. A blend that works so well in this film that it plays out in two different styles. The first half of the film is told through a documentary style footage, with people talking directly to the camera explaining the backstory of the mothership and basically setting up the rest of the film. Half way through the film Blomkamp switches the style to a more conventional style of film-making, yet it isn't a jarring switch. The two styles bleed into each other and both feel the same.<br/><br/>The film is set in South Africa, the aliens are sequestered into these slums and blocked off away from humans. This segregation is reminiscent of our own history and it works well here, making the film more believable than a film like Independence Day. While watching this film I got a sense of Cloverfield and some Slumdog Millionaire. I wouldn't say it's a mix of the two, but I just got the feeling from it. I saw Cloverfield because this is a sci/fi that we haven't seen before. It's not based on anything and the creators have free range to do what they want. This was apparent in all the awesome weaponry they had. Cloverfield was new, fresh and a monster that we had no idea what it could do. I had no idea what this film was about to do, which was blow me away.<br/><br/>The second half, which is the more conventional film-making style, is action-packed and bloody violent. I had no idea what I was in for, but once I saw that the lead got his hands on the weapon technology, I had a huge smile on my face. What he did with it, made me smile even more. There were plenty of ""Holy Sh*t"" moments on my end. The most fun I've had at the movies this year, even more than the other sci/fi entertainer Star Trek.<br/><br/>The film is gritty, dirty and everything that it needs to be to sell this idea. The special effects look marvelous, especially when placed on such a desolate and depressing backdrop. The slums are dirty and turn into a warzone. A warzone that goes on for a long time and you never get tired of. You end up wanting more, craving more.<br/><br/>For a film with no star names attached and a lead who hasn't acted in anything before, I was surprised in the depth and emotion that these characters had and what Sharlto Copley had to offer. He's between a rock and a hard place. His character transformation from beginning to end is real and saddening. It's not easy to get me to care for CGI creatures, George Lucas failed, Peter Jackson succeeds, again. The alien creatures look great and I was surprised at how well I was able to connect to the Christopher character.<br/><br/>The film is original, fresh and unexpected. I was never bored and had no idea what was going to happen next. In all this action and drama, is there any room for some sweet romantic moments? The answer is yes and it ends on a beautiful note.<br/><br/>Go see this one in theatres."

","""District 9"" is a science fiction film that clearly states a message in it's arc of story. Producer Peter Jackson and first time director Neil Blomkamp takes a documentary/mock""u""mentary approach that we should understand other unknown species, we should protect strange lifeforms that come in our science laboratories and we should envict, protect and care for illegal human aliens who get a free ride into the country without being a licensed citizen and can't find a way to live on money because their jobless , that is the reality we have to face.<br/><br/>The fantasy of this movie is the fictional South African character Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley who gets picked upon as the head of the Department of Alien Affairs at Multi-National United Environmental Corporation in Johannesburg, South Africa to do a job. Wikus and his G-Men are going to drive out to the District 9 colony where these so called aliens nicknamed ""prawns"" have been living there for the last 28 years and now all the general population people want them out of the city, but MNU is buildung a facility called District 10 to keep these aliens away from the busy day lives of Earthlings. MNU has these big over-sized motor vehicles to keep them safe. The District 9 Colony is a junkyard and I mean a junkyard. These aliens who look like grasshoppers, shrimp and lobster tails with a over-sized tunic on their bodies need a reality check but they also need protection and possibly death. Some of them have children. While Wikus is their he finds a Nigerian soldier who is guarding the District 9 colony and only asks for money and aims a weapon at him. The third act of this movie is a action-packed thrill ride. Wikus transports himself with the alien spacecraft to the mother ship but does not succeed.<br/><br/>With all the hype out their and all the fanboyism ""movies"" this summer, ""District 9"" is a film that will be understood by the general population if you the moviegoer ""tells them what I just explained to you"".<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is a genius. Him as a producer is going to be what really sells this movie. Move over ""Lord of the Rings""(joking because I'm a fan of that movie) because there's a newbie in town. Director Neil Blomkamp is also the genius storywriter. Blomkamp took the science fiction genre and turned it right side up telling a story and visually shocking the general moviegoers who are just passing by for a entertaining show. I can't wait to see this film again. It will help us grow a little each day."

","2009 has been a really cool year for movies. We've gone into space and seen Captain Kirk get beaten like he owed people money in Star Trek. We've seen an angry old man use balloons to abduct a short little fat kid in Disney's Up. We've seen giant blue wangs in Watchmen. We've - well, not me, but apparently a lot of you - saw the Jonas Bros. sing inoffensive, diabetically sweet pop music in the Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. We even saw Optimus Prime beat the crap out of Shia LeBeouf in Transformers 2. And yet, none of those memorable moments mean anything compared to a single minute of District 9.<br/><br/>District 9, for those who don't know, is a film dealing with the arrival of aliens over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find themselves soon wardened into a segregated slum called District 9. What follows next is something I really can't address without spoiling the mystery of the film. This is one of those rare films that actually captures you way better if you have little idea of what it's about beforehand, and so, I won't address the story anymore than that.<br/><br/>There is simply no element in this movie that falls short. The cinematography is simply beautiful, with an incredible background set piece of the alien mothership hovering quietly throughout. CG in this film is of such a high quality that you seriously doubt that its budget was only 30 million. Any one alien or robot in the film looks far more realistic than any transformer. Pacing is incredible, with a very interesting, very quick revelation soon in that carries the film to an incredibly violent, very engrossing climax. Don't downplay that last sentence; this film is VERY violent. Alien weaponry does a messy number on human bodies. And yet, the most gripping aspect of it all is how it was filmed. About half of the movie is done in a documentary style, meaning you see the film through the lens of a news-camera. Unlike Cloverfield, however, the person holding it is not having a 2 hour long seizure. With such an incredible amount of attention to detail, the film is proud to show you everything without a single shake. Everything feels quite visceral, dramatic, and most of all, real due to this style.<br/><br/>Yes. District 9 feels like it could totally happen.<br/><br/>No one acts in a way that people wouldn't. It is, at the center, about humanity at its best and its worst.<br/><br/>And that, specifically, is something that you so rarely experience in films. Too many trips to the cinema lately are overly-escapist; even romantic comedies seem too...unlikely...nothing more than Hollywood magic. D9 places you in the center of the action and leaves you feeling as desperate and stressed as the main character. Every actor in the film melts into their role, feeling so honest and perfect. I sincerely hope that at least Sharlto Copley, playing Wikus, gets an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Too few alien encounter films so blur the line between good and evil. Your sympathies go both ways; to the humans suddenly inconvenienced by odd visitors, and to the aliens, hoarded away into ghastly, dirty slums. The ending of the film highlights that point perfectly, and will certainly have you leaving the theater in an enjoyable argument with someone else.<br/><br/>Who was right? <br/><br/>Who was wrong? <br/><br/>What will happen next?<br/><br/>Can we see this again? <br/><br/>I sure will."
"PWNYCNY","10","6","13","15 August 2009"," Best science fiction movie in years.
","It would be easy to poke holes in the story. What would be considered the most momentous event in human history, the arrival of aliens in a space ship, is reduced to the level of caricature as the aliens are portrayed as pests that have to be controlled and relocated. However, there is nothing implausible about that. Once the novelty had worn off, the presence of aliens probably would become something that would be taken for granted, especially if there were no way for them to leave. And furthermore, which country in the world would want to be responsible for having to deal with them? Hence, in the movie one country is stuck with having to deal with them, and that is not far-fetched at all. This movie is the best science fiction project produced by Hollywood in many years. The movie has an offbeat original story, great acting, lots of action, continuity and an actual beginning, middle and end. The plot is clearly spelled out and grabs and maintains audience interest. Also, the movie offers an innovative and sympathetic treatment of the aliens which further enriches the story. The movie inspires a short but profound question: what would we do if millions of aliens from who-knows-where showed up at earth and could not leave? Furthermore, the movie is without any pretentiousness and is presented in a straightforward, semi-documentary format which gives it an air of authenticity. The story may seem far-fetched but anything can happen and remember, what was once considered fiction in the past, such as devices allowing for instantaneous communication over huge distances and vehicles that can travel through space to other planets, is now reality today."

","I have never posted a comment on IMDb even though I have been coming here for years. I had to post a comment on this movie after seeing it today.<br/><br/>The special effects are astounding, seamless and just so damn realistic. The story itself wraps you into it, you really buy into it, it keeps you engaged through the whole movie. Totally.<br/><br/>This is best movie I have seen in the past 12-15 years and it is now in my top 5 movies of all time. Hell, maybe even top 3.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and go see this.

"das417","10","6","13","15 August 2009"," Moving and powerful, District 9 is the best movie of the year
","Aliens are not new to movies. We have seen them countless time either invading, killing, or enslaving humanity. That there is still room for an original story about an alien ""invasion"" shows that creative thought still exists within the movie world. District 9 is a reminder that even the most ordinary of sounding plots can still deliver. One will not see a major star or large budget. Peter Jackson is the only real known name with District 9 but even his presence is forgotten as the plot moves forward. The best movies of the year, District 9 is easily the standout movie of the summer.<br/><br/>South Africa becomes host to almost one million alien survivors of a ship that suddenly appears in the skies above Johannesburg. The United Nations and South Africa hand control over the aliens directly to a corporation known as MNU which, along with caring for the aliens, is also interested in their weaponry. It is discovered that that alien technology can only work with their DNA so humans are unable to use them. Placed into District 9, a slum that separates the aliens from the human population which fears them, the aliens are subjected to a life not too different from those who also suffer such poverty. <br/><br/>Wikus Van De Merwe(Sharlto Copley) is an uninteresting cubicle worker for MNU who is also the son-in-law of one of the major corporate owners of the company. When he is promoted to lead an eviction of the aliens from from District 9 where they were placed, he sees a chance at having a better future and a real career. The Prawns, as the aliens are known, earn no sympathy from him. Humans see them mostly as a problem that sucks away resource and breed crime. Wikus has the same mentality and has little ethical concerns about cheating the Prawns out of what little they already own.<br/><br/>That changes the day he arrives to serve the evictions. Suddenly sprayed by an strange alien chemical, Wikus finds himself transforming into one of the Prawns. Not only this is distributing to one who was as bigoted as himself, but it also drives MNU to hold him captive. His arm, which was the first to transform, is able to use the Prawn weaponry which makes him suddenly the most valuable man in the world. If MNU can discover how to transfer this biotechnology into humans then that will make them one of the most powerful corporations in the world.<br/><br/>Wikus, escaping and finding a place of hiding within District 9 itself, discover the chemical he found was the necessary fuel for Prawn shuttle which has remained hidden for years. Realizing how oppressive he had once been, Wikus joins with the Prawn who developed the fuel in not only an assault on MNU's headquarters but also a final stand in District 9 itself. It is the final scenes that make District 9 the most powerful because we see one of the most touching conversions seen in a story. From seeing the Prawns as simple creatures that can be ignored, Wikus sees their oppression as a cause worth fighting for even if it means losing his own life. <br/><br/>If there is a small complaint then it is that we never really learn more about the Prawns and why they were made so sick in the first place. Then there is the matter of leaving aliens in the hands of a private corporation. Would the United Nations leave such a duty to a group of businessmen? It seems unlikely, but this does not subtract from the movie too much. <br/><br/>District 9 is easily a commentary on the affairs of humans. That the Prawns would land in a country such as South Africa is evidence that the writers were attempting to say something about society as a whole. The barbarity of MNU and humans against those who are different compares to human prejudice against other humans. South Africa, once more, has experienced this throughout its history of being a colony and since independence. One cannot but feel a sense of the injustice delivered to the Prawns without thinking back up the injustices that humans continue to deliver to each other.<br/><br/>The question District 9 asks is how would aliens change humanity. Would humans be better or worse? Unlike other invasion movies, District 9 shows that human reaction may be one that is not so different in terms of dealing with those who are not the same. Prejudice, that human emotion so common in all nations, may still be very well alive when it comes to those from a different world. That, it seems, is the real tragedy of District 9.<br/><br/>10/10"
"billbink","10","6","13","14 August 2009"," A provocative, grim, violent, disturbing masterpiece
","I admit to being puzzled at those here who praise ""District 9"" as a superb action film with lots of kick ass scenes. For me, the brilliance of ""District 9"" is in its unrelenting grim and cynical portrayal of ALL of humanity, whether it be the multinational corporation out to exploit the aliens for their weapons technology, the Nigerian warlord who exploits the aliens for their love of ""catfood,"" or even the anti-hero of the film (he is clearly not a ""hero"") who until the very end is a selfish, self-centered and dim-witted twerp, drunk on his new found power and promotion and as racist and demeaning to the aliens as anyone else.<br/><br/>But even better than this aspect is how the writer and director allowed the aliens to be ""human"" in a very non-traditional way, i.e. they are JUST like us but only look different. Some of them are smart, some are dumb, some are violent, some are passive, some are compassionate, some are angry. It's amazing how few reviews I have read pick up on this VERY unique twist to a usual SF cliché. In SO many SF films, the aliens are either ""noble and pure"" or ""violent and homicidal."" The aliens in ""District 9"" are just like humans, i.e. they can be ""anything,"" not just all good or all bad. This is, IMO, intentional and is an underlying theme of the film. The difference between us is only skin deep.<br/><br/>For me, there are several gut-wrenching scenes in the film that stand out: when Wikkus is forced to kill the alien ""test subject"" with his alien weapon,when ""Christopher"" discovers the alien butchering that is being done for weapon research, and the final scene which I will leave unmentioned. These scenes were profoundly disturbing yet beautifully done and I admit to almost breaking into tears more than once.<br/><br/>The most shatteringly original aspect of ""District 9"" has nothing to do with the visuals (which are indeed jaw-dropping but again they serve the dystopian vision more than anything else) but instead is how at the end of the movie, the most compassionate ""human"" scene in the entire movie is the one between ""Christopher"" and his son as they leave...as the parent tenderly pats the youngster on his head. It is the ONLY moment of tenderness in the movie UNTIL the final soul-searing shot and THAT closing shot only underlies the director's and screenwriter's bleak view of humanity (one I share, by the way) since the character is no longer human at all.<br/><br/>Summing up, the sheer oppressiveness of the (genius) dystopian vision which is ""District 9"" makes the depressing ""Children of Men"" look like a Disney cartoon. While there is an undeniable visceral thrill at the vengeance enacted by Wikkus at the film's end, it reminds us of how we reacted during the helicopter attack in ""Apocalypse Now"" in which we were exhilarated yet repulsed at how wanton our bloodlust was. We want the evil doers punished, but as the film makes clear, WE ARE the evil doers ourselves.<br/><br/>As Pogo once opined ""We have met the enemy, and he is us."""
"fredman5555","10","6","13","14 August 2009"," Real or Fantasy?
","Right off the bat, let me tell you this movie is not for everyone. One couple who had come in loaded with food ended up walking out of the theater within the first ten minutes. If you're a person who squeamish over insects or light gore, don't go. If you're a person who has a vivid imagination to the point where the line between reality and fiction often blurs for you, don't go. If you don't like militant strong arms or thugs running profiting from the running of slums, don't go.<br/><br/>What this movie is, is a very fresh perspective on sci fi and on movie making -- something Hollywood badly needs! This movie is fiction (at least I assume it is -- :) ), but it is presented like a docu-drama. It begins as if it's something real which is happening in Africa today, and we're seeing real footage of the action. It gradually turns into the third person perspective where we're overseeing the events, and then it wraps up with the final moments of the docu-drama.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an excellent movie! I give it a 10 of 10! It's fresh, it depicts many elements of reality (if you read into the overtones) while using fantasy to do so. There's plenty of action, a moderate amount of gore (both human and alien), an abundance of inhumanity to other living creatures, and lots of swearing, but it's also a happy story of sorts. Interestingly, the story doesn't completely resolve (true of any real-life situation).<br/><br/>My fifteen year old son and I watched it and very much enjoyed it, but I'm glad my wife wasn't there because she likely would not have enjoyed it. I would probably see it again in the theater if I have time, and I recommend it to all (who don't fall into the exclusion clauses above).<br/><br/>Happy movie-going!"
"blueeyedguy25","10","6","13","14 August 2009"," It's been a long time for a great Sci-fi movie to come around; this is IT
","Just saw D-9. When I arrived at the theatre, each door had a large warning poster in official-sounding language reminding me that this is ""A Human-only Theatre. No Non-Humans Allowed!!"" with an ominous crustacean-like graphic below. Nice way to set the scene. The movie, set in South Africa, shows us mostly desolate, dry inhospitable locations and has an immediate gritty feel. The last great sci-fi movie I got excited about was James Cameron's ""Aliens"" which had the advanced weaponry of the US Colonial Marines going up against some very hostile life forms and the very first ""Starship Troopers"". Weapons fans will be delighted as both human and alien forces are armed with very interesting and exotic firearms. I won't say much to spoil any surprises, but the aliens themselves are very, very well done. There is NO way that this movie could have been made before today's CGI effects because to have so many aliens running around in rubber suits would never sell. Set in the near future, we see the human soldiers still carry with them the attitudes of cruelty and take joy in destruction. They lack any kind of mercy or empathy with the aliens. Peter Jackson has really outdone himself with this movie. Just like ""Frodo & Company"" had to set out on what seemed like an impossible quest, so does our hero in this movie. His very survival depends upon him completing seemingly Herculean tasks, making for a very interesting set of obstacles. The movie is noisy and explosions and battlefield sounds are frequent. My wife almost couldn't handle the first 30 minutes because of the shaky-camera technique (ala Cloverfield, to name one film) was bothering her head. After the first half-hour or so, the film moves from being a set of choppy flashbacks and documentary-style shots to more of a regular movie with much smoother camera movements. Hang in there because its worth it to see this film to completion. Great effects, great music and so believable. Of course, the film sets itself to be open to a sequel, which I wholeheartedly say YES to, hoping the studio sees it my way too. Fans of Sci Fi rejoice--we finally have one to crow about."

More than making your heart pump the blood times faster. Even more than believing what you see. Watching District 9 means living it to the point where you have no doubt that what is happening there is an absolute imminent reality, even though you never saw an alien before. And this is just the beginning -- what really makes your stomach freeze is the idea that while you hate those people in the movie, you realize that they're so much like you.

","Honestly, though, I went last night to a midnight showing-and I couldn't have been more happy with this movie.<br/><br/>To start off, the entire movie, beginning to end, was completely original. For one, the movie was filmed in a ""mockumentary"", which I have never experienced in any sci-fi movie before. Also, the brilliant film-makers involved in this great film actually gave the aliens some human emotion without allowing them to seem too human-they still had alien characteristics.<br/><br/>In addition, the plot was especially great, too. I went in knowing that some new alien race had stopped their ship over a city and were kept in captivity. Really, though, it was so much more, and it kept me on the end of my seat (clishe, I know, but very true to this movie). It kept me interested the entire time, and, at times, my jaw was left agape at what I was seeing. No one should miss this movie; it's worth every last cent!"

The soundtrack was amazing and it fit in with everything that was going on. The real world stuff that they brought into the movie was fit in perfectly and just everything was well put together.

Not very many laughs... unless like me you are completely desensitized to over the top violence. There may be a few scenes that could make you puke.. but only the very squeamish. If you can make it through the fly, you'll do fine. There is a lot of action and violence in this film, but the main driving force is the story. Yes kiddies, this is not AVP, there is drama in this film and a lot of it. You will find yourself almost ashamed of your own humanity. And i'm not the touchy protester type, but it's horrible that there are people in this world that go through a lot of what this film dictates. The cast was amazing, not one American accent in the entire film, which also gives it a great feel. <br/><br/>Now lets get to the action. If you happen to be a fan of first person shooters, you will see some familiar weapons here. Dare i say Grav Gun? But all in all, the action is great, and just enough of it. I will admit it does take awhile to get to the goods. But if you are just as interested in a great story and peoples heads exploding you won't mind."

Documenting various people and their thoughts on the aliens etc. The main actor, Sharlto Copley, has a great breakthrough performance, it being his first in a feature film. I do not want to give too much away because this film needs to be watched the whole way through for complete satisfaction. From start to finish it is a wonderful ride that dives through every emotion. During this movie, you will feel sad for the aliens. You will want them to succeed. This is an outstanding movie, that made me angry when something created from a computer was killed. This movie is a journey through the corrupt humans and their desires for power. Peter Jackson's name comes with the movie because it is on par with one of his.

"Irie212","3","7","16","16 August 2009"," Attempted allegory fails to help a formula buddy film
","In short: A sci-fi buddy flick with more repulsive gore than science.<br/><br/>The buddies here are a kevlar-vested bureaucrat and a bolero-vested ""prawn"" or alien. Most buddy movies have the buddies start as enemies and become friends, and ""District 9"" follows that formula. Think ""48 Hours,"" if Eddie Murphy was a prawn instead of Nick Nolte's pawn.<br/><br/>A few clever ideas stand out (not including the failed attempt at cinema verite), especially the fact that the aliens have already been on Earth for 20 years when the movie begins, which recognizes that, as with most invasions, the problem is the aftermath. (How long have we been occupying Iraq now? 6 years?). Their spacecraft appears derelict, just hovering over Johannesburg—a location that delivers the obvious metaphor: District 9, the enclosed alien encampment, is like a bantustan from the era of apartheid.<br/><br/>The best plot ideas have to do with alien weaponry. The prawns have arms which only they can use—only their DNA works on the trigger. Not bad, right? Even better is the acknowledgment that we humans are more interested in finding out a way to use those weapons than we are in any kind of lasting détente with the aliens-- let alone the fact that humans apparently have zero interest in where the aliens came from, why they're here, details of their obviously superior technology, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>To top it all off, there's no ending. Instead, we're left with characters' promises that there will be retribution and salvation in the future. Is ""District 10"" already in the works? I hope not."

","District 9 is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.It's been years since i've walked out of the theatre giddy like a little child (i'm 23) from what i had just bared witness too on the screen.I went to the midnight release and was so captivated but this film that i've come out of hiding to write a semi film review.This film deserves it.<br/><br/>District 9 is the story of an alien mothership containing a very high number of populace of alien beings that appear to have fallen on hard times and had to make a stop over earth..and us humans make a decision that we have to ""help"" the aliens to we move all of them off of their mothership and down to earth into slums, pretty much how we treated the Japanese Americans during world war 2.it's a horrible treatment but everyone has there own reasons and they all come to light during the film.Now the plot goes much deeper then this and it would be a shame to ruin anything else for you.You really have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>As far as actors chances are you wont recognize anyone on screen. Which is a blessing, leaving us able to focus on the brilliant story and not wondering what's the latest will smith alien film like. With the screenplay and the directors work we are pulled right in and you find yourself quickly siding with the aliens (or at least i did)The treatment bestowed upon them is just horrid. And seeing it makes your question how much of this is based on the things that are really happening in this world. The camera work is top notch, at times a bit shaky but i felt like it added realism to the picture. it wasn't so much that i felt myself growing queasy so don't fret. you get some great panning shots and some POV shots.<br/><br/>But the films greatest strength is going to be the story and the action..of course one only strengthens the other..cause the film is a complete work of genius.but they has never been so many times in a film that i found myself thinking ""wow did i just see that""...""oh shi*t that's amazing""..were giving the most flawless CG i've seen yet..it's not a single standout character like smeagol or autobots but all the aliens look so realistic which makes it that much easier to believe what i'm seeing.<br/><br/>The film starts out so strong and never lets up..when i walked out of the theatre my 1st thought was when can i see this again. Finally a film that deserves all the credit and the money that it earns. Not seeing this film would be a huge mistake on anyones part. Of course the violence is extreme at parts when said weapons our used on said humans but it's to be expected on a science fiction films. I haven't been this pleased with a Sci-fi action film since the late great Aliens, and i do believe that District 9 is better. This really is the film of the summer and i believe the film of the year, maybe the last 5 years..See district 9."

","I think the only reason I watched this the first time is because I was in high school and it was popular. I just turned it off 30 mins in because Sharlto Copley's character did something way too dumb to forgive.<br/><br/>The entire first act is A) unbearable to watch due to the camera action (and I enjoyed Cloverfield) and B) unbearable to watch due to Sharlto's awful South African accent. If you make it past there, you get into a story trying to make you like someone who is taking joy in evicting residents who are unwillingly stuck in a country, city, planet that doesn't want them there. I had to turn it off this time because our ""hero"" finds an unknown device of alien origin with alien markings filled with an alien goo and inexplicably opens it and it sprays him in the face, catalyzing act 3. From here, what I remember is fuzzy but I know it makes no sense that fuel would morph another species into your species. It's literally like if we poured gasoline on a shrimp and it sprouted arms, legs, etc. <br/><br/>And, yes, I know that this is a metaphor for apartheid.

","This film shows quite clearly what the writer of the story thought about apartheid, an idea of a time he could have no clue about. First of all Neill Blomkamp was born near the end of apartheid and was too young to have seen any of the ""unfairness"". Then he also immigrated to Canada at the age of 18, meaning that he was from a strong financial family. To top things off he attended Vancouver University, a feat that no upper middle-class family could dream to achieve. So I want to know, what on earth made him an ""expert"" on apartheid and what on earth was he thinking bringing aliens into it all?!<br/><br/>The film is basically an ANC propaganda film, with Wikus playing the part of FW De Klerk and Christopher playing the role of Nelson Mandela. Two different species (races) uniting for the freedom of the majority. It is a film about a smart alien race who endured space for years with technology that would destroy anything we can throw at them yet they were too ""stupid"" to use this tech for some reason??!! Was it because Neill sees black south africans as stupid? The main character Wikus was a prawn hater turned prawn lover without reason or premise. <br/><br/>My review might not be the best worded, but it's because too many angry thoughts are going through my head, this was horrible and a waste of money making it so high budget just to spread more false south African propaganda. <br/><br/>The only reason this film isn't getting a 1/10 from me is because as a south African I feel the need to give higher rating for our films, but this is with a very heavy heart"

","District 9 is a film that is shot incredibly well and it does look amazing. The action towards the end is quite good but on the whole it was just a bit boring. I thought the film was supposed to be full of violence and gore? Well the blood from the 'prawns' just didn't look realistic at all. The human characters weren't that great but I really liked Christoper and the baby prawn.<br/><br/>The plot was solid and the potential was there. I just think it could've been executed better. It was shot a bit 'documentary style' which I didn't really like and the camera seemed shaky. The film did get better when it got into the main story but I feel it could've been so much more, I wanted more action. The story did seem a bit mixed up as well. It was one of them films that I wanted to love, but it just didn't hit the spot for me. <br/><br/>Overall it was quite a disappointment, although it did look amazing. It isn't something I would watch again but I can appreciate why others rate it so highly. <br/><br/>5/10."

","Was gonna give it an 8 but i just cared so damn much about the prawns that it made me realise that out of all the big summer blockbusters I've seen, this one really got me rooting for the main characters. <br/><br/>Brilliant concept for a film and i enjoyed the documentary style scenes, it really gives a huge sense of realism. The choice of Johannesburg is good as well, it allows for the film to tackle some real life issues as well as deliver a mind blowing sci-fi plot. <br/><br/>The film definitely has a point to make about apartheid and racial segregation. This movie shows how harsh humans can be when there is a different race looking to seek refuge in their country, it really makes us out as monsters at points. <br/><br/>The main character is played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley, looks like he could become a huge star off of the back of this film.

","I like the way it starts out easy going in the beginning, documentary style, continually intensifies almost to the end where it then eases back into documentary mode bringing it home softly. Like a good song.<br/><br/>Also got a kick out of their South African accents not to mention the irony of the humans' names vs. the aliens' names. From an American's perspective anyway.<br/><br/>I saw a few complaints about plot. It seems to me if you can accept the biggest unexplained plot point, How did the aliens solve the problems of deep space travel, you can accept other unexplained plot points and just chalk it up to sociological differences between the species.<br/><br/>To address one such complaint I saw: why did Chris become bonded to Wikus after being betrayed? I didn't find this surprising. Towards the beginning the prawns were depicted as gullible. In other words trusting when it is undeserved. In the end, Wikus sacrificed for the principle and Chris was the beneficiary of that, Chris's trust more easily returned than a human would trust again.<br/><br/>Another complaint I recall: why was Wikus's access code still good at the lab? It wasn't his own personal access code. That door only required a pass code. All such doors I have had experience with there is only one pass code that everyone knows. Much like a combination lock on your bicycle. It's much harder to change that and get the word out to everyone who needs to get in. Had it been badge authentication or badge and pass code then it is usually personalized."

","I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie that had me on the edge of my seat like this. I cannot remember the last time a movie gave me such a mixture of emotions. The story was not meant to be political, according to the director in interviews that can be found on the special features of the Blu-ray release. But you cannot help but feel drawn to how humans were treated in much the same way during the partide in Africa. The use of CGI is masterminded to absolute perfection, which is a lot to be said for a lot of so called Hollywood blockbusters these days. The cast and script were all top notch. As for those in the forums who have said about plot holes, i feel this movie was designed to be watched more than once. I certainly felt so!.

","""It's got action. Big action. But in some ways it's also my anti-war film."" – James Cameron <br/><br/>Released the same year as James Cameron's ""Avatar"", ""District 9"" essentially tells the same tale on a smaller budget. Like ""Avatar"", we watch as a young man ""becomes an alien"", learns to empathise with these ""strange creatures"" and then helps them battle a greedy corporation bent on exploiting their technology. Unlike Cameron's film, however, ""District 9"" is a bit more grungy in its approach, director Neill Blomkamp using faux documentary footage, shaky cameras, interview segments and a selfish hero, all of which help to keep ""District's"" copious clichés somewhat fresh.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's second half quickly degenerates into a mindless shoot-em-up. What started off as an interesting sci-fi parable, quickly becomes an action movie reliant on chase scenes and an anime inspired robot-suit battle which – despite trumping Cameron's similar robot-suit battle at the end of ""Avatar"" – still feels too much like a video game.<br/><br/>Many have complained that the film makes allusions to Apartheid in South Africa (the aliens become slum dwelling blacks, ostracised by the whites), only to then abandon any real world context by having the ""blacks"" defeat the whites and then escape to their Mother Ship. But should this surprise us? ""Avatar's"" blue skinned ""native American Indians"" may have been slaughtered in real life, but in Cameron's film they likewise valiantly defeat their enemies.<br/><br/>The truth is, this is a common narrative arc in Hollywood. All these films are racial fantasies which resolve themselves in similar ways, cinema allowing us to exorcise our demons by helping the ""rebels"" defeat the ""empire"" and win. Those ""ugly foreigners"" may die in real life, but on screen we always help our little buddies triumph. How cute.<br/><br/>Indeed, with its airborne snipers, armoured convoys, circling helicopters and dirty shanty towns, ""District 9"" is best compared to Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" (itself just one successor to old Cowboy vs Indian westerns) a film in which white soldiers mercilessly gun down a horde of slum dwelling, gun toting Africans because they ""left a buddy behind"". But with ""District 9"", the situation is reversed. The revenge fantasy is granted and the ""left behind"" aliens are allowed to destroy the white man before catching a ride back home.<br/><br/>And while ""socially conscious"" ""war movies"" like ""Avatar"" and ""District"" pander to fantasy, ""straight"" war movies simply portray the fantasy from the opposite perspective. Whether it be ""Platoon"", ""Private Ryan"", ""Zulu"" or ""Black Hawk Down"", the white man is always allowed to callously gun down hordes of aliens because our sorrow is always directed internally. We weep when our brothers in uniform die, because violence sucks when it happens to us. Very rarely do war films build to a climax in which one is positioned to mourn, or even consider, the loss of the Other.<br/><br/>So while films like ""Avatar"" and ""District 9"" pretend to be ""socially relevant"", they really just pander to the flip-side of the usual Hollywood formula. The Camerons, Costners and Blomkamps of the world want to mourn the slaughter of blacks, Indians, Vietnamese and intergalactic aliens, whilst simultaneously demonizing the might of military and corporate muscle, whilst the Stone's, Spielberg's and Scott's of the world want to romanticise our boys and bask in the nostalgic glow of brothers dying bravely in combat like blood splattered Christs, whilst simultaneously exalting the ""never leave a brother behind"" ethos of benevolent leaders. There is some truth in both approaches, perhaps, but too often these formulae resolve themselves by resorting to comfortable traditions and wish fulfilment. At least ""District 9"" ""updates"" some of these problems by having the ally of the aliens be a nerdy bastard who couldn't give a crap about helping the underdogs. Perhaps this is the future: I recognise your problem, but will only help you if it helps mine. Or to put it in ""Avatar"" terms: I see you, but don't give a f**k.<br/><br/>The real cutting edge of these themes can probably be found in such odd ""war films"" as Godard's ""Our Music"", in which the anger is precisely that it may be impossible for modern cinema – because of various factors which Godard catalogues like a raging professor - to actually give a hoot about the alien Other on screen (anti-establishment cinema is now a product sold by the status quo- think a smug politician like Al Gore telling us about climate change, or think ""Full Metal Jacket"", where a marine's anti-establishmentarianism is shown to itself be the seed of all working ideology). But it will be decades until such trends filter into the mainstream.<br/><br/>Aesthetically the film is fast and manic, though also thin. This is unsurprising. Old school Spectacle is dead. This is the age of information overload, of narrative excess, which is perhaps why the first act of ""District 9"", which bombards us with information, mixed points of views, documentary footage and interviews, feels the most spontaneous, exciting and energetic.<br/><br/>The film's climax hints at a sequel, but its hard to see where Blomkamp can take this material without going where ""Alien Nation"" went decades earlier. Perhaps the victimised aliens come back and wreck vengeance on Earthlings? Maybe a white hero stands up for all little guys, not just aliens? ""Defiance"" meets ""Inglorious Basterds"" with aliens? Blomkamp is so behind the times he might just do one of these.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - Worth one viewing."
"diac228","8","3","5","12 January 2010"," What are we watching again!?!?
","So, name a movie that is a mix of mockumentary, thriller, action, sci-fi, and political commentary? Can't come up with one? Well, in case a random question like this pops up in Jeopardy, the answer is District 9. Resembling nothing that was shown in the trailer, District 9 is a crazy-different way to look at cinema and the genre of science fiction. The movie itself is split into two major parts: starting off as a subtle hilarious mockumentary, but then quickly shifts in tone when the stakes are higher and danger is rounding the corner. This unique approach to telling the story about aliens stranded in Earth being shunned from human society will whether totally impress you or bore you to death, its very hit-and-miss. Even if the beginning isn't your cup of tea, stick around, because the true insanity starts once the events behind the camera start unfolding.<br/><br/>District 9 involves a man Wikus (Sharlto Copley), in charge of attempting to peacefully relocate the alien species currently inhabiting Earth. With the entire army behind him, he sets off to District 9 to warn the aliens to move without conflict, or problems will occur. In the midst of the relocating and checking for any illegal activities and supplies, he becomes exposed to their biotechnology, resulting in him becoming a fugitive and in grave danger of losing everything he had worked for. At the same time, some of the aliens may be making process towards ending their alienation (pun intended) with the Earth. Based off of a short film directed by the same man helming this visual roller coaster, District 9 is a major allegory to the issues happening in Africa and the Middle East. Yes, there is a political slant involved, but it never distracts from the original story.<br/><br/>The script is quite clever, but it's the directing and visual style that absolutely stands out. The first half of the movie is in a documentary format full of interviews and backstory as to how the scenario (and now issue) has come at hand. In this same documentary format, we enter the District 9 world, and see the poor condition the aliens were living through. We also see the corruption, greed, and evilness that occupy the same area. The camera vibrates, moves, and breathes just like a documentary, and the footage of the aliens intertwining and interacting with humans looks downright realistic to the core. Special effects and special directing can be attributed to this incredible accomplishment.<br/><br/>Acting also enhances the documentary feel, as a good portion of the dialogue in the beginning is improvised on the spot, giving it an even greater feel that these events can be unfolding thousands of miles away. Everyone reacts to the CGI aliens with accuracy and realism, almost as well as Jurassic Park (which remains the best film in terms of the actors interacting with the special effects). Unlike in most sci-fi flicks, there is a good bit of emotional sentimentality, especially that of Wikus and his wife.<br/><br/>The second half is where the entire movie turns around and becomes something totally different. In a style akin to From Dusk Till' Dawn (which turned from suspense to full-out vampire horror), District 9 starts off as a politically-motivated mockumentary with humorous undertones to a heavy action thriller with science fiction touches left and right. This will whether enhance the movie for you or totally turn you off from it. The shift in style never really changes the tone and theme of the movie, so it was a seamless transition (unlike From Dusk Till' Dawn and Pineapple Express), and one that feeds the action-starved viewers sitting through the first half. We wondered where the R-rating came from, and it wasn't until the action began dominating that we didn't see it.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp directed the documentary footage well, but truly showed his skills when the action increased, especially considering the low budget. The weapons were impressive, the shootouts were tightly-edited, and the film never drops in suspense and thrills until the very end of the film. With very little time to breathe, you see blood spill to the screen, you see bodies flying everywhere, and you see that with a limited budget, you can still deliver very impressive visuals. While the ending came up a bit fast considering all we went through, it was a crazy ride from start to finish, and one you cannot claim you've been through before.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: District 9 is the cure for the common sci-fi. This film will become a major influence to studios everywhere, because it was a visually stunning film, and it comes with a budget of less than 35 million—which is less than a quarter of the budget of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Blomkamp's first film was a success because of his ability to blend special effects and capture the emotions of the actors and actresses involved without going over-the-top. The first half gives the film a small sense of realism, and the second half gives the film a dosage of adrenaline that propels the movie through around half an hour of relentless action. As long as you don't mind the total shift in genre and style, then you are in for an exhilarating two hours."
"gavin6942","7","3","5","4 January 2010"," A Nice Analogy About Racism and Oppression
","An alien mothership hovers over South Africa, and millions of aliens, starving and weak, spill out. They are put into camps in District 9, a section of shacks that is poor and largely run by gang members. Weapons and food get traded on the black market. What is to be done? As I type this (January 2010), this film is ranked #102 of all time. It's a fine film, but really? Almost top 100 of all time? That seems a little fishy to me, and I suspect if I ever revise this review, it will drop to 200 or lower.<br/><br/>Writer and director Neill Blomkamp has taken some good science fiction -- aliens, genetic manipulation, advanced weaponry -- and combined it with a subtle, or maybe not so subtle, message about racism and South African apartheid. While there is clearly a difference between aliens and people, is it that much different from the divide amongst races? After all, the prawns in this film clearly operate on at least our level.<br/><br/>The apartheid analogy gets a bit muddled with the genetic aspect... I don't see white South Africans turning black, especially after ingesting fuel. But it's a story, and a well-written one at that, with no predecessors that come to mind. Blomkamp has really unleashed a unique piece of film here. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for producing this one.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do. Science fiction fans will obviously enjoy it, but it goes beyond that. One friend of mine, who I would not suspect is a sci-fi fan, really loved it for the message of family. Even aliens have families in District 9. I would gladly watch this one again, though I'm still confused about the interspecies prostitution."
"hyprsleepy","Null","3","5","19 September 2009"," This movie is often misunderstood
","District 9 is an action packed science fiction film that deals with morality and ethics.<br/><br/>After watching it a second time I realized that what the human news reporters thought was a ""control module"" that dropped off the mother ship was really Christopher's ship! It pulled on my heart strings when watching the father & son bond and made me wish I had a kid of my own. <br/><br/>The social commentary was sharp and did not pull any punches, which is probably why it hurt a few people's feelings and ruffled some feathers. Not everyone will like or identify with the main character and if this is a sticking point for you then you may dislike the film because he's not a terribly likable guy.<br/><br/>In regards to the negative comments: <br/><br/>#1. Some wonder why the aliens would allow the humans to boss them around even when they were stronger and had such great technology and weapons. It was mentioned in the movie that the aliens were very docile and easy to command. This is probably because they were ""workers"" and more akin to insects such as ants and bees than mammals. <br/><br/>It is normal for us to think that aliens would think like us, but this is assuming far too much.<br/><br/>#2. District 9 takes the struggle of the blacks in Africa during the apartheid and turns it on it's head - making the blacks the ones who were being racist and cruel. This has angered some blacks who think that movie makes them look bad, but hey anyone can discriminate against other humans (or species). The main character's name is a very common one among the white oppressors and the Prawn's language has a lot of clicking sounds, much like the Bantu tribes that were victims of the apartheid. There really were signs many years ago saying that blacks were not allowed. This wasn't a clumsy half-hearted attempt at a historical connection as some have asserted.<br/><br/>#3. Some think that the movie makes humans look bad or that the way they behaved was unrealistic. Humans have the capacity to be bad though! If aliens landed on earth and needed our assistance and the whole world was watching, yes we would help them. You know no country would allow themselves to be publicly shown to be heartless. No they would not blow up the ship or attack it, especially without provocation. Once they were on the ground yes, we would quarantine them so that they were separate from the human population. That's only smart and a good safety precaution. Yes, we would monitor them militarily, especially upon first contact as oral communication would be difficult or impossible thus leaving force as the only universal language available. Of course we would build them shanties and not mansions. Is it likely that any humans who lived near the aliens would feel about as comfortable as they would living next to a maximum security prison? Absolutely. Would companies that dealt with weapons be interested in the aliens, sure. Would such companies have the money to push law makers around and put themselves into a favorable position to gather technology? Probably. This isn't a plot hole as previous commenters have suggested. The movie is quite logical and realistic in it's depiction of how humans would react if aliens like the Prawns were found hungry, dying, and in bad shape.<br/><br/>District 9 has an important message - do not judge a book by its cover. Something we all should remember but too often forget."

","Its unusual, exciting and has a message. I'd recommend to watch it, even if you are having doubts in the beginning. <br/><br/>It starts like a documentary, which I am personally already tired off, and compared the aliens situation with the black south African society. Stupid and painful statements that you heard white people uttering during the apartheid regime are copied word for word to classify the aliens. I personally had difficulties with that. Anyhow after a while into the movie, it begun to unfold its strength. <br/><br/>Aside of this great development, the fact that the freaked out utterly primitive dealers supplying the aliens with all sort of stuff are always referred to as ""Nigerians"" was also rather annoying, especially when you are coming from Nigeria. It would have been less bothersome to just call them Gangs or Dealers or whatever. That was about all that irritated me. I really liked the way the movie developed, and enjoyed how the movie progressed. By all means give it a try if you can cope with the above mentioned details and you will watch a sci-fi movie that gives you a ""new feeling"" in the end."
"jayarava","6","3","5","4 September 2009"," OK but...
","Don't get me wrong - this is a good movie in many ways. The special effects are great, it is grittily realistic, mostly good acting especially from the main character, yadda yadda. The semi documentary thing works well enough, and blends OK with the 'real' action. But in many respects it is quite predictable and not saying much that we don't already know. Indeed in many ways it is rehearsing some well worn clichés about how we react to outsiders. Worse it seems to fall back on Hollywood formulae towards the end - references to every American Marine movie may well have been unintentional I suppose, but at one point I was also thinking of ET.<br/><br/>It's a difficult movie from the point of view of the shear number of murders and vapourisations that occur - it must be well over 100. It means I left the theatre feeling more numb than anything else - other emotions regarding the ending (which I anxious not to give away) were drowned out by the gunfire and flying blood. The film showcases the emotion of anger, hard and bitter anger. Ironically the callousness of some of the characters must be fostered by a movie which numbs us to the reality of violence, so in a sense the movie is participating in the problem rather than offering a vision of another way of doing things.<br/><br/>I think we have to treat this movie as entertainment of the gruesome kind (that I associate with Peter Jackson), certainly not a horror film, though horrific in parts; but we should not treat it as saying anything new or insightful about prejudice because it doesn't. And what it does say is not at all subtle - perhaps this was the point, but I'm not sure anyone on the wrong end of a bludgeon was ever truly convinced of anything - isn't this what the story of South Africa has really shown us? So why bludgeon us with a film?"

","I went to see this movie on the strength of the ratings. It was a massive disappointment. IMDb - I think you need to check the IP addresses of reviewers. Are they all from South Africa by any chance? The movie is a hodge podge of borrowed clichés and visuals from start to finish. First the spaceship arrives over Johannesburg in the manner of Independence Day. However the rest of the world fail to notice when the aliens (prawns) inside are discovered to be malnourished and confused, so a local company is contracted to put them all in unguarded shanty towns where they can mix freely with the poor human population. At this point the movie shifts from being a sci-fi movie (not that it ever was, because the spaceship is inert the whole time) to a social commentary type with thinly veiled references to Apartheid. The local Nigerian gangsters are portrayed in the film pretty much the same way as they are demonised by local South Africans in reality. Its also only a matter of time before the locals start calling Zimbabweans Prawns. Yes, the film actually adds to the already hateful xenophobia which exists in South Africa.<br/><br/>Setting aside the appallingly superficial and narrow minded social commentary - we are then treated to a Blade Runner type landscape where Transformer like Mechs fight it out with stereotypical mercenary types. We even have the hero mutating into a Prawn in the manner of the Fly, whereupon he is taken away for medical experiments.

With all the crap Science Fiction films that have been coming out in recent years, I have been waiting a long time for some good cinema and this seemed to have it all. I really didn't know what to expect, and then within the first 10 minutes of the film, I knew this one was going to hit me like a truck with a lot of crap. First off, I felt like I was watching some kinda Geico TV Commercial, I think it has to do with the acting, script/humor, and parts of the visual effects. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie for some reason. Second thing that really turned me off was why the hell did the fuel for the alien ship turn the protagonist into an Alien? It didn't make any freak'n sense why the Aliens were handing their weapons to the humans for cat food when they could have destroyed the human race. Also the alien and humans were communicating way too easily (But this is excusable). The African gangsters are dumbed down, and they really think they can become aliens by eating them? All the characters were one dimensional and the action had no suspense. It was funny occasionally to see people getting blown up, but I was never excited at one point of the film. Im really hoping Avatar will blow this fish off the sea because it was a complete waist of time and money."

","Well where to start off? I like most sci-fi fans could not wait to see this movie after watching the trailer, especially after seeing it receive a 9.1 on IMDb... That really got me excited and this most certainly would live up to its hype right? Wrong! Movie starts off with an ET ship that crash landed on Earth for whatever reason and is stranded. The aliens are then held in a remote area and are imprisoned in a slum like environment living like animals for about 25 years as the humans try to figure out their weaponry. While in these slums these aliens trade their super advanced weaponry to other humans living in the slums for cat food. Yes cat food! That itself is retarded, a super advance alien race crash lands on earth but to be held captive and trade their weaponry to barely survive on cat food. If you want to know more about this, I dare you to go watch it because it gets worse."

","I shan't bother you with a synopsis of the movie, I really took the time to register on the site to give you my opinion. That simply put is do not waste your money, it is one of the worst movies I have seen with the exception of the Blair Witch Project. The last 10-15 minutes were OK, beyond that not worth the admission price. The acting was poor, I'm all for using new unearthed actors which would be ones to watch for the future, but sadly there weren't any in this film, with the exception of the child alien (prawn) Oh I forgot that was a CGI and really didn't have a great speaking part. The script well let's not bother the film makers obviously weren't it could have been a classic as some have eluded too but in reality it was far far less. The CGI was ""OK"" that's it period but the film had the chance to be so much more than that and simply put it wasn't. It was predictable, slow and really I felt I'd wasted my money,please don't waste yours."

","I was very excited about this movie after seeing the trailers. One thing I didn't agree with was the fact that they showed the prawns (Aliens) during the commercials. That tactic in movie cinema is hardly ever done. They usually have you anticipate how the creature will look. Anyway, as the movie goes it really wasn't my kind of movie. The first 30-40 minutes was documentary style to give the movie a real feel but for me it really didn't do it as it just really bored me. Minutes later it goes to a more movie style play and even thou I still found myself falling asleep and really not enjoying this movie. Yes it was really original it wasn't your typical remake junk it was a good story but for me it just didn't keep me interested long enough to enjoy it. I was with my 6 year old and understandable yes he is 6 but his exact words after the credits were ""dad this was boring"" I feel the commercial showed way to much and really the movie itself just dragged at many points. The CGI was great, the look of the PRAWNS was unique being the fact that they didn't use the basic big headed big eyes aliens. Knowing this, this is a movie I wont want to sit thru a second time or even bother to buy on DVD. Original YES.... Summer blockbuster NO!!!"

","This mind blowing indie film is in my opinion the best picture of 2009. We were lucky to get precious sci-fi art gems in the past decades. 2001 A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner etc were sci fi masterpieces. But there were no sci-fi masterpieces in our technological era(Apart from some good films ). Odd, but true,cinema of 21st century was deprived of a true scifi film with real substance and insight. But the wait is over. We got our masterpiece in this small indie film. It ruthlessly unveils human darkness, our ethnic intolerance and questions the basis of our civilization. Metaphorically rich, thought provoking, magnificent acting,strong narrative and splendid direction, District 9 is awesome in many ways.I bet you, this one is not gonna be forgotten soon."
"EUyeshima","8","4","8","9 February 2010"," Role-Reversal Alien Thriller is One Part Documentary, One Part Allegory and One Part Horror Film
","It's strange to call a science-fiction thriller eerily captivating, but first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp has somehow managed to earn that description with a most unexpected twist on the alien invasion genre of films. Based on a six-minute short, ""Alive in Joburg"", he made back in 2005, director/co-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp has fashioned a propulsive, corking adventure film that manages to be a thoughtful allegory on xenophobia, corporate greed, and due to its South African location, apartheid. What is most fascinating about the screenplay co-written by Terri Tatchell is that the aliens are not positioned to the viewer as an unknown force ready to destroy mankind, as is usually the case, but rather as an escalating socio-political ""situation"" to which the South African government respond by assigning a multinational corporation to transport them from a ramshackle, inner-city shantytown called District 9 to another area outside of Johannesburg.<br/><br/>Turning our expectations upside down, Blomkamp reveals an obviously powerful alien species rendered helpless on earth by their refugee status and relegated to criminal acts. In mock-documentary style, the story begins with a series of interviews explaining the back story for the aliens. A gigantic spaceship hovers over Johannesburg in 1982 (shades of Roland Emmerich's 1996 ""Independence Day"") where an exploratory team discovers over a million malnourished aliens onboard without a leader. They are tall bipeds with insect-like faces and crustacean-like bodies (looking very much like Jeff Goldblum's fully transformed title character in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of ""The Fly""). Over the next two decades, the aliens conform to their squalid surroundings and engage in destructive behavior that raises the ire of the local residents who call them derogatorily ""prawns"". An officious Afrikaan field operative named Wikus Van De Merwe has been assigned the unenviable task of serving eviction notices to the aliens and confiscating their weaponry.<br/><br/>On one particular raid, Van De Merwe inadvertently sprays himself with a mysterious liquid that mutates his DNA to take on alien characteristics. He is shunted to District 9 where he relies on a more thoughtful alien named Christopher Johnson to help him reverse the transformation process. Before that can happen, the multinational corporation wants Van De Merwe for his new-found ability to handle alien weaponry (which humans cannot operate). There is also trouble brewing with Nigerian gangs eventually leading to a violent mêlée that decides the fate of not only Van De Merwe but also the aliens on earth. Blomkamp decided to cast a first-time feature actor, Sharlto Copley, as Van De Merwe, and he is quite effective in the role. At first, he appears to be a geeky corporate lackey married to the boss's daughter and intent on carrying forth his undesirable mission with little trepidation. Copley manages to show his character's arc in not only the manifestation of graphic effects but also through the sinking dejection he experiences as an evolving alien.<br/><br/>All the aliens are CGI-generated, and kudos belong to the visual effects team headed by Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, and Matt Aitken for giving them a scarifying look to contrast their increasingly vulnerable state. Make no mistake that despite the film's grander statements regarding the detrimental impact of social segregation, it turns primarily into a man-on-the-run (or should I say ""alien-on-the-run"") B-style thriller with eye-wincing horror elements. There is a robust set of extras with the two-disc 2010 DVD set. The first disc contains 25 minutes of deleted scenes, a strong making-of documentary, and an engaging commentary track from Blomkamp. The second disc is on the light side, offering four featurettes which detail various aspects of the production, but unfortunately, there is no sign of the original short, ""Alive in Joburg""."
"lizziebeth-1","9","4","8","7 February 2010"," Mockumentary surprisingly results in legitimate ""traditional SF first contact"" tale.
","Mockumentaries are tricky. They dally with logic stretches beyond the ""norm"" in their given topic, so they must appeal to the partial ignorance and vanity about that ignorance in their audience. Our question is whether the whole of D9's output is worthier than its tricks. -Happily, YES; D9 extracts black humour from the racism/Apartheid being satirized, yet tries hard to stretch its ""norms"" only a little. <br/><br/>In fact D9's mock is a high-wire act, partly for having such a serious subject-matter co-written for laughs by an expatriate South African(Neill Blomkamp's accent is now Canadian), but also for using digital exobiologic realism that surpasses previous alien character-designs, last seen within such a banal human environment 20yrs ago in Alien Nation(1988). <br/><br/>Therefore D9's primary originality comes in intercutting its plotted action with mock ""found footage"". Blomkamp's storytelling, because it's well done, amounts to Oscar-worthy editing. Such proficient deployment, for example, of ""tv vision"" successfully embeds us in a sense of history passing, giving the film considerable (mock) gravitas. <br/><br/>Blomkamp's and producer Peter Jackson(Bad Taste(1988))'s tastes do run to ""blokey"" schlock--cf the grisly objects, characters and ""exploding meat-bags"" in D9--but this grisliness is integral to its far more sophisticated story punctuating the value of life in a caustic slum. <br/><br/>The authentic Chiawelo location was a coup, but my hackles were raised when I found D9 to be missing worldwide perspective. Despite repeatedly referencing ""the whole world watching"" Joburg's ""first contact"", there is nil political influence on the locals and no worldwide commentary or footage--a glaring plot-point to have overlooked for Blomkamp's budgetary concerns. <br/><br/>Although it suffers from plot-rushing and a pile-up of ""Hail-Mary-passes"" during the last act, D9 manages to organically combine several Hollywood blockbusters with its own rare originality to result in a (surprisingly) legitimate ""traditional SF first-contact"" tale. <br/><br/>The film's success rests on (male) audience sophistication. <br/><br/>Realising that racism has an economic purpose pivots us toward the aliens to begin ""rooting for"" the film's rousing ending. The audience also traverses a huge emotional arc in tandem with the story's lead. Wikus(Sharlto Copley) is our hapless bureaucrat toiling for a multinational, until he's accidentally contaminated by intelligent alien nanofluid, becoming MNU's ""most hunted"". <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Blomkamp--a feature-novice director--neglects to verify his ""MNU"" (Multi_National_United) as NOT the UN; confused readers should consult the DVD 2nd-disc short ""Conception and Design""(at 8:53m). <br/><br/>Blomkamp/Tatchell's collaborated screenplay paints Wikus a lame, ""not very smart""(his mother) ""good son"" who's opportunistically racist toward anyone over whom he can exert control; but he still doesn't deserve what happens to him. Because Wikus' character was seeded as wary of the downside of ""cowboy""/mercenary ethics, we trust he'll rise above his pathetic cowardice. He even instructs his hand-picked field replacement--a black man smarter than himself, Fundiswa(Mandla Gaduka)--how to butt heads with the military subcontractors lead by Koobus Venter(David James). During this funny beat on military/civilian enmity, Koobus' team refer to Wikus as ""the FNG""(F'cking New Guy), while Wikus quips about them with an inverted adage:""They shoot first, then they ANSWER questions""! <br/><br/>D9's black comedy is sustained by Wikus' racism (""No, don't shoot it NOW, it's illegal to do that""), and by the Mengele-like surgeon so interested in Wikus' ""strong pain reaction"" to being skewered with a ""DBX7"" during human/alien experiments! Observant viewers will note Blomkamp's unwillingness to ""fix"" this scene (for a conclusion that the patient's ""nerves have fused"", Wikus needed to skewer himself)--simply because then it wouldn't be funny. <br/><br/>Audience relatability to our hero ""prawn"" Christopher Johnson (rotomated replacement of actor Jason Cope)--note the moniker-similarity to Blackhawk Down(2001)'s ""skinnies""--was contingent on our empathy for the facial/physical features of Christopher's design; we're left to gather that such human names were assigned to 1.8million aliens by overtired Alien Affairs officers, just as in Alien Nation(1988). <br/><br/>The bipedal insect concept allows these aliens to be human-like even in size, but their facial expressions needed to be hauntingly mammalian, not arachnoid. That was delivered by movable facial scaling and the obviously MAMMALIAN over-sized eyes of.....chimpanzees, apparently. <br/><br/>And indeed, the most audience-grabbing achievement of D9 for me was its inclusion of ""photo-real"" aliens, bettering Avatar(2009) in 2D. (Cameron's WetaDigital artists either didn't start with situated-lighting cinematography, or relied on automated (less-accurate)animation for Avatar(2009)...!)<br/><br/>Thanks to Canadian SFX outfit Image Engine(""Stargate""(2005-2007)), D9's ~35m of alien visuals really outstrip audience expectations. Their CGI was perfected with 1) WetaWorkshop's clever alien-character design, 2) panoramic/multi-angle light-source cinematography, and 3) Image Engine's hand-rotomated animation based on 2). <br/><br/>The cat-food-as-catnip-to-aliens idea was ""homaged"" again from Alien Nation(1988), the main ""elephant-in-the-room"" inspiration for Alive(2005)/D9. The creators leave it unacknowledged so their originality isn't dismissed by careless comparisons to a beloved earlier franchise (the TV series ended with AN:Dark Horizon(1994)). <br/><br/>During the home stretch, the graphic war violence deliberately resembles Blackhawk Down(2001), adding similar ""yayli tanbur""(Turkish bowed lute) wailing music; the exo-suit's awesome anti-gravity weapon successfully distracts viewers from counting the ""Hail-Mary-passes""; and seeing the Nigerians get their comeuppance minus bullets was deliciously reminiscent of Rabbit Fire(1951):us.imdb.com/Find?select=Quotes&for=buwwets! <br/><br/>Sadly that entire section of the film feels truncated, due to plot-rushing. There's insufficient vision of the exo-suit, plus it's too easily--not to mention farcically--crippled by human bullets. It stumbles around wounded, anthropomorphically ""bleeding"" nanofluid and being altogether too derivative of Robocop(1987)'s Ed-209. <br/><br/>So D9 sometimes tries too hard to be ""Hollywood popcorn SF"", but it accommodates a rather surprising un-Hollywood ending. One last poignant ""documentary"" flourish of Wikus waxing lovingly about his wife proves painful when intercut with the last scene on the heels of the bookending interviews. Such a romantic close was a worthy end to this almost-plausible, rich, fast-paced story. <br/><br/>With its blatant pillorying of xenophobia coupled with Enemy Mine(1985)-type buddy action and even spousal romance, D9 is sure to prick naysayer consciences worldwide. It has entered the venerable SF pantheon of ""Stargate"", ""Star Trek"", ""Alien Nation""...Welcome, D9.(9/10)"
"MetalAngel","9","4","8","11 January 2010"," Reinstates my belief in science fictions films. It's a wonder!!!!
","I've never been much of a man for science-fiction movies. After the days of ""Star Wars"" and ""Back to the Future"", Hollywood went through a period of time where everything sci-fi that it spewed was absolute trash, but lately it's beginning to redeem itself with incredibly good films such as ""WALL-E"", ""Star Trek"" and the incomparable ""Avatar"". So when a friend recommended I watch a sci-fi film called ""District 9"" directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson, I did so with many expectations...and I must say the film delivers, enormously. I obtained a sense of utter satisfaction from watching it, and I declare it's one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's completely fictional, of course. In a near future, a gigantic alien spaceship has arrived to Earth and is now suspended in midair over the city of Johannesburg in South Africa. After 3 months of uncertainty, humans board the spaceship and find millions of aliens living therein, malnourished, sick and in need of assistance; so the humans decide to transport all of these aliens to a holding camp in Johannesburg where the aliens can regain their strength and repose. These Prawns (that's how humans decided to call them, because of their obvious resemblance to prawns) are generally peaceful and adapt quickly to the rule of men, and they quickly become a hot subject for 'alien rights' and countless discussions and organizations worldwide. But they begin taking over the holding camp, so humans must evacuate it and fence it, and this alien camp on Earth becomes known as District 9.<br/><br/>Now, District 9 is a serious problem because the Prawns have made their own small world inside it, they're reproducing at a fast rate and they're engaging in shady activities which cause great commotion to humans...so the MNU, the Office of Alien Affairs, decides to relocate the millions of Prawns to a larger camp outside of Johannesburg where they may not pose such a risk to humans, and they send their top employee Wikus Wan de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) with a team of soldiers to notify the Prawns of their eviction. Now, Wikus is a sweet, sympathetic, jolly man who takes this new job with happiness and excitement, but he's in no way prepared for what he encounters inside District 9...or how his entrance into the alien society will affect his life and that of his fellow humans.<br/><br/>Now, where should I start? The movie is filmed almost in documentary style, with a variety of scientists, sociologists and experts being interviewed; they open the film by explaining everything that happened when the alien spaceship appeared on Earth, and lots of news footage is shown. Wikus is also interviewed, alongside some of his family members, and we immediately begin to establish a personality to this jolly man, who adores his wife and who tries to do his job as well as he can. He has a fascination with the Prawns, and we see him fidgeting excitedly and grinning from ear to ear when he's given the mission at District 9. He's a character we immediately like and easily identify with, even if he DOES have some traits that disturb us...like his unnerving need to touch everything, to explore, to probe into things that are really not of his concern. We see him like a sociable person who greets everyone at the base, who messes with soldiers' weapons without knowing what they are and who, once inside the camp, explores the alien settlement with fascination, touching, touching, touching.<br/><br/>Before Wikus enters District 9, the interviewees on screen foreshadow an ominous event that 'happened' in District 9, and with which Wikus was heavily involved; that event is what the film is all about. The majority of scenes are taken by a hand-held camera, or from the buzzing helicopters, and it serves to involve us in the film's plot to a point where it feels like it's us walking beside Wikus, traversing the district. The editing is remarkable- scenes change, camera angles change perfectly, capturing that facial gesture, that body movement, lingering on that doubtful expression long enough to create tension and to move, fast-paced, onto the next scene. The score quite good, and since it's extremely subtle and muted, we're hardly aware it's there, and it builds up from sound to sound until we're so immersed in the action on screen we never really noticed when it got there to enhance the thrill and the suspense.<br/><br/>This seems at first like any underground film, with a complete cast and crew of 'unknowns', but we KNOW it's mainstream Hollywood because of the impressive special effects and the magnificent production, manned by producer Peter Jackson. Just recalling his name reminds us of the astounding visual quality of his films, ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""King Kong"", so there's really no need for me to try and explain the visual effects- they're amazing.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is heavenly perfection. Thankfully, it also has a story, and a very good one at that. Now, the truly remarkable thing about the story is that it manages to involve us and it makes us actually CARE about the characters on screen, alien and human, even through some absurdly quirky characteristics of the plot. For example, the aliens who look like Prawns- they look cute and weird at the same time. Or the fact they could basically kill for cat food, which is practically their drug. A scene where tension is released and a possible street brawl featuring heavy gunfire is stopped with the help of some cans of cat food would seem laughable and silly in the hands of another director, but Neill Blomkamp has written and directed a story which, even through its implausibility, commands our attention and weaves a tapestry of action and suspense.<br/><br/>The downfall of the film? I can't think of any.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!!"

"Ayreesfoxx","Null","4","8","23 December 2009"," District 9: A Walk in Someone Else's Shoes
","There is one singular event that makes watching the same movie from the release in the theater and then again at the DVD release enjoyable, and that's simply still enjoying it. District 9 is one of those movies that will be talked about for years based on the technical merit, it's writing, and it political undertone of what really happened in Johannesburg. Writer and Director Neill Blomkamp did a superb job of blending his real-life events with realistic and fanciful science fiction to bring a story that will both bring into the light of what humans are capable of, and how we are capable of doing it.<br/><br/>The story itself is fairly straight forward, even with its small subplots that are meshed in seamlessly. Especially when you include that the movie is portrayed in a ""fly-on-the-wall,"" cinema-verite style, while pushing documentary and hand-held, and general third-person, it gives the whole plot and main character an intense feeling of being a fish in a fishbowl: They have nowhere to run and are insubstantial to stop the rising tide that is about to come at them. Winkus, the protagonist of the story (Sharlto Copley) is working for an international company MNU, which bears a striking resemblance to NATO to help relocate an alien race known to humans as Prawns. <br/><br/>The Prawns have been stuck in Johannesburg for twenty years for reasons unknown, and in that time have lost their ability to get home. While they have been stranded on Earth, MNU has set up camps for them to live in which has become a cesspool for drugs, prostitution and violence. With humans getting fed up with Prawn occupancy in Johannesburg, MNU begins to move them out to another location outside the city limits. As a result, Winuks becomes contaminated an alien device, which causes him to turn into a Prawn as the movie progresses. <br/><br/>Now, as far as the rest of the plot goes, it flows well and seamlessly for the most part. I will say that for sections of where they take emphasis on the worse of Winkus' transformations, Blomkamp would break up the intensity with a sappy conversation to Winkus' wife, delaying the story with a feeble attempt to add another layer of sympathy for the man. Although it is nice to see he has some other goal to work for rather than just himself, truthfully it seems thrown in, especially once you notice how quickly his wife changes his mind.<br/><br/>Other than the slight plot hiccups, the rest of the movie works with surgeon-like precision. The greatest achievement in this movie was how the Prawns (who were all computer engineered) were able to interact and seemed to fit perfectly into the surroundings. The quality of the aliens blending so well into the foreground and background was ideal, and something that up till now, hasn't really been pulled off as perfectly. While it would have been nice to see during aerial shots of D- 9, to see more of the supposed two million Prawns, instead of shanty houses and burning rubbish.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the picture was justly topnotch. To interact and work with each of the imaginary Prawns, each actor did a remarkable job of making one believe it was there. Copley himself did a fantastic job, having to essentially spend the majority of his time with a Prawn and interacting with him like it was an everyday occurrence. In fact, Copley and the majority of the cast did a splendid job of playing into their roles, be it the interviewees for the supposed documentary of what really happened, the typecast role of military officer, or Copley who make you feel like he was Jeff Goldbloom reincarnate in The Fly.<br/><br/>Yet still the most stunning is how powerful the movie really is without people really comprehending. Blomkamp first got the inspiration for this movie with his original short Alive in Joburg. While that was more of a political piece as it was a short on how the government was handling the apartheid and the blatant racism for the people living in District 6 (otherwise known as Cape Town). This movie helped bring the issue to a broader light, along with expanding the issues of racism, which has plagued South America for years. Thankfully, Blomkamp also does the appropriate thing of keeping it low-key, letting the audience either realize his creative intent, or respectfully ignore it.<br/><br/>Even with its slight bumps, they are not enough to knock the coffee out of the holder. District 9 is not a movie you will watch every day, but it will be one that you can put in and appreciate for what it brings to the table, the story it tells, and the creative and imaginative intelligence behind it's creator."
"paudie","8","4","8","17 November 2009"," Alien movie that thinks outside the box
","Director/writer Neil Blomkamp and Producer Peter Jackson have come up with an interesting addition to the ""Alien v human"" genre. Helpless aliens were found on a ship hovering over Johannesburg. They weren't hostile and were housed in a ghetto (District 9) for twenty years. However their numbers have now increased and relations with humans have got worse. It has been decided to move them to a purpose built ghetto, further away form the city. A multi national corporation that just happens to make weapons has been hired to ensure the move goes off smoothly. We meet the not very pleasant Wikus Van De Merwe, whose job it is to get the aliens to sign the move agreement by hook or by crook. During this chaotic process Pontus accidentally comes into contact with alien DNA. Soon he starts to notice physical changes to his body. His employers notice this too. They have been trying for years to make the powerful alien weaponry work. However it only operates when in contact with alien DNA. Having established that their employees DNA is changing to part alien this is an opportunity too good to miss. The brutal initial tests are successful and they decide to ""harvest"" Van De Merwe's DNA before he dies. However he escapes and goes on the run. His metamorphosis continues and he heads to District 9 where he hopes he will be harder to find. Here he meets up with an alien and his son who he ""met"" during the moving process. It turns this alien has moving plans of his own but needs Van De Merwe's help. The movie has a lot of breathless chase sequences but is also quite moving in parts as we have sympathy with the alien and his son and with Van De Merwe and his wife and their lives fall apart. The film threatened to lose momentum half way through but recovered well for an excellent closing sequence. The special effects are very good. The human/alien interaction is excellent and Van De Merwe's gradual gruesome transformation in suitably unsettling. The plot is a tad far fetched at times but this is only to be expected in a film of this kind. The fast pace of the film doesn't lend itself to great displays of acting but Sharlto Copley as Van De Merwe is very good in the main role as the man whose life and body are falling apart. This is South Africa's most successful film ever and deserves all the acclaim it has received."

","I don't understand why so many have rated this film a 10 out of 10. I love good sci-fi, I think Jackson is a genius, but this is certainly not his best work. This film barely deserves a 7.<br/><br/>There are many problems with this film but I don't wish to reveal any spoilers, so I will attempt to limit my words to non-specific elements.<br/><br/>Clearly an allegory for apartheid/racism, this movie is so obvious with both location and the many absurd situations, it was almost shouting to the audience that they were too stupid to 'get it' and needed to be told or shown over and over throughout this film. But then, beyond belief, the very people for whom this allegory represent, are made to look repugnant or savage and unworthy of our sympathy. <br/><br/>In terms of overall character development, it was poorly done. The lead character has no redeeming qualities, there are the stereotypical Rambo types, betrayals, and just a glimmer of real emotion in two of the many aliens. <br/><br/>I also had a big problem with some very unrealistic depictions of these aliens and giving them too many negative human character traits to the point of absurdity. <br/><br/>The acting was superb but unfortunately the story was illogical, incomplete, lazy plot devices, and too many plot holes. <br/><br/>Questions or comments: 1. Why were there alien components scattered throughout the garbage? Why wouldn't the humans have collected their components first?; 2. Clearly, the aliens are more intelligent than humans. Yet they allowed the humans to take their weapons and subjugate them?; 3. The aliens preferred food sources are so ridiculous, it's comical. 4. The aliens reminded me too much of a certain video game character (this was unfortunately and apparently intentional). <br/><br/>I am pretty sure Peter Jackson has also shot and will soon release District 10. I'm waiting Mr. Jackson."
"fantasyescapist","Null","4","8","7 September 2009"," Humanity's intolerance emerges after the arrival of an alien spaceship
","Just saw this in a two-thirds full screening, and while it was very enjoyable I don't think it's quite the masterpiece some are saying it is(as it's not as impeccable as it could be on all levels) and here's my reasons why:<br/><br/>Acting: Copley is very believable as a oblivious worker then desperate, reluctant anti-hero later on. His raw emotions were really well done, though his accent, especially when swearing might leave some people in fits of giggles, as it does sound somewhat Scottish and a few other British accents. It's a perfectly authentic South African accent, though. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Haywood, who plays his wife, is unconvincing. Her emotional scenes merely look contrived, as if she's very much out of her depth and can't deliver the feelings required.<br/><br/>Plot: Because this moves at such a breakneck place, I'm sure keen-eyed viewers will spot plot holes aplenty. It's too rushed in places, and I actually got slight headache from the shaky cam in the doc segments and the speed of some shots. Slowing down to appreciate in the non-doc segments where appropriate would've helped maybe. Most of the fast pacing did give it a sense of heightened urgency, though.<br/><br/>The doc segments feel jarring as well, in their transition. Maybe book ending the film with them would've worked better. This structure could be hit or miss with audiences.<br/><br/>There's your clichéd MNU soldiers (especially a particularly wicked, merciless one) and a Nigerian criminal overlord, obsessed with voodoo. They're archetypes. Stock villains. Stereotypical antagonists that feel too banal and one-note for a film that aims for realism.<br/><br/>The main character could split opinions as some may route for him after his personality transforms, and others not. He's morally grey and not as clear cut as we initially think.<br/><br/>Conversely, it's good points are how emotive these aliens seem yet they're completely not from this world. The main one, Christopher especially is the 'prawn' I completely emotionally invested in.<br/><br/>The aliens have a strong sense of realism about them and humanity so that side of the plot, the political and social commentary side of it works quite well.<br/><br/>I liked how visceral, tense and explosive the action scenes were and how engrossing Wikus' tale is.<br/><br/>SFX and Cinematography: For a low budget film, the effects are great. The CGI looks solid and has a physicality about it, especially up close. Does what effects are expected to do.<br/><br/>I noticed just how much depth of feelings the eyes of the aliens conveyed, especially Christopher. Heartbreaking at times, just how sad and how deep in despair this creature was.<br/><br/>The grimy South African look effectively grounds the sci-fi elements in reality in a stylistic way.<br/><br/>Score: Dramatic and touching when it needed to be. Really good, but shame it's not available to buy as of the time of writing this review.<br/><br/>Overall: A solid attempt at something fresh, from a different angle in a genre that has become over-familiar. Flawed, yes, but it's exciting, compelling and has parallels in today's world. Interesting if not great on all levels but a very good film indeed. A definite must-see at the cinema."
"overcranked","7","4","8","5 September 2009"," One of the better Sci-Fi Movies lately
","District 9 is the story of what happens when aliens come to South Africa and become refugees. The story picks up 20 years after the aliens have arrived on Earth and the movie can be divided into two sections. The first section is shot like a documentary, which is where we are given all the background information we need to understand the story. The second half of the movie is more like your typical Action Sci-Fi movie with documentary scenes laced into the action.<br/><br/>Over all the film aspires to do two things. One is to comment on how man kind is capable of severely inhumane treatment of others. The aliens are used in the film to reflect the way that Apartheid effected South Africa, and on a larger scale how segregation and ignorance is practiced by man on a wide scale. The other thing that appears to be what they wanted to do was to show off their skills with special effects. This film has some of the best CGI I've seen in years! It is seamless how it blends images created on a computer and real life. This brings me to my first of three problems with the movie. There was more gore in this movie than in most Sci-Fi movies. Now, I'm not squeamish about gore one bit, but there was no reason for it in the movie. The only purpose it served was to show off their skills with CGI. My second problem with the movie was that while he kind of is a bumbling corporate drone, Wikus is not a character you care about. He's constantly abusive to the aliens in the film, and never is motivated by anything but his own selfishness until the very end of the movie. Now, I didn't hate Wikus, but I didn't really feel a deep connection to the character or his plight. The third problem was that the movie never fulfills it's goal from the beginning of the movie to talk about social issues like Apartheid, and instead switches tracks into an Action movie.<br/><br/>In the end District 9 is entertaining and probably one of the better Sci-Fi films to come out recently. However, there are a few problems within the film that weaken its overall impact. The idea of the film and the way it was made is excellently done, but that fails to push the movie over the edge. It's absolutely one of the better films to come out this summer, and worth a look, but be prepared because it's not what you would expect. After all, there are a lot of secrets in District 9.<br/><br/>Review Written by Josh for http://www.overcranked.net Visit us for more movie and video game reviews!"
"TheHandThatBleeds","1","4","8","3 September 2009"," Average summer sci-fi action movie.
","I wanted to like this movie a lot. So I relaxed and paid close attention. As the story went further, I realized that I didn't care much for what was happening. I did want to see the end, and it was easy to get there because the film is a pleasant watch.<br/><br/>Part of the reason the film gets you to stay with it the whole way through has to be that there is seemingly a lot of mystery about it all. But when it was all over all I was left with was questions--and not in the good 'life changing' way. I was never immersed into the movie and never given a real reason to care about what was going on. I have to say that the story ended up being rather like Swiss cheese.<br/><br/>District 9 ends up being a giant hole that you could walk through to the other side. Then at the other side is an empty room. You yell 'Hey, where's the story?!' No one answers. 20-minute action sequence, roll credits. Masterpiece?"
"beaconb","9","4","8","3 September 2009"," A great all-around movie
","I read the mixed reviews, although mostly very positive, and wasn't sure what to expect. Perhaps it was because I didn't have any expectations that I really liked this movie. Having no actors that I've ever seen was also a definite plus, because I didn't know what might happen to them, or when. The acting was excellent and the overall look of the movie was fantastic! The combination of pseudo-documentary, and conventional film, was very effective. I expect that this movie will be a top-ten at the box office for many, many weeks, since word-of-mouth is probably what brings people to see it. It's so nice to know that people are still willing to make an original movie, as opposed to an 8th sequel, or even worse, a third re-make."

","Being a South African, one notices certain parallels between the movie and the history of our country. Locally produced and inspired movies are usually disappointing and slightly embarrassing but for once I was pleasantly surprised. If you ever wanted a taste of South Africa and its culture this is a movie you certainly shouldn't miss. Although the lead actor's performance was pretty top notch as far as SA actors go, I would however like to point out that most South Africans do not speak in such hick-tongue (and that's about all I'd change). Otherwise, the special effects were impressive (considering the budget) and the story even more so. I would definitely not miss this one guys. It was ""fokken"" good."
"Quebec_Dragon","8","4","8","30 August 2009"," Refreshing take on human-alien cohabitation
","How refreshing. A smart original sci-fi movie that's not a remake, a sequel or based on anything already existing such as a toy-line. Even better, not only is it suspenseful and unpredictable, it makes you think and serves its fair share of social commentary without hitting you over the head with it. In short, the aliens are here, arrived 20 years ago, but they're not like anything we expected (more like animalistic shrimp-insectoid hybrids) and they're living in a slum in South Africa the nice humans built for them because the aliens couldn't survive on the big giant spaceship that brought them here, nor could they leave Earth. The story is at first told in a faux documentary fashion before becoming more traditional later on yet always quite dynamic. It's amazing to me that this was made by a first-time movie director considering the talent shown.<br/><br/>The human cast is unknown, at least in America, so it helps suspension of disbelief and they're good but nowhere near the highlight of the guy playing Wikus (somewhat resembling Christian Bale), the functionary put in charge of relocating the aliens far away from the city. I particularly liked the character development of Wikus and how our perceptions of the aliens change as we go along. I also liked the twists and turns foisted upon us. However, I did not like a particularly stupid decision made by Wikus, under emotional duress to be fair, that at the time seemed only there to create conflict and delay the end of the movie. I think the story is partly so good because in similar circumstances, the reactions of the involved parties could be very much like this.<br/><br/>The aliens were extremely well done in terms of looks and movements. It's a thought-provoking movie but it has lots of thrilling action especially in the last part. There are also some gory moments but they're over quickly. The location of the story, South Africa, is brilliant because of all the associations with Appartheid, disinformation and racism. I would say that right now District 9 is overrated on Internet Movie Database but I think it's because people were anxiously waiting for a great original sci-fi movie with some substance. It's certainly not in the top 50 movies of all time but it's probably the best sci-fi movie I've seen in 2009. With a much lower budget, it beats most American blockbusters in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"
"ennieday09","9","4","8","27 August 2009"," An inventive and creative sci-fi story that redefines the genre
","I cannot remember another science fiction movie in a long time that made me leave the theater wanting more. District 9 takes the cliché concept of aliens on earth to something completely new that we have never seen before. The movie starts off kind of slow to let the audience take in the story of the aliens landing on earth, but after the story is explained, an epic adventure about the race of both humans and PRAWNS begins.<br/><br/>In most movies about aliens, the plot consists of evil aliens landing on earth and then having a wild cat and mouse chase of aliens versus humans...NOT the case in this movie. For the first time Neil Blomkamp and Peter Jackson twist it around and make you feel what it is like to be on the alien side of the story and the emotions and struggles they have trying to cope with the human race on our planet. Almost every scene in which a human is abusing one of the PRAWNS, your heart sinks slightly and you cant help but feel sorry for them. The makers of this movie leave you with emotions of anticipation, depression and anxiety through each scene as it develops.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley, (unknown to me before this movie) plays his role perfectly as a once enemy to the alien race to a half turned ally towards them. His struggles through his transformation and escape is equally heart-felt as is the back-story to the prawns. The special effects and scenery were as good as any other science fiction movie i've seen in quite some time. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a different and innovative movie about aliens and something you haven't seen before, i suggest you check this movie out right away. It is one of the best reviewed movies this year by far and i can see why. Do not miss your chance to see this classic"

Not that that's a bad thing, I just wanted more than an average movie. I was becoming bored, and wanted more!!<br/><br/>Some of the special effects looked fake to me, though most were awesome.

","District 9 succeeds because it takes you through the full range of human emotion: rage, disgust, fear, friendship and unity. And believe me, you WILL feel them because this film is THAT good.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the stronger themes is selfishness: Wikus makes some stupid decisions which cost him time...something he manifestly lacks. These actions hurt himself and those around him, causing the viewer to wonder if this story is REALLY going to unravel.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the special effects I think the film stands alone as a commentary on division, hate, and oppression. And more disturbingly a real expose on the darkness of the human heart. It's shocking because we treat each other this way now.<br/><br/>There is a real moment in this film when Wikus has to abandon his fear and loathing and do what is right--even if it costs him everything. The choice that seems impossible is the one he must take, and thankfully does.<br/><br/>District 9 is a real thought-provoker and probably needs to be seen more than once.<br/><br/>Congratulations to all involved and I look forward to more films of this calibre!"
"kunalkhandwala","9","4","8","22 August 2009"," Jackson and Blomkamp invent a rich and engaging action drama
","With the teaser at Comic-Con '09, inventive ad campaigns on bus stops, billboards, train stations, public restrooms and some effective viral marketing, District 9 had already created quite a stir among the underground world of sci-fi geeks who waited with sheer excitement for the Ring Master (Peter Jackson)'s latest wizardry. Jackson entrusted Neill Blomkamp with District 9 after the duo first attempted a movie version of of the popular video game 'Halo' (which did not see the light of day) and being inspired by Blomkamp's own short film, 'Alive in Joburg' (2005). Thus, Blomkamp's big directorial debut is not only a manifestation of his affinity for science fiction and his South African background in the wake of apartheid, but is an exemplary sci-fi action-drama that ruthlessly supersedes its hype. <br/><br/>An alien ship arrived over Johannesberg 20 years ago and the entire population of the ugly tentacled shrimp like creatures, whom the humans nicknamed 'prawns', were moved into District 9 which grew into a massive, uncontrollable ghetto area of the city that humans could not control anymore. The discontent among the citizens of Jo'berg is expressed through the eyes of news cameras that interview people who demand segregation and alienation of the prawns outside city limits. When black people say this in South Africa, the images turn potent. Those who are interviewed in the beginning are talking about Wikus, an employee of MNU (Multi-national United), with an assumption out there that something went wrong with him and the alien camp. The mystery surrounding these interviews haunts one throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Wikus is assigned the task of resettlement of the prawns to another camp outside the city. Sharlto Copley plays this role remarkably well for a novice especially since his character sees high voltage emotions that are only compounded by his physical and mental change. Something goes wrong while he is serving evacuation notices and this leads to a dramatic turn of events that involve a revolutionary gang of Nigerian thugs, an opportunity for a prawn to re-power the mother ship, a chance for MNU to finally enable the usage of the alien weaponary they've acquired and Wikus' very existence as himself. <br/><br/>Blomkamp's story telling has a lot of thrills and twists to keep one engaged but at the same time, he gives the thoughtful mind some delectable bits to chew on while he stirs the emotions to make one realize that humans are indeed a flawed species. District 9 has all the ingredients for a summer thriller – grotesque aliens, a robot suit that turns Wikus into Iron Man, space ships, 'Halo' type explosive battle sequences, gory scenes of exploding bodies and at the same time, a hard- hitting docu-drama about the prejudice, hypocrisy and savagery inflicted by humans on the otherwise helpless and sympathetic aliens. Blomkamp makes you care about Wikus as he is alienated from his own people. He makes you care about Christopher, the prawn who found the means to re-power the mother ship and his little whiz-kid who is ever so curious about going back home awww!...<br/><br/>On the other hand, Blomkamp throws the reality in your face. Aliens are not the invading type that we have seen so far and they do not appear in the darkness with muted special effects. The prawns in District 9 are out in the sun, with CGI so sophisticated that it's hard to believe that Weta did not have any alien suits. Hand-held cinematography is used only when needed for a natural effect (way better than Cloverfield) but the real action is left explicitly adorned for all to enjoy. He even throws our cruel intentions, selfishness, hypocrisy, innate villainy and physical limitations at our face for us to rather take the side of the aliens. How would you not feel excited when the savage aliens rip apart the leader of the MNU Mercenaries??!<br/><br/>District 9 does what true science fiction does—it makes you think about the world you live in. The world where man's path of righteousness is in direct conflict with his opposing actions. There are numerous instances of real-life parallels in the movie as depicted in the savage and gangster life in the slum, prejudice against certain sects and money-minded corporations that turn against their own. Although, the film gives a bleak view of our world, it proves the undying fact that humans can truly become who they are upon complete alienation.<br/><br/><ul><li>9.22 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"paul-2686","9","4","8","21 August 2009"," Does District 9 deserve the hype? 9 responses to 9 criticisms of District 9
","I heard a few anti-hype warnings that District 9 was ""not all that great,"" but after seeing it I think that the hype about this film is deserved. I read every negative comment posted on IMDb about the film (as of Aug 22), and did not agree with many of them.  Most gave no reason for disliking the film and focused instead of creative ways of saying how much they hated it. Here are my responses to nine specific criticisms I did find, some of which were repeated many times (especially #s 1, 2, and 3):<br/><br/>CRITICISM #1: Too long!<br/><br/>RESPONSE: It's true, some scenes could have been cut, and I don't think this criticism is incorrect.  But I was never bored. Something is almost always moving District 9's plot forward. It compares favourably to many other films in this regard.  It doesn't have interminable exposition like the Matrix sequels, or interminable space shots like 2001, or interminable hobbit-gazing like Return of the King. There is a long action sequence that starts to eat away at the film's intelligence, but I also think it's a minor concern.<br/><br/>CRITICISM #2: Too much gore!<br/><br/>RESPONSE: I thought the gore was an appropriate extension of a more integral element of the story: the grossness of the slum.  Everything in this film is dirty and disgusting, and for good reason!<br/><br/>CRITICISM #3: Too much swearing!<br/><br/>RESPONSE: Yes, Wickus definitely did swear a lot, but objecting to it is prudish and naive.   As any soldier or veteran knows, the F-word is used like punctuation in violent situations.<br/><br/>CRITICISM #4: The film hits you over the head a bit with simplistic moralizing. The apartheid analogy is too blatant. At a couple points, one of the interviewed experts tells us exactly how we're supposed to be interpreting the action, and it's heavy-handed.<br/><br/>RESPONSE: I agree that there are couple moments of expositional bludgeoning, but I can only think of a couple.  The rest of the film is pure allegory, and I see no reason why it needs to be subtle. Just because the analogy to apartheid is clear doesn't make it illegitimate. Lots of great films about racism have been blatant with their moral message! District 9 is no more morally simplistic than any other cautionary tale about racism.  Blomkamp tells the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story of apartheid in an original way — not simplistic at all.<br/><br/>CRITICISM #5: Too many implausible that's-so-fake moments, especially the amazing command that racist humans seem to have of the prawns' clicky, glottal-stoppy alien language. No universal translators here, and yet they have no trouble talking to each other at all!<br/><br/>RESPONSE: The language barrier is a nearly impossible SF problem to solve.  Realistically depicting a language barrier with aliens is so tedious that it will destroy any story. Blomkamp chose his compromise, and it's no worse than a lot of others, and maybe better: the aliens have been there for 20 years, after all. Maybe some communication is plausible.  While a racist is not normally interested in learning the language of an oppressed minority group, these are alien visitors: the human interest in learning would have been high, even for racists.<br/><br/>CRITICISM #6: It makes no sense that the prawns fail to use their superior physical strength and powerful weapons to overthrow their oppressors.<br/><br/>RESPONSE: Of course it makes sense!  Again, it is the critics who are being simplistic and naive, not the film. It's a matter of clear historical record that poverty and hunger can pacify almost any population, preventing organized resistance, and that oppressed minorities are surprisingly passive and underestimate their own strength.  Not only is it realistic, it's actually one of the major moral points of the film — a point overlooked by the same people protesting that the film is too ""morally simplistic"" for them.  Furthermore, the story makes it clear up front that most of them are ""workers"" who aren't too bright and take no initiative.  Thus it is to be expected that prawn violence is erratic and impulsive and not an effective resistance.<br/><br/>CRITICISM #7: The cat food thing ""trivializes"" the prawns and the moral message.<br/><br/>RESPONSE: Get over yourself!  It was a bit of comic relief.  Who knows what aliens will want to eat?<br/><br/>CRITICISM #8: There are several SF clichés in the film.<br/><br/>RESPONSE: Yes, there are, but the measure of an SF film is not whether or not it has clichés but how many and how much it depends on them: District 9 only has a few. Yes, a big hovering mothership has been done in many (many, many) other first-contact movies.  And you can hardly go to an SF film anymore without seeing the ol' infected-with-alien- DNA thing.  However, after decades of highly productive SF storytelling — 700+ films since 1970! — anyone who thinks that SF is only good if it's completely original is pretty much doomed to be disappointed.  There's just no such critter any more.  The problem with most bad SF films is that they are mostly or entirely driven by their clichés. District 9 contains a few, but it is not limited to them, and a great deal of originality mitigates their impact.<br/><br/>CRITICISM #9: I hate hand-held camera work!  It makes me dizzy and sick!  Why do directors do that?<br/><br/>RESPONSE: Because it's effective and interesting and it doesn't bother most people. If you're one of the unlucky ones, just don't watch it on the small screen, and don't blame the film!<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: District 9 offers a much that we bemoan the lack of in science fiction: an original setting, an original premise, intricately conceived aliens, no-name actors, quality FX that are there to serve the story, lots of uncomfortably gritty realism, and action that makes sense for the situation. District 9 is undoubtedly the best SF film in several years, and one of the most unusual and interesting ever made."
"theandrewneel","8","4","8","21 August 2009"," Nine reasons to watch ""District 9""
","Peter Jackson and aliens did not make the list, but here are nine other reasons to go see the Jackson-produced movie ""District 9."" 1. Action. Lots of it. ""District 9"" hosts massive and impressive firefights on several occasions, and watching the gunplay alone might be enough of a draw for some testosterone-driven viewers.<br/><br/>2. It is faux-documentary film-making at its finest. Director and writer Neill Blomkamp has created a story that, at moments, reeks of realism. The ""news"" footage and interviews give parts of the movie a sense of grounding in the actual world that is sometimes hard to shake.<br/><br/>3. It is an original story with a unique personality. Kudos to Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell for their fascinating and quirky screenplay about the results of an alien ship settling above Johannesburg, South Africa.<br/><br/>4. Sharlto Copley might become your favorite new actor. With the awkward charm of Michael Scott and the determination of Rambo, Copley's character Wikus Van De Merwe takes viewers with him through the danger and emotion of ""District 9"" with refreshing poignancy.<br/><br/>5. Everyone else is talking about it. You should be too. ""District 9"" grossed almost $40 million at the box office its opening weekend, and the film has already jumped to the upper echelons of the IMDb Top 250 at #31 (while the film's ranking will most certainly drop after it's initial fan boost, it could easily stay on the list for some time).<br/><br/>6. The movie actually has something to say, a surprising accomplishment for an action-oriented movie in the Michael Bay era. Combine an ethical dilemma about the inhumane treatment of non-humans with the moral principle of walking a mile in someone else's shoes and you have the thought-provoking idea ""District 9"" presents.<br/><br/>7. Excellent visual effects. Blomkamp didn't have the advantage M. Night Shyamalan had in ""Signs"" of only showing his aliens for a few scenes, so the aliens in ""District 9"" had to be able to be on screen for the majority of the film without being a distraction. He and his design team succeeded, as the ""District 9"" aliens are unique but familiar enough to evoke empathy from the audience.<br/><br/>8. Creative (and cool) alien technology. The alien weapons play a large part in the film, and a robotic alien suit (ala ""Bioshock"") gives a fresh feel to familiar action sequences.<br/><br/>9. It is a fascinating movie which has achieved the rare feat of being as thrilling and interesting as its marketing campaign. The widely distributed alien-clad posters promoting the film suggest ""District 9"" is unfamiliar territory. The work of Blomkamp and his crew ensure it's like nothing else you've ever seen."
"matthew-realff","9","4","8","19 August 2009"," Very Effective - movie of ideas, don't be put off by violence and swearing
","I have to admit to significant trepidation about seeing this movie with my 14 year old son. The swearing is ubiquitous and the violence at times is very off-putting. However, this is a movie that rewards the risk. The ideas are compelling - how should we view an alien race that appears to have overwhelming technology but not the will to use it? When faced with a decision as a half-human half-alien which component of your make-up should we ascribe the decision to? Should we assume that the altruism that is displayed is because you are human, prawn, or that this might be a universal characteristic of life? This is a profound movie and the sound and fury do signify something."
"morty343","7","4","8","19 August 2009"," Good grief, calm down, some of you
","While this was a great _action/suspense_ movie placed in a sci-fi setting, this film hardly qualifies as excellent sci-fi. My guess is that most persons offering hyper-enthusiastic comments here are not consumers of sci-fi literature. A well-crafted sci-fi storyline should offer ""swallowable"" explanations for pivotal events, rather than treat the liberties offered by speculative fiction as an excuse to broad-brush science. An example of a major sci-fi snag in this story is asking the viewer to simply accept that an alien starship ""fuel"", when accidentally spilled on a human, causes that human to slowly and inexorably morph into an alien. Hunh?!? Absolutely NO mechanism for this key storyline event is offered. How could the writer conflate such an extremely complicated biological phenomena with a substance simply required to power an alien landing vehicle? Yet, there it is. As a sci-fi fan, I was bothered. I have a hard time believing a less distracting plot mechanism wasn't available to the writer. And, in general, I'm fair: as a sci-fi fan, I'm willing to accept an alien anti-grav device could hold a gigantic derelict mother craft in place for 20 years. I'll accept the possibility of 1+ million alien refugees being kept in internment on earth, without issues of contamination of alien microbes etc. I'll even accept that they really like cat food (although this notion is also filled with plot holes). But aside from some ""Star Trek: Next Generation""-ish social commentary, and the well-presented/acted alien slum segments, I viewed the majority of this movie as not much more than a vehicle to deliver the Ooo-wow weaponry scenes like those from the last 15-20 minutes of the film. However, because I enjoyed these immensely (even the uneconomical head-exploding device used on the black-market king), and the excellent GCI renderings of the aliens (as well as their alien ""language"") I gave the movie a 7 of 10."

Under the graces of the Multi-National United, a private company, humanity running out of patience waiting for an attack boards the ship to find cowering aliens, the survivors of a dying world. These creatures are set up in a temporary home, a ghetto-like slum called District 9. It doesn't take long for the creatures, now called 'prawns', to become uncontrollable scavengers and wearing out their welcome. MNU puts a nimrod desk jockey Wikus van der Merwe(Sharlto Copley) in charge of a mass eviction project moving the contemptible 1.8 million aliens to yet another concentration camp further from the city. This begins a horrifying train of events pitting the 'prawns' against MNU forces. In the fray, Wikus becomes contaminated... possibly becoming the key to discovering the secrets of the alien's biotechnology.<br/><br/>Engrossing special effects. Violence is harsh and splattering.

","DISTRICT 9 (2009) ***1/2 Fantastic sci-fi parable/mash-up of apartheid/""Alien Nation"" meets ""ID4"" by way of ""Enemy Mine"" could easily have been the pitch for this shrewd morality tale cloaked in genre trappings: 20 years ago a tremendous mothership hovers over the area of South Johannesburg, South Africa, and its insectoid-like alien 'prawns' are discovered and eventually acclimated into a shantytown cum slum which leads to social unrest with the human populace demanding the unwelcome visitors to be re-located to the titular area run by a conglomerate that has other ideas in store – particularly for its unwitting, hapless drone (newcomer Sharlto Copley straddling the line of comedic sap and affable anti-hero), who finds himself a doomed pawn in their game plan. Executive produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by talented newcomer Neill Blomkamp (who co-scripted the tense, taut screenplay with Terri Tatchell), the seamless CGI of the aliens is truly remarkable and the uncanny parallels of recent history underscores the plight of the creatures at hand."
"FatMan-QaTFM","6","4","8","17 August 2009"," Great idea, poor script.
","Summer of ought nine has really disappointed for sci-fi/fantasy movie fans. Harry Potter was long and boring, GI Joe made children cry, but there was hope with the very cool looking District 9. I skipped into the theater and plopped down with my Diet Coke and Taco Bell to enjoy what would certainly be the best movie of the summer. Looking at the movie ratings here you'd think it was, but never underestimate the power of fans who thought they went to see Halo. <br/><br/>Like I said, the film had a great idea. I'm sure the short film was a great preview for the feature, but somewhere in fleshing out the script Neill Blomkamp went horribly wrong. Maybe it's the obsession with trying to be a writer/director that kept him from checking with other writers to see if there were any, I don't know, massive plot holes or something, but it was so ponderous and scattered near the end, I didn't know what I was watching. <br/><br/>The idea: aliens are stranded because they are too dumb to get their ship working again. The plot: guy accidentally starts transforming into an alien, find that two of them happen to know what's going on, but have been sucking goo out of motherboards for 20 years to get enough fuel to get back onto their ship. One gets killed, guy helps for selfish reasons and suddenly becomes compassionate. At least give the guy a son so he can suddenly realize he would do the same for his son...<br/><br/>I could write a companion guide on the plot problems, but here are a few of my favorite: -They can drive out of a building in an armored car, but nobody seems to notice except for that one guard who shot at them (and apparently dropped the ball on telling anybody later). -1 million aliens can be kept at bay with a chain link fence. -(stolen from sikboy21) Should you be infected and slowly changing into a alien creature rest assured that despite never encountering your species before the aliens know how to reverse the process.<br/><br/>Two other trends in film-making were present here as well: 1) Humans are evil. And I mean all of them. There's been anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-whoever, but the anti-the Earth movies have been on the rise. What gives? 2) Shaky cam! I'm tired of it, and it doesn't make sense. When it's documentary style, that's fine. Once you're watching a 3rd person narrative, it needs to stop. My fiancée almost puked because of all the motion."

","This is a movie that deserves to be watched on the big screen, the bigger the screen and the louder the sound the better your experience! Very realistic and a much more plausible story than most other science fiction films that I have seen. From frame one onwards you are transported to a 2010 South Africa where aliens and humans co-exist, and trust me, you will believe every bit of action that is taking place in it as much as you will believe that MNU exists! The perfect cast in such a film is where you know none of the cast. And it worked out perfectly - I can't attest to a much more realistic science fiction than this one!

","Amen, this is NOT just another alien movie! Thank god. It absolutely blew me away! The one thing I think that made this movie such a success is the fact that it was filmed (for a good chunk of it) from a documentary point of view. That is what brought this film down to Earth, believable, suspenseful, intriguing, and most importantly current. The fact that the cast was unknown, to me at least, was a help. I certainly could not have had the same effect if any non-South African Hollywood superstar played the role.<br/><br/>The perfectly chosen location of Johannesburg, South Africa allowed the film to play homage to Earth's past conflicts, from your well known African civil wars and arms dealers, to forced relocation of a society and segregation of African-Americans (to name a few). Essentially, these creatures behaved as we would have under similar circumstances, except with this story our roles are reversed - we are the aggressors."

","But I pretty much loved it. It helps if you've caught some South African sci-fi previous, though it isn't absolutely necessary. I was impressed with 2 things in particular: That the aliens were as believable as they were and that the movie celebrates ordinary, stupid humans. On the negative side there's an awful lot of sordid filth (not sex, more like garbage) in this film. After a while you get used to it. And, incredibly, you get to feel for the aliens! Now THAT'S a trick! There's suspense and a love story and action. And the quality of the CGI is wonderful. Some of the machines are near perfect. But this isn't going to be everyone's idea of a great time at the movies. But if your people aren't either squeamish or closed minded, this is one of the best new takes on the whole alien thing you're going to find anywhere."
"ladyophelia101-1","9","4","8","15 August 2009"," After a string of mostly lackluster blockbuster movies consisting of sequels, prequels, and, oh yes, reboots, this movie was very refreshing.
","For those unfamiliar with the story and under the assumption that it 's a simple retelling of apartheid except with aliens, this is really only the beginning of the story. As for those comparisons to Cloverfield, whilst the film is shot in documentary fashion, the comparisons pretty much end there. Think more the last half hour of Children of Men with kickass firefights in the middle of a slum and you'd be a little closer to the feel of this Neil Blompkamp science fiction action movie.<br/><br/>The basis for the story is that an alien spaceship stops, not in Washington D.C. but in the skies of Johannesburg. On board the ship are over a million alien refugees, known by humans as ""prawns."" The prawns are kept away from the general human population in an area known as District 9 where they have lived for 20 years. Of course, the area is rife with crime, with roving bands of Nigerian crime lords, human-alien prostitution and the traffic of cat food, of which the prawns are particularly fond of.<br/><br/>The plot centers on Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley who fans may recognize as a sniper in the short film Alive in Joburg, which District 9 is based on. Wikus, the son-in-law of the boss of the powerful Multi-National United corporation, is appointed by his father-in-law to head up a new initiative to ""re-home"" the now 1.8 million alien inhabitants to a camp away from Johannesburg.<br/><br/>We are introduced to the slums of District 9 as Wikus goes door to door (flanked by armed soldiers under MNU's employ) handing out eviction notices. He neither understands what the prawns are going through nor really cares. That is, until he discovers a mysterious object which changes the story from a simple apartheid analogy into, well, an action packed sci-fi flick. Suddenly Wikus, and the audience, learns about the more sinister side of MNU, particularly their interest in alien weaponry.<br/><br/>Wikus' main motivation throughout the movie is to save his own skin, and what strikes me most of all is how generally unlikeable, and certainly unheroic he is throughout most of the movie. If characters like John McClane are the movie equivalent of the everyman then Wikus Van De Merwe is the real life everyman, thrown into a surreal situation in which suddenly those friendly MNU soldiers are turning their guns on him and District 9 is possibly his only safe haven.<br/><br/>Whilst more time should have been spent on the plot, in particular regarding the mysterious object, ultimately this movie succeeds as a thoughtful, gritty, funny sci-fi action movie.

"main-38","8","4","8","15 August 2009"," Every Summer has One
","There are always a few movies, every summer, where one cannot help but be thoroughly pleased after exiting the theater. Last summer it was hands down The Dark Knight and this summer, after a lot of waiting around and disappointment (The Hangover excluded) we were finally given 'District 9'.<br/><br/>I did not know what to expect from this movie. I feel like the allure for me came from the allure of the director's fledgling career. He only has a few films under his belt and the majority of his work has been done in other aspects of film making. With such a clever idea he had a lot to live up to. Neill Blomkamp appears to have done much in the way of visual effects in his film career. And for this reason the film soars. His expertise becomes crystal clear in the opening sequence of the film. The creatures, or Prawns as they are called, meld seamlessly into the set. The CGI is evident but close to flawless.<br/><br/>The story itself is interesting for a number of reasons. I found myself coming back to the setting, Johannesburg South Africa, over and over again. This is in no way an American movie, and for it to be received so well by American audiences is great. There are a lot of political undertones and a plethora of sociological statements to be made in this film. It is gritty but beautiful. The creatures and their technologies are inventive but slightly familiar and this is never once a detrimental aspect that is the down fall for similar films.<br/><br/>My complaints are few. As any ignorant American, I found their accents to be a bit much at times. Also, there is a a bit too much in the way of shaky camera work. I do understand that this had to be done but it is still very hard to keep track of everything that is happening while the camera shakes violently. I felt the main character, Wikus, has a lot of morality issues hat could have been either explored more or toned down a bit. In addition, I wanted to more about the Prawns- why did they come here? Who sent them? etc.<br/><br/>Regardless of minuscule short comings all movie goers will find something in this film. There is a healthy serving of blood, gore and explosions and this mixes nicely with the allusions to historical events and provocative statements made about society and human nature. The film is also a study of relationships and the nature of trust. For lack of a better term: if you possess any kind of pulse you will find something in this movie. It will both excite and incite in you some kind of deep thought."

Had I not paid $6 for a child's ticket, I would have asked for my money back.<br/><br/>More plot holes than...

"headly66","3","6","14","19 August 2009"," More silliness from another new director.
","I can't say I don't get what the director is going for here, a documentary style, shaky camera movements, etc, and he has us come in not at the arrival of the aliens like most films, but it has been established that they are an issue. The problem is not that the action itself or the effects are unreal but it's the plot and just basic understanding of reality that has been thrown out the window.<br/><br/>First of all, if real aliens suddenly arrived on Earth the UN would take control of the situation (not a weapons manufacturer) in a completely controlled manner, every alien would be in quarantine and never be able to contact normal citizens. The whole idea of a shanty town for them where they interact with gangs and families is just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Basic questions are not answered: Who is running the alien ship to keep it afloat? How can they communicate with the aliens? Why are they treating them as citizens who have to sign papers? Why would an alien have any conception of our ways of money or what's valuable? Why would an alien species want to sleep with a human woman, would you want to sleep with them? Why did they allow the aliens to acquire weapons? Why are they going door to door against creatures who are three times their strength with an approach like they are evicting old grandmas? Would you go door to door in a bad neighborhood full of gangs with drugs and weapons with three inexperienced guys and one guy with a gun??<br/><br/>The aliens are: A) Stupid animals who are addicted to cat food. B) Super intelligent enough to create the ship and travel to Earth. C) Dumb creatures who eat rubber tires and scrounge for garbage. D) Genius chemists and weapons makers who learn to read and speak English without any lessons.(oh wait, they don't speak English, and the humans don't speak alien, wow, it's the first time in history where two cultures speak to each other in their own languages with no interpreter and understand each other)<br/><br/>To believe in this movie is to believe that every aspect of human military and the ability to control large groups of people (which we have doing for 7000 years) has been lost and we have no idea what were doing anymore.<br/><br/>I'm sure this film will be praised and hailed as a masterpiece by 17 year olds who for some reason today only like movies filmed in this quick edit, crazy CGI, wacky camera, no real plot style that has taken over good sci-fi. Here today gone tomorrow, about as relevant as Transformers."
"cortlahman","10","6","14","14 August 2009"," Deep, gripping, original and so much more
","As an avid movie goer, I keep all of my ticket stubs for personal records. I had to go back through all of the movies I'd seen in theatres for the past few years to find one as riveting as District 9. The only movie that even came close was The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>I am glad Peter Jackson has moved from directing to solely producing films. I don't want to imagine what this movie would have been like had Jackson been calling all of the shots. However, by bringing District 9 into the limelight, he has done a great service to the world of entertainment.<br/><br/>The way the perspective switched from mock documentary to standard third person left me feeling totally immersed into the points being made and the action unfolding. There are several absolutely engrossing scenes that really set the theme of this movie. This world created in District 9 seems so parallel to ours, that you never feel like you're watching something that is a complete fantasy.<br/><br/>In no way is this film your traditional cookie cutter alien vs human story. In fact, most of the fighting that takes place in this movie is human vs human. The aliens are as much a part of the background as the slums in which they live in. Blomkamp gives us a lot of deep levels in this film that you can only dwell on just a few during the first viewing. There are just so many different themes being thrown at you that you almost feel overwhelmed. What you really benefit from in District 9 are the questions it leaves you with afterwards. All of which have nothing to do with plot holes, for there are none.<br/><br/>Blomkamp has created a new standard for Sci-Fi movies. I have heard comparisons between District 9 and last year's Cloverfield. The latter doesn't even come close in terms of: substance, action, and drama. Do yourself a favour, and pay a visit to District 9.<br/><br/>10/10, baby."
"dunks58","10","6","14","14 August 2009"," A classic
","Neil Blompkamp and the team have really delivered a great film here, in my opinion. One of the things I love is that it has obvious connections to other features with similar themes and settings -- notably the (soon-to-be-remade) '80s miniseries ""V"" and the excellent ""Alien Nation"" -- and yet it has a startlingly fresh and exciting approach all of its own.<br/><br/>Just about everything here appeals to me -- an intriguing story with powerful allegorical elements, and it's VERY political; it's skilfully told, with a good balance of action, drama and humour, excellent SFX (the aliens are terrific), strong performances and it's such a pleasure to see a film in this genre that doesn't regard all its viewers as uncritical clones of Comic Book Guy. It's quite gripping throughout and the final showdown between the hero and the security forces is tremendously exciting. The documentary style really works here and the hand-held camera work is for once a very effective tool, with Blomkamp very cleverly weaving us you in and out of the 'actuality' style.<br/><br/>The choice of setting is a brilliant touch in itself and it's good to hear Sarth Effrican accents right up front. It's terrific to see such an accomplished and thoughtful work coming from a country that was for a long time best known in films terms for the execrable 'The Gods Must Be Crazy'.<br/><br/>Unusually for a high-concept sci-fi flick, the plot elements are sparingly revealed, and many are left unexplained. It's also those rare movies with an ending wide open for a sequel ... but one that I'd really like to see. So many questions left deliciously unanswered ... what IS the story with the aliens? Why are they so seemingly so passive? Are they -- as it appears -- merely a degraded worker caste, or is there more to it than meets the eye? Will our hero be redeemed?<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley gives an amazing performance in the lead role and it's part of what sets this movie apart from prefabbed Hollywood dross like 'Aramgeddon' or '2012'. In the hands of Michael Mann or Roland Emmerich, the role would have gone to an obvious 'everyday hero' type like (urgh) Russell Crowe, but Copley fearlessly plays Wikus with such an amazingly convincing nebbish persona that it at first left me wondering whether the whole thing was heading for 'Scary Movie' territory. But fear not -- it rocks. I was blown away to discover that Copley was not a career actor and indeed had never acted until he appeared in the original short-film version. Incredible -- I predict big things for this guy.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that (at least in artistic terms) Blomkamp is going to be very glad indeed that he didn't end up directing Halo. This will undoubtedly come to be seen as one of the great sci-fi films of its time and I sincerely hope there is a sequel. A no-brainer for any serious sci-fi fan -- just go and see it."

It highlights the very humanity that lacks in so many ""Hollywood Films"" It transcended any other sci-fi film that has ever been made. From the very beginning until the end, the film is filled with constant action! It pulls you swiftly into it's story and doesn't let you go. <br/><br/>Non of the actors are well known to the American audience, yet the acting is flawless all the way through and they bring a truer sense that what is happening on screen is real. <br/><br/>Most films like this tend to lean heavily on hand-held camera shots, leaving you feeling sick and with a pounding headache, but it cleanly transitioned from shot to shot, always moving at a brisk pace.<br/><br/>To say this is the best film I've ever seen, might be an understatement!

"marttisarkia","10","5","11","3 September 2009"," The Lord of the Rings of scifi
","I saw this movie yesterday evening and it's definitely one of the best scifi-action-adventure movies ever made!!! Before I went to the cinema, I'd heard that the film contains a lot of blood and guts and it might be unsuitable for some people. I agree with this, but at least for me it was far from a too violent movie, because the gore scenes are quite gritty and blurry. This is why I'm honesty recommending this to the majority of adults. It has so much to offer.<br/><br/>First: the plot. Despite you've seen the trailers and read the synopsis, the plot has many twists to surprise you. And unlike in the case of 24, the twists are pretty reasonable and humane. Besides, it's not hard to recognize the connection between the alien community problem and the global social issues of the real world (just think about this after watching the movie).<br/><br/>Second: the CGI's. This is probably the first film including so realistic CGI effects that they are actually hard to separate from the ""real"" objects. Also, the rugged documentary-like picture enhances this vision very well. Nonetheless, the explosions and the other such visual effects were cutting edge. Still, I was a bit surprised to see that the film wasn't completely shot in this documentary-like manner, though only some individual scenes were.<br/><br/>Third: the action sequences weren't presented too frequently and that's why they worked so effectively. Despite this I didn't find myself bored in any part of the movie, probably because the action scenes were highly intensive and simply super-exciting!<br/><br/>Fourth: Sharlto Copley. This guy was incredible. He played his character (Wikus van de Merwe) extremely well, which reminded me of Borat (by Sacha Baron Cohen): so innocent and well-meaning person, but still people see him as a goofy (which appears to be a false assumption, when it's about his survival). But maybe the most impressive thing about him was the South African accent, it's simply unforgettable when you hear him swearing (and that's what you'll going to hear a lot in this movie).<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me a bit, was ""the overwhelming necessary evil"" character that they had to include to the movie for some mysterious reason. Maybe this will make it look more Hollywood style, but still I think it's a bad cliché.<br/><br/>Bottom line: don't miss this film, if you respect good scifi entertainment. It's like the Lord of the Rings of science fiction movies, one of the best movies of it's genre. Last, but not least: respect for the co-operation of Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson."

","Don't get me wrong, it was an enjoyable enough movie with seamlessly merged CG and an incredibly realistic feel to all of the scenes; it was very immersive that way. Lots of interesting weaponry too. And it was kind of nice to have a big-screen flick that doesn't act as if the US is the only country on earth.<br/><br/>But the movie had some very serious plot issues.<br/><br/>The idea of District 9 is that the aliens came to Earth malnourished and somehow stranded, and thus became reliant on the humans. ""Interesting premise,"" we all think to ourselves watching the trailer, ""I wonder how they will explain all that."" Well, they don't. It is never explained how this happened. How a ship full of over a million well-armed aliens ends up stranded in a slum on Earth for a few decades.<br/><br/>And there is a good reason they don't explain this, because the entire movie doesn't make a lick of sense once it is explained. They're stranded because they lack some sort of fluid for control/fuel for the mother ship. At one point it is explained that alien technology itself contains this fluid, and that there's enough lying in junkyards on earth to take the ship home. But this alien technology presumably came from the alien mother-ship... right? So then they must have had enough fuel all along, in which case the aliens were never stranded at all and there was never any reason for them to be stuck on earth or leave their ship. The entire premise of the movie is not logically sound.<br/><br/>Maybe most viewers can overlook that, but when the singular instigating event of a movie, the point of making it even, doesn't make a bit of sense it's a serious impediment to my enjoyment of a movie. If you feel like this too, then don't bother with District 9 in the theatres."

","I honestly don't understand all the love for this film. I love sci-fi but there's really nothing of substance here at all. The ridiculous overall notion aside, the story really wasn't told very well. The mix of point of view documentary, live TV coverage and regular film was poorly executed. It just doesn't work when you intermix those presentations throughout a film. The characters themselves were all unsympathetic, even the lead. His physical transformation is tragic (and gross) but every human is portrayed as a major a-hole. The violence was disgusting but I need more from my cinema than exploding humans and funky looking prawn aliens. The Iron Man meets Transformers exo-suit action at the end helps save the film as warped popcorn entertainment but that comes far too late to even care. BTW- There's 1.8 million aliens yet what amounts to two of them takes down the MNU complex? The story doesn't even hold up under its own weight."

"quito787","10","5","11","15 August 2009"," Sci-Fi Classic in the Making
","I really enjoyed this movie! As a sci-fi fan, I haven't been impressed with a lot of movies in the genre as of late. Good thing District 9 came along-- this film reminds me of how cool sci-fi movies can really be if executed properly.<br/><br/>I won't summarize the plot again, as other reviews have already done this. Suffice it to say that District 9 gives a fresh take on the humans vs. aliens plot line. We're not the ones being pushed around this time. The story is engaging on many levels, and provides a social commentary on interracial relations.<br/><br/>The special effects are awesome! The best thing about the alien effects-- from the creatures, to the weapons, to the vehicles-- is that they don't have a fake feeling about them. Too many SFX heavy movies nowadays look good but they just aren't very convincing. The SFX artists of District 9 did a fantastic job of making everything look gritty and real. One of the highlights of the movie for me is the part where they feature an alien robotic suit/vehicle that is armed to the teeth with alien weaponry. That was definitely a treat! Mecha/robot fans like me will love it for sure. District 9's robot shows that a Votoms, Armored Core, or Robotech/Macross-type movie is possible! The actors in the movie did an impressive job, especially Sharlto Copley, who played Wikus, the lead character in the story. He doesn't come across as your action-hero type leading man, but he did a really great job coming across as the unwitting hero in story.<br/><br/>Now I understand why Peter Jackson got involved with this project. Although he is not the director (Neill Blomkamp is), he must have been impressed by the story and the ideas behind District 9. I'm glad he did, because it is clear that in the production of this movie, money was spent on its polished look and feel.<br/><br/>I really hope this movie does well in the box-office, because it really is a great movie. It would be nice to see where they take the story if they ever do a sequel. I recommend to everyone to go see this...you will not be disappointed!"

The CGI on the aliens made them look real, and made you want to feel sorry for them with those big eyes.<br/><br/>Now I do not want to give away spoilers, which is why I left out specific details, of why I liked the movie."
"zero4-2","10","5","11","15 August 2009"," Awesome!
","This movie is awesome, instantly my favorite sci-fi movie ever props to Niel Blomkamp and Peter Jackson, by the way thanks guys for releasing the movie on my Birthday it was the coolest present I got all day. I should also mention Sharlto Copley does an outstanding job and may be the most impressive acting debut I have seen, any ways to sum it up I created this account on IMDb just so i could give this movie positive feedback, if you haven't seen it yet and like sci-fi do your self a favor and go see this movie, only criticism I can dish out is that the story moves incredibly fast at some points, but it just makes me want to see it again, and the action does take a while to build up but it is worth the wait. I'll say it again movie is awesome and can't wait to see it again!"
"Apemangalore","9","5","11","15 August 2009"," An original, thought-provoking masterpiece
","I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of District 9, to be honest. The trailers looked alright, and the premise sounded fascinating, to put it simply. Besides, I've always been interested in what director Neill Blomkamp has been up to, ever since I initially heard about his now long abandoned Halo adaptation. Having just seen the film, though, District 9 is not only perhaps my favorite movie of the year so far (challenged only by Coraline and Up), but one of the greatest films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Arguably the most surprising thing about this film is its budget; the movie cost approximately $30 million to make, yet looks as though it cost $100 million. The folks at Weta Workshop, as expected, did a truly exceptional job with the animation. All of the aliens (or Prawns) are given so much expressiveness, and in very subtle ways, too. In fact, I often forgot that I was watching a computer-animated character, which I think is the highest compliment that you can give to an animator.<br/><br/>The highlight of this movie, though, is Sharlto Copley's portrayal of our main protagonist, Wikus. Throughout the first 30-45 minutes of the film, he's viewed as a relatively unlikable character, yet becomes increasingly sympathetic as the film continues. It's done so in an extremely compelling, extremely real, way, which is refreshing to see in a film. It's this character and his relationship with the aliens that give these already incredible action sequences (that look as though they were inspired by sections of Halo and Half-Life) some genuine weight. I found myself tearing up a couple of times, actually, fearing for the safety of one of the characters, and rarely does a film manage to get that kind of response out of me.<br/><br/>District 9 is an original, thought-provoking masterpiece that shows how a system can force its citizens to be unwanted, without becoming preachy on the subject. I'll have to see it again, but I think that this film may actually dethrone Coraline (which is virtually tied with Up) as my favorite movie of the year so far."

The struggles of the important character parts became so much a part of the viewer experience, that it stirred emotions to match that of the film in our real world. <br/><br/>Many have tried to do this.

Note that a good understanding of what is going on will heighten the experience of watching this movie. Just be prepared to be aware. I don't want to give away anything so i'll be as vague as possible. I liked the satire, the irony, the metaphors that are of direct relevance to us presented within this film that allowed it to speak on so many levels.

","I went into District 9 today pretty much knowing what to expect from this film.

His transformation from nerd to empowered human was so astounding.<br/><br/>Now I know this movie won't be as highly watched as garbage like Transformers 2 and GI Joe. Though for a film that was made on a measly $30M budget it far surpasses these films in both substance and effect.<br/><br/>Also I saw this film on a Saturday and the theater was close to empty.

Walking out of the theatre was like when I finished seeing the Matrix for the first time. It was awesome. The film has a great story, excellent special effects, and great action as well. The film can be a bit heavy at times, which I enjoyed, but some viewers might be upset by the levels of cruelty, more than the violence. But then, it was inspired by the Apartheid, so what else can be expected? The only complaint I had was that it ended leaving so many questions. I won't spoil them here, but I will say this film will have people talking. See it as soon and as often as you can."

I was worried that nothing could possibly be OK in the end and that I'd leave feeling depressed.<br/><br/>I'm glad I stayed till the end.

","I have to say that at first time I saw the aliens in this movie, I wondered why did I got excited for it!!<br/><br/>As a science fiction movies fan, I would say that I liked it. It have all the reasonable factors that makes it a good sci-fi movie.. which is presentation of an unusual phenomena or event or whatever it could be and then the viewer should sit back and watch the effects of it with minimal predictable ""smart"" interference that usually found in sci-fi movies. <br/><br/>This movie is not about aliens.. it is about humans. The aliens are just means to describe human behaviors. Most movies that involve alien race presence would of course showcases human behaviors toward the unknown.. but here and in this movie the aliens are not ""unknown"". For some reason an obviously more technically advanced alien race got ""trapped"" on earth. Up to almost half the movie run time, the presentation of aliens was through TV reports and interviews that documents the life of aliens in the restricted slum-like area after so many years on earth. On the second half of the movie run time, that's when the enjoyable part start.. the sympathy toward the aliens reflected back to be a sympathy toward human race for its cruelty and selfishness. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to every science fiction genre fan."
"zkonedog","4","2","3","11 March 2017"," Too Weird To Be Good
","On most occasions, I am a fan of science fiction films. In the case of ""District 9"", however, the experience was just a little too bizarre to appeal to me.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the future story of human-alien interactions. Instead of the traditional ""us vs. them"" battle, we have exiled them to a slum-like area where corruption breeds. Unbeknownst to the humans, however, the aliens (Prawns) have been working on a way to go home, a method that is ultimately set in motion by a strange series of events.<br/><br/>For extremely hard-core sci-fi fans, I think ""D-9"" will really resonate. It is completely original, full of ""future tech"", and contains enough action to satisfy the ""shoot 'em up"" crowd. In an age of sequels and recycled plots, I have to give the creators credit for thinking up such out-there stuff.<br/><br/>From a ""regular movie"" standpoint, though, ""D-9"" is just too fractured and strange to be considered a success. Besides the main character (and even so much more could have been done with him), this is a typical ""black and white"" film. The bad guys are mustache-twirling fiends, while the good guys are portrayed as innocent of everything. I call this the ""Avatar Effect"", and prefer a bit more ambiguity (""shades of grey"") in the character development. Plus, just when (at times) you think the plot is really heating up, it usually gets bogged down in more laser blasts and military action.<br/><br/>Thus, while not a terrible movie by any means, ""D-9"" was just too strange and ultimately formulaic for this reviewer. If you appreciate ""left field"" ideas, however, then you will like it more than I. 2.5 stars would be a more accurate rating, but I couldn't give it the benefit of the doubt for 3."
"iahsan18","10","2","3","19 March 2014"," Expect the unexpected
","District 9, a film directed Neill Blomkamp, has to be on your must-watch movie lists. It's like Aliens mixed with Transformers but a little bit better than both. The reason this movie stands out of the rest alien movies is mainly because it shows that we need to get along even if we are aliens or humans, District 9 is also a political film and that's one of the reasons why this lost one star from me. The aliens in this movie are not called aliens but instead they are called ""prawns"" because their characteristics and personality match those of a prawn. The action is mind blowing but at the beginning it's starts out boring and slow but then it runs smoothly and gives you a package of action and a cool story. The acting particularly from Sharlto Copley is more than exceptional and even though it's the second movie he has starred in, he gives one heck of a good act. Sharlto Copley's role is unique because he plays someone who is a fugitive human-alien on the run because he didn't like being tested on and together with his two prawn friends he has to cure himself."

","District 9 is one of those films that need to be seen to be believed,literally. Few times we've seen so much overall content in a sci-fi film since The Matrix. Starting with the plot: a relatively original and very creative script, which uses some allegorical representations of the real world to compose the aliens and the protagonist personality. Absolutely great. So is the plot. Obviously,it has his flaws, some greater and some not so perceptible, but it has. Still, a great job done by Neill Blomkanp. The cinematography and the CGI are absolutely great as well, and so is the make-up. Shame i can't tell more than that without spoiling the film. Sharlto Copley did a good job too. A underrated performance,perhaps. Still, if you want to watch this film, don't think twice to do it."
"fallonfantriple7","10","2","3","22 August 2013"," Apartheid with aliens
","District 9 is a visionary film about an apartheid-like regime in South Africa, wherein twenty years ago a ship full of insect-like aliens came to a hovering stop over Johannesburg. Humans were eventually able to cut into the ship and found a population of aliens starving and weak, they were transported to Earth and now reside in District 9, a slum of a place that is cutoff from the rest of Johannesburg by barbed wire and armed guards. The film follows Wikus van der Merwe, the head of MNU, the govt. agency that deals with the aliens (derogatorily known as ""prawns""). Wikus is charged with going in and telling the aliens that they are being moved to District 10, which, unbeknownst to the aliens, is smaller and even less comfortable than District 9. While doing this, Wikus and his men also seize alien weapons and destroy nests of eggs as the humans have also imposed breeding restrictions. During the excursion Wikus has an event happen to him and it changes his whole mindset and will change the course of his life forever. This film is amazing, while the underlying metaphor is obvious, it is still freshly told and excellently shot, the alien effects are fantastic, using motion capture and CGI, the aliens look real and individual also the makeup that is used is so real looking it could pass for CG. Apart from that, though the story holds it own, telling the story of Wikus' life in documentary-style flashbacks and interviews combined with vivid cinematic shot that show the action both as it happened and what the people of Earth think in the aftermath, creating a very immersing film. The film however is very bloody, very violent and has enormous use of the F-word, not for young children. However, everything seems realistic and called for and is an amazing piece of work. The highest recommendation for this film. A must see."

This piece of work blow your mind.The plot is original,the special effects are top-notch and the heart wrenching performance by Sharlto Copley. Some people say that the violence and profanity is overdone but i think it is just accurate and necessary for the movie. The gut-wrenching scenes involving prawns are fabulous. I loved the documentary-hand held camera style by Neill Blomkamp and his entire work. He is such a talented filmmaker. On the other hand it is no less than a thriller,it gives you chills. The scenes where they torture Wikus seems so realistic and cruel. Also it has a emotional side,when a mild-mannered and a good man faces these kind of things and misses his loving wife.

But after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. Well, I was delightfully surprised by the quality of this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie has extremely great plot. It revolves around the landing of alien mother-ship and various aliens living in refugee camps around Johannesburg.

"jack_face","Null","2","3","30 December 2012"," Original and that's rare.
","For this movie's budget, it was visually stunning and very impressive. Acting was good too. Plot was totally original which is rare these days. It was a good little movie, moved very fast, slightly absurd and darkly comedic in places. Special effects were top notch for what this movie cost. It ended with sequel potential. Characterizations were decent as later the focus shifted to one human and one alien.<br/><br/>About the only complaint I really had was they never explained the reason why the aliens actually came to Earth and were malnourished. Later, I thought they'd reveal it but it was just a plot device to drive the story. The 20-year timeframe wasn't well delivered either. Unless mentioned, the movie seemed like it moved in a few weeks or months rather than 2 decades. I saw no reason why the aliens had to live in squalor. Plus the language barrier, or lack thereof, was never explained as to how it was overcome as no human ever spoke alien language but could understand them fully. I'll chalk that up as one of the absurdities. Why'd the aliens stay for so long? 'Why' seems to be the big question that's never answered. But I don't think they really wanted to. Needed to, yes, that would've been nice. Wanted to; if they would have, the movie would've been a lot longer and a totally different experience. All the stuff that was left out because the movie moves so fast could be revealed in a retrospective featurette, possibly on the DVD. Then the 2nd movie, if any, could be the return of the alien species; either malevolent or benevolent. Either way, I'd like to know the answer to 'why.' It's the only headscratcher in the whole movie.<br/><br/>That aside, if you're a bonehead, like my friend who calls this flick ""cinematic trash,"" who doesn't understand the type of story the director is trying to tell or needs a simple plot to enjoy a movie, then don't bother with this. You could get lost if your brain is slow because this movie does move very fast and uses very different expository techniques as it shifts from a documentary style at the beginning where the characters acknowledge the cam to traditional methods where you just kick back and watch things unfold. I liked it. Can't say I was expecting what I got and that's a good thing. It's original."

This is probably the first film that eliminates 'stereotypes' towards aliens. Although it does have uncertainties and loopholes here and there, District 9 is one step closer towards a highly probably outcome if the situation actually takes place in real life, and is likely to form a good base for future movies to come that I hope will create a new market intended for viewers who demand something alien, but closer to reality than being imaginary."
"Kane20","9","2","3","26 September 2012"," Review - District 9
","Personally, I am a bit of a science fiction lover. I have seen tons of sic-fi films, from fun and lighthearted popcorn flicks to deep and emotional ones. I've seen clichéd and basic-formula ones, and ones that have a distinct uniqueness about them - new worlds, unique scientific concepts, memorable scientific technology and what not, and much more; and, best of all, unique twists on stories. District 9 is one such unique science fiction film. It has several obvious clichéd and borrowed aspects, but overall it's a somewhat creative film, and pretty memorable, too. I didn't see it when it came out, and, in fact, I had never even heard of it until sometime last year. So, after reading a bit about the film, yet still not knowing much about it, I decided to give it a try in May (yes, this year), and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>District 9 eludes many expectations of a sic-fi audience. The film is set in an alternate timeline, where, in 1982, a spaceship appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa (instead of a usual sci-fi setting). The aliens on board, instead of being evil and strong with an urge do kill, are helpless and in weak condition. The aliens, unable to operate the ship anymore, are taken to a temporary camp on the ground underneath where the ship is hovering. Unfortunately, due to the the high population of these aliens, and to typical political flaws, over the years, the temporary camp eventually turns into a giant slum segregated from the rest of Johannesburg. Also, the initial welcome wears off, and humans begin to discriminate against the aliens, nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their ugly appearance. Finally, in 2010, the Multi-National United munitions corporation is sent to evict these prawns from the slum, with Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In the process, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical, at which point his personal nightmare begins and everything changes drastically for him, and the story really starts to get going and unfold. I won't give anything else away about the story after this last thing: along the way, Wikus befriends an alien, and his small son.<br/><br/>District 9 combines dosages of the man-befriends-other-race-and-turns-against-his-own-people theme, the don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover moral, political elements, elements of racism, segregation, and discrimination, and a bit of E. T. and some other themes. It uses its running time wisely and tells its story very effectively. Some of the film is in documentary-style, and part of it is in regular style, and there are even some shots seen here and there from security cameras, and things like that. Visually, the film has a gritty, ugly look about it, adds brilliantly to the tone of the film, and gives it a bit of a more realistic feel to it. Even the aliens themselves are pretty ugly, but they are very well portrayed with top-notch CGI. In fact, all of the special effects in the film are very good. Clinton Shorter composed a very effective score for this film. It's not a great score or anything, but it does help bring out the tone and emotion of the film, just like the special effects do.<br/><br/>There is not a single actor in the film whom I have heard of before seeing this film. However, the actors' performances are pretty good. The actors really bring out their characters very well. I liked the characters. They are strong and dynamic. Wikus is a good protagonist, and I really cared about him while watching the film. I also came to like the aliens he befriends - they may be ugly, but I really felt true emotion for them and their inner characters, who they really are inside, especially the big one (the father). I know hardly anything about director Neil Blomkamp, but he did a very good job with this film. There are definitely some things that he could have done better, and the overall film was not great, but Blomkamp did a good job overall, and gave us a pretty good film.<br/><br/>So, overall, while District 9 is, in my opinion, not quite an iconic or classic science fiction film, it's still pretty unique, and it has some pretty memorable things about it. It's not really something I might remember immediately many years from now as a classic film or anything, but, like I said before, it's pretty memorable. It's a smart, emotional, and entertaining science fiction film, and it's definitely worth seeing at least once.<br/><br/>My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/"
"beatonsf","8","2","3","3 July 2012"," District 9 - Distrik Ses
","District 6 (Distrik Ses) was the absolutely genuine inner-city slum region of Cape Town, best known for the brutal removal of over 60,000 inhabitants during South Africa's apartheid regime. South Africa gave many reasons for the removals: interracial interaction bred conflict; enforced separation of the races; the district was a slum fit only for clearance; the area was crime-ridden, dangerous and full of immoral activities like gambling, drinking, and prostitution.<br/><br/>Around the historical facts of District 6, District 9 weaves one of the most original and engaging Sci-Fi movies I've seen since Bladerunner. The cinematography is wonderful, the editing is damn-near perfect, the CGI is beautifully handled and the cast perform with considerable aplomb.<br/><br/>Additionally, District 9 wears its allegorical politics very lightly. It makes no direct mention of apartheid, and it makes no mention of the painful legacy of apartheid, which can still be seen so clearly even to today. What it does do is balance originality, entertainment and socio-political comment so beautifully that, by the end of the screening, I wanted to stand and applaud. 8/10 - a very fine piece of work."
"Ernest_Carpenter-Baggins","9","2","3","22 June 2012"," Contributory comment
","With over a thousand user reviews already in, there is just one thing I feel strongly about which I want to add, and that is this: Unless you lived in South Africa during the apartheid years you cannot - you really can't - fully appreciate what Neill Blomkamp has achieved in this film. His satirical artistry is near-perfect. The odyssey which Wikus must complete is a multi-layered reflection and examination of what it means to be human. An apartheid-era civil servant journeys to an understanding of the Other - from the inside. Whether you are black or white or crustacean, being human depends on whether or not you are a whole person on the inside - and on whether or not, and to what degree, you are capable of recognising the person on the inside of another exterior. The different characters in the movie, whichever side of the divide they are on, or whether they are caught in between, show their individual degrees of humanity.<br/><br/>The only reason I took a point off a full ten is that the degree of in-your-face violence, blood and guts is somewhat stomach-churning (although justified in the context). So it is a brilliant movie which has some distinctly unpleasant moments. It remains brilliant."

","I think I saw 'District 9' shortly after its release of home video. It's hard to believe that was about 10 years ago. I enjoyed it then, and I still like it now. What I find surprising is how good this movie works as a well paced sci-fi action movie that never really stops. From beginning to end it flows quite seamlessly from one event to the next. Whilst the film doesn't do much at all to develop its characters, you still end up rooting for them... well, at least the goodies. It's well worth a watch (and rewatch).<br/><br/>But for writer/director Niell Blomkamp, lighting doesn't seem to strike in the same place twice. Together with his wife, he co-wrote this film, and two other Sci-fi films which aren't really up to scratch by comparison. 'Eylsium' and 'Chappie' - also directed by Blomkamp - two more sci-fi actioners, with the former being below average, and the latter being unwatchable in my opinion. It's difficult to believe that the same creators who brought us this solid sci-fi action film, returned to other projects with such diminishing returns. Still, at least 'District 9' still holds up well."

"gbill-74877","7","1","1","25 February 2020"," Solid science fiction with a message
","It's not hard to spot the commentary on the cruelty of mankind, and in how these aliens are treated, to recognize how we treat each other, be it during apartheid in South Africa, or more recently, refugee camps along the southern U.S. border. There is no sign of an attempt to understand the alien culture or what intelligence they have by scholars, it's all about making sure they're subordinated, their weapon technology harvested, and anything of value monetized. The speed with which this occurs is devastating, but the film is lightened up a little bit by the humor of the naïve agent (Sharlto Copley) who bumbles through rounding the aliens up for relocation. When he's accidentally sprayed with some form of alien fuel, he begins morphing into one of them, and in the absurdity of it all, I thought of Gregor Samsa waking up to find he was a bug. It's all madness, and yet, the militaristic, inhuman response of the earthlings has disturbing elements of truth. It's unfortunate that the back half of the film becomes increasingly filled with action film clichés and concentrates mostly on special effects, plot holes be damned, losing its way from what was such a strong start. It's entertaining for sure, but could have been a classic had it not targeted being a blockbuster."

","District 9, in my opinion, is Avatar done right. Both movies deal with themes of discrimination involving aliens and the main character eventually siding with the aliens and having to fight against his own people. The story and themes in both films has been done to death, but District 9 manages to do it in a way that does not feel so cliché. They both have amazing special effects. However, District 9 produced great effects with a much smaller budget.<br/><br/>The main character, Wikus (Sharlto Copley), while I do not like him much at first, does not feel like the stereotypical hero like Sam Worthington's character in Avatar does and he feels more real. I bought his plight more and his transition from a naïve person to liking the aliens feels natural.<br/><br/>Plus the film is very violent which makes the action more exciting for me. When I first saw it I was jarred at how dark it was so I didn't like it. However, I saw it again and enjoy much more. I still think the dark nature of the film is a bit extreme but it didn't bother me a lot once I got used to it. I definitely recommend this film, but I would caution in letting your children view it. The film is very dark and intense and not for everyone."

","This was my second time watching it, and I still love it. Instead in most movies where we are the prey and the aliens try to conquer us, it's the other way around. They also seem to slip in messages here and there in the movie what I thought was really clever. The brawns are mistreated and harassed like people of different races and genders are today. We use to and even still today mistreat people and nothing is done, about 50 years ago we ordered people around like animals and felt Superior to them. Even though it has those types of messages throughout the movie, it was still a great movie. This original movie will have you talking about it for weeks to come it has rewritten what we think of aliens, not harmful but gentle loving a peaceful. The story is amazing and very creative. It's also a more interesting way to talk about what's happening in our world today. This movie really touched me, and I bet it will touch you to."

","I did quite enjoy this film. It's different to the generic Hollywood movie in many respects. There are no American good guys saving the entire world from the arab terrorists or perfect RP English speaking criminal mastermind in this film. Instead the main character is actually South African, he is not a clear hero but just a normal and very flawed human, capable of treating others very inhumanely. The film shows all humans in a negative light and very realistically so. It really does escape from this Hollywood ""hero"" idea and bring reality of how people would really act in situations to the screen. It is kind of eye opening and believable in how we could possibly treat another intelligent species. The film is shot in a very believable way also, using a lot of hand-held camera shots, adding to the realism, it's kind of like the blair witch but filmed more as if reporters are actually filming the main character (trust me it really works well). The action likewise is fairly gritty and realistic and there are some cool alien weapons and technology to be seen! It is the kind of action where 1 person getting killed has a lot of impact due to the gritty realism, as opposed to action films where hundreds of people get shot but you don't really care because they're just generic henchmen there to be shot in the hundreds in a boring fashion haha."

","This is a great imaginative sci-fi classic that has an interesting twist on racism. The plot revolves around a group of aliens being isolated in South Africa. While trying to maintain them, one of the workers get infected and he starts to mutate into one of the aliens. He soon becomes the most wanted man on the planet and he's forced to retreat into the area where the aliens are being held. I enjoyed the movie more and more as it went on. It has great acting from Wilkus Van De Merwe. The cinematography was excellent and it was expertly shot. It has a nice barren and rundown environment. The action sequences are highly interesting since we get to see fictional weapons being used. They make them more entertaining. They are played well and last long but not too long where they start to drag on. This movie definitely taken inspiration from 80's sci-fi movies. It has just the right elements which make a classic sci-fi movie. It is an interesting depiction of aliens and the future and its originality shines through.

","Now that I've watched it a second time, it still stands out to me as one of the best sci-fi movies of the last 20 years. You have a protagonist with a clear arc, and who is someone you can sympathize with. The entire cast of characters, in fact, are fascinating to watch. I also like how genre conventions are played around with, by the having the faux-documentary feel for much of the movie. Still greater is the movie's treatment of racism as more than just a cultural problem, but something which essentially robs us of our humanity, or causes us to view others as second-class citizens. And of course, the action is first-rate, albeit with a little more shaky-cam than I'd like. All things considered, it's a must-watch regardless of its genre."
"alindsay-al","9","1","1","12 October 2014"," a fantastic film that questions conventions
","Going into watching this film I had heard very little about it and I knew very little so it was to my delight that this film is utterly fantastic. The story sees aliens arrive to earth in the 1980s above Johannesburg in south Africa, these aliens called prawns are put into poverty and this particular place is called district 9. Now this film is about the prawns in a lot of ways but also there had to be a representation of humanity and our lead does a really good job in this. Played by debutant sharlto Copley our lead character really represents the upper class and he does a great job of turning his character in ways that aren't expected and making him feel relatable to the prawns and I thought he did a great job doing that. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag though with the two prawns he allies with being great and feeling almost human in the way they react in their own ways as their relationship with the human grows. But the problem with the other human characters is that nobody stands out with a great performance as they are just all completely average, but that is not a huge bad thing because of Copley's performance. The story is excellent with this first time director really putting a lot of social messages into this film with the representations of characters. I also like how these are not your typical aliens and they fit into this realistic story and world. The script is great with a lot of heartfelt moments in this film even from the prawns and when a film can make aliens relatable that is a job well done. The style is freaking awesome with the cockroach look of the prawns really looking great and modern, also the weaponry is insane with all the guns being massive. Another great thing is that this film takes place in south Africa and because of this less then typical setting it adds a lot to the film. Overall this is a film I recommend to anybody as it is a fantastic film and I hope this director does eventually get the chance to make the halo movie that was planned."
"wafflelady1996","Null","1","1","24 September 2014"," District 9
","Ever since I saw Elysium last year, I have been obsessed with its director, Neill Blomkamp, and one of its lead actors, Sharlto Copley. Once I found out they did another film together I was thrilled. I immediately bought it and watched it. The film was District 9. District 9 takes place in a post alien arrival in Johannesburg. This film was better than all of the other Neill Blomkamp's movies and other sci- fi movies I have seen. Through the use of different camera styles, sounds, and lighting, District 9 has unique scenes that make a marvelous film.<br/><br/>A quick synopsis of the film is aliens arrived in Johannesburg in the early 80's. They were stuck on their ship and became refugees in South Africa. Fast forward 20 years, the aliens and human population are at war with one another. The film focuses on a Multi-National United (MNU) worker, Wikus Van de Merwe (Copley), and his day evicting the aliens from their refugee camp, District 9. District 9 uses a variety of camera perspectives to produce a unique feel to different scenes. For example, there are many scenes of family members, co-workers, and professionals describing events that occurred throughout the film. The interviews are similar to a documentary that you would see on the History Channel. There are also scenes that are shot like surveillance footage. The surveillance scenes provides a live action feel which makes the audience believe it is in the moment and there is no time for the main character to think. The interviews and raw footage set the stage for District 9 and bestows a powerful element on the film. Sound was another key element that created such a miraculous film. The use of sound was used very wisely. Instead of having the typical shrieking noise to build up to the intense scene, District 9 has background noise and drum beats. The background noise and drumbeats would increase steadily, giving the viewer the feeling that something bad was about to happen. After building up a scene with sound, District 9 changed the sound completely by changing its tempo once it reached the climax of the scene. A common sound used was loud helicopter noise. The helicopter noise made you feel the intensity of the chase that Wikus was experiencing. Sound is a technique that is often used the same way in films but District 9 brings a whole new level to sound in cinema.<br/><br/>Sound was not the only component used to develop this alien infested world, the use of lighting created a very dramatic mood throughout the film. There is ominous lighting through the introduction, giving a feel that something is about to go drastically wrong. It is very dark and eerie. However, the lighting changes in a blink of an eye. An illustration of this is after Wikus is attacked; the film has bright lights showing Wikus' disorientation. The scene also includes the sound of ringing in your ears which also demonstrates how disoriented he is. <br/><br/>District 9 uses a fantastic combination of cinematic techniques that make it a masterpiece. It will change your view point on sci-fi films. District 9 has brought sci-fi films in to a new era of sophistication. You will want to watch this film over and over again –hoping that the sequel comes soon. District 9 has created a new level of sci-fi cinema."

","Before I start to write the review if you want a good sci-fi film with a little bit drama and with lots of action this movie is for you. First, I will talk about the age MPAA rating because lot of people ask about is it scary or not. I don't want to give a spoiler but there are 1-2 disturbing scenes and a few frightening scenes but I didn't felt scared but there is a lot of blood (not ""Saw blood"") a little bit more blood then a normal war film. OK now let's talk about the film .First of all, few part of the film is like documentary(10-11 minutes max.).But it's fine, some of you just want to see action and people fighting aliens with lot of intense scenes don't worry rest of the film is like that. Some of you want to compare with other sci-fi movies so do I ,this film is way better than War of the Worlds or other sci-fi films. The reason why I'm comparing with War of the Worlds because you can't always see aliens (You see in 2-3 scenes).But in this film you always see aliens and you can see what they do . You can see the drama in the film where some of the people behave so bad to the aliens and behave them like they are slaves.You can see a person who don't feel bad like the other persons but then a lot of events happen and the old thoughts replaces with new and different thoughts .It's so interesting that a sci-fi film have some drama with a lot of action.And last but not least this movie has a great and a different view to the aliens. And this is it, I'm sorry if there are mistakes with my grammar and I hope you will like this review and District 9."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","1","9 August 2013"," A unique style of science fiction filming
","Like many other directors that have a breakthrough in film, their first theatrical release is always considered to be their best. Sam Raimi is the perfect example. Before Spider-Man (2002), he was known for creating the low budget horror film, The Evil Dead (1982). Now look at him, even after all the other well praised films he has made, he is still best known for that movie in particular. Same will happen here with director Neill Blomkamp. District 9 (2009) will forever be considered, by many, his best creation in film. For the most part, this is mostly credit for the type of style this film gives its audience.<br/><br/>The story revolves around how a dystopian city called Johannesburg where humans and aliens called ""prawns"" live amongst each other. Unfortunately, neither species is happy living with the other on the same ground. But what will really grab the viewers' attention is Neill Blomkamp's direction. At the introduction and the finale, the film acts like a documentary with interviews from various citizens and professionals. I assume this is where the short film Tron: The Next Day (2011) got its creativeness from, because they too used a documentary- like style of filmmaking. This kind of direction does make the experience feel more authentic because documentaries are historical film works which are supposed to give its viewers a better understanding of what happened in the past.<br/><br/>Adding to that authentic feel is actor Sharlto Copley, who at the time, was a no-name actor. Copley is in his root continent in this movie, which makes the story that much more believable. Plus, because Copley hasn't really shown audiences until now what he can do, he will prove himself not only as a viable action star but also a actor who can show true emotion. Even more astounding is how this movie was able to create such a real looking environment and creatures. The prawns are something to behold, especially the way they talk. It is a very intriguing sound. But, it may annoy some audiences that there is no translation for the dialog between prawns. Its basically like watching two wookies talk. No clue what's being said; which is frustrating.<br/><br/>The special effects and action scenes were also well executed. Even the practical effects such as makeup was innovative. Though one element that I found this film to be weak in, was the film score. Clinton Shorter, a composer with not many theatrically released movies under his belt, lacks sufficient expertise to really bring out the emotion in various scenes. I like that he was able to give the score an African voice to its background, but was only effective to establish the setting. After that though, it needed more depth to illustrate the struggle between humans and prawns. But I never felt that at any point. Instead, Shorter will incorporate a lot percussion when tension arises but other than that. The music is left under produced.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's theatrical debut may not contain the most convincing music but with solid special effects, a realistic tone and unique film making, after viewing the movie, some people may think District 9 may have existed."

","District 9 is one of the most unusual films I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of science fiction films and have seen quite a number of them, yet this is a unique film. Most sci-fi films are futuristic or have a simple good-vs-bad plot. In contrast, District 9 is a more realistic portrayal of what would actually happen if aliens landed on earth. I like how the aliens were unlike what one comes to expect in these types of film.<br/><br/>Although the plot is intriguing and more mysterious than most films involving this subject matter, I found some of it hard to believe and ludicrous. Nevertheless, the film is exciting and you just never know what to expect.<br/><br/>Kudos to the director for making such an interesting film and pulling it off for the most part."
"paul2001sw-1","7","1","1","14 October 2012"," Being Human
","Many of the ideas of the celebrated film 'Alien' are reinterpreted in Neill Blomkamp's movie 'District 9' in the context of a parable about Apartheid South Africa; and rather more surprisingly, there are also shades of 'The Office', as an un-self aware bureaucrat becomes an unlikely hero. It's nicely done, and the political parallels don't seem wholly limited to the past either, but the film's weakness, rather like that of Orwell's 'Animal Farm', is that the parable is perhaps just a little too obvious: it's hard to care too much about the plot when it's so obviously constructed to make a point. But there's skill in the telling: we're encouraged to see the aliens in progressively more humanised form (although the film perhaps also suggested that being human is nothing particularly to be proud of). 'District 9' may not be a masterpiece, but it's certainly more interesting than the average piece of celluloid sci-fi."
"Thomas-Giffin","9","1","1","23 April 2012"," A fantastic film, cannot recommend enough!
","Amply filling the previously lacklustre genre of South African science fiction, District 9 is one of the smartest, most engaging, emotionally powerful and well directed film I've seen in recent times. It is as simple as that.<br/><br/>Acting as a mirror for the events of the apartheid regime (specifically District 6), this film is a powerful social and political allegory for those events brilliantly moved over to the fictional narrative of an alien race landing on earth. Apart from this, if you do not have much knowledge of that era of South African history (and I am no expect by any means), the film also operates as a fantastic piece of cinema by its own right.<br/><br/>Originally Peter Jackson (who produced) had picked South African director Neill Blomkamp, to direct a film adaption of the Halo game. When this project fell through, Jackson gave Blomkamp around $25 million to make any film, District 9 was an expansion of a 6 minute short film Blomkamp made in 2005 called Alive in Joburg.<br/><br/>Playing the main character is Sharlto Copley, who is absolutely incredible. His Wikus van der Merwe is an incredible character, an utterly fallible real human being. The narrative means that he spans this incredible scope from callous and distant to heroic but never in a linear fashion and he still remains a flawed but identifiable character. It's a marvel of script writing married with great acting.<br/><br/>The direction is beautiful too. Hand-held but visually alive, occasional static CCTV type shots fit right in with the inventive style of directing and considering the director had less than $30 million, the CGI is stunning. Christopher Johnson (the main alien) is almost as emotive as fellow CGI creature Gollum even without being able to speak English. It is a great lesson in how far money can get you in cinema (By contrast, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End cost upwards of $300 million to make....)<br/><br/>Even as the film nears the end and it becomes more of a 'regular' action film (although expertly done), it still retains all the character and style of the preceding events and unlike a lot of films, it ends in a very satisfying way without handing you all the answers. The 'bad guys' too are almost comically nasty, evil laughs and all. It's not hugely detracting but it does seem odd considering how fully realised Wikus is. This is literally the worst criticism I can level at the film and it is not a film-destroying accusation by any means.<br/><br/>Please, please watch this film if you haven't seen it. <br/><br/>I don't usually plead or beg but in this case, I will make an exception."
"minsuk731","7","1","1","14 April 2012"," Good movie...overall
","I enjoyed watching most of the movie. However, the character development wasn't as logical and smooth as it could have been. I understand the main character's motives, and I think the actor has done an amazing job to reflect it. The character acts according to his instincts, and shows very little consistency and gave the impression that he is definitely not a deep-thinking individual. And I was fine with that. It was his character, and the actor did very well to express it. He continued to act in favor of himself, killing everyone in his way, unconsciously becoming one of the prawns. I understand his motives of wanting to establish his old life again, but he caused too much damage in my opinion to justify his actions. Everything till here was good. The character was very constant with being inconsistent and selfish. However, it was the end that ruined my experience with the movie. This selfish character, who screamed at the prawn near the end when he found out that it would take three years to fix his arm, because the prawn needed to get some help from his home, suddenly began showing sympathy towards the prawn, sacrificing his life so that the prawn can reach the ship. Thinking about the character development to that point, it was impossible, or very unnatural for him to change so suddenly. I would like to acknowledge that the actor was amazing, one of the best performances I have seen, but the character development was not the best."

I did not find myself laughing at the moments that were trying to be funny, I laughed at the moments that were trying to be serious, like the gang leader in District 9, who apparently has polio or something, or how the humans blow up from the alien weapons.<br/><br/>The film overall was corny filled with bad acting and poor directing. It was trying to be one movie, and it became two, and in my opinion it should of stuck with the documentary style. One of the worst films of the year."

The look of the aliens themselves was good but other than that, don't waste your money or the minimal brain power required to view this movie because it isn't worth it. After hearing raving reviews, I expected something outstanding and I guess maybe my expectations were too high (way too high) because it didn't do anything for me whatsoever.

I actually walked out in the middle (First movie I've ever walked out of) and lied down. I felt sick to my stomach just by watching that pile of trash. I left after he cut off his finger with an AX! There was no reason for them to have added all the gore they did. I don't think there is a man alive who can explain it to me. There also wasn't any point to add all the cussing that they did. The whole movie had things that didn't make any sense. If all the gangsters were causing trouble they would have just been kicked out. This whole thing took place in a military base. How did the people get in? And if everyone knew what they were doing who didn't the military just kill them, or kick they out of the base.

No, thanks. Awful - The acting in this movie was nothing short of pathetic. I'm pretty sure we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards the alien Christopher, but honestly it would've been much nicer if they put him down within the first half hour of the movie.

"wgeddings","2","6","15","23 October 2009"," Awful movie and I am disappointed
","This movie sounded good in theory. It sounded good in reviews. I love science fiction so the idea of aliens being stranded on earth and forced to live in ghettos seemed very interesting. I used to love the movie and television series Alien Nation, which had a similar theme. I was pumped and excited to see this movie. Sadly, it left the regular theater here before I got to see it so I had to wait for it to come to the $1.99 theater. At least that is good news because I only wasted $1.99 (and the required $9 for popcorn and a drink...).<br/><br/>What is good? The special effects are very good and the action sequences are well done. I dislike an action sequence with too many fast cuts or too many close up shots of the hero or villain. While this had a very little of both, overall the sequences were filmed from the vantage point I would want to see. The basic plot was also good and interesting. The CGI work on the aliens was very good and they seemed more like actual characters than just cartoons.<br/><br/>What is not so good? First and foremost, the accents. I realize this was supposed to be South Africa and it would be silly to have them speaking American English but the idioms and fast speaking was almost unintelligible at times. A few idioms were easy enough to figure out but many meant nothing to me. I think the acting was probably pretty good but it is hard to say since I did not understand a lot of what was being said. I know, that is how things are in a foreign film but this was not supposed to be a foreign film and difficult to understand English (at least to an American) is why I do not see foreign films. It was extremely distracting. I also did not expect that all aliens would be unable to speak English so I would have to read a lot of subtitles. I can believe that humans and aliens would learn one another languages even if they did not speak each others but most of the humans seemed to be awfully capable of understanding the aliens and when I figure that we humans have a lot of trouble understanding one another's language (or even the language of other English speakers), I just feel like that level of understanding was a bit too much. Yeah, complaining of linguistics in a movie with space aliens sounds odd but that is what I thought.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie I would have preferred to wait for the DVD version. First, I would have had subtitles to be sure I understand all that was being said and second, I would have saved a lot of money on just renting it. As it is, I would definitely not recommend this movie."

","Many people who consider themselves Sci-Fi aficionados, will instantly fall in love with this summer's Blockbuster hit, District 9. As most who have already seen this film can attest, there is almost nothing in the Sci-fi genre like this film. The concept is presented in an almost documentary-like fashion.<br/><br/>However, this unique presentation of alien life on earth is also the film's downfall! What seemed like a neat idea, actually turns out to be a little tiresome and drawn out. After about the first hour, some people may find the plot line so obviously defined, there will be no point in continuing the film. In essence, it is very dry.<br/><br/>To add to the films complications, the nearly fresh cast brings very little to the proverbial table. While they may all have great potential as actors, this film does not adequately portray their acting talents.<br/><br/>In summation, this film provides a very unique sci-fi concept with some fairly stellar action sequences, but falls short in plot and acting characteristics. Unless you are unable to carry on without a steady dose of science fiction action films, this movie is one you can wait to see. If you can view it online, it is worth the price you pay (nothing) to download it. If you are not as fortunate, allow a friend to buy or rent it before seeing this movie!"

","I am a fan of Sci-fi movies. Anything that deals with aliens, UFOs, and the like are the types of movies I enjoy. Independence Day, Men in Black, etc are all excellent movies with a cognitive story line. This movie was so disjointed, you didn't know what the plot was because they were trying to develop too many story lines. It jumped around to much in the scenes, far too many closeups of everything, you couldn't get an overall idea of what was happening. The camera work was amateurish and very sloppy. It was like driving by an accident, you couldn't help but look. It never got any better, I had endured enough and walked out. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, save your money."

So I guess we are supposed to believe that it was this ONE alien out of the millions that were living on our planet? Yes there was a lot of realism I suppose to a certain degree but then it also left a lot of unanswered questions. We collected all their weapons but did nothing with the gigantic space ship just hanging in the sky? All of the aliens were kept quarantined in this place that grew to look like a garbage dump. And the aliens would gladly trade over weapons for cans of cat food..? But the weapons only work for the aliens so why weren't the aliens using them? The movie was left open for a sequel but my God they couldn't have put something in THIS movie to make it more interesting??

"RainDogJr","10","5","12","4 March 2011"," District 9 is the capital of every ghetto town
","Saw this one for the very first time back in Christmas Eve 2009, on DVD. Loved it. I finally saw it for the second time today, this time on Blu-Ray. Had the same feeling, certainly. In what is my second favourite 2009 movie (just behind Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"") we have an early sort of warning: ""to everyone's surprise, the ship didn't come to a stop over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago but instead coasted to a halt directly over the city of Johannesburg"". It's like an announcement that basically warn us that this is not going to be our typical alien movie, not the ""aliens coming to kill us all"" kind of thing. Just like its filming style (at first presented as a documentary, as we see footage and post-events interviews, and later as a regular movie), it's a hybrid that successfully adapts classic sci-fi elements to the human condition. We are told that the aliens (the prawns) ""were extremely malnourished, they were very unhealthy they seemed to be aimless"". Like I said, this isn't a very typical setting. So think in every little thing that happens in a slum, or just in society in general and add the sci-fi element of having aliens. It's just great. It's like a new world but really is just everything that happens in our world: the prawns have a strange addiction to cat food, then there you have the humans (the ""Nigerians"", the only human group who lives with the prawns in the District 9) selling or changing for weapons the precious cat food to the prawns. The prawns are stuck in Johannesburg, they get to know the human condition, and they become in the ""people"" from the ghetto. <br/><br/>My uncle said to me, when I told him I had just seen again ""District 9"", ""isn't Wikus -the protagonist of the movie- sort of like the protagonist of ""Brazil""?"". And I was like ""yes, both are like a innocent protagonist, kind of soft, but only at first sight or in real life"". Plus, both characters work for the *system*. So, I didn't really think in a movie like ""Brazil"" after seeing this one, but after my uncle said that to me I immediately recall the words of both Edgar Wright and Richard Kelly when they presented it at the New Beverly Cinema back in January. Their sort of love letter to Terry Gilliam's masterpiece (my personal favourite of him so far) basically focused on how ambitious, how big the project was for its time and how great is visually and how many great visual gags offer to that kind of stuff. And they only mentioned the classic ""not to mention"" to reference to all the sociopolitical commentary of the movie. You can say pretty much the same for ""District 9"". Visually is a spectacular achievement. From character design to special effects, I have only love for it. And it ain't really a huge production ala Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay, as it only cost $30 million (great filmmaking style too). And so, there are lots of things to say when it comes to the ""sociopolitical"" thing of ""District 9"" (*everything is for the guns*). But it may be like ""South Park"" as its creators always say that their one and only job is to make people laugh and if their thing says something more, well good. It may be like ""South Park"" since its said that its director Neill Blomkamp set the movie in Johannesburg simply because he is from there! So all the Apartheid and the rest of ""sociopolitical"" commentary may be incidental or just something Blomkamp sees as secondary, but is nevertheless great. <br/><br/>But in the end, ""District 9"" is a masterpiece because, with its great and really attractive context, it makes you really care for the characters, it's really something emotive and exciting, hell it's just one of the last decade's best!"

It had an interesting back story, as well as a convincing protagonist. It had powerful themes of racial segregation, as well as poverty and pollution.

I did not enjoy it at all. The plot was non believable, the fuel becomes some kind of potion that turns a human into alien? There was no point in the film, at no point did I feel for the main character or the aliens. At some point I felt that I was watching a Disney film because of the interactions with the aliens, it was pretty cheesy. The acting was over the top and the shaky camera was used way too much, I felt like I was watching a long TV commercial that by the end made me feel very nauseous. The last half was just brainless shooting. Yes it had a lot of gore, but the action felt sloppy and the story was crafted very simply, not at all intelligent. The directing wasn't very good at all, no thought was put into it. This is certainly no classic.

","Is this what sci-fi has come to? Does something have to be clichéd, depressing and boring in order to count as excellent sci-fi among the so-called professional movie critics?! District 9 is basically a mish mash of concepts from earlier sci-fi films like Alien Nation, Aliens, Iron Man, and perhaps one or two ideas from the Halo video games thrown in to create something that is far less than spectacular.<br/><br/>Some of the ideas are good, but the movie is more an exercise in sadism than it is in entertainment. Aliens are persecuted, brutally murdered, people suffer, and basically there is nothing really to enjoy in this movie except maybe the occasional humorous subtitle from the Aliens. The whole film is about racism on the alien level.<br/><br/>I don't know exactly how anybody in their right mind could call a movie that is completely about either killing or persecution a great film. The greatest films IMHO can be viewed by anyone, not just the male demographic aged 18 to 40. If you were to ask me if I liked anything about this movie, I would say that ironically I really liked the very last scene. Until that last scene the movie was totally and needlessly barbaric and sickeningly intolerable in its xenophobic attitudes.<br/><br/>This is not as good as the critics would have you believe, and this movie is certainly not for everybody, and I find the high score on both rottentomatoes and the IMDb here to be totally unwarranted. If that isn't satisfactory, then by all means go see it for yourself and see what I'm talking about."

"Magic_Lantern","10","4","9","10 September 2009"," A riveting, original and exceptional sci-fi movie
","District 9 absolutely outstanding in almost every respect. Telling the tale of an atypical alien invasion, the plot fitted the documentary style of direction perfectly and was gripping right from the opening scenes. The story was truly original with a fascinating twist on the typical War of the Worlds/Independence Day modern sci-fi movie. It was remarkable, gripping and thought-provoking, which I believe is becoming increasingly rare in modern cinema.<br/><br/>District 9 avoids modern clichés such as fast-paced plotting and relentless over-editing, instead focusing on plot and character development with a superb dose of action to conclude the film. The film, set in South Africa, features an entirely South African cast of unknowns but was particularly well performed. The score was excellent and was appropriately avoided in the more documentary-style segments of the film to offer a more realistic tone. Similarly, the direction, particularly of the action sequences, was superb; this is even more impressive considering the relatively small budget of the film.<br/><br/>Every once in a while, but not very often, I come out of the cinema feeling truly stunned by a movie. For the fist time in 2009, this happened to me after watching District 9. I struggle to pick out any significant flaws in this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it.<br/><br/>10/10."
"Robert_duder","10","4","9","4 September 2009"," Stunning...one of the most brilliant sci-fi films ever. It will be under rated!!
","I think the latter part of 2009 will almost certainly show some really interesting science fiction films including my highly anticipated Surrogates (drooling for this release.) District 9 looked interesting and in the little I had seen on it I had the wrong impression entirely of the plot of the movie. I thought District 9 was about Aliens landing in the future and basically imprisoning human beings. This was completely not even close to the plot. Aliens crash land against their wishes on earth in an alternate time line earth in the eighties. The humans usher the Aliens into a small ghetto type area where essentially their social climate erupts into crime and disease. There is without a doubt some social message here but all of that aside the movie is downright brilliant. Full of action, and drama, and emotion and humor the movie is a nonstop thrill ride. Made on a relatively low budget of thirty million the special effects are spot and brilliantly done. While there aren't a lot of so called ""battle scenes"" the ones that are there are just eye dropping and brilliant. The story, the direction, the action and every other part of the film just falls into place to create one of the most entertaining movies of the summer and it has heart and intelligence to boot.<br/><br/>Sharlton Copley is apparently a newcomer to the big screen, this being his only acting credit. That only makes his performance as by the book alien relations office all the more impressive. His character goes through incredible changes physically and emotionally and his performance is mind blowing. Some IMDb reviews call it Oscar worthy and while that is probably very true it would never happen given the mainstream quality of District 9. Still he has an incredibly fascinating character and is just simply incredible to watch. On top of that he is basically a one man show when it comes to this film. Yes there are supporting characters but they are very small roles all around and the only other characters that have any substantial screen time are the aliens themselves. I'm sure the lack of actual actors in the film made the budget restraints better for the special effects.<br/><br/>Director and writer Neill Blomkamp is fairly new to the big screen as well but clearly if you look back to his live action Halo shorts you will see the man is potentially a visionary director and loves science fiction and that will most certain bode well in the future if he is kept on to director the ""Halo"" film. District 9 is entirely his baby and he is brilliant. The world he creates is so incredibly realistic and the documentary style shooting is not overused like it has been in the past with films like Cloverfield or Quarantine. He uses it rather to immerse you into the story and then doesn't hesitate to return to a more stylish and normal film style. He gives the Aliens personality, and heart and emotion whether it be anger or sadness, hatred or love and the one thing you will be left wishing for is more on the intriguing character of Christopher Johnson (the Alien father trying to do nothing more than save his son.) District 9 begs for another installment and yet no one should touching this except Neill Blomkamp because this is entirely his creation. Science fiction fans, action, horror fans you must absolutely see this film...it will be under rated most certainly and yet is probably one of the best films of 2009 hands down. Absolutely breath taking!! 10/10"
"sinncross","9","4","9","28 August 2009"," A fascinating delight ...
","After over 20 years of keeping a mysterious alien race, referred to as Prawns, in check in an area known as District 9 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is given the job of relocating the aliens away from the city so as to ensure that they pose no threat to the citizens of Johannesburg. But during a raid on one of the alien's shack, Wikus comes into contact with a substance that causes him to become the number one person of interest throughout the world.<br/><br/>District 9 is a remake of sorts of a short film from 2005 known as Alive in Joburg, and is filmed in two manners; the traditional film-making process and a documentary approach. The latter is mostly used for the first arc of the films narrative. It combines interviews and news reports, with documentary segments relating to Wikus and the relocation work he will be doing with the aliens. This film perspective is masterfully controlled by Neill Blomkamp and the integration of, and eventual change to, a more formalized camera work seems effortless and natural. This also provides the narrative with some added depth: instead of a linear exposition of Wikus and his reassessment of the whole situation, the audience is provided with history prior to the events taking place, even recalling vital information as to why the aliens are informally referred to as 'Prawns'. However the greatest strength of the narrative is how it parallels Apartheid. While the events in District 9 could relate to events such as the Holocaust, it is quite obvious that Apartheid is the core starting point of interest. This even goes as far as replicating the xenophobia which is strife within South Africa. For instance, replacing the African majority being subjugated against, are the technologically superior aliens. And even though the film is science-fiction, great strides have been taken to make the material as real as possible. These include the poor living conditions; an almost picture perfect representation of shacks through South Africa; and even finer details such as the African SWAT member calling Wikus by the term 'boss'. These are not just randomized stereotypes, but rather real life occurrences of South African living. This combined with the well structured story results in an entertaining and engaging narrative. However there are some points of interest which seem to get very little attention and any audience without an understanding of Apartheid might be feel something is amiss. For instance, the aliens who are clearly superior to humans seem to show little resistance to the poor conditions they are forced to live with. This may appear as a plot-hole, but essentially is only mimics how the White apartheid government were able to exert control over every other racial group, even when they were outnumbered nearly ten-to-one by the African population.<br/><br/>Continuing the believability of the South African context is the actors department, most notably Sharlto Copley who uses an incredibly authentic Afrikaans accent. Wikus is clearly a second language English speaker and Sharlto replicates this well, combining his characters need to speak English with instances of resorting to Afrikaans when swearing. Sharlto is only a first time actor in District 9, which is incredible to note considering how believable his acting is. Wikus goes from being a jerk to desperately fearful for his own life because of how the odds change against him. Regardless of how Wikus develops, Sharlto conveys his character with great realism. The remaining cast are all essentially secondary, and while they perform good jobs of keeping the level of acting high, they do at times falter a bit, but thankfully very rarely.<br/><br/>There is no nudity and sexual activities are only talked about and on a rare basis. Language is strong and consistent with a variety of expletives being used with the F-word uttered at least around 70 - 90 times. Most of these are spoken by Wikus and in Afrikaans, but considering how the F-word sounds similar in both Afrikaans and English, it is not difficult to know what is being said. The language is contextually fit though there is the odd scene where it does feel a bit too much or unnecessary. The intensity of violence matches that of the language with some fairly graphic scenes. Granted many of the deaths happen at a very quick pace but people are essentially vaporized into bloody matter or hacked apart, and this does not even account for the many instance of gunfights and psychosocial cruelty which takes place. Unlike the language at times, the violence is very fitting for contextual purposes in order to emphasis the brutality that existed during Apartheid and even in current day South Africa. South Africa is a violent country, and Neill Blomkamp does not shy away from this.<br/><br/>Both cinematography and the CGI are stunning. Neill Blomkamp is slightly experimental at times, such as filming from just above the barrel of a gun. He never does so frequently, but they surprisingly work. Another factor which is nicely executed are the action sequences which are viewable enough for the action to appreciated, but also slightly frantic to heighten the atmosphere. Accompanying this is some stellar CGI which blends into reality very well: the alien mother ship is the best example as it appears so natural while hovering over Johannesburg.<br/><br/>District 9 is being heralded as one of the best science fiction films to ever be showcased and its not difficult to understand why: it has a mature and exciting narrative, even if unclear at times, which brings about enough material to further the created universe in many directions. With a brilliant example of acting by Sharlto Copley, fascinating cinematography from Neill Blomkamp, high quality CGI, and engaging violence, District 9 is one of the most exciting films of recent years with only a few hitches. And as for this year, it easily relegates other recent blockbusters to the levels of mediocrity they deserve."
"teldrassil99","4","4","9","23 August 2009"," Setting human-prawn relations back by several centuries
","Much hype (too much hype) has gone before, and unfortunately this film fails to deliver.<br/><br/>Yes, the CGI is quite good (really, with Wiki-wiki-wild-wild Weta and PJ involved, what do you expect?).<br/><br/>Yes, the action scenes are sometimes compelling.<br/><br/>But sadly, there is also 2 hours of footage, which feels more like 4. Because, let's face it, the story is just not very interesting.<br/><br/>Oooooh, let's have a clever commentary on racism. Let's use aliens instead of an actual suppressed group of people, because that will make it more original. It'll be ground-breaking sci-fi... No, wait. This all sounds strangely familiar! Worst of all, although this movie appears to be trying to make a statement about racism (and most reviews actually buy into this!) it manages to include its very own racist overtones. As Blomkamp goes out of his way to show us again and again, Nigerians are either gangsters or hookers. And no matter which of these two professions they may be pursuing, they are universally uneducated and superstitious, believing that by consuming their enemies, they can absorb their power.<br/><br/>Even the supposed hero is racist (although apparently he is more strongly biased against aliens than Nigerians), and blatantly so at the start of the movie. Sadly, he never grows to overcomes his views, only finally working with some aliens because of self-interest, rather than any sort of recognition that his prejudices might have been founded on ignorance and closed-mindedness.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie wasn't utterly awful, but it was rather boring and misguided. I wish I'd bought myself a prawn cocktail instead. And I don't even like prawns."

","Firstly, just wanted to clarify that fact.<br/><br/>This movie has it's flaws, but it is a sure 9 on a scale of one to ten. Realistic, gritty, gripping, unnerving, unsettling, frantic, energetic, amazingly well executed. Wow, many, many pluses to this film! WHOA! I do, however, as a proud Canadian, not only tip my hat to Neill but his buddies at the Vancouver Film School. Too many people believe that since Peter Jackson has produced this film that it's WETA behind the CG.<br/><br/>It isn't.<br/><br/>The effects in this movie astonish one with their near-seamless integration to the actualities taking place. Really, really incredible.<br/><br/>I loved the believability of this film, and it even had some heart.<br/><br/>Grisly, yes, but not for it's own sake.<br/><br/>This movie really lingered with me a lot.

"akkoziol","9","4","9","20 August 2009"," Unique story, AWESOME frags, regular actors, chunks of other movies = One of a kind film
","So I am going to say what a lot of other people have said about this movie without revealing too much of the plot or fawning over how much I liked this movie. Yes, Billy, it is a unique story and nothing like I've seen ever before. I also have to dispel the whole ""racism"" thing that many have said is in this movie, that's total pap. I suppose if you REALLY wanted to stretch it, some of the signs in the movie that say ""Humans Only"" or that have the alien with the circle-and-slash (/) ""No"" marked through them, then it's an allusion to the ""Whites Only"" of the south in the KKK days. MAYBE I can see that. In any case, that's within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie and is more a visual plot device and NOTHING MORE. Sorry, no Billy Bob rednecks running around with nooses doing lynchings. The growing tensions between the Prawns and the people of Johannesburg causes riots and could be akin to the race riots of the 1960s. Allegory, yes. Overt racism? Come on, give me a break.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is an amalgam of a lot of movies that I've seen in the past with elements taken out of them and mashed up to make this movie. Remember Alien Nation from the 80s? A bunch of Aliens show up on earth with nowhere to go and nothing to do, they integrate into society but soon enough decline into the same sad state as regular humanity? I saw a smattering of that movie here along with the desperate, hardscrabble world of (insert your post-apocalypse movie here), the non-stop sense of what-the-heck-is-going-on from a movie like Cloverfield, and a bit of Bizarro-world mixed in with a Kafkaesque piece of Clock World Orange's character Alex. Maybe an anti-Alex? I'm also thinking a pinch of Enemy Mine plot elements thrown in for those astute enough to pick them out as the story progresses into the 2nd half of the movie. I see pieces and elements of ALL these movies in there.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with the main character talking to the viewer and is this normal work-a-day guy from MNU (Multi-National United) who's getting a promotion to lead the Prawns to a new settlement away from Johannesburg's ""District 9"" because of the social tensions. Tasked with the huge job of transplanting and eviction (Trail of Tears anyone?), our main character finds it easier said than done and gets massive resistance from the Prawns and crushing pressure from the government, military, MNU, and those with other hidden agendas (MNU). The plot just takes off from there and I won't reveal any more as you should see it for yourself.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work and work well is that it's presented in the same continuous-shot manner as movies like 28 Days Later, Cloverfield, and Blair Witch without intentional editing or shots being contrived. While some may argue it doesn't work well for those other movies, this movie presents itself almost as an unedited documentary on the attempt to move the Prawns out of District 9 and how it doesn't goes as planned. Don't take that to mean that this movie is boring, it's not.<br/><br/>I also have to agree with what some others have said about the CG in this movie. It is not intrusive, mechanical, or in any way two dimensional. The alien characters are very believable and the composition always blends in well with the movie. It's not actors standing in front of a green-screen talking to dead air and the aliens are pasted in later in post-production. It is entirely fluid. I almost wonder if the fact that they used regular actors is why this movie and CG aliens was pulled off with such ease. Not gratuitous, just well executed. Of all the junk that came out this summer, this one was a sleeper. I loved it. Whether it qualifies as Sci-Fi will be up to others to debate. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, when the bad guys get it with the alien guns: KABOOM! FRAG! FRAG! FRAG! It was worth it alone for those scenes."

These aliens don't invade, except in the way Cubans invade Florida when they try to escape Cuba: barely alive, hungry and dehydrated. <br/><br/>This is a movie about racism, class-ism, corporate greed, governmental stupidity, and the lowly preying upon the lowlier, but it is also about hope, love, and redemption. It has much to say about the absurdness with which we underestimate one another, and the way a few greedy bastards ruin it for all. Manipulation of everyone for personal gain is the rule, and that is accurate in our world today. In that respect, this movie is non fiction. <br/><br/>But as I said, no one wants to go to the movies to see the truth. Even it is as well made and compelling as this one is."

","Like many people, I enjoyed this movie, but there was several one big plot problems that kept me from giving the movie a higher rating:<br/><br/>1) The aliens have an arsenal of many different sophisticated weapons beyond our technology, but never use any of them to demand better living conditions. Instead they trade them all for cat food. <br/><br/>2) The ship seemingly doesn't function for three months where the aliens are starving before humans go and cut a hole in its hull. Why does the ship magically work more than 20 year later?<br/><br/>3) It seems unlikely one alien and his son could run the whole ship.<br/><br/>4) Why isn't a large section of JSB, located directly under the ship, worried that that ship may loose power can land on top of them?<br/><br/>5) The smart alien and his son spent 20 years finding pieces of their own technology that contain a fluid they use to get their ""control module"" back off the ground. Why are any pieces of the ship missing? There is no mention of the command module being damaged, nor the main ship.<br/><br/>6) It seems unlikely so many of the aliens would be so unintelligent. If so few of the aliens have the knowledge of how things work, how can they manage 100's of thousands of the dumb aliens along with the ship?<br/><br/>7) How can over 1 million aliens, that are larger than us, exist on that ship--it doesn't appear nearly large enough.<br/><br/>8) It seems unlikely that humans and aliens would so easily be able to understand each other's language. We can't even figure out Dolphin-speak let alone an extraterrestrial language."

"SAVA1224","8","4","9","14 August 2009"," Certainly one of the best Sci-Fi this year, possibly of the last century, maybe of all time
","Many sci-fi/action films have tried but very few have really pulled it off in so many ways, District 9 is that film....finally Sci-FI is back in its greatest form!!<br/><br/>District 9 is possibly one the greatest visions of earth-space contact in memory. It is so much more than ""just another alien movie"" it works on levels of action, character, emotion, and social commentary.<br/><br/>The mockumentary style (which is carefully and resourcefully utilized) is often an overused tool that often masks lack of character, plot, and story. Here, it is brilliantly interspersed as a tone device and character piece. It manages to dodge the typical ""shaky-camera-syndrome"" of Blair Witch and Cloverfield while the outlook manages to deliver intensity and appropriate tone to the first act.<br/><br/>Certainly the most disturbing is the all-too accurate depiction of governmental reaction, irritation, exploitation, and fear of the aliens. Example being the use of ""relocation camps"", where they promise the aliens will be more ""comfortable"" and ""free to flourish"". The social interaction of humans with the aliens, bartering, co-existing etc is intriguing as we often have wondered how/if two species could co-exist.<br/><br/>The film manages elements and tones on par with Alien, Terminator, Total Recall, The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) while depicting the struggles to co-exit and instinctual interactions of The Killing Fields, The Deer Hunter, and Black Hawk Down. Finally, the film manages to create the human-alien connection, empathy, and emotion of films like Starman,Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T.<br/><br/>The depiction and action of the aliens is brilliant part CGI, part live action. They really become an integral part of the story and provide a plethora of glimpses into their social and psychological adaption to life on Earth. Most interesting is the instinctive employment of violence and intimidation by the humans versus the lack of understanding and little knowledge of it by the aliens.<br/><br/>Above this all, District 9 manages to become a truly reflection of classic sci-fi, action, and a gritty depiction of social interaction, and humans' ""print"" on anything that opposes or bewilders it."
"HellBoy13","10","4","9","14 August 2009"," Of Robocop's violent satire and anime's surreal presentation...
","*mild spoilers* (do not continue if you want full wow factor, until you see the movie)<br/><br/>This was amazing. First of all, there are no lulls in the film. There's either mystery, when we wonder what's going on, or tension, or dazzlement in the form of action or effects. <br/><br/>The effects were amazing. Bladerunner and Alien happened at night. Most other sci-fi films happen in the black of space. Most of this movie happens in the full sun of South Africa. The CGI lighting was so perfect and the action so fast-paced that it was hard to tell there was any CGI at all. It's all done in documentary style, mostly shaky camera, mixed in with news footage and security camera footage so it just feels real.<br/><br/>The way humans treat the aliens is a chilling satire on racism, the way I've seen in 1950's history books in America. Whether this is reminiscent of present-day Johannesburg I don't know. The poor naive hero is so calm and blasé about all the violence and racism that occurs around him, as he shows off to the documentary film crew. Plot-wise, fans of sci-fi in movies and literature will see the influences of Clarke's ""Childhood's End"", Veerhoven's ""Robocop"", and the Alien Nation TV series. But, gosh, that CGI was just amazing. If just for the sight of a live action MechWarrior, you've got to see this thing. In fact, the entire movie had the feel of a live action Japanese anime. Fans of RoboCop, AlienNation, anime, & MechWarrior have GOT to see this movie.<br/><br/>THIS is the way sci-fi SHOULD be, with technology as an everyday occurrence that's taken for granted by all but the audience. It's like an ""Airplane"" joke that happens in the background. Technology and effects are not in the front in this movie. They're in the background, and they still wow us, but the story takes the lead. Awesome movie all around. I can't wait for the inevitable sequel."
"johnstrash1","5","3","6","13 February 2011"," Gobs of unanswered questions
","District 9 is a good example of what happens when filmmakers are more concerned about their political message than they are making a good movie. Not to say that it is totally bad, but there are too many questions without sensible answers. I've listed some, but not all that I could come up with:<br/><br/><ul><li>Why did the space ship end up where it did? Was it simply a transport for sub-par aliens with the goal of just dumping them off on another planet? I suppose this is an analogy of humans being packed into boats and shipped off to another country that doesn't want them either. I would be fine with this, but it is never adequately explored in the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Were the aliens criminals or just really stupid? They briefly addressed this, but they never actually find out despite having learned their language.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Once humans breached the hull of the spacecraft, why did they not set up shop after the aliens were brought down to the surface? Wouldn't there be a permanent research group of some kind in there?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why is a multinational corporation (MNU) put in charge of this as opposed to some new multi-governmental body or even the UN? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why did MNU put a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Basil Fawlty in charge of the eviction process?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If the aliens are unintelligent rejects from another planet, why did they get a big honkin arsenal of weapons, including one that turns living flesh into red pudding in less than a second?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After the live film documentation of the eviction process, why is the rest of the movie still shot the same way as if someone was there following the main character with a camera?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How come the fluid that is used to power the spaceship also mutates people into aliens if it sprays in their face?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Were the aliens originally 'prawns' or did they get a blast of the same magic fluid and transform from something else too?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why were tribal gangs allowed to trade cat food for advanced alien weaponry unchecked?</li></ul><br/><br/>I know there are some messages in here, like big corporations are evil, humanity is still made up of insensitive barbarians and big men with guns are mean, but how about a little subtlety? Not to mention the obvious reference to apartheid since the whole thing took place in South Africa. This could have been a much better movie had they been concerned about the quality of the story as much as they were the quantity of the political statements.<br/><br/>I don't want to say it is a total loss though. The overall concept was interesting. And the amount of different alien weapon types obviously took some time to come up with. I'll even go as far as to say that I still somewhat liked the main character, but just not all the time. I could also comment on the quality of the special effects, but today that should be a given in a modern motion picture. I guess the upshot is, see Distrct 9 for the fun of it, but don't take it too seriously. You'll just end up with a list of questions that should have been answered."
"rooprect","8","3","6","4 December 2010"," Best scifi satire since Starship Troopers
","There have been a few great scifi satires in the history of cinema: Robocop, Starship Troopers, Alphaville, Zardoz, Frankenhooker. The scifi genre is perfect for satire because it inherently brings a degree of fantasy and surrealism, setting the stage for anything-goes.<br/><br/>You can choose to view District 9 as a straightforward action story. But I think its beauty lies in its social commentary which is done through hilarious satire, just like the aforementioned films. For starters, the ""hero"" of the story is a sweater-vest-wearing nerd, not a musclebound, stone-jawed stud. This should be a tipoff that the presentation isn't meant to be taken literally; it's tongue-in-cheek. Next, we see that the movie takes on a ""mockumentary"" feel, a lot like the great comedies Spinal Tap or Waiting for Guffman. Again this catches us off guard and encourages us to laugh at things that would otherwise be shocking.<br/><br/>That's a good thing because the story, if seen beneath its thinly veiled metaphor for racial segregation and government sponsored apartheid in South Africa, would be pretty damn depressing. Enter the satire: the storytelling device through which we can tolerate such disturbing and shocking themes and still be entertained. Archie Bunker taught us this.<br/><br/>Like I said, you can ignore everything I'm saying and instead enjoy this as an action flick; it has plenty of hair-raising, seat-gripping tension for that (and who couldn't love guns that make people explode like bloated sacks of ketchup?). But what sets this film above the average is its ability to combine its futuristic action & story with a very contemporary social problem. And it does this while giving us a fun ride.<br/><br/>I have 2 minor gripes. One is that the nonstop barrage of sarcasm & dark satire can be very taxing after a while, like watching a 2-hour marathon of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", you eventually want to punch someone. My other gripe is that the shaky camera, while adding an interesting sense of realism, can eventually induce dizziness, vertigo and vomiting, especially when you're watching scenes of a guy acting dizzy, vertiginous and vomitous. Also, the scenes of meat lockers and hunks of putrid, unidentifiable flesh on the chopping block are enough to turn anyone vegetarian for an evening. Overall it can be an exhausting experience, definitely not your shiny, happy Spielberg fare (E.T. would crap his pants in this world), but I guess it was the director's intent to convey the disturbing conditions he himself was intimately acquainted with, having grown up in Johannesburg in the 80s. I do recommend that you familiarize yourself with South Africa's history if you really want to get the most out of this movie. Then you will see, as with Starship Troopers, that this is not a fantasy about spaceships and bug-eyed aliens, but rather, it's a very contemporary allegory about our own human fears & prejudices."

","I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because 60% of the movie was fantastic and after that the movie kinda just dropped a good idea. I watched the movie and was falling in love from the atmosphere of the movie. The whole concept was really cool. Right up to about the 40-50 min marker I started to lose it. It seemed like they went to high up with a good idea and tried to hit the ground as fast as they could in a certain time frame to reach a conclusion. The fact they had the soldier that never died, the indecisive save him or not save him, the ridiculous battle scenes and just the obvious visual that the end of the movie was meant to be ostentatious. It seemed the director spent a huge pretty penny just to, ""ooo and ah"" people right at the end. Who knows, maybe just wanted to use Peter Jackson's pretty toys."
"secondtake","8","3","6","8 February 2010"," Wow. Hilarious and unsettling and deeply original. Cat food anyone?
","District 9 (2009)<br/><br/>Aliens in Johannesburg. A lot of them. And humans, without the usual fear of invasion from outer space, but a more normal fear of those who are Other, just plain different. What do you do with a million uncouth strangers who can't even speak English? Exploit them of course, and put them in a giant tent city. And make them victims of a modern bureaucracy, too, and ask them to sign papers for their own eviction from a squalid camp they never asked for in the first place. I'm surprised they didn't think to tax them, too.<br/><br/>Yes, this is District 9: inventive, preposterous, crude, grandiose, silly, disturbing. In spurts and surges, with talking head experts and creaky sci-fi effects, District 9 downright crazy, too. Above all, though, it's a relief. It isn't a Hollywood version of the same clever idea, and though I might like to see that slicker, and probably more sentimental movie, this one is a rare divergence, valuable for its diverging. Unlike many European films and their sibling American Indies, this South African production aims high, and big. And it pulls off some happy combination of absurd and profound in an entertaining, unpolished hybrid. It creaks and groans are unfortunate, and the plot could use some depth, but the whole situation, and the suspension of believability required, are fabulous.<br/><br/>It's worth saying, at the start, that the monsters (of which there are an unreasonable 1.8 million during the main part of the movie) are unappealing, grotesque, violent things, vaguely human in shape, but eating raw goats heads and, their favorite treat, cans of can food (including the can, it seems, or at least without a can opener). But if this is enough for some viewers to wish them all dead, or at least wish them all to go home, it doesn't seem to bother the human population. Maybe this looks like small potatoes compared to Apartheid, a parallel lost on many younger and most outsider viewers. But the crux of the movie is the apparent kindness of humanity to help the aliens in their time of trouble (their spaceship broke down).<br/><br/>The plot doesn't quite devolve into a good guy bad guy movie, though there is a particular bumbling, lovable hero at the center of it. It does resort to half an hour of chasing and shooting toward the end, with lots of effects not far removed from a contemporary video game. The fact that you are rooting for the aliens by then should strike you as odd, and in fact it might strike you as a parallel to a truly Hollywood movie with similar threads (stereotypes of aliens and macho humans battling for survival), have you heard of Avatar? But give this one a chance to get to you more poignantly (with less of the sweeping oh my effect of more expensive movies) and you'll maybe get what's good here."
"zorbear","8","3","6","31 January 2010"," Slow start but worth the slog
","Last week I picked up this DVD because I never got around to catching this movie while it was at the theaters, and I'd read that it was worth watching. Plus, it was being pushed by Peter Jackson (""Lord of the Rings""), so I had high hopes for it. The trailers didn't give away much, but did sort of give you a clue what the story line was, so I had an idea what I was going to see when I popped the DVD into the player.<br/><br/>And I was wrong on all counts. The story was nothing like I thought it would be, and the beginning was a let-down. The movie started off very slow, and, except for the computer-generated aliens, looked like it was made by a couple of kids using their parent's home movie camcorder. I knew that it was a low budget flick, but the write-ups had said the director achieved great things on very little money. After ten minutes I was just about to turn it off, when a little voice inside said ""Give it a chance."" So I did.<br/><br/>After another five or ten minutes, I noticed that I was becoming interested in spite of myself. The next time I noticed anything, the final credits were rolling. No, I didn't fall asleep, I was simply that riveted to the TV screen. I'm not sure if I breathed during the last thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Now, first off, this is a very violent and gory movie, and definitely not for everyone. But the story it told has stayed with me. I keep thinking about it - not about the gore or the special effects, but about what the writer was trying to say. You see, the movie was filmed in South Africa by South Africans. And the story is all about how people in power tend to marginalize people that aren't. That covers not only apartheid, but so very much more.<br/><br/>The story is about how some aliens got stranded here when their giant spaceship broke down. They ""landed"" just outside Johannesburg, so the local authorities gave them a small plot of land (district 9) to stay on until they died out. Unfortunately, they multiplied instead. Inside this reservation, makeshift shanties sprang up (i.e., a slum), and enterprising humans figured out a way to make a buck off the situation. For example, they sell addictive substances (in this case, cat food) to the aliens, in exchange for alien gadgets that no one can figure out how to work. They also introduce prostitution, infanticide, and other lovely concepts. As the film opens, almost thirty years have passed, and the government has decided the alien problem is too visible where they are, and besides, it needs that land back. So they're going to forcibly move the aliens to another spot of land, far away from the city. Only not everyone wants to go.<br/><br/>BTW: The disgusting slum in the film was a real slum just outside Johannesburg. A slum left behind when the powers-that-be decided to forcibly move a large population of second-class citizens to a new location, far away from the city. Looks like some things never change..."

","Peter Jackson's claim to fame has already been established with his world renown Classic, 'Lord of the Rings.' His experience and expertise was the impetus behind writer/Director Neill Blokamp's superb film entitled "" District Nine."" If history is any guide to Human behavior it's prominently displaced in this incredible film. The story tells of the events which follow when a rag-tag group of Aliens called Prawns arrive on the Earth seeking refuge. In typical Earth style, they are accepted and settled in a desolated area of Johansburg, South Africa called District Nine. Greeted with interest at first, over time the Earth people's original curiosity is replaced with anger, apathy and resentful disdain. That prejudice results in their host erecting restrictive barrier's, bared wire fences and eventually to imprisonment. The general population is apathetic to their plight, with only the Military taking a definite but collective interest in their alien weaponry. Deciding to move the Alien encampment to a distant location, a relocation commissioner Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) takes a personal, but artificially sympathetic approach to their resettlement, that is until he is contaminated with a strange black fluid and begins to evolve into an Alien. His mutation causes him to realize he has become an outcast like his targets. With the government, the press, the military and a select group of lethal mercenaries out to capture or kill him, things become more serious. Further he discovers an ally in a pair of highly intelligent and compassionate Aliens. The movie is jam packed with fast paced action, explosive confrontations and human complexities and as a result this movie will become a triumph for Neill Blokamp and Christopher Johnson who plays all the Extraterristals. Great entertainment. ****"

After seeing this movie, the only ones that have a shot at getting Best Picture (in my mind) are Avatar and The Hurt Locker. The other two movies are just plan bad.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I buy into all the excitement and high rankings for this movie. I thought the CGI effects were nice, but the storyline took FOREVER to develop which made the movie drag, thank heaven it wasn't a 2 1/2 hour movie. If it would have been that long, I would have wanted to use one of those laser death ray things from the movie on myself. I thought the main character's performance was laughable at best, the aliens looked like over-sized cockroaches and I really felt like I was watching Cloverfield (which was another AWFUL movie) all over again because of the camera work. True the story lines were different but the camera work felt the same.<br/><br/>I do like Sci-Fi films but this one just really didn't do it for me. This is a film that you can get away with seeing just once and then never seeing it again. I'm glad I spent only $3.48 to rent the movie, anymore and I would have felt I was robbed.

"tburke85","8","3","6","18 January 2010"," District A Good Sci-Fi Action Thriller
","District 9 is a good sci-fi action thriller unlike any other but in a good way. It has character development, action, suspense, drama, and some humor to light up the serious mood of the movie from time to time. I can see why many people liked this film after watching it. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp is admirable in making this movie to the big screen with a compelling story and impressive special effects that help bring the film to life. Newcomer Sharlto Copley is effective as the lead bringing a lot of comic relief to his role. He's believable as his character who goes through a major transformation during the course of the movie. The rest of the unknown cast are good in their roles too. The aliens looked realistic like a cross between insects and cockroaches. The special effects are great especially for a small budget independent film including the hovering space craft and the alien weaponry. The bloody brutal violence is well executed which mostly happens toward the second half when the action kicks into high gear. Besides some flaws with the dialogue at times overall District 9 was much better then I thought it would be. I actually enjoyed it more than X-Men Origins Wolverine and Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen which were okay but had many flaws that weighed them down. So if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi action thriller, District 9 is the movie for you. It has character development, action, drama, suspense, some humor, and a very convincing performance by Copley which makes this movie worth the time to watch."
"EchoMaRinE","10","3","6","10 January 2010"," A very unorthodox science fiction
","This is certainly not a normal science fiction we are used to. It is discussing what would happen if unprotected aliens come to earth and need help from us. Off course they would be treated as refugees and in the movie, their possible future is shown. They are treated as garbage, they are put into districts, they are given animal food, they are forced to migrate, they are killed wildly and much more. Some people may find this very provocative and may claim we wouldn't do that but thinking about it, this would exactly be what could happen. It reminds all the suburbs of big cities, filled with people coming from poor countries who are treated almost like this. First put the different to somewhere isolated, restrict their movements, slowly reduce their rights, treat them as natural born criminals, force them to move from their homes, kill them randomly for nonsense reasons and then declare them as the enemy of state. Sounds kind of familiar. This is really the most controversial movie of the year. You won't regret watching it."

","I was very interested in seeing this movie from being a major sci-fi fan but decided to await its DVD release due to the US economy I tend to reserve no theater viewing of any of the films I would enjoy. Plus IMO today's movies aren't overall that great to have to see the week they come out.<br/><br/>Anyway this was a good movie overall - From the camera work except for camera in the bathrooms was a little out of place it had a good take on presenting the story.<br/><br/>The CGI was realistic and the interaction with the live scenes was well done.<br/><br/>The story was okay from a sci-fi perspective it was a nice way to represent the changes that had happened over the last 20 years in the real world of the South Africa area.<br/><br/>For me the worst part was the dialogue, it started soft and clear and the interaction with the aliens was fine, then the f-words started to pick up and this started to make the key dialogue get mumbled as the F-word was more pronounced and more frequent without much stress upon the actors involved. It was if the F-word was became the main language of actors. This was very much disturbing from the lead actor's character who started was a administration clerk and turned into gangster wannabe based upon his dialogue alone.<br/><br/>Yes he was suppose to be stressed, great we got that in the prodding scenes, but his whole dialogue became mostly the F-word than other English swearing. The cool thing about the dialogue was the use of native language words and yet instead of using more of those the F-words became a rhythmic assault to the viewer and because the dialogue was a great part of the style marred the rest of the film for those that were watching this on our home theater."

","Just saw it on DVD. Wow, outstanding low budget flick! Good story reinforced with top notch effects. I could do with less ""documentary"" style movie making, however this movie starts as documentary and moves to cinematic. Aliens and weapon effect animations are outstanding.<br/><br/>The story is about aliens who arrive on earth, their space ship ends up hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa. After 20 years, as second class citizens and because the ""prawns"" don't do well mixing with humans, they are relegated to a slum. The government decides to move all of them farther out of town to a new camp. This is when the hero of the story is exposed to an unknown substance that has a profound effect on his life and in the process reveals an alien plot. I think I'm going to watch it a second time! ;)<br/><br/>Be warned: every other word starts with ""f"" and graphic violence as in dismemberment and people being splattered by alien weapons.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers below---------------------------------<br/><br/>Some have complained about holes in the plot. If you are picky, those critiques could be valid. They did not bother me. Such as why did they come to Earth? An answer is not really required. They like cat food? Alien quirk. They are all morons? No they are not as the plot proves. Some of it can be attributed to inter-species differences and incompatibilities. Why would an unknown substance act as fuel and alter DNA? Their Alien tech merges technology with biology."

","I will save everyone some time here and just say that this movie was excellent - maybe even a little beyond. They did an excellent job of putting the movie together in a very unique way. For sure not your typical science fiction. As other have mentioned, the setting (where the movie takes place) also adds to the interest of this movie. There are some mild attempts of humour with this movie and that was well done too. The special effects were also top notch. The thing I liked the most about this movie is that it seemed as if it really could have happened. (you'll understand when you watch the movie) Another angle the director hits on was the relationships, not only between the officials, but also some of the locals and within the alien community itself. It's something you don't usually see in these types of movies, and when you do, it's usually done in a tacky sort of way. If you were planning on seeing a movie tonight - get out your popcorn or chips or whatever you want, and enjoy what probably was one of the better movies of the decade!"

","I considered many others. The Hurt Locker. Up. Fantastic Mr. Fox. Etc.<br/><br/>District 9 is an unbelievable achievement. Visually, it is mind-blowing. Blade Runner, Dark Knight, 2001, and Clockwork Orange type mind-blowing. 'The 9' takes a social commentary and spins it into one of the most original and thrilling science fiction adventures of our time.<br/><br/>Neil Blokamp jumps forward in movie-making-plausibility and creates something fresh, something new, something cinema needed, and something that shouldn't have been able to be pulled off - and he does it without missing the mark even once.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley breaks through in his big-screen debut as an MNU(Multi-National-United) representative sent to inform the aliens of their re-location. The humans seem to have a limited knowledge of their visiting friends - even though their ship has hovered above Johannesburg for nearly 20 years. Every human act is calculated, spun to their advantage, and the aliens are misunderstood,.. mistreated.<br/><br/>Copley's character, Mr. Van De Merwe, will be forced to re-think his position. He will find out more in a matter of days than the rest of us have in years. He will attempt to save himself and an alien species, and he will come under attack from his own kind.<br/><br/>Each scene is fantastic. As the movie goes from scene to scene the plot dives deeper and deeper, until, just like every good sci-fi film, it would take many years to come to it's actual conclusion. Like 2001, and Logan's Run, District 9 needs another 2 hours and 100 million to finish the story - but its almost better that it doesn't. The future, unknown. The story, incomplete. The moment, breathtaking. The message, the importance of understanding and compassion. District 9 is hands down the best film of 2009 - nothing(that I've seen) comes close.<br/><br/>94/100<br/><br/>Very, and I mean very close to becoming my 12th ""10"".<br/><br/>Careful with some DVD format issues they had with this one - if you can't see the Alien subtitles - DON'T WaTCH IT! Without them it's more like 80/100"
"TxMike","Null","3","6","24 December 2009"," What a different and interesting alien movie.
","I am so aggravated! I just almost finished typing a very complete set of comments here, and accidentally hit a key that wiped it all out!! Well, one more time...<br/><br/>This movie was made by a group very inexperienced in movie-making, and with actors that had little experience in movies. To turn out an effort this good is amazing in itself. It will be interesting to see if the movie maintains its lofty IMDb rating once greater numbers of votes roll in.<br/><br/>The movie begins as a documentary. A very large structure, essentially a very large space ship, has been suspended for some time over the Johannesburg, SA area. Eventually they are able to work their way inside it and find perhaps a million aliens in poor shape. They decide to remove them and relocate them to an area outside the city named ""District 9."" <br/><br/>At first blush the aliens appear to be more like large insects with two legs and two arms. I found myself wondering ""why don't they just exterminate them?"" But as we see more, they have intelligence and a language, and obviously had operated the large ship through space and into our world. One thing removed from the ship were large, powerful weapons which can only be fired by someone (something?) with the alien DNA, so the government is trying to figure out how to make them useful.<br/><br/>The lead actor is South African Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van De Merwe. He is put in charge of the effort, after a few years, to evict the aliens from District 9 and relocate to another area. But while searching one hut he is sprayed with a mysterious fluid, which eventually begins to turn parts of him into alien-like.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is hard to describe, much easier to understand when viewed. Overall a very good, different alien movie."
"reymond810","5","3","6","24 December 2009"," A prequel to district 10
","After going through the rave reviews this film got, I couldn't keep myself from expecting a lot from this film. Sure it is a very good story shown in a very innovative way but i thought the plot became too predictable at the end.<br/><br/>In my opinion it has definitely been made keeping in mind a possible sequel. I view this as more of a TV series than a movie. I thought the plot was too short to be made into a movie this long. It has way too much wasteful action with no point to it. Though the director manages to very beautifully bring out the life of the alien specie he fails to bring in a sense of genuine suspense.<br/><br/>Whatever suspense is in the film has been forced and I believe it destroys the originality.<br/><br/>The rescuing factor was the performance of Sharlto Copley as Wikus van de Merwe. He was exceptional in his role. But another weak factor was the absolute lack of any other character besides the alien and van de Merwe. So he, in a sense carries the entire film on his shoulders, given that the alien can hardly show any expression.<br/><br/>SPOILER : I am expecting a much better sequel to this. But I am not sure how this is going to happen, now that Wikus van de Merwe seems to have become an alien. <br/><br/>But this time i would love to be proved wrong as this is a story with great potential.<br/><br/>Verdict : Don't watch this unless you love sci-fi or have too much time on your hands."
"TheUnknown837-1","6","3","6","23 December 2009"," The explosions, the slimy bugs, the mechanical battle suits, the laser beams — well, they all look good, but we've seen the like before
","There is nothing wrong with making an alien movie. There's nothing wrong with making an action movie either. And there's most certainly nothing wrong with combining these two elements togetherunless you stress the wrong points too much and the good points not enough. And that was the case, for me anyway, with ""District 9."" This is by no means a bad movie, but it contains too much of a been-there, done-that feeling and it's a real shame because the movie's premise contains some strong imagination and a surefire promise, but it doesn't quite deliver. As an action movie, it fulfills its purpose, but as a science-fiction original, it struggles a bit.<br/><br/>I loved the plot of ""District 9."" Twenty years ago, an alien spaceship the size of a city descended over a city in Nigeria and then suspends there for two decades. Scientists manage to get onboard the ship and discover a civilization of intelligent, but helpless insect-like creatures. After the local Nigerians refuse to live with the creatures in peace, they are moved to District 9, sort of their alien ghetto, I guess you could say. The man in charge of District 9 (Sharlto Copley), while trying to serve an eviction notice on the aliens, becomes infected by one of their chemicals and very slowly begins to transform into one of them and thus becomes the subject of a vicious manhunt led by a bug-hating colonel played by David James.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the promise of the premise amplifies the disappointment, I'm afraid, of ""District 9."" From this plot, we expect a strong, original, imagination-packed modern-day science-fiction classic. And during some parts, it displays those qualities. But the filmmakers made a mistake. Instead of developing these truly fascinating elements, they decided to in the end just degenerate the movie into a standard action movie where blood is sprayed and things blow up with no point and with no purpose. And as a result, we get that been there, done that feeling. The special effects? They're as good as they could be. This is just the sort of movie to see with surround sound. The pyrotechnics and CGI are absolutely fabulous with very few faults. But then again, good special effects in Hollywood is simply a package order. The explosions, the slimy bugs, the mechanical battle suits, the laser beams—well, they all look good, but we've seen the like before.<br/><br/>What would have really made this movie wonderful would have been to explore the nature of these aliens, for they are a lot more interesting (and a lot more likable) than the stereotypical characters that populate the cast. The movie does take the liberty of giving them some development, but not nearly enough I'm afraid. It just tends to resort to blowing things up and painting more CGI on the screen.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me was that there were no interesting characters. Sharlto Copley does a fine job playing the protagonist, but he's left to moan, weep, and curse instead of fleshing out what could have been a fascinating character. He doesn't have any real connection to his wife or to the aliens or to the bad guys, who I'm afraid, are so stereotypical that they might even be insulting. There was one character in particular, a Nigerian played by Eugene Khumbanyiwa who simply drove me crazy. And it's okay, I suppose, to have a menacing-looking Australian play the bad colonel, but to have everybody in his command be vulgar-happy Australians might also generate some disappointment in the audience.<br/><br/>Once again, ""District 9"" is not a bad movie. It has some strong action scenes and if that's all you're looking for, you won't be disappointed. Me, I was wanting something a little more powerful with a little more imagination. I want Hollywood to realize that although audiences can enjoy an action movie, they can enjoy one more if it focuses on more than just blowing things up and showing off the latest special effects package in ILM.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5/4"
"Anyoneatnowhere","9","3","6","19 November 2009"," Why can't they make more movies like this?
","I'm not a science fiction fan at all so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about and being too generous by giving this movie a 9/10. But this really is one of the most stunning movies I saw this year. It's so weird (in a good way) that you can't help but applaud the filmmaker for having the guts to make a movie like this.<br/><br/>The film is set in an alternate reality and starts by telling us of an alien spaceship that stalled over Johannesburg, SA in the 1980s. Nothing emerges from the ship so the SA govt sends a team to explore it and they find it filled with aliens. They're malnourished and in need of attention so they bring them down and set up a community for them to live in. This area soon becomes a militarised slum (District 9).<br/><br/>Skip forward about 20 years and we are introduced to Wikus van de Merwe who is in charge of relocating aliens to a new area. Legally, the govt. needs the signed consent of the aliens to move them and it's his job to get their signature and deal with any unruly aliens. Things don't go as planned and Wilke is forced to face up to some ugly realities. <br/><br/>The story, special effects and message are all great. It switches between ""documentary"" footage and the feature film to give it a sense of authenticity and there's also a great sense of humour, which caught me off guard but didn't seem out of place. <br/><br/>What I loved about this movie was how realistic it felt. Every other alien movie you've seen has a showdown between the two races and it's either us or the alien race as the aggressor. This movie treats the aliens more as a different race than as dangerous visitors. Initially, there are no fireworks, no display of superiority, instead the showdown is in the form of a bizarre refugee crisis as South Africans are forced to coexist with their new neighbours. <br/><br/>There are some slow parts during the second half, which fu cks with the pacing but these are forgivable flaws in a movie this unique. <br/><br/>Easily one of the best movies I saw this year."
"Maxrepooc","8","3","6","13 November 2009"," Like Cloverfield, but more engaging, satisfying, and cinematic!!!
","District 9 is filmed similarly to movies like Cloverfield and Quarantine, with a very non-fiction feel. I've seen Cloverfield, but not Quarantine, so I recall that Cloverfield was meant to create the illusion of one of its main characters holding the actual camera that presents this movie like a homemade video, but this is not so for District 9 even though it still has some of that ""Reality TV"" feel to it, if you will. District 9 starts out clearly as a mockumentary, but as the action unfolds, it breaks this form, but does not do away with it, simply because the main character has to begin his adventure, which we see playing out in as close to real-time as possible. So, this is a movie that looks like a documentary, unfolds similarly to a more conventional narrative, and which uses cinematography that includes camera angles that you would see used in newscasting or interviews, security surveillance footage, and more conventional continuous presentation, but which is typically called ""shakycam"" when it doesn't have a legitimate reason to look so DIY, like when the character Wikus first goes on the run and is, when you think about it, all by his lonesome even though the camera is still right there next to him, so how is that supposed to be explained? At least Cloverfield had a consistent reason for looking shaky throughout the entire film: the government found the tape in the rubble; it was a home movie! I'll continue using Cloverfield as an example because of the two film's technical similarities, contemporary status, and because I like both J.J. Abrams and Neill Blomkamp, who I feel are both going to bring us a lot of great things throughout their lives.<br/><br/>I think that both of these films present good modernizations of stories we're all ready familiar with. Cloverfield is re-hash of the Godzilla idea, which if you read about on the Internet will show to be a metaphor for the destruction and fear caused by the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan in World War 2. Godzilla was a matter of Japanese identity, but since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Americans now also have a similar situation to find a new identity in the face of so much change, and fear, I say. So, this kind of monster movie applies to us and Cloverfield is very heavy-handed in its presentation of this fear via a singular image in the film, the wall of dust rushing toward the protagonists as a building collapses in the background because the monster tripped over it or something.<br/><br/>Appreciating this heavy-handedness in Cloverfield, I commend District 9 for having a more positive message instead of creating only a spectacular thrill ride, which it also does create and in ways much cooler i.e. with awesome sci-fi tech. Firstly, the film doesn't take place in New York City, but in Johannesburg, South Africa, which is not explained in the context of the film, but which has an allegorical meaning because of the Apartheid injustices that occurred there in history, the aliens in this movie face racial segregation also, in the titular district. Well, if the movie is a sort of allegory, then it must be recognized that Apartheid officially ended in South Africa, so there is a necessary light at the end of the tunnel for the characters whereas in Cloverfield, well no one knows if the world will ever be free of terrorism. Indeed, at the end of Cloverfield, after the monster has been bombed to supposed death, a whispered piece of audio on the tape seems to say, ""It's still alive"" However, I do recognize that racism does still exist in the world and probably in South Africa, the ties that bind can be cut, but after being so tight for so long, they leave indentations.<br/><br/>Secondly, when you watch District 9 you will see that it is of course about change away from what is and a desire to change back to what was. So, it also presents an ambiguity about change, definitely on the individual level and maybe even on the societal level, which makes the film more interesting than Cloverfield because its debatable what kind of change is good and what kind of change is bad. So, that's why I think D9's story is more engaging than Cloverfield's.<br/><br/>I think the acting is good in District 9. Sharlto Copley's Wikus Van DeMerwe is a really strong character in a different way than a traditional action hero. He's a lovable geek and a basically stand-up person who is put into an extraordinary situation. I'm reminded of Lieutenant Ripley, these character's indignations and emotions are so much more genuine and concerned and outraged than say those of a physically huge male character that I relate more to their plight's, they're my size in body and in mind.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp is a fan of the cinematography (cinematographer: Trent Opalach) that he uses in District 9. I don't think he chose it just for this movie because if you watch the Halo: Landfall Trilogy, directed by Neill Blomkamp, you'll see it again in that project in fine form. Other than that, I don't know what to say about Blomkamp's directing.<br/><br/>I did read that Blomkamp's short film Alive In Joburg received many accolades for featuring excellent visual effects, probably due to what I also read of his background as a professional animator, which caught the eye of Peter Jackson, hence ""Peter Jackson Presents""; District 9 is the feature length adaptation of Alive In Joburg, which can be viewed on YouTube. The visuals effects in District 9 are the best illusions you'll see in the movies today, but don't forget that Avatar comes out December 18, 2009."

District 9 is basically crisis of an alien arrival to Johannesburg South Africa and its effects on everything after two decades. But unlike a stereotypical evil aliens bent on destruction of humanity and taking over the planet ( do sci-fi writers or audience ask themselves what is so special about this little planet or humanity anymore while writing scripts ? ) these are chaotic , aimless , half starved creatures who landed to small planet of ours because their giant spaceship hovering above Johannesburg is out of fuel. South African government transfers them to a temporary camp outside the city due to international pressure. But temporary camp becomes permanent , militarized and at the and turns into a isolated slum called District 9. Aliens segregated and mistreated by human population of South Africa in general. Because they look different almost ugly. We humans are so easy to judge them from their outer appearance we can not comprehend they are sentient living beings..They are called Prawns , a degenetaory term due to their half cockroach half locust outlook. They are humiliated and segregated from humans by force. There are special public places they can enter and they can not. ( Subtle Apartheid allegory from director Neill Blomkamp ) Nigerian gangsters who move in to District 9 exploit them with various scams , like selling their favorite meal , cat food with high prices...And now a large arms manufacture company MNU ( Multinational United ) contracted to baby sit aliens and District 9. MNU does not give a damn to well being of aliens. All they care are advanced alien weaponry brought with them. Because humans can not operate alien DNA coded weapons MNU takes it as far as making medical experiments on Prawns...<br/><br/>This whole universe laid out in first ten minutes with a largely mocumentary TV program edition. You can get the feeling this is news channel or documentary of already happened. Then main plot starts from tragic dramatic story of one man. Wikus Van der Merwe. A MNU official a bureaucrat who is tasked with alien affairs. A regular everyday man Wickus he has same prejudices against aliens with rest of society. Not because he is a bad man but the society he is living in makes this prejudices as a reflex. He does not even acknowledge that he is treating Prawns wrong. When novelty of alien first contact wears of and it is clear Prwans are just refugees who do not offer anything MNU starts moving 1.8 aliens population from District 9 to a far away camp District 10. By force if it is necessary. Wikus is the one of several MNU officials to notify them eviction notice in District 9. During his search in District 9 he contacts some alien chemical with slowly turn him to a prawn. As a result his life is ruined he is the most wanted man in South Africa now because he is the only human being who can operate alien weaponry. He goes only place he can seek refugee now...District 9 <br/><br/>It is clear that Peter Jackson and new director Neill Blomkamp try to display our human nature to screen. Our ability to prejudice , exploit , segregate and even hate to others who do look like and act differently as a society...At the entrance of District 9 there is a huge statue , a Human and a Prawn hand to hand but it is worn down and disrepair...Just from it atmosphere is apparent. The message is clear. The idea of humans and aliens co existing , living together has lost its appeal long time ago..We humans are majority on the planet and we are the hunter gatherers by instinct. We do not care anybody else because it is not in our nature..Second half of movie goes from mockumentary and hand held camera to regular film making with themes of run-pursuit and sci-fi action....Ironicly as Wikus transforms to a creature like scientist in The Fly he becomes more and more human with good traits...like self sacrifice , help , understanding...Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van der Merve shows an excellent acting performance...<br/><br/>Conclusion :If you like smart thinking man's sci-fi with regular CGI action diet ( final battle is quite satisfying though it is a little bit gory ) do not miss District 9..."
"Willie-12","9","3","6","8 November 2009"," Another One
","Earlier this year I saw Moon, and thought it was one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long time. I also thought that it would be a while before I saw another one just as good. I was wrong. District 9 is just as good, albeit very different. However, the two films did have a couple things in common. First, they are both very intelligently written. I have to admit, I wasn't taken in by D-9 right off the bat. Much of that had to do with the fact that this odd little character, Wikus Van De Merwe, seemed as if he was going to play a pivotal role, and initially, I just couldn't see that happening. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is one of the best developed characters I've seen in a movie. As another comment alluded to, the transformation that Wikus makes from the beginning of the film to the end is nothing short of astonishing. Sharlto Copley's performance is brilliant, and it is one that definitely needs to be remembered come awards time. And the movie itself is a pleasure to watch. It is thoroughly entertaining and it gives the audience what they came for, but so much more. We get big explosions. We get guts and gore. But we also get a powerful story of hope and redemption (as was the case in Moon). We also get a story that revolves around some very tough ethical concerns and questions (also, like Moon). And that's the type of depth I like to see in any movie, Sci-Fi or otherwise."

","Although seemingly quite the hype in the rest of the world, ""District 9"" got unleashed into theaters in my country without much publicity or commotion. It's only playing in cinemas with the largest number of screens and if I hadn't coincidentally checked what was playing in theaters this week, maybe I would have missed it completely. I've read in the trivia section that the American marketing campaign included interactive posters with phone numbers that upset citizens could call, but here in Belgium there weren't even any trailers. Too bad, actually, because ""District 9"" is an imaginative low-budget movie that for once really deserves to lure as many curious film fanatics to cinemas. Unlike other over-hyped blockbusters of this type, like for example ""Cloverfield"", this film contains a large amount of genuinely ingenious ideas and a truckload of very effective social commentary. ""District 9"" differs immensely from the average type of alien invasion movies and is actually more of a pitch-black comedy slash political satire instead of a Sci-Fi. The coolest and most inventive aspect about the entire concept already comes at the beginning, with the arrival of a mysterious spaceship on earth, but not in New York or Paris or any major Western city, but above the 'crime capital of the world' Johannesburg in South Africa of all places! After nearly twenty years of silence and no attempt of the aliens to seek contact, soldiers eventually break into the spacecraft and discover a severely weakened race of aliens they baptize Prawns because of their hideous appearances. The South African government is now ""stuck"" with the aliens, and since they're unable to integrate in society, they put them into a township called District 9. Today, in the year 2010, ambitious social worker Wikus Van Der Merwe is assigned to finally evict all the Prawns one by one, but during his round he accidentally comes into contact with an alien liquid and gradually turns into a prawn himself. Now fleeing from his own government, since he has become an eagerly wanted study object all of a sudden, Wikus discovers that human never had any good intentions with the Prawns and simply wanted to dissect and study them and obtain accessibility to their powerful weapons. <br/><br/>Particularly the first half of ""District 9"" is downright brilliant and jaw-dropping original, because writer/director Neill Blomkamp fantastically illustrates the South African living conditions of poor people. I've spent two months in that country myself (though in Cape Town and not Johannesburg) and can actually confirm that these Townships are disastrous places where often two million people live together on a couple of square kilometers, in terribly ramshackle cabins with barely any running water. These places gradually sew despair and they are breeding grounds for criminal gangs. The alien intruders in Blomkamp's are actually just oppressed South African people; locked away in townships and given the negative image of being a ""financial burden"" to bear by the rest of the country's population. Blomkamp's film, in documentary style with interviews and seemingly live action reporting, is masterfully compelling and – even with the implausible premise of alien intruders – feels incredibly authentic. The second half of ""District 9"" is a lot less interesting, since the script reverts to violent shoot-outs and rather indigestible sentimental plot lines. The infected Wikus teams up with the most intelligent member of the Prawn species to fix the spacecraft and find an antidote for Wikus' deteriorating condition. The subtle social criticism gradually vanishes during this second half, as there are a lot of agitated confrontations with military forces and Nigerian crime syndicates. In spite of the relatively low budget of $30 million, the film has amazing special effects and make-up art. The unknown cast does a terrific job and the overall tone of the film – in spite of the harsh political topics – is spirited and energetic.

","I remember seeing Alive in Joburg three years ago, after I found out that Neill Blomkamp was going to direct the movie adaptation of Halo. I was impressed by the idea and hoped to, one day, see it adapted to the big screen. <br/><br/>A year later, I was pleased to find out District 9 was in the making. For the next couple of years, I followed news of the movie with great interest. Finally, I got to see it last week. Disappointment?<br/><br/>No, it was...awesome.<br/><br/>I figured that I may have hyped myself out for this one or that the old ""i-hate-it-because-it's-popular-now"" beast was going to shed my skin; but District 9 delivered.<br/><br/>It very much is a movie of many sides with the main themes being:<br/><br/><ul><li>Documentary - Action - Alien - Human</li></ul><br/><br/>I was so impressed by the way that these four sides integrated into the movie. It's amazing how it moves from alien documentary, to human documentary, to human drama/action and, finally, to the alien story.<br/><br/>The main character was great. A completely human anti-hero rather than an over-the-top marine hero or something. His physical changes are mirrored by his changes in perception of how things are; it's great character development. Also, he's very well-acted by Sharlto Copley - while the Academy may snub him, I think he is Oscar worthy in the eyes of many others.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's experience with directing CGI really shows in this movie. He's at absolute ease with this kind of stuff and it's all rather believable - that's coming from someone who usually dislikes CGI in movies.<br/><br/>My only main criticism was with the intro. I feel it could have been done a lot better as it felt a bit jarring. But, it was still vital to the movie in terms of scene-setting.<br/><br/>This movie has much more to it than I have written, but I'll just leave it at that and recommend you see District 9. 9/10"

"Irishmonk","8","3","6","7 September 2009"," Highly original but frequently absurd.
","Though District 9's originality can't be denied, the absurdities do get piled up pretty high. it's not the logistical plot holes that annoy me (most of which I can't reveal without being a Spoiler) but, rather, the frequent lapses of believable human behaviour. The capper is the ridiculous and gratuitous surprise party thrown by the wife and father in law of the seriously wounded and grievously ill main character. I suppose it may been intended to be funny but the filmmaker didn't really tip his hand in this direction. As it plays out it just feels jarring and dramatically OTT. <br/><br/>Unfortunately that's the case throughout a lot of the film. There are numerous moments during the eviction operation with the lead character mincing and prattling about like a hepped up camp counsellor on a Sunday stroll, utterly oblivious to the imminent danger of the situation. These scenes could have been humorous if played as broad satire or as a direct parody of the U.S. govt. handling of Katrina, but, unfortunately they're played pretty straight and whatever laughs might result feel unintentional and awkward. Much of the film's action unspools this way, lurching from faux docu-realism, to surreal comedy, to all out action that it makes for an uneven and, for me, somewhat strained experience. However, I think a lot of these problems will be ironed out by the highly talented director come the inevitable sequel time."

","Even though I had heard good reviews, I resisted knowing a thing about this and went in cold. What unfolded was one of the more gripping cinema experiences I've had in years.<br/><br/>If I had to use one word to describe the film, it would be ""intense"". The scope of the film covers such a broad array of real-world topics (as any good sci-fi does), ranging from racism, to animal testing, to genocide, famine, corporate war-lust, the list goes on. But the beauty of District 9 is not its political overtones, but rather its emotion. It's able to wrap all these elements together in a very compelling and believable way. Of course it takes a few Hollywood liberties, but they are NOT cheap and you find yourself almost feeling senses of relief when they occur.<br/><br/>Nothing about this film feels rushed or overdone. Everything unfolds very organically and there are enough story devices at work that you will have a hard time second guessing what will happen next. This is an exceedingly rare quality in film today.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are sound and I can't applaud Sharlto Copley enough for his performance. His character portrayal is stunning in its scope and depth (plus some great dry, awkward humor) and this role will certainly put his name on the map.<br/><br/>Last comment - even though there is plenty of brutal violence, the film never holds your nose to it...just enough to make you squirm a bit. I will say that it is not a film for everyone.<br/><br/>Both the premise and execution of of District 9 were ambitious, and in the end, wildy successful. This film will be discussed for years."
"wolftab-1","8","3","6","29 August 2009"," These Illegal Aliens Can Stay
","For most of the year there have been trailers and promos for a unique looking film called District 9 that is produced by Peter Jackson. A buzz was rightfully generated as the trailers show a colony of shrimp looking aliens that happen to appear over Johannesburg, South Africa and end up in a slum designated as District 9 and the problems that ensue because of the visitors. But would the film deliver? Boy, does it ever. Forget Transformers, Harry Potter, (I wouldn't go near GI Joe). District 9 is the original sci- fi hit of the summer. It's the best film next to Hurt Locker, Julie and Julia for an otherwise average selection of summer movies. Feels like the summer of 2008 was a long time ago.<br/><br/>District 9 takes place 20 years after the aliens (which are derogatorily called Prawns) appear. They do not live in harmony with humans as a nice montage of the past 20 years shows us. It's actually a great metaphor for the immigration problem and more directly for South Africa itself...Apartheid. But, a government agency called MNU (Multi-National United), has decided to uproot the aliens and put them in a more confined area, more akin to a concentration camp. Leading the efforts for evicting the aliens is a dorky kind of bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe. While going from shack to shack Wikus gets exposed to a strange alien chemical substance that is concocted by the alien protagonist Christopher Johnson. Here the film turns into a Kafkaesque adventure where Wikus with the help of his only two ""Prawn"" friends, Christopher and his son are in a race against time to put things right...for both species.<br/><br/>District 9 comes to us from unknown Director, Neil Blomkamp, who also hails from Johannesburg, South Africa. He certainly has a great love for sci-fi films as all through District 9, you can spot homages to such films as Aliens, RoboCop, Star Wars, Independence Day, etc. He keeps the action steadily flowing in the all too prevalent documentary style of shooting, which is a lot kinder to the senses than Cloverfield. A pleasant surprise was the acting of also unknown actor Sharlto Copley, as Wikus. He truthfully brings out the imaginary circumstances that he is under without forcing or doing much indicating. He displays a nice range of varying emotions throughout the film as his character has a very interesting arc. For the most part, the rest of the acting is well done. The film is not without it's flaws and one certainly has to suspend much disbelief but despite the films' flaws, the story remains solid and the end result is science fiction fun that I highly recommend."
"Reel_starz","8","3","6","29 August 2009"," A thrilling and unique take on an old genre
","District 9 is probably the biggest surprise hit of the year so far that isn't really a surprise. Made on an incredibly low budget (compared to the majority of Hollywood summer blockbusters) and featuring no big names except for Peter Jackson, who produced the film, this unique sci-fi action thriller surrounding aliens who live in slums in Johannesburg after their ship stopped above the South African city earned twice the amount of money it cost to make...in its opening weekend. And it deserves every cent of that box office gross. The Hollywood studios that released such deafening, incoherent summer movies as Transformers 2 or G.I. Joe should take a look at this film from little-known director Neill Blomkamp and see it as proof that you can make an intelligent blockbuster and that audiences actually will see it. Not only are the special effects incredible, but the movie's actual plot is intriguing and profound.<br/><br/>By styling the film like a documentary, Blomkamp creates tension right from the opening sequence, where numerous people, from employees of MNU (Multi-National United) to sociologists and scientists, take turns describing the alien situation. This also helps enhance the movie's gritty, uncompromising tone and gives it a fresh feel. Instead of an expensive set, the crew used real locations to film, accentuating the movie's realistic mood; you really feel as though you have been transported to a desolate slum in the middle of Johannesburg. We filmgoers have seen many films surrounding extra-terrestrials, most of them nothing more than showcases for the latest in CGI and F/X technology, but District 9 does not feel like anything we have seen before. The special effects are used to support the story, not the other way around.<br/><br/>Even so, you cannot help but marvel at the way Blomkamp and his tech crew managed to create something so convincing with so little money. The aliens look more realistic than anything featured in Transformers 2, and they did it with no more than 20 million compared to the Transformers's 200 million. In fact, it looks so real that when, for example, one character's fingernails begin to spontaneously fall out, you feel obligated to glance at your own fingernails to make sure they're still perfectly secure. This is only a fraction of the violence and gore, and this movie is clearly not for the queasy. District 9 never flinches when it comes to showing blood and...well, anything. Intense and graphic, it hides nothing and does not hesitate to throw the viewer right into the middle of the action.<br/><br/>Of course, there is much more to appreciate about District 9 than the makers' astute handling of the budget. Blomkamp and his casting director made the smart choice in casting only unknowns; the lack of a familiar face heightens the realism and compels us to care about the characters because of the characters themselves, not the actors who portray them. Sharlto Copley does a commendable job as Wikus Van de Merwe, a worker in the MNU Alien Affairs department and the central character in the film. He is aided by strong performances by Vanessa Haywood, who plays his wife, and the rest of the supporting cast. The humans aren't the only ones who turn in good performances, though. Though they are entirely CGI, the aliens or ""prawns"", a derogatory term used by humans throughout the film, particularly Christopher Johnson, the most prolific of the extraterrestrials, are complex yet sympathetic. You can often see their emotions and thoughts in their big yellow eyes, and it is not hard to convince yourself to root for them; at times, they are even more likable than the protagonist, who is good but flawed.<br/><br/>Finally, what really sets District 9 apart from the bulk of alien movies is the underlying allegory concerning immigration. Like many refugees, the aliens are forced to reside in substandard slums that separate them from the indigenous population and they are often treated with malice and suspicion by others. Most people have commented on the ties to the apartheid apparent in the film, but many of the messages and themes can also be connected to events in the United States. When a riot breaks out in district 9, I was reminded of the footage often shown of the Los Angeles riots in the '70s, and the relationship between the prawns and humans echos the racial discrimination that has characterized much of American history. In fact, there is no coincidence that the word 'alien' is often used to refer to someone who is foreign or different from oneself. At one point, an interviewee comments that it would not matter if the aliens were from a different country, but it does matter because they came from another planet. This brings up two points: one, why does it matter if they are from a different planet? How much difference is there between a country and a planet? And second, it is hypocritical, because even today, a big deal is made out of foreigners moving into another country. In short, if the aliens were only from the neighboring country, not another planet, the locals would be just as contemptuous of them.<br/><br/>Ultimately, aided by incredible special effects, a solid cast and masterful direction, District 9 poses a single question: How can we, as humans, expect to peacefully co-exist with a different species when we can barely co-exist with each other?"
"mexicospidergreen","10","3","6","27 August 2009"," It's original, terrifying, fascinating, and is the summer's first must see movie
","From the visionary mind of Peter Jackson comes a movie so riveting, shocking, and marvelous you'll swear you've just gotten the Goosebumps when it's over.<br/><br/>The following takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa where years ago humans first made contact with an extraterrestrial race. Years later when they evolve into slum like creatures they become a threat to humans alike. A government agency known as MNU (Multi-National United) then came in and locked them up in a secured facility called District 9. One day on a classified mission to evict the creatures out of their homes a MNU agent named Wickus is exposed to their biotechnology making his DNA as powerful and as indestructible as one of the creatures. He quickly becomes the most dangerous man in the world after learning that MNU associates want to use him as a weapon, but the creatures believe that he is the key to their survival.<br/><br/>This is a unique and visually stunning masterpiece that's thought provoking, imaginative & terrifying. It also begs to ask the question ""what if we aren't alone in the universe?"" Director Neill Blomkamp dares us to expect the unexpected, and with the help of producer Peter Jackson (Director of Lord of the Rings trilogy & King Kong) he's able to grab the viewer's attention, and take them on a tense and realistic journey that will leave you speechless afterwards.<br/><br/>Despite all its potential, the film takes quite a while to get moving. It starts off slow, and you'll feel as if you're watching a documentary but if you wait patiently action, suspense and originality awaits you. Another thing to be warned of is that this isn't ""Independence Day."" It's complex, gory, and might be too much for squeamish viewers. It's aimed towards mature teens, so leave the kids at home.<br/><br/>If you're willing to be acceptable of that, this is a sci-fi stunner that's so originally well done, technically brilliant and extremely good fun"
"foodaddy","8","3","6","24 August 2009"," Great Sci-Fi Movie that doesn't try too hard
","District 9 is an awesome film. I feel like way too many movies (Sci-Fi especially) go to way too many lengths to try and explain themselves. Movies try to make their premise believable and give a sort of explanation like Jurassic Park of how everything happened. This rarely works. Also, many movies try to be like Star Wars and create a whole universe where every gun and creature and piece of technology is all explained and catalogued. This works for a few great films, but most that try end up boring you to death.<br/><br/>District 9 simply blazes along at an intense pace where I don't care if certain things are explained or probable or add up because I am so caught up in the suspense and action of the current situation. On many movies like this, I might find myself saying things like ""No way! not possible"" and ""Yeah right"". But if the movie can keep your attention and focus on what's at hand, it can get away with little plot-holes just fine.<br/><br/>Go in to this movie expecting just one thing: a great movie. It doesn't need a universe or video game adaption or sequel, just one good story. I feel this is exactly the type of movie that would make a terrible sequel. But who knows, Neill Blomkamp has a great style and could maybe pull it off. Lets hope if the rumors are true and he does do Halo that it goes as well as this.<br/><br/>8/10"

","From the beginning of this film, you get the feeling that you're watching something that's addressing big ideas. South African Apartheid, Slavery, The Tuskegee Experiments, corporate and governmental interests in profits and technology as opposed to humanitarian concerns. Those are things I thought about when I watched this powerful movie.<br/><br/>The acting was great and the CGI was remarkably well-crafted. When I heard that the budget was $30 Million I almost didn't believe it, I couldn't. The Dark Knight and The Half-Blood Prince both cost over $250 million. It just goes to show, that the artists involved know what they're doing. Jackson and Blomkamp got it done.<br/><br/>Originally (or so I've read) Jackson was going to use Blomkamp for a film based on the game Halo, but the project and the money fell through. Well, Jackson, being the stand up guy that he is, wanted to keep his promise to the director, and scrounged up $30 Million for a film. This was the result, and it was fantastic. Big ideas, big effects, big performance by Sharlto Copley, small budget. I will definitely see this one again."

Now just imagine if Hollywood made this with a PG-13 rating with Will Smith playing Vikus. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Will Smith (Who doesn't) But this was done right. Peter Jackson right. At times I felt like this was a little borrowed but I went with it. Now just wait 15 years for Hollywood to remake this starring Robert Pattinson as Vikus. Whatever. I was nuts about this film. It had everything right and I'm proud. Now hopefully Sharlto Copley will become a star and keep making instant classics because this one is one of the many of this decade. 5/5. 10/10."

","The documentary feel gave the film an element of reality along with moments of seemingly unscripted (but really scripted) mistakes in filming. Aliens living in a South African ghetto called District 9 are not pretty. They look like bugs we might spray or swat. But they are taller than humans. Their appearance makes it easy for the government officials to mistreat them. We learn how they are treated in the early part of the movie as the aliens are being evicted from a squalid Johannesburg slum and being relocated to another concentration camp.<br/><br/>Themes of prejudice, marginalization and ethnocentrism dominate most of the film, but we must change how we feel about these creatures to feel empathy.<br/><br/>The human protagonist is a petty official who is collecting acknowledgments from the aliens on notices of eviction, apparently some legal requirement. Most of the aliens do not read. The human is vain, preens for the camera, and explains the process of eviction. While serving papers to the aliens with his security force behind him, he comes in contact with a substance which causes his metamorphosis. His transformation is a Kafka nightmare.<br/><br/>Corporate greed is to blame for much of the inhumanity, and as our proxy becomes more like the aliens, he becomes the recipient of the same inhospitable treatment he visited on our visitors.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect film, but it is exciting, thought-provoking and fun.<br/><br/>See it."

","I went into this movie knowing nothing and expecting something different. In this respect, I was mostly disappointed. Although there was some really great satire, (many of the scenes bordered on Saturday Night Live sketches), the overall plot was cliché. Too many times have we seen this same general theme. The last hour The storyline jumped round so many times, like 'let's do this' and then 'well that didn't work, let's do this'. It just felt a bit too loosely woven, without giving the viewer any sense of what the ultimate goal was for the protagonists. My other critique concerns suspension of belief. I don't mind suspending my belief to a certain extent, I think that is a necessary component of enjoying sci-fi. But there were several things that, unless you suspend your disbelief to the point of becoming a goldfish, you will ultimately attribute to poor story-editing. <br/><br/>I actually enjoyed a lot of the shaky cam work, and the characters, acting, casting, it was all Bang On. Obviously, the effects were great.<br/><br/>In retrospect, it was the first half of this movie that made it great- it mockingly, lightheartedly, displayed the most disturbing parts of human character and conduct. It was black comedy brought out in the land of sci-fi,a well-balanced tongue in cheek satire of hygienic cruelty. Unfortunately, The last half was a video game."

The movie was not overly short or overly long, and the acting was perfect for what it was about. I recommend this film highly to fans of SF, the summers best one, bar none. It is interesting to see the progression in terms of SF film making from when the film Alien came out in 1979, to the Hollywood blitz of Arnie does SF films in the 1990s, to the land of endless rehashes of the concept of monster aliens that is supposedly a nod to Alien post 2000, but is really a nod to nothing.

","This is one of the amazing films of history. To think that it was done on an indie budget, with the two lead actors as first-timers, and a director who has very limited experience is somewhat mind-boggling. I suspect that the superb empathetic elements in the Christopher Johnson character and his son deserve a slight nod in the direction of the producers (cf. Gollum & King Kong). What do you want? Acting? We got that. The evolution of the Wikers character is truly dynamic in a very personal way. You want pathos? We got tons! You want action? Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. You want FX? Again, seamless and some of the most impressive FX ever! You want Sci-Fi? This is in the grand tradition of ""I am Legend,"" ""2001/2010,"" ""I Robot,"" ""Thirteenth Floor,"" and a long list of socially relevant Sci-Fi films and literature. Humor? Check! Shocking realism? Check! Even a rather touching love story between Wikers and his wife. Check! This movie has it all, and is a non-stop dramatic tour de force from beginning to end. Warning: not for morons who have trouble with understanding South African accents, social relevancy, or who can only see aliens as the universally superior, new age, breathlessly long awaited saviors of human culture (cf. Close Encounters), or on the other hand, evil predators who live only to survive by evisceration of humans or implanting embryos in their abdomens (cf. Alien, Aliens; which films I love, BTW).

Leave something to the imagination critics of the movie. It tells the story like a documentary and that is done amazingly without camera shaking and it flows so well that I don't even notice when it changes to black and white during certain scenes. This movie is to alien movies what Saving Private Ryan is to war movies. I saw the reviews on here and I usually trust them because after a sample group of thousands of people you get a general idea of how good a movie is but it had a 9. That was really high so I decided to see it over other current movies. I just can't believe how good it was. I love the feeling of being super happy and adrenaline pumping because the movie had you genuinely surprised, and worried about the characters in it.

","This movie is a metaphor of our society that represents the immorality of humans with their prejudice, racism, concentration camps & inhumane experiments. Since the film has no stars, it's based entirely in South Africa, it contains a huge amount of graphic violence and it's shot in a documentary style; I find only a very selective audience will actually enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects were mind-boggling with its seamless interactions between the aliens & humans. The movie has some similarities to the 1986's film ""The Fly"" and your generic plot line of that specific lone humanistic alien that the audiences are rooting for. His son adds the sympathetic role so that we can easily relate to them.<br/><br/>This film has parts that are unique & brilliant, but within a metaphorical story that we're all too familiar with; which at sometimes, runs as being unoriginal. The 2nd half of the movie is flooded with action sequences, where the visuals are very similar to watching a live-action video game; that at times, becomes a little too disoriented and messy.<br/><br/>Even though I enjoyed this film and I was in awe in specific scenes, I don't find myself eager to be watching this movie again on home video.

District 9 is definitely light on story, and even when it has story, it takes elements from earlier science fiction movies and television. Basically, District 9 sends the very negative and nihilistic message that humanity is greedy, hateful and spiteful and we'll never, ever improve as a species. Bravo District 9, wonderful message you've got there.<br/><br/>A heavy focus of this movie is on the Alien weaponry, and the military needs someone with alien DNA to come along to use it. Ah-ha, so here comes the convenient plot device of guy-getting-infected-by-alien-weapon-so-he-is-on-the-run-now. Huh? Wait a minute... how exactly does Alien fuel turn a guy into an alien from outer space???? That's one of the biggest and most significant plot holes in the movie, and it really, really needed to be addressed at some point, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>Finally, when you expect some exciting story point to finally happen near the end, there's more grisly blood, guts and gore. In focusing too heavily on the blood, guts and gore, the movie ends up being very predictable in the end. It's kind of like going from point A to point B to point C without taking any detours or finding a better path.<br/><br/>A lot of the Science fiction from the 1950's was much better than this because not only was it meant for everyone, but it was purely story-driven. This movie was merely a cruel, visceral exercise in exploding body parts and wrapping up 20 or 30 pre-used ideas from other movies and Star Trek episodes and calling it a new film. I mean for God's sakes, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was more Sci-fi than this movie!<br/><br/>Honestly, answer me. If this movie was PG, would you have enjoyed it as much? Catering to the basic instinct of violence as entertainment and pompously calling it a work of art shows how low we've sunk as a species."

","This was the worst movie I've seen in years. I actually considered getting up and walking out of the theatre (which I've never done btw), but I stayed to see if it got any better after the first 45 minutes. It didn't. I've shot better quality films on my HVX. I'm so sick of this zoom in-zoom out-find the focus crappy camera operating. Also, no one in this film can act. One would think they would have spent some of the $30 million on some more talented actors. From Sharlto Copley to Vanessa Haywood to all the people playing MNU employees... Terrible. The aliens look good, that's the only thing District 9 has going for it. So, good job on the CGI. Everything else blows."

","I looked at ratings and was tricked into seeing this. Normally with a bad review I would start by stating what was wrong with the movie, but this time, I'll do the quick part first.<br/><br/>The ONLY redeeming features were decent special fx and cool looking explosions. But by the time you see any of that you're already bored by the lack of a plot and mockumentury ""style"" filming and nauseas from the crazy cameraman. Now the bad. EVERYTHING ELSE. I couldn't really get into the movie for a half an hour because they don't explain anything. Even with all of the puking you see in the beginning it never gets any easier to watch because the aliens are bugs. Of the 3 major characters, only one had any significant amount of lines which led to a poor story that was handicapped at best by the subject matter. Aliens stranded in Africa getting evicted to a different reservation? Seriously, who thought that up? Next come the plot holes... We don't want the aliens here, which is why we're evicting them from the town. So why does the Alien have to escape to get help to rescue the rest? Also, why couldn't he take the main character with him and help him during the 3 year trip instead of making him wait on a hostile planet? Did I mention the Cameraman? He seemed to be an epileptic on meth with the shaking and quick zooming in and out. It was what i would expect from an 8 year old ADHD child on a roller coaster. My advice is to skip it. If you want to see a horribly filmed movie without a plot yet had cool explosions, check out Cloverfield."

The production values are quite poor. Cinematography was bad. Acting a joke. Special effects also poor. The whole thing looked like it had been put together by a school drama club. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie was that I went to the first showing. When I left the house prior to the movie there had been no reviews or ratings. When I returned home after leaving the movie half way through I see a glowing review and about a thousand ratings, most very high. Apparently all of those folks rushed out of the movie before it was over in order to give it top ratings?

","I'd been following along keenly to all the news stories about this movie leading up to its release. I'd seen the trailers and advertising that teased something would be special about this film. And being a sci-fi fan it looked like someone was finally going to make an amazing 'what if...' style flick that was acted and filmed in a realistic manner.<br/><br/>So I excitedly popped along to the New Zealand preview screening tonight in Wellington. All the while hoping some special guest like Richard Taylor from Weta would pop along. The head of Sony NZ pops out and says he'd like to introduce a special guest, and Peter Jackson walks out to spend about 10 minutes talking about the making of the film and how it came about due to the demise of Halo. He talked in depth about how they'd felt so bad for Neil that Halo had been canned by the studios and that they'd like to help him make another film.<br/><br/>I am sad that Halo never came to fruition, but am over the moon that this movie was made instead. Never would Halo have been as raw and gritty as this. With a $100,000,000 plus budget the studios would never have allowed it. It would have been too much of a risk.<br/><br/>This movie is an unflinching look at ourselves and speaks volumes about all the things that are wrong and right about being human. If you are in to science fiction that is really intelligent and entertains you with more than just amazing special effects and weapons (which this movie has in spades) you will be blown away by this. Go see it this weekend and show these corporations that this is the way to make movies, and they made a huge mistake to pull out on Neil and Peter."

","I kept hearing from people who caught the 'special' screening ""Oh it's the best movie of the year! You gotta see it!""...I must admit, it was a good movie, but not the BEST. The plot was extremely original which I LOVED, the special effects are 'top notch' as promised in advertisements and reviews, but what it lacks in is execution, now don't give me s**t about my opinion because it's just that, MY opinion. <br/><br/>I was expecting some thing shocking, something that would blow my mind but the only thing that blew me away was really the theaters AC...oh and the plot. For me it was just another Alien movie...but it's not your typical alien movie. We're all used to watching ones with butt-loads upon butt-loads of action and violence and some pretty freakin' scary aliens but this wasn't anything like that...NOT that I'm complaining mind you, I just really disliked that it was made out to be this major action movie, and we're left with AT MOST 15 mins of serious alien vs human death-matches. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I was very impressed with the visual effects, story and acting. I gotta hand it to the main character, for being an unknown actor and not really starring in very many movies, he did a phenomenal job in this roll. <br/><br/>So I guess in the end all I can really say is if you decide to spend the $9.50 (or however much it is you spend on a ticket), go in prepared for lots of dialog, special effects. Luckily our theater here is still cheap so we only had to shell out $4.50 matinée price...so I guess the movie lived up to it's ticket price. Worth matinée if you can catch it, but probably not the full ticket price.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10 for me."
"jdesando","Null","6","17","10 August 2009"," An original
","To delight this critic with sci-fi, you need a heavy dose of allegory, jaw breaking production values, developing characters, ingenious plot, and eye-easing cinematography. The Peter Jackson produced District 9 pretty much has all these except for the last. If it weren't for the disorienting, jittery, hand-held cameras, the film would be an almost perfect modern sci fi. And I hold a respect for the genre from Metropolis through Forbidden Planet down to 28 Days Later. So this film is within the district.<br/><br/>Aliens have landed in Johannesburg, South Africa. For twenty years they have been held in compound District 9, but the natives are restless to get the ugly ""prawns"" out of their 'hood. Such a plan to move over a million aliens to a holding camp is given to unlikely leader Wikus (Sharlto Copley), whose challenges as the lead organizer are almost insurmountable. Just think of occupying Iraq or apartheid, and you'll get the idea.<br/><br/>Wikus becomes almost the entire focus of the film, and in that sense he embodies all of those residents who fear outsiders, but who discover deep wells of understanding inside themselves as to who the real enemies are. In Wikus's case, alien Chris Johnson becomes a ""Christ"" in the allegorical tradition, but just barely. Actually the parallel themes to our time are ample besides that biblical chestnut.<br/><br/>That Wikus develops as a character is a saving grace of the film because the alien-virus-contracting hero struggles with the ambitious Jo'Burgers such as his father-in-law who want to harvest his organs to gain the power the aliens have but no one else can use because of their special DNA. Imaginative District 9 is; bloodless and visually stable it is not.<br/><br/>While District 9 has obvious reference to this summer's blockbusting Transformers in its alien attack machine, it is smarter and scarier. See it, but don't eat through it—it's gory. Although directed by Neill Blomkamp from his short story and film, Peter Jackson's sweeping vision of cinema as a visceral extension of the audience's dreams dominates. And that's good."
"starmars","5","9","29","15 August 2009"," A disappointment
","I had been a fan of Neil Blomkamp from his original short films ""Live In Joburg"" and ""Tetra Val"". When I saw that he was making an entire movie based on LIJ, in association with Peter Jackson, I thought it was a going to be a fantastic ""hard"" Sci-Fi classic along the lines of Blade Runner or Enemy Mine. Maybe I set the bar too high for myself going in, but what I ended up getting was more of a body-horror movie the first half, and a shoot-em-up the last.<br/><br/>It felt that much of the time the film should have spent developing Wikus's character was spent lingering on every gory, disgusting, detail of his transformation into an alien. This would have been fine had I been watching a horror film along the lines of The Fly(1986) or Videodrome, but I thought this was going to be a sci-fi film. These scenes only served to gross me out and felt like little more than filler.<br/><br/>The last half of the film switches gears and much of the time they should have spent developing the alien character was spent on an advertisement for the inevitable FPS game which will tie into this film. Lots of explosions, cool alien weapons, and people vaporizing into hamburger. I found the violence way to fetishized in this segment. Lingering on severed limbs, gaping wounds, heads exploding. I'm not against violence in movies, but I signed up for a Sci-Fi film exploring an interesting concept, not a gory torture-porn/war-epic.<br/><br/>There was a lot the movie did right. I love the opening, leading us into the story through CCTV, news broadcasts, and documentary narration. I found this very gripping and effective.<br/><br/>The aliens where very well done, portrayed as entirely non-human cockroaches. With very little relatable about them as far as human-emotion or ethics. Why should they act/think like us? This was the most provocative aspect of the movie, the aliens were very non-human, even unlikable. So it begs the question, should we segregate them? Does the virtue of their life and sentience alone afford them the same respect and treatment of the native humans? Unfortunately these questions and the other ramifications of the movies scenario are grossly underdeveloped. Quite frankly Blomkamps original short film had more depth when it came to examining the social ramifications of the alien presence. In District 9, the actual hard questions and science fiction is left to fade into the background in order to tackle the easier subjects of people losing teeth and stuff blowing up.<br/><br/>There are much better Sci-Fi movies out there which have taken the various elements which make up District 9 and done a better job with them.<br/><br/>Enemy Mine did a much better job examining the relationship between species as well as the greater question of what enemy and friend means in the context of a war. Curiously it also features an alien and his child, but Enemy Mine is a much more thoughtful film District 9.<br/><br/>The Fly, while not really Sci Fi, did a much more effective job at making us feel sympathetic for the main character will making us want to hurl our cookies watching him suffer through a hideous transformation.<br/><br/>And Children of Men for it's gory fighting and action scenes while effectively examining the social ramifications of the films scenario. You can still be gory and full of action while remaining thoughtful about your subject matter.<br/><br/>District 9 is an OK movie. It is not great, and the short film which spawned it is much better in my opinion."

Well,if you know South African social history and the forced removal of black people from District 6 in Cape Town during the 1960s (check out ""District 6"" on Wikipedia), you'd know that this plot is a parody of very ""real"" events which happened. Do a bit of research before you shoot off your mouth. Remember, it is better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt! Sure, the ""transformer"" ending unfortunately slips into Hollywood sci-fi shlock, but that is the beauty of this film. It is a blended product which combines real history, sociologiocal perspectives of ""the other"", commentary on the nature of man,amazing CGI and blockbuster effects, together with the tastelessness of Hollywood.

","I really wanted to like this film given all the good reviews I read about it before actually going to see it. Parts of it were very well done. I have to agree with some other reviewers that the hand held camera gets to be a bit much at times and the documentary style gets tedious. That being said, the aliens themselves, with the exception of the lead alien, don't appear to behave intelligently enough to have constructed the spaceship. Their penchant for cat food, can and all, is a bit hard to fathom. The action however when it comes is good, but it's too little too late IMO. The South African accent is a bit hard to understand at times if its spoken fast, which it seems to be most of the time when we view the main character. I would say the film is worth seeing, but maybe the sequel, and I'm sure there will be one, will be better."
"MovieHancho","10","4","10","15 August 2009"," Easily one of the Top 10 of All Time
","This movie should not be missed. Every single second had my heart pounding due to all the suspense. The Plot takes an extreme turn, leaving the viewers unraveled. The special effects are top notch from such a low budget. There was one instance where Victus uses an alien weapon that shot a laser towards the enemy, forcing them to explode, and guts flying every where. My friend had to leave because she couldn't handle all the gore. So if you don't have a strong stomach...you should still watch because its easily one of the best sci-fi movies out there.:) Another amazing effect was the arsenal of the weapons in District 9. There was one weapon that grabbed objects, similar to a gravity gun (Half-Life 2). All in all, the special effects team really deserves a well round of applause. Peter Jackson did it with Lord of the Rings, and he does it again, but with Neil of course. So if you're deciding what to see this week, then look no further to District 9.<br/><br/>I also wanted to add that I am very disappointed with Microsoft for denying Jackson and Neil the right to make a Halo movie. I am a fan of Halo and would have loved to see it come to life with these directors. Microsoft For The Loss :("
"Chris Knipp","6","8","26","14 August 2009"," Cat food for the ""prawns"" and caviar to the general
","How odd to set a sci-fi horror movie in and around Johannesburg, South Africa. That's where a big fuzzy looking space ship has been hovering in the air for twenty years, we're told during the mocumentary footage at the outset of Neill Blomkamp's 'District 9' explaining how a gang of terminator-torso creatures would up here by accident, starving, and were settled in a compound on the edge of the city called District 9 that's become a hideous slum. District 9 is now a place despised by all South Africans, black and white. The unfortunate outer space refugees confined there, whose insect-reptilian look and proclivity for feeding on rubbish, bad meat, and cat food has led to their being called ""prawns"" by the general, are to be relocated to a tent camp 200 miles out by a wealthy independent contractor called MNU (Multi-National United).<br/><br/>By the time all this has been laid out for us, of course, it's obvious Johannesburg isn't so ""odd"" as a setting for the story at all, just heavy-handed. The location chosen by South African director Blomkamp is a blatant way of making this a sort of allegory about man's inhumanity to those he considers his inferiors, like the blacks in the Bantustans of apartheid South Africa. The only trouble is, the film thus begins with a creakily obvious story device.<br/><br/>Another trouble with this unholy combination of bits from 'Black Hawk Down,' 'RoboCop,' 'Transformers,' 'Aliens,' 'The Fly,' etc., etc, is that it points to how aliens are being cruelly treated and then presents them as disgusting. Some pleasure comes out of how that disgust is milked, however, because the interiors of the ""prawns'"" shacks, a riot of technology and degraded junk, show the designers had a lot of fun with them, as they do with the exteriors of the shantytown, a kind of sci-fi Mogadishu (actually, in the Ridley Scott's film, recreated in the suburbs of Rabat, Morocco). Even when it descends into actioner schlock, District 9 does make ingenious use of its low budget and limited locations. And even if its characters are mostly clichés, the degenerating relationships in the protagonist's life are poignant enough.<br/><br/>'District 9' is a conversion story, because Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the goofy bureaucrat put in charge of the relocation, who's the son-in-law of MNU's owner, starts out with contempt for the aliens but ends up being, sort of, their ally. More than that. When invading the house of one of them, he spills some black fluid from a vial onto his face and starts sprouting a ""prawn"" claw where his left hand used to be. Then, the whites want to use him to kill aliens, because his new DNA allows him to fire alien weapons that are the only thing that can finish them off. And a Nigerian gangster, who preys off the aliens, stockpiling their special weaponry and extorting enormous sums from them for tinned cat food, wants to consume Wikus' arm because he thinks it will make him superhuman. Anyway, Wikus is forced to befriend the ""prawn"" whose shack contained the fluid, because he (or it) may be able to help him. And so he who was to have been the aliens' concentration camp director now becomes their protector.<br/><br/>But if the ""prawns"" are vulnerable only to their own weapons which only they can fire, it seems easy enough to hurt them in other ways. This movie just isn't very well thought out. There's no further back story for the aliens either. Where do they get money? What do they do all day? These things we never learn. Nor, unlike the flawed but superior 'Children of Men,' are local events put in the context of global ones.<br/><br/>Copley is (perhaps intentionally?) a wooden actor when he first appears being ""filmed' at his desk as publicity for the eviction and relocation project. He livens up when he gets involved in the violent action in the ""prawns'"" ghetto. For a while, he seems a complex hero, morphing from doofus into bigot, then pariah, then cross-over, then selfless savior. But during this interesting progress the movie unfortunately descends just as rapidly from its allegorical sci-fi setup into more and more crude levels of B-picture action and horror.<br/><br/>And this crudity only reminds us of how clumsy the fake TV news, surveillance footage, documentary interviews with academics or technicians and other bits of hack ""realism"" have been, and highlights how crudely drawn the MNU operatives and Wikus' family members are. And how utterly derivative the aliens' body shapes are. And how inexplicable it is that the ""prawns"" speak in the usual sci-fi movie guttural backwards-tape alien language, which is subtitled for us, but the white men all understand it, and the aliens all understand English. By the time you get to the end of District 9, however intense its sometimes George Romero-worthy yuck scenes have been along the way, it has just become an utter, irredeemable mess. And that's too bad because there are some ingenious ideas buried here, and the first half lets you think instead of just watch people and critters bang into each other.<br/><br/>The final insult is to find that this movie is being heralded as ""original"" and ""smart."" Only mavericks like Armond White and Michael Sragow are unimpressed. (To liven things up, Ebert even supported White's right to pan this -- then withdrew his support.) Sragow points to the film's ""derivative"" quality. A black man himself, White points to how 'District 9' trivializes the South African liberation struggle, and is offensive to Nigerians. But viewers and critics see the movie they want to see, and since this one pushes the right liberal buttons and gives the superficial appearance of being an ""original"" sci-fi movie, it's making a big noise and doing good box office."

The most technological thing that human can use in this movie is helicopter and surface to air missile.<br/><br/>After the first 45 boring minutes of ""interviews"" that provide insights of Wikus Van De Merwe, Van De Merwe suddenly turned from a wimp to a human killer even though he loves his wife.

","All these weeks, viral videos made me eager to watch District 9. It seemed so interesting and different but after watching the whole movie my comments are just these: another boring flat film with HUGE plot holes and no point at all. It just SUCKS! The best feature is the CG aliens' video tracking and composing with the other elements in the film. I must admit the special effects department did a magnificent job. However, this doesn't save the movie at all.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie does seem interesting and it's a nice touch to see the main character being affected by the ""liquid"". After that, the whole movie turns into a ridiculous Resident evil 5 video game with awful camera shaking (I think it's time to stop this 2000's camera trend anymore), constant bombings and silly plot.<br/><br/>There's no logic in the plot: advanced aliens with fantastic weapons abused by humans? And they manage to get a can with black liquid after twenty years, which is powerful enough to activate a spaceship but turns humans to aliens? What about the huge mother ship? Just standing there? All these don't make sense and the overall approach is very shallow, I would expect more depth. <br/><br/>Another annoying fact was the character's ability to do anything he wants like being a ""super-hero"". He assaults military headquarters, gets away from any difficult situation easily, he even avoids bullets, rockets, missiles.There are so many clichés here that make the movie the worst anticipated movie - like Kevin Kostner's Water World.<br/><br/>This is not a sci-fi film, this is a video game with an awfully-fake documentary camera shake.

Supposedly they only spent 30 Mil to make this movie, but to me it looks like a garage movie that cost 3 mil.<br/><br/>The TV ads for this movie contain just about every action scene in the film. So if you go looking for action you will be greatly disappointed. I will say, the alien technology produced some awesome booms and bangs, and the mechwarior was cool.

"baenad","3","10","35","14 August 2009"," A great premise turns into a glorified mess.
","When I went to see ""District 9"" at the midnight release, I was nothing short of excited. Having been largely disappointed by most every major summer release thus far, I was optimistic about ""District 9,"" considering the awesome premise, thoroughly enjoyable previews and build-up, and the fact that it was produced by one Peter Jackson, who has yet to disappoint with his trade-mark fantastical epics. <br/><br/>Indeed, the first 45 minutes or so of the film set up the potential for what could have been a great mystery or psychological thriller. ""There's a lot of secrets in District 9,"" as we are told in the film's opening mockumentary sequence; secrets including a treasure-trove of derelict alien weapons and technology, crime-rings, both human and alien, etc. A whole slew of plot options become available. Are the alien's secretly planning a coup against their oppressive human ""protectors?"" Does our would-be investigator slowly uncover the mysterious reason for the aliens' landing 20 years ago? <br/><br/>We eventually discover that the aliens are being exploited by human weapons researchers for their own profit, a revelation which comes, in my mind, far too soon. At this point, abandoning all its finer, more subtle points, ""District 9"" turns into nothing more than one long action sequence, with less suspense than the last Indiana Jones movie, and more unnecessarily graphic violence than ""Tropic Thunder."" Most of the plot is good enough for a B+ video game, at best, especially when one considers that the only thing standing in the way of the aliens and their stash of high tech weaponry, and hence liberation, is their insatiable addiction to cat food (pretty weak reason for voluntary submission and cultural castration, if you ask me). <br/><br/>I do praise the film for its remarkably low budget, and surprisingly good acting. Sharlto Copley did a decent job, considering the frantic nature of the script. It was almost as if there was no longer any room for dialog amidst so much chasing and shooting, as if the entirety of the film's plot and character development were condensed entirely into the first forty five minutes or so, leaving the lasers and cranial bores to do the talking for the remainder of the film's nearly two-hour run time.The action itself, though mildly entertaining, offers no clear distinction between this movie's special effects and those of ""Transformers,"" ""G.I. JOE,"" or any other plot-less ""orgy of computer-generated destruction porn"" (to quote Stephen Colbert on analyzing this year's summer blockbusters). <br/><br/>In terms of the film's overall message, the decision of having the aliens land in Johannesburg, once ground-zero for Apartheid, is a clever, but ultimately obvious and shallow metaphor for actual racism. One shouldn't need to look at a seven-foot, sentient shrimp to know that the exploitation of others based on physical and cultural differences is wrong. Indeed, for a movie that promised so much in the line of good sci-fi,mystery, and a unique premise, ""District 9"" is sorely disappointing."

I guess it has some referencing of apartheid, slum townships and other elements of South African politics and culture but with a frustrating lack of the specificity that more intelligent (and less zany) satire might achieve. These kind of films only hinder proper education, discussion and understanding because the  person who's infatuated with the ""message"" of the film and has various enthusiastic ""thoughts"" and ""beliefs"" about it invariably assumes that their fellow interlocutor/victim knows what the hell they are rabbiting on about. Also, perhaps more tellingly, the ultra-violence and completely gratuitous battle scenes can only be enjoyed by someone with damage to the frontal lobe, which, to warn you, may in fact be damaged just by watching this utterly stupid film.<br/><br/>God only knows why I watched the whole hour and 40 minutes. Must visit the brain surgeon tomorrow."

","""District 9"" was better than I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill Hollywood production. That's not the case. This is a clever package harking back to the sci-fi films of the 1950s. Maybe it's a tribute to those old b movies from the 50's and early 60s? I don't know, but I did find it suspenseful for most of the time.<br/><br/>The story is basically about aliens (insect like creatures) discovered in a weird spaceship hovering above Johannesburg South Africa. They are brought down by government forces under the MNU department, and put into a slum of sorts called District 9. They get incorporated into the fringes of society. But when they have to be cleared out of the area, things go haywire when they revolt. Not to bad all in all, basically it had what every good futuristic b movie has, an engaging story. The only issue i had with District 9 was the CGI effects of the ""prawns"", which left a lot to be desired. However I looked past that and could still enjoy the movie."
"codive","9","3","7","15 December 2010"," This IS Science Fiction
","Let's be honest: The best science fiction we've ever read or seen does start with an impossible, incredible, at least highly unlikely idea.<br/><br/>Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke, or Lem.<br/><br/>All of them ask you to believe in a very unbelievable idea from the very beginning of their stories.<br/><br/>I've seen District 9, and I've read a lot of the reviews giving it a low rating. Most of these ratings however make a lot of assumptions about what an encounter with an alien race would look like, what an alien race would want, desire, or be able to do. They complain about the unbelievable, the strange, the illogical.<br/><br/>I admit that some parts of the story do indeed seem illogical, but that's EXACTLY what the human race is all about! We ARE very unreasonable, have motives that would be quite impossible to understand from an alien point of view, and our cultures are so diverse that we hardly understand each other.<br/><br/>So, who's to complain about something unreasonable about an alien race? What the heck to WE understand about it? Nothing! I've recently seen Avatar (and I liked it), but in comparison, the cultural and social depth of District 9, the realization of being human, and what that means, what kind of species you're a part of, kicks you in the head with a much more powerful impact.<br/><br/>Naturally, the film is a film and must follow some rules of film making, and only has two hours to tell the story to the audience.<br/><br/>Taking into account, that the film has only a short time, that the subject touches not only technology, but also culture, history, present conflicts of our time, and of course introduces a whole new species, I've got to say it's the best science fiction film in years.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 9 out of 10, because there was indeed one moment of asking myself ""What the heck is this?"" However, compared to a lot of other films I've recently seen, District 9 still shows them all where to set the standards, what creativity means, what amateur actors can do, how to tell a compelling story, and how to approach a very difficult subject, and get it to work.<br/><br/>I'm very content that I finally saw this film, and I say to any TRUE science fiction fan who is able to admit that real science fiction involves SOME leap of faith: This is a film that I'd really recommend!

","NO SPOILERS: District 9 delivers a movie that Science Fiction has been waiting for since the days of Star Wars. Masterpieces of the genre include 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien duet (Alien and Aliens), and, of course, the unforgettable Star Wars. District 9 is everything you want and more. It makes itself a masterpiece through originality, great story telling, realistic aliens, both in looks and actions, reality, and meaning. To put the final touch, it delivers a multitude of action sequences that keep your eyes wide open for the second half, without which we would be subject to another movie that you hate to watch because every time you find yourself drifting off to sleep. This is no space opera and it has no complex subtext scattered throughout. It is a genuine story of realistic Science Fiction. The many themes, characters, and emotions within the story make it a powerhouse within the movie universe. The few fallacies lie cluttered in the script, mainly in the lack of dialog aside from f-bombs. On a lighter note is the connection you have with the aliens. Even in other movies where the aliens are the ""good guys"", you find yourself wanting to care for them. The connection developed with the alien Christopher is more than you could want. The personification of the alien's eyes gives you a hold of the connection reel before it pulls you in. District 9 is the Science Fiction masterpiece of the 2000's. The Story reminded me most of Fargo, which showed greed and selflessness and the effects of both. Movies like Avatar and Donnie Darko are great but hail in comparison to the marvel that D9 delivers. I purchase few movies but this one sits in my library next to Star Wars, Alien, and 2001 as an equal. OVERALL: 9.5/10"

","Finally I had enough time to sit down and watch this movie that has been on my most anticipated films list. It was one of the greatest films ever made. It is like a better version of Cloverfield. Although instead of placing the film in a famous city it is in Johannesburg, and instead of just a monster this movie deals with aliens. It stars of as a fictional documentary of how the aliens came about and then the movie switches into the aliens and the humans sides of the story, which I thought was brilliant. The computer animations were insane. Also just want to point out to anyone who is grossed out easily that you should not watch this film because there are some pretty hardcore gross scenes throughout the film. Any ways 9 out of 10 stars for this film."

","This movie is a tongue-in-cheek comedy. I thought the opening scenes of the politically correct documentary approach to the ""nice"" aliens (ignoring their revolting appearance and table manners and their foul tempers) were hilarious. The Nigerian gangsters were gross caricatures of some very real personalities: I suppose they were operating the equivalent of a convenience store. The special effects and the aliens themselves looked pretty low budget but it didn't matter so long as you got into the spirit of the thing. The humour appeared to flag as the story progressed and it seemed that, contrary to many movies which, in desperation, mutate into comedy when the director realizes he is just not going to make it otherwise; this one becomes increasingly serious.<br/><br/>The vast space-ship concept was impressive and quite credible.<br/><br/>This is an utterly different genre from Alien or Blade-runner - bears no comparison.<br/><br/>It's probably a little too long but is highly original and quite entertaining."
"niezone","8","3","7","25 January 2010"," An interesting new approach to the Sci-Fi Thriller
","Watching District 9 was an odd experience. <br/><br/>I was taken back to a time when sci-fi/thrillers relied on the craft of set designers, make-up artists and clever directors to make an ambitious film possible despite a rather limited budget. <br/><br/>District 9 reminds me of sci-fi classics like Alien, in which a team of artists led by a young but apt director work in unison to bring a unique take on the genre to life. <br/><br/>The idea of filming District 9 as a quasi-documentary allows the audience to forgive the lack of fancy special effects and the lack-luster appearance of an alien breed that could have been designed two decades ago. The documentary feel also creates an air of intimacy and realism that is highly engaging. <br/><br/>Despite having a share of weak action scenes and some plot inconsistencies, the movie remains interesting throughout due to a very original script, artistic concept and creative artistic design. <br/><br/>The lead character embodied with great energy and ability by the unknown Sharlto Copley (South-African actor) gives the movie an added aura of realism, placing an average-looking man without the typical chiseled features of Hollywood action heroes. <br/><br/>For some, District 9 will be caricaturesque or even silly in its original approach to a Hollywood subject that has been widely explored: the man vs. Alien battle for supremacy. The truth is that District 9 brings a breath of fresh air to an exhausted genre by making humans the villains and aliens the victims, exploring some ethical and political questions but never being preachy. <br/><br/>District 9 is one of the best movies of 2009. A must-see."
"siderite","10","3","7","15 November 2009"," Fantastic movie
","I believe the greatest damage to this film was made by the people who promoted it, the trailers showing aliens and explosions and all that crap. The movie is actually about something else entirely and the ""movie"" violent moments are few at the end. There is real violence in the everyday actions and behaviour of the people involved, though, the status quo that lets you be a smiling bureaucrat doing his job killing children and dispossessing helpless people.<br/><br/>What I think is worth mentioning is that Peter Jackson did not direct this movie, he was only the producer. The director and writer of the movie is Neill Blomkamp, who I was surprised to see, directs and writes for the first time. I look forward to see any of his movies, provided there are courageous people like Jackson to back him up financially.<br/><br/>Back to the movie, another review talked about kindred spirits. I disagree. When people get together out of necessity, that is not kinship, but rather pure selfishness. And if at the end there were clear moments of sacrifice and valor, it is a mistake to forget the smiling baby burner from the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The script wasn't perfect, but everything else bloody was. The music was nice, the actors played very well, the camera work was great (in fact, it is the only movie I've seen after Battlestar Galactica that uses cam motion in a useful, not irritating way) and the story was just wonderful. I changed my mind just now and marked it with a 10, rather than a 9. The movie deserves it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: an unlikely combination of Enemy Mine and The Constant Gardener (or at least this is like what it felt to me) that can't possibly not be liked. I highly recommend it."

The lack of imagination in the plot could have helped develop the underlying message - but I had certainly lost faith in why the film was made before anything was resolved.<br/><br/>But that can't take away the merits of the film - the successful CGI, and the anti-hero.

","Last night died and went to cinema heaven – District 9 is a work of absolute genius and one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. An unprecedented and totally successful fusion of action, intelligence and humour – stunningly realised. If you don't get a kick out of this film then there's probably something seriously wrong with you.<br/><br/>I'm just staggered at how well the film makers managed the fuse a variety of styles into a coherent (and enjoyable!) whole. Funnier than most comedies, smarter than most art-house pics, and the action and effects speak for themselves. Something that seems to be lost in the post as far as praise for this film goes is the incredible performance by Sharlto Copley – just like the film itself he managed to nail an entire spectrum of emotions, that by most conventions, would never even appear in the same movie. His character was grey-scale interesting and multi-layered enough to keep you interested in every decision he made.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so were just brilliant satire, this was followed by a slight lull before the film kicked in to an emotion-led edge-of- the-seat adrenaline rush. I was literally on the edge of my seat for the entire second hour – something I haven't experienced watching a film for a long long time.<br/><br/>There were a few problems of course – mainly in some of the supporting acting – the actors playing both the chief villains (the father-in-law and the merc) were poor, as was the actress playing the wife. A bit more care in casting would have worked to make the film near perfect in my eyes. Most other supporting actors were great and special mention should go to the guy who played the main 'documentary' talking head narrator – the best fake expert commentary acting I've ever seen – and believe me it's pretty hard to get that done well.<br/><br/>Yes there were 'plot-holes' but the whole world was so well realised that it didn't seem to even matter (or you just accepted that you weren't in full possession of the facts)<br/><br/>This film made me genuinely excited about cinema again – and I can't wait to see what Blomkamp does next."

But then, one wouldn't expect anything else from Weta.<br/><br/>There is an excellent central performance from Sharlto Copley, a 35-year old South African with almost no screen acting experience.<br/><br/>I wasn't over-keen on the ""Bourne""-isation of much of the visuals (enough now, thanks, can we please get back to using tripods?), I thought the start could have been usefully trimmed by a quarter of an hour or so, and I would have quite liked a stronger resolution.

"meeble-1","10","3","7","4 September 2009"," What a massive bunch of idiots the human race remains...
","Whether it was the general standard of films out this summer, District 9 stunned me into uninterrupted silence, setting my brain constantly thinking in ways that very few films this long can do. Seeing this with friends, I initially thought I'd been invited to another Transformers 2, a mess of a film with little plot, poor action sequences and self-indulgent CGI, but when the film commenced with documentary-style footage, something perked me up.<br/><br/>You probably know the premise of the film, otherwise I doubt you'd be reading the review, but it is based on the premise, that in 1982, an alien spaceship ended up hovering over Johannesburg and remained there for nearly 30 years. Meanwhile the inhabitants, aliens, were at first treated nicely, and given homes. Quickly falling to slum-status, MNU, a large munitions corporation attempts to move them to what is essentially a concentration camp, greedily trying to steal their advanced weaponry technology. Put in charge of the operation is Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), whose character development becomes an integral part of the film, displaying the selfishness and close-mindedness in all of us, and being someone with whom it's difficult not to relate. Sharlto Copley plays him very well, and it is incredibly refreshing to see such a mature performance from a very unrecognisable face.<br/><br/>It was very difficult when seeing the brief picture of what was essentially a concentration camp not to let the words 'Auschwitz' or 'Holocaust' spring to mind. Being set in South Africa as well, it was easy to be constantly comparing the fear of the aliens, known derogatorily as prawns, to Apartheid. The film made me actually think about what a bunch of idiots the human race remains. The anti-non-human signs displayed everywhere brought to mind the name 'Jim Crow'. Humans very simply acted in the film as they have done through history to that which we don't recognise or that which we fear, which was remarkably believable. It angered me to see the alien species treated with such abhorrence, even when I knew it was fiction.<br/><br/>While a few of my friends sat there laughing at the very good action sequences (understandable - they were well-directed) which nicely took nothing away from the story, it was great to take away a message from the film as well, that meant it seemed a nicely well-rounded film that's hard not to enjoy in some way."

"Otoboke","Null","3","7","4 September 2009"," Humanity?
","What do we mean when we refer to our humanity as a virtue? When criminals, races, societies or anyone remotely different from the cultural norm are deemed ""inhumane"" in their thoughts, actions or behaviours, we see them as monsters and entities quite separate from us—they are them, and we are us, and to the grand majority of those pointing fingers and segregating the minority this is human. In the world of District 9 then, which occupies a reality where extra-terrestrial beings (colloquially known as ""prawns"" because of their resemblance) have been habiting the Earth for close to 20 years in slums devised to keep them alive—if only barely and out of the way of the general human populace—this black and white cross-sectioning of what is human and what is alien becomes a literal source of conflict.<br/><br/>Like all great science-fiction, the heart of this story is not the ostensible plot lines involving devices like alien weaponry, government cover-ups or the aliens themselves rendered in masterful CG, but rather that allegorical subtext that drives the whole thing home. Sure enough, the aforementioned aspects are just as cohesive and compelling as that very substance that lies underneath and certainly shouldn't be ignored—but after countless ""science-fiction"" movies of the past decade merely concerned with cool effects and other-worldly exploit for the sake of it, it's the intelligence that subsides within the channels of District 9's subversive tale that defines it as its own work and brings it intro largely unexplored territory.<br/><br/>So what does it mean to be human? Many would claim that it's to have compassion, to be consciously driven by thought and free-will rather than impulses or reptilian habits of our less evolved ancestors. No matter how you look at it through the lens of District 9 however, there's a notable lack of such qualities in much of the movie's scenes involving us. Instead, there's a predominant sense of the opposite; of the barbaric, unfeeling, somewhat logical and cold side of our overwhelming naivety and obnoxious pride as a species; fearing becoming one of them, but at the same time wanting the greater parts of those we alienate (some going to more drastic means than others), humanity finds itself defending an empty shell of a concept.<br/><br/>This in turn, brings us to the protagonist of District 9's story, who comes in the form of Wikus Merwe, a representative and paper-pusher of an agency that deals with all alien affairs. Wikus is neither a good-guy or a bad-guy, he's just a guy. In the initial stages of the feature, the man is painted to a bit of a meek bureaucrat who takes no pleasure in killing the ""prawns"" akin to the battalion of hot-headed soldiers that looks after him on away missions, but certainly isn't one to question the morality of his job either which involves keeping the aliens under control through any means possible. As the movie progresses however and Wikus becomes more and more entwined within the fabric of the alien plight, his character takes on a startling transformation that is powerfully done, but not overly so. In this vein, District 9 rather rapidly tilts towards the action-survival side of things, and it's so expertly done that you really question when a movie made you feel this engaged and enthralled at the same time.<br/><br/>Much of the success of this character however has very little to do with all the social commentary, subtexts, plot-developments and special effects but rather through the tremendous performance by Sharlto Copley. Let it be known that this isn't a performance likely to be considered for an Oscar Nomination in that it doesn't demand intricacies and subtleties so lauded by the Academy, but instead asks for something completely human and so damn convincing that you feel this man's pain and the horror that he goes through; you believe in the entire world of District 9 because in more ways than one, he is essentially the sole heart of the movie that beats with any sort of resemblance to what we term humanity.<br/><br/>So what about the action? Well thankfully, I make claim without qualm that not only is the movie one of the smartest sci-fi movies to come out in recent years, but I can also testify that it's certainly amongst the biggest, loudest and most downright good-looking too. The action, which is saved mostly for the final act is riveting—the effects, never dominating the screen or drawing attention to themselves in an adverse fashion, work in ways that only the best of movies that employ them do so. There's explosions, futuristic weaponry, giant mechanoids, but most pleasing of all is that the aliens themselves look absolutely convincing and utterly fantastic in their animation and rendering details. Make no mistake; this one's smart and pretty.<br/><br/>So just what does this awkward mix of brains and brawn mean exactly? Well, it means you have one very compelling movie worthy of some serious praise and recognition. You see, only very rarely does this clashing of art, idea and cinematic excitement come together so eloquently and natural that you're simultaneously engaged in this fantastical world so far beyond your own imagination but at the same time brought crashing home to your own through use of allegory. This mixture gives District 9 its central motif of sorts in that with the prerequisite composition of humanity itself comes the good, the bad, and you guessed it, the ugly. Embodying this theme not just in subtext, but through the use of survival-action which brings out such shades of human nature explicitly, District 9 is undoubtedly a science-fiction masterpiece sure to be revered long after it closes on box offices and enters the pages of cinematic history. It's got adrenaline, but it's got heart and head too—the foundations of our humanity, and therefore the very foundations of film itself.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","I just saw this film Saturday August 30, 2009 and I'm definitely impressed. This film went way beyond my expectations I must say. Beyond ""E.T."" and ""Independence Day"" that's for sure. The amount of realism is excellent and one can actually find this plot very believable. This film is a mixture of ""The Fly"", ""E.T."" and a few other great sci-fi pieces, all blended together into a an actually very different film if you ask me. Neill Blomkamp did a great job here, creating a real sense of emotional tension rarely seen in sci-fi films these days. The film's odd yet unique choice of setting is one thing that sets it apart from other alien flicks that simply don't compare against something like this.<br/><br/>The story is extraordinarily well written and the characters are very moving with bad ass performances. Sharlto Copley , who plays the main protagonist, is a great choice and I love his role in the story. I don't want to spoil it since the film is still pretty new but you have to see this film!!! The action and drama plays as well as the sci-fi classics such as ""Alien"", original ""Star Wars"", and ""Terminator 2"". In reality, I won't be surprised if this film is soon considered one of these classics. Even as the film ends, one is so thrilled most, like myself, are praying Peter Jackson will provide some sort of sequel."

","What can I say. I'm not sure what just happened. Sitting here I feel like I've just witnessed something extraordinary - but I can't quite put together what it is. Being a film student at AFDA in Cape Town, I can see the relation to the style of South African films - specifically with regard to the human complexion, and how we expose the darker side of it. Showing just a segment of a story is also commonplace here, finite endings are outlandish. South African filmmakers are very good at 'revealing whats really going on', most especially with regards to abuse in our own country; unlike many Hollywood films which have the tendency to promote the good parts of America, how great it is and how cool the characters are. We on the other hand, are not used to seeing such spectacular CGI in our films, and hopefully this new 'global production team' movement will open up a lot more opportunities like this for us. A stellar performance by Sharlto Copley and an amazing production all around. <br/><br/>Well done boys."

I loved the way Blomkamp and company allowed the extraterrestrial race to essentially express traits that were so compelling, you would actually forget that these creatures were from another world and yet at the same time, no different than us Human beings here on Earth. I was also taken aback with how clever and original District 9 portrays the level of nationalism and xenophobia that pits Human beings against ""illegal aliens"" and also parallels the VERY REAL world problem of the treatment of ""illegal"" immigrants. We seem to forget that people from elsewhere in this world that ""illegally"" make their way in to another country are also in fact, Human, and should be treated as nothing less than such. <br/><br/>It is a plague that affects humanity, indeed.<br/><br/>District 9 reminds the viewer that despite cultural differences, differences in behavior, differences in appearance, differences in country of origin, galaxy of origin, that we are all similar, and that compassion and tolerance should never be ignored...

","As the summary suggests, this movie features a solid premise, very able acting, and a sensible script. The plot is fairly well thought through and each scene follows from the last. The director must have done a fabulous job because I really couldn't predict the events of the movie. It didn't lock itself into a hero-movie path.<br/><br/>The character-driven nature of this film is one of its best characteristics, and as a rare treat for an action movie I was able to emotionally invest in the fate of the lead characters. This extra quality offsets the typical action, and more than makes up for some of the slightly more clichéd elements within the show. Thankfully though, they did not follow any formula closely.<br/><br/>It *does* have some faults. There are moments when plot or scene logic doesn't hold up to serious scrutiny, and while the action is well-done, it does have a few of those ""why doesn't he just..."" moments. That won't matter to you though because you'll be so intrigued with having a cinematic experience that treats you like a thinking person that you won't even bother to think about HOW the logic is incomplete or how the action should have been done. The foibles are sufficiently minor and the movie keeps moving forward.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is with the camera work. The shaky camera effect was used in places I felt it unjustified. Certainly some of the film is believable with the hand-held quality but many parts make that really inappropriate and distracting.<br/><br/>This movie is intelligent, and I beg for a sequel. I want that sequel to be a continuation of the story, with the same high calibre acting, attention to script quality (that's so important), and not blown way out of proportion and made horrid like sequels normally are.<br/><br/>Thank you, everyone who contributed to District 9. This movie did not disappoint!"
"jdnmichele","8","3","7","24 August 2009"," Loved the open ended possibilities
","I really enjoyed this movie, specifically the points where things were not explained surrounding Chris Johnson (is that his name?). He was clearly more knowledgeable than many other aliens which lead me to think of him as either the only surviving leader or just an extraordinarily capable member of the worker class. There's no way to prove that, but based on the relationship with his son, the fact that his friend seemed to have difficulty identifying his own alien technology, his understanding of legality and the reaction he had to the surgical experiments it was just easy to see him as someone with a lot of regret and an ability to forgive.<br/><br/>Some posters want everything explained, what was wrong with the ship?, why didn't the workers fight back? It was more interesting for me the think about plausible reasons those things might happen. Some movies are lazy and just ask you to makes leaps of faith. I don't think District 9 was one of them. It just made you work a little bit."
"stzzo","7","3","7","22 August 2009"," Worth the matinée
","I'm amazed at the reviews complaining about it being unrealistic. What SciFi is realistic? Certainly not Star Wars, Star Trek, Terminator, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner ... I think some of the reviewers have forgotten that SciFi stands for ""Science FICTION"".<br/><br/>And it's not SciFi because it doesn't explore alien worlds? Come on. Some of these reviewers are pretty uptight.<br/><br/>The ""hand-held cam"" wasn't too bad by my taste (less than that in Blair Witch Project).<br/><br/>It's particular style of movie; if you don't like that style, you won't like it. They do say ""f*ck"" a lot. The South Africans speak with an accent (surprise!), so if you have difficulty understanding South African or African accents, you'll miss some things. If you need extensive character development, stimulating dialogue, famous actors, or realism, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>I thought the ""documentary style"" was refreshing. The action was good & fun. The aliens were interesting.<br/><br/>I love SciFi, but a lot of the stuff I've seen lately bores me (I'm 42 / male). It was the best SciFi movie I've seen in a while."
"Royalcourtier","9","3","7","22 August 2009"," Good film, but vaguely disappointing
","Before seeing this film I read the reviews, watched the trailer and the short film on which the film was based. I was expecting a different type of sci-fi, something rather unusual and perhaps even intelligent.<br/><br/>The film was generally as good as I had expected, but I was left with a feeling of disappointment. It wasn't as good as it could have been. There were a lot of details, many regarding the plot, which could have been dealt with better.<br/><br/>=Spoliers=<br/><br/>The documentary approach was a great idea, but resulted in a rather unprofessional feel to much of the film. It needed a defter touch to work.<br/><br/>The device of placing an ""everyman"" in a central position, well beyond his abilities, and then seeing him respond to adversity was good. But the blatant nepotism that got him there was ridiculously far-fetched.<br/><br/>The idea of an alien spaceship sitting motionless above Joburg for 20 years was good, but the consequences of that were not well thought through.<br/><br/>The implication is that the million or so aliens were simply planted on vacant land and left to look after themselves. They were fenced in, but there was no sign of any accommodation being built, food supplied, or any organisation set up. We know that the aliens were leaderless, so why was no leadership provided? There is no explanation as to why a private multi-national organisation should be responsible for running (or rather not running) the camp. There is apparently no government or UN involvement at all.<br/><br/>This camp is in the middle of South Africa's biggest city, a city teeming with indigenous black gangs. Yet ""Nigerians"" set up a criminal black market, and seem to supply all the food consumed in the district. An obvious device to avoid political criticism. But we all know that crime is rampant in South Africa, so it would have been better to have had local villains, rather than artificially passing the buck to the Nigerians.<br/><br/>Is it credible that the authorities, or rather MNU, should allow ""Nigerians"" to openly collect alien weapons, especially when the company desperately wants them?<br/><br/>When, after an incredible 20 years, it is decided that the aliens should be moved to a purpose-built camp, there is no sign of any organisation or planning to actually move them. Simply a quasi-military invasion. The convoy of Casspirs seem to been there solely to accompany Wikus, who seems to have been personally serving eviction notices on all of the inhabitants. An earlier office meeting suggests others are involved, but they are not seen or referred to.<br/><br/>Although the inhabitants are given 24 hours notice to move, there is no attempt thereafter to move any of them.<br/><br/>Although the aliens are fenced in, they seem to freely roam into ""non-Alien"" areas, we are led to presume to rape and kill (and eat) humans. Wickus also has no trouble getting through the fence. So what is the purpose of the fence if it don't work?<br/><br/>There are supposedly millions of aliens, yet we never see more than a handful at a time. No crowd scenes. If there is rioting in the townships, there should be crowds.<br/><br/>When Wikus is infected, he is treated worse than a lab rat would be. The company may be utterly ruthless, but it also comes across as utterly incompetent.<br/><br/>The ""colonel"" is a stereotypical homicidal military nutter, all bluster and aggression. Totally unrealistic.<br/><br/>Finally, the aliens had been preparing enough fuel to enable the ""command module"" to fly to the mothership. Not enough fuel to power the mothership itself. Yet once the command module was activated it was drawn to the mothership may magnetism, and didn't even need its own power. If the mothership itself could return home, why didn't it take the rest of the aliens with it?<br/><br/>If I had been Peter Jackson, and doing my job, I would have sent the plot summary back to Neill, and told him to sort out the details. Instead he seems to have closed his eyes and finished a half-baked idea. The possibility of a sequel is left open. Next time I hope that a more experienced director is used, or at least that the plot and script be given more careful thought."

The entire movie was incredibly depressing, dark, dirty, and very uninteresting to even hold me as a viewer! It tried this very fast paced movie style to bring you in to this story and parallel world yet didn't grab me at all? Wasn't the least bit interested or cared about these people or aliens!

The hype for the film also rose. I waited each day for the rating to show on IMDb, and finally it came. Top 250 in it's first few days. I had to watch it. And I was blown away. On a budget of $30 million, the effects and direction were brilliant. Better than the garbage camera work of transformers 2. Shot with subtlety and a believable plot, it will rise in the ranks for top sci-fi films.

"rosborne979","8","3","7","17 August 2009"," An unusual Sci-Fi film
","This is one of the few (if any) sci-fi movies I've ever seen in which the basic plot and theme of the movie have virtually nothing to do with science fiction, and instead focus on human qualities and weaknesses, which may be why (I predict) the critics will like it so much.<br/><br/>During the movie, we learn very little about the aliens, their (obviously advanced) technology, their biology or their culture. Instead the movie focuses on the human aspects of the story and the growth of the characters (alien and human).<br/><br/>While this is bad news for me (personally) because the sci-fi aspects of the story (alien science, technology and culture) are what I enjoy the most about sci-fi movies, other viewers will probably find that the strength of the ""human"" qualities of the story are compelling enough to drive the story, and by the end the human and alien characters have grown on you enough to get you emotionally involved in the climax. And that's what a movie should do.<br/><br/>This movie takes a long time to establish the characters and the situation so I found the first half kind of slow, but it builds to a nice crescendo and it's all worth it in the end. And they give themselves a big fat setup for a sequel in three years.<br/><br/>My rating of 8 out of 10, is based mostly on the strength of the underlying theme, the acting and realistic (gritty) documentary style of filming. If there had been more detail about the aliens themselves this would have been a ""10"" for me."
"jaredmobarak","9","3","7","16 August 2009"," There's many secrets in  District 9
","Remember those great Mechwarrior-like short films that sprang up as a sort of resume reel when Jackson shone the light onto this South African filmmaker? No? Okay, well maybe I'm that much of a geek, but everything he did in those test shoots has been brought to the big leagues with the precision and handling of a seasoned professional. Taking place in the Johannesburg slum of District 9, the quartered off area housing our alien ""visitors"" since 1982, the film is shot documentary style as the MNU, (Multi-National United), go through the process of relocating them to a safer place outside the city—safer for the South African citizens that is. The section of land has become a cesspool of these ""prawns"" as they scavenge, fight, and barter with the local Nigerian crimelords, trading their highly sophisticated weaponry, (that can't be used by humans due to their biological components), for the delicacy that is cat food. Think Alien Nation meets Cloverfield in a story about race relations and you'll begin to comprehend the vision put forth. I'll just say the locale of Blomkamp's hometown for this tale is not coincidental  the Apartheid allusions are fairly obvious to see.<br/><br/>Discovered malnourished and scared, the South African government brought them down to the surface and even learned their language. It was never to assimilate and educate, however, but only to understand, hope to steal their technology, and capture them for medical experiments. The MNU isn't only an establishment for the safe keeping of societal bliss over the fence; no, it is also one of the leading manufacturers of weaponry and military goods. Everyone has an ulterior motive; it's the name of the game.<br/><br/>Caught in the middle of it all is Wikus Van De Merwe, played with poise and experience by Sharlto Copley. It is his only credited role for which I can see and man does it deliver. At first a simple pawn married to the MNU head's daughter, he can appear to be a bit on the dull end of sharp, yet his face is never without a smile, endearing him to his men. He is assigned to head up the eviction committee that will go door to door and serve each prawn its notice of relocation. Followed by a cameraman and accompanied by a new trainee, as well as a soldier he knows, the foursome start their rounds and discover hidden arms holdings, understanding aliens, hostile aliens, and new technology that can only be nefarious. The opening remarks by interviewees alludes to an incident involving Witkus, one that many can't believe he partook in, one that may or may not have resulted in his death due to the multiple uses of the past tense. It doesn't take long before the catalyst to these new feelings of hatred and sorrow for a man loved by all occurs, bringing him into a world of darkness, but also one of understanding—putting his differences aside to work with the aliens. For someone with a clear hatred of the prawn kind, he still sees them as more that just an animal. One can't deny their intelligence or the fact of their cognitive abilities, making them possibly more advanced than humanity itself.<br/><br/>It is Copley that makes the film what it is through his evolution as a man. The transformation he takes from a weak idealist cowering from the army man who is technically in his control to the confident fighter willing to risk his life for the cause of moral righteousness is unavoidable. You won't believe at the end when cuts to his later self are juxtaposed with earlier footage before the relocation program that they are the same person. War can do funny things to a man, especially when the sides are blurred and the idea of what's right and wrong becomes flipped. As his counterpart, however, mention needs to be made for the amazing visual effects. The aliens he encounters are rendered beautifully and fit in their environments as though they are real flesh and blood. Blomkamp even finds room to include one of his Mechwarrior-esquire creations as an alien-made suit. These creatures show emotion and seamlessly integrate with the live actors to make the plausibility of everything happening real.<br/><br/>District 9 asks the question of how far we as a race will go for power. If a technology is discovered that is so advanced it can only be used by the enemy, to what lengths can one be willing to live with in order to adopt its use for ourselves? What if one of us is inexplicably turned into a hybrid creature, one with the humanity necessary to fight for good but the biology to use those weapons that are destroying us? Would the government help that person and treat him with respect and worth, or would they look upon him as an abomination, valuable only as a control subject to be poked, prodded, and eventually dismembered in an effort to mass produce? You'd like to think that as a people we have evolved to the point where compassion and understanding can trump any fears and insecurities we may have, but history begs to tell a different story. Throughout time we have oppressed and experienced the drive for power and leadership. By using a legion from another far away planet, Blomkamp has put a mirror up to the world, showing it its true colors. Can a movie make a difference? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the political undertones are there to make viewers think afterwards and the action packed journey of a man without a home keeps them in their seats with a riveting and thrilling tale told through a singular vision. See Hollywood? Sometimes fresh new ideas can not only push the limits of the medium, but also become huge critical and financial successes."
"Lemniscate433","8","3","7","16 August 2009"," Budget: 30 million
","I watched the film thinking how on the face of this planet could the director and producer only used 30 million to create this film and still create wonderful visual effects. Maybe it is the absence of big name actors. Maybe Peter Jackson knew people who can charge less money. No, it is not that; it was creativeness that made the movie so cheap and I put Einstein on the spotlight with his famous quote, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" And if you are confused how that can be, than watch District 9 and you will find out.<br/><br/>The basis of the film is that twenty years ago, an alien ship landed in the middle of South Africa and had alien refugees in the ship. The government was kind enough to bring these aliens into a refugee camp and the government believed that soon, the aliens will fix the ship and be able to get out of Earth. But after twenty years, nothing happens except the aliens start acting up and riot, wanting to go back home. So the MNU (Multi-National United) decide to take care of the aliens and throw them into an area called District 9. They not only abuse the aliens, but also attempt to learn about their arsenal and technology. Of course, the aliens refuse to give it up. So a brave, yet moronic man named Wilkus van der Mwere who is part of the of the MNU goes out to District 9...<br/><br/>And I have to stop there because a true experience of the film is to watch the movie without knowing anymore than what I said.<br/><br/>The first act of the film was in a documentary format which made this alien concentration life seem more realistic to a human perspective. What really made me proud was to see new time director, Neill Blomkamp, use some documentary film making in this movie because topics such as alien invasions and documentaries were never melded together before like it is shown in this movie. The director created a movie that not only stuck to what the audience likes to see on the big screen, but also to experiment and go a bit progressive into the idea of the science fiction genre such as a documentary filming in the first act.<br/><br/>The visuals effects were fantastic, which is not surprising considering Peter Jackson produced the film who is known for visual movies such as Lord of the Rings and the King Kong remake. The aliens looked realistic, the weapon firing were outstanding and the cinematography was another great highlight. Every bit of the 3M budget was obviously for the special effects, and it was used very well. Also, the story line was well developed and because it was complex, and it really got the audience and I engaged in what was going on. The story line also connected with real-life issues such as racism, apartheid, or xenophobia which I believe should be the basis for good science-fiction movies, a connection to human flaws and set in a grungy future of the Earth.<br/><br/>District 9 is what we would call ""The Matrix"" ten years ago, ""Terminator"" twenty years ago, ""Alien"" thirty years ago, and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" forty years ago. A science-fiction action film that used progressive and advanced camera styles and also went above and beyond into the world of the science fiction genre. And who better to be connected to the next movie that would do this visual effects revolution than Peter Jackson/Neil Blomkamp. I hope this team will perform another spectacular science fiction opus in the near future and Neil Blomkamp has said that he will revisit the District 9 world someday. <br/><br/>The only thing is that if you do not appreciate science-fiction, then this is not the movie for you. The movie is for serious science-fiction lovers like me. Only for viewers who enjoyed Alien, Terminator, The Thing, and all of the science-fiction classics. This movie will become a classic many years from now. You have to watch this movie on the big screen because it was meant for the big screen. I do not know why the movie was not in an IMAX format because that would have upped the ante even more. The film is going to lend itself to a sequel and hopefully the sequel will be just as I hope it will be. Well directed, well produced, well filmed, kick-ass, and in IMAX (hopefully)."
"johnnymacbest","10","3","7","16 August 2009"," Original and emotionally gripping from start to finish.
","With the recent decline in quality of summer sci-fi blockbusters (Transformers 2, anyone?), it's nice to see a film such as ""District 9"" that's original and groundbreaking; with a universe and a web of intrigue that you've never seen before in the sci-fi genre. I won't spoil any details of the plot but I will tell you this: This film is the most emotionally gripping and horrifying experience I've ever had this year. Some parts of the film were unintentionally funny, giving it dose of black comedy that works really well with the grimy, dilapidated slums of South Africa with performances by Wikus Van De Merwe, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copeley. In addition to the well-written script and beautiful direction lies some very original creature designs seemingly inspired by the Cthulu mythos of H.P Lovecraft fame which that are truly terrifyingly realistic. But beneath all the great aspects of this film is the heart of the film showing the good and bad of both sides of the conflict bringing in touching moments of heroism and justice, racial intolerance, isolation, and brutality. Some of the violence is really shocking and disturbing so I advise parents not to let their kids see this one because some of what's up there on screen will really give them nightmares. <br/><br/>I have to say this is if you want to see a thought-provoking, original, and gripping sci-fi film, see District 9. One of the best films in the genre of this year."

","I had to sign up in order to post this comment, something I don't usually do. I do not want to create a review with all the negative hyperbole that keeps you from reading this since I feel it is important for the reader to see another point of view that is opposing the majority of the reviews for this film. I cannot say the film was awful since I believe that the CGI stuff was quite good and the actual acting seemed to be OK. However, the story line was, at best, predictable; even to the most casual observer. There were many confusing aspects such as: 1. How did the aliens and humans know what each was saying? 2. Why did the aliens, who clearly are superior in technology, end up in a ""concentration"" camp completely subservient to humans? 3. Since the aliens were capable of interstellar travel why did they all of a sudden get ""stuck"" on earth? 4. Why didn't the aliens simply use their superior weapons to overtake humanity? And the list seems to go on. My son and I did agree that this movie will make a great game and will expect to see the same on the market soon. Is that why this film was made? Way too much inconsistency in what could have been a really neat film. Lots of social and racial commentary that was unnecessary or poorly done. The concept of a documentary was good but could have been better realized without so much camera wiggle which ultimately becomes irritating and for some, as I have read, physically sickening. There was, unfortunately little about this film that I enjoyed and I have to say that at film's end my wife and son both agreed. View at your own risk."

The main character is a terrible actor (he has never acted before, and it shows). I can't understand what this character is saying throughout most of the movie. He sounds like he is attempting to improvise, but he is no good at it. The best part of this movie is the little son alien.

"theolein","9","4","11","24 May 2010"," SF as brilliant allegory
","The basic plot of this film is well known. An alien space ship stops over Johannesburg, South Africa in the 80s. Its crew are found to be near starving and unable to properly control the ship. The aliens are resettled in segregated camps in Johannesburg, and twenty years later, as their situation has deteriorated to leave them helpless, feared and hated by South Africans, black and white, in a delicious, ironic poke at South Africa's Apartheid history, they are about to be resettled in camps further away from humans.<br/><br/>The plot involves a civil servant type of man of the company contracted to oversee the aliens carrying out an eviction, how he becomes infected with an alien substance (that the aliens ironically need to fly their ships) and gradually starts changing into one of them. His trials and tribulations and, one could say, his final discovery of his own humanity as he aids the aliens' flight from their brutal human pursuers, amongst truly violent and gory action scenes is what makes the movie.<br/><br/>I am a South African, who, like Neill Blomkamp emigrated from South Africa during the last violent days of Apartheid, but, in what is perhaps also similar to Blomkamp's views, has come to realise that Apartheid, racism, fear and hatred of things you don't understand is not a South African phenomenon.<br/><br/>I see many people, especially many Americans, expressing a great deal of anger towards this film in the reviews, and that makes me think above all that this film is a success. Not because it angers so many Americans, but why it does so.<br/><br/>Some of the negative reactions are based on what is pretty obviously the factor that many Americans have extremely stereotypical views of what the rest of the world is like, and a movie like this shakes that belief. They feel upset that America isn't the centre of attention for a change. This is a good thing in my opinion.<br/><br/>Another negative reaction, this one not restricted to the above mentioned people, is the feeling that the special effects should somehow be shinier, more pronounced and that the technology should be more in the foreground. To them, I can only say that this wasn't a film for action-tech nerds, and that they should look elsewhere, chiefly at Hollywood, which releases dozens of films that rely on special effects for want of a real story.<br/><br/>A similar grouping of people dislike the film due to its violence, gore and copious use of abusive language. To those I suggest they turn on the TV and watch any, really any, real world violent situation. When people are being shot at and dying, or in utter desperation to some catastrophic situation in their lives, polite language is usually not the first thing that comes to their minds.<br/><br/>The final group of negative reactions, and perhaps the saddest ones of all, are the people who see ""aliens"" and immediately wonder how a star-travelling race could sink to such a level of depravity and revulsion, why they couldn't simply switch on the death ray, get back in the pilot seat, evaporate the humans and fly away.<br/><br/>To those people I point to so many instances of human behaviour in our current technical world where we still fail to live according to principle. Would passengers on a crashed jet liner know how to fly the plane? Have not previously civilised groups of people acted with utter barbarity to other people before? Hint: Nazi Germany, Cambodia, Vietnam, Iraq, Rwanda etc.<br/><br/>Why would aliens be any different? And why should they be any different when part of the purpose of the film is allegory to point out exactly that fact, that barbarity and cruelty is not a preserve of ""them"", the others, and that today's oppressed can become tomorrows oppressors? I think this film is a fantastic success, and its amazing to see fresh, local faces giving more spontaneous performances than spoilt Hollywood bratlets."

","I loved the trailers for this movie and really made an effort to go see it when it the first weekend it came out.I rarely go see movies at theaters and almost never try to go the first weekend one opens but this one looked cool so I gave up a Saturday night to go see it.<br/><br/>A huge alien spacecraft becomes disabled and its one million occupants ,yes one million,are put in camps,sort of like the camps where human refugees are put now.The big mother craft just hangs up in the sky low to the ground unable to move.Soon the camps become like any other camp where beings are forced to live in squalid conditions--crime ridden and violence filled hell holes.The aliens are sort of big insect looking things.Most of the movie is told from the viewpoint of the man who was put in charge of relocating the aliens when the camp becomes too much of a problem being located near a large human population.<br/><br/>I didn't really understand why a million of these things would be flying around in space and how you would get a million in the spacecraft they came to Earth with.Their home planet apparently wasn't destroyed because some of the more industrious aliens were trying to get back to the mother ship and fix it so they could get back home.And they can build this incredible massive flying craft then they appear stupid and lazy when the are in the camps....eating cans of cat food which were used as currency in some cases,and also eating old tires.The whole cat food business was just stupid and silly and distracting.I think I would have liked the movie better had the aliens been more menacing,instead of the dullards they were.<br/><br/>The film is done in a sort of documentary type although it doesn't hold too strictly to this style.The action is good when it finally starts and the special effects are pretty cool with space guns that explode people and stuff like that.And the big space craft looked cool hanging in the sky.But overall the movie was rather bland and boring in dealing with this problem of space alien refugees.<br/><br/>Maybe the whole point was to deal with these aliens like we humans deal with other human refugees but if you are going to do that why use space aliens? This wasn't a bad film.It just didn't live up to it's potential and certainly not to it's trailers.I wish I had my $8.25 back I paid to see this movie.That would rent me 4 DVDs of movies that would be at least,if not more,interesting than this movie was.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a six which to me means a decent watchable film but nothing that you'll remember as being extraordinary enough to go out and buy when it's released to DVD."

","Sympathetic characters, nice effects and not much else. The main character does a good job of drawing the audience in emotionally. The special effects are excellent and do a great job of creating a world and scenario that is believable. Beyond that the film is unremarkable. The story shows some early promise of exploring deeper issues, such as the conditions of refugees around the world but then the movie turns into a fairly predictable action/drama. I did appreciate the lack of ridiculous dialog. It never felt like they created a scene just to insert a one-liner that could then become a trailer. It was well-crafted in terms of setting and the look of the aliens and didn't feel like a waste of time, but I won't be rushing out to see it again."

","This film is completely overrated. Although it has an interesting concept and visuals, what destroys the film is the main character. The main character is annoying and hugely unlikeable. Because of this I do not feel any sympathy for him throughout the film. <br/><br/>The story is simplistic but a simple story doesn't affect the film's quality if it is done in an interesting and entertaining way. The film tried to do this by adding interviews in the style a documentary. The film loses points for this because I feel this only works for films to add some realism. Considering the fact this is a science fiction film, this technique doesn't fit in my opinion. The science fiction genre allows the possibility to show the world with visuals rather than being told about it (2001 and Blade Runner are excellent examples of visual storytelling in the sci-fi genre).<br/><br/>3/10."

","In a plot designed to mirror apartheid, a race of extraterrestrials arrive in Jo'burg where they are segregated from the humans in a ramshackle slum known as District 9. After 20 years, with tension rising between the races, it is decided that the aliens (known derisively as 'prawns') should be relocated further away from the city; city official Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is given the task of overseeing the operation, but things go awry after he is exposed to alien biotechnology that slowly mutates his body.<br/><br/>Writer/director Neill Blomkamp's first full length feature is such a technically slick film that it's is easy to forgive its glaring plot holes. The story can be picked apart like a king prawn, but Blomkamp's assured storytelling and expertise in visual effects ensure that, even though certain elements make little sense when given too much thought, the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience from start to finish. Solid performances (anyone who lets the South African accent bother them should stick to mainstream Hollywood films) and superb CGI (especially when considering the budget) go a long way to making this a hugely enjoyable piece of popcorn fun despite the obvious flaws."

I did not understand what the aliens were about, and how they interacted with humans all these years. We know nothing about that Nigerian (?) gang that sells cat food / trades weapons with the aliens.<br/><br/>In the plus column, though: the aliens were cool by design. Quite realistic.

"piratecannon","9","2","4","26 December 2012"," See it. Now.
","District 9 probably isn't what you think it is. If you've seen any of the trailers or recent TV spots for the film, one might expect that it's a slightly more intelligent version of Independence Day. Ominous shots of an alien mother ship hovering above Johannesburg have no doubt fueled speculation that this Neill Blomkamp/Peter Jackson collaboration is a movie that's strangely ""arthouse"" in its aspirations, which are awkwardly offset by the inclusion of what appears to be a fair amount of mainstream Hollywood-type alien/human warfare. Forget all that. It's a piece of cinema that's not flawless, but it's very close–it's a movie I could talk about all day, but it's something that you need to experience to truly appreciate.<br/><br/>If you want my thesis, though, here it is: District 9 is an alien epic that's simultaneously exhilarating and affecting. Even though it occasionally surrenders to certain filmmaking and storytelling clichés, this is a must-see film for any fan of science fiction, and it's commentary on racism, prejudice, and the inherent violence found in all organic beings makes it, in a few brief, gut-wrenching moments, as thought-provoking as anything else out there.<br/><br/>The aliens in this movie, known as ""prawns,"" were extracted from their ship by humans after it came to Earth and showed no signs of activity, floating quietly over South Africa, for a long period of time. It turns out that the prawn were malnourished, stranded, and didn't have anywhere else to go. Because of their large numbers (somewhere on the order of 1.5 million), it was decided that they be kept in a restricted area known as District 9 for their own well being.<br/><br/>During an attempt to relocate the prawn, our protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, an employee of an organization titled Multi-National United (MNU), is accidentally sprayed in the face with a prawn biochemical. Soon, he starts having a really bad day (in true Peter Jackson fashion, I might add, that's directly reminiscent of one of his especially gory features–the classic Dead Alive). Before long, it's clear that the MNU has a more sinister motive for keeping the prawn in captivity, and the whole thing essentially becomes one long chase film (albeit a wonderfully crafted one).<br/><br/>When the movie begins, the story unfolds in the form of a documentary, but, as the action is amped up, Blomkamp opts for the more traditional method of directing, and we're allowed to see things that could never be revealed via documentary. On the whole I think the decision to shift the mode the story is told in is a good one, but there are times where, in the middle of the action, the perspective reverts back to that of a documentary. When this happens, it often seems as if it's done for a sense of continuity–it doesn't really add anything to the story itself, and seems to be more of a stylistic decision. I suppose this is a minor gripe, but it can be a little distracting. I think the movie would've benefited from having a contained documentary placed exclusively at the beginning that explains the origin of the prawn–the random switch-back to the ""security camera/handycam"" view, especially in the heat of the action, could interrupt the trance District 9 will undoubtedly have you in. There are also one or two ""Hollywood"" moments that may have you rolling your eyes–especially when they're in stark contrast with the realism found at the beginning of the movie–but the story is so cleverly constructed and the transition into a more traditional mode of storytelling is so subtle that it ultimately shouldn't hinder most people's enjoyment of District 9. In fact, it will make a movie that could've been alienating–please forgive the horrible pun–accessible for a wider audience that might otherwise be put-off by the unusual approach Blomkamp initially takes in terms of telling this particular story.<br/><br/>In light of all that District 9 accomplishes, the minor flaws I've just referenced almost completely disappear. The attention to detail, for example, in the movie is staggering; everything from the prawn technology (you can see the moving parts in each and every weapon) to the strikingly human emotion incorporated into the beautifully rendered CGI creatures will mesmerize you. Blend this with some strong acting from Sharlto Copley and the universal theme of bigotry (and how it's handled) and you'll see why many critics have praised this as the best piece of sci-fi to come along in quite some time.<br/><br/>So, despite my nitpicking, I absolutely loved this movie. It's an almost flawless piece of sci-fi cinema–it's emotionally engaging, thought provoking, and is filled with original, jaw-dropping technology and action. I want so badly to comment on how much I loved the ending, too, and what it suggestsbut I won't do that because I would be doing District 9 a severe disservice. The only way to appreciate this movie is to get out of your chair and go see it. Now."

","Blomkamp does the amazing by combing roller coaster excitement with an intelligent context that makes all the noise about something. While some of the ideas are occasionally heavy handed or on the nose, it's so exciting to see a Hollywood action film that traffics in ideas, that I'm willing to forgive the occasional 'I get it already' moment, or logic lapse, or easy coincidence, or mediocre supporting performance. <br/><br/>The story is simple. A million plus grotesque looking, starving and sickly aliens get stranded on Earth when they essentially run out of fuel. And while at first humans try to reach out in friendship, before long corporations are trying to make money by exploiting their technology (especially, or course, their weapons) and the aliens are herded into a 'district' and walled in. (That the film is set in South Africa is one of those choices that feels like gilding the lily – even though that is the film-makers home). And it's clear that progressing from apartheid to Nazi style medical experiments and concentration camps is the next step. <br/><br/>While I wish the villains were less mustache twirling (some 'banality of evil' would have been even more chilling), the effects are great, and it's a film that grew, not shrank as it went along.

","When I first saw District 9 back in 2009 at the theater, I was satisfied, it was the first time in a long time that I felt satisfied by a Sci-Fi movie, since The Matrix maybe. I must admit that these last 2 or 3 years have been great for the Sci-Fi genre. Though most of the recent Sci-Fi flicks are as elegant and well crafted as District 9.<br/><br/>On the same year we had Avatar, Star Trek, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and District 9, all of them visually impressive, yes, all of them good, almost. Avatar is a visual masterpiece that manages to stay entertaining for two and a half hours and Star Trek gave us such an interesting shift to the usual sluggish pace of the Star Trek movies, without losing content nor sense. Transformers: ROTF on the other hand is a trashy movie that does not deserve to share the same genre as the 2 before mentioned movies.<br/><br/>And last but of course not least, the movie I am reviewing, District 9, it avoids the convetionalisms of trashy, cheesy Sci-Fi, by not giving us an attractive male lead with a perfect body and smile and flooding with altruism, instead we get a complex anti-hero, that is cruel at times, ignorant and even coward, that most of the time is looking for his own well being without thinking about others, it also avoids the conventionalism of having trashy, stupid, repetitive humor as well as a ''well known'' background location, like New York, Los Angeles, etc. It is decidedly original, from the background, to the lead character, to the premise and story, which are by far the best and strongest elements from the movie. For those who have already seen the movie, you know what I am talking about, but for those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it, because, just as it pleasantly surprised me, I want you to be surprised by the freshness and originality of this film. Granted, some will say it was already been done, but not like this, not with this setting, not with these characters, not with such a coherent and well crafted script. You'll get the action and suspense we all appreciate from Sci-Fi, but you will also get a complex, realistic character development study, you'll find plenty of smart, interesting allegories and clever and even funny dialog and even very sweet romance if you are willing to understand.<br/><br/>I've compared the movie to the contemporary Sci-Fi movies, because it is the easiest way to demonstrate that this is truly the Sci-Fi masterpiece of our times. Just one year later we got a Sci-Fi pretentious, overrated, incoherent movie by Christopher Nolan that claims to be a masterpiece, please avoid it, don't waste your money nor 2 and a half hours of your time, when you can enjoy of a true masterpiece with District 9, if you are a lover of clever, creative and original Sci-Fi, do yourself a favor and rent District 9, it is worth it.<br/><br/>10/10 Superb acting, direction, photography, sound, visuals."

"colinrgeorge","6","2","4","6 April 2010"," ""District 9""
","""District 9"" has all the subtlety of an exploding carcass. Neil Blomkamp's UFO apartheid metaphor sounds in theory like the sort of relevant, sophisticated shot in the arm the science fiction blockbuster needs, and addresses some very important issues beneath the laser shoot-outs and gooey, extrapolating body matter, but suffers from ham-fisted pretension when digging below its surface.<br/><br/>The film has smart people behind the lens but condescendingly assumes the other side their antithesis. The characters, especially our protagonist, government operative Wilkus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), lack dimension and rationale, presented as either broad caricatures of racist idealism or doe-eyed alien innocents. The audience, however, is guessed simpler still. The movie's humans have inexplicably learned to comprehend the alien tongue (and vice versa) but we're not even trusted to follow an English conversation with South African dialect without the aid of subtitles.<br/><br/>The movie's delusions of grandeur are its greatest flaw, and like ""Paper Heart,"" the documentary elements of the film supplement a thoroughly average narrative. Blomkamp's intentions may be nobler than those of comparable popcorn flicks, but the execution is just as forgettable, its impression just as transient. And though ""District 9"" was advertised heavily as a documentary, the film itself is a mixed media experiment, unmotivated camera placement and all. Conventional action is shot in a hand-held documentary style, and any insightful social commentary is relegated to the back burner when things blow up, and they frequently do.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is not without its merits, however. The visuals are (usually) impressive, with the foggy, leering mother ship subtly creeping into the edges of shots, and convincing facial detail for the prawns. The effects falter only occasionally (in a ""Star Wars: Special Edition"" kind of way) in wider shots where the aliens occupy the same space as the humans or we see their narrow, multi-jointed legs: they don't quite exist on the same plane as the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's direction is stronger than his pretentious writing, and individual sequences excel at creating excitement and suspense. However, the oversimplification of the underlying message and the on-the-nose symbolism make most scenes too generic to be profound, and when an investigatory mistake begins transforming Wilkus into a prawn (a derogatory term for the other-worlders), the plot becomes less a detailed examination of an intriguing supposition than a hodgepodge of schlocky action sequences and allusions to John Howard Griffin's ""Black Like Me"" and David Cronenberg's ""The Fly.""<br/><br/>Based on the director's six minute 2005 short ""Alive in Joburg,"" ""District 9"" ultimately gasps for identity over the nearly two hour running time. With its smattering of documentary-esquire interview footage, conventional narrative sequences, and gory action, there's not a want for material so much as there is for thematic singularity. Employing a foundation more relevant than Campbell's mono-myth is a welcome template for a modern science fiction film, but ""District 9"" brings as many clichés to the table as innovations.<br/><br/>The film is by no means a poor way to spend a few hours at the multiplex, but is hardly the poignant masterpiece others have hailed it as."
"funkyfry","6","2","4","8 February 2010"," Decent sci-fi, could have been retooled
","Directors and writers love allegory, because it allows them to make ""significant"" films while delivering the goods for audiences. Thus an anti-blacklist message is slipped into the water supply by way of a Gary Cooper western (""High Noon""). Then later it's turned into a sci-fi movie (""Outland"") with very little allegory. But that's not to say they haven't tried it in sci-fi; ""Enemy Mine"" and ""Alien Nation"" beat ""District 9"" to this particular punchbowl about 20 years ago, basically rehashing the old race/buddy-cop formula from films like ""In the Heat of the Night"" for the sci-fi audience. That black people would probably prefer not to be allegorized by way of hideous mutant freaks has hardly been questioned.<br/><br/>But an attempt at an interesting sci-fi premise is still better than the lazy premises we usually see. The people who made this movie actually seem more enamored of Verhoeven's style in ""Starship Troopers"" than any of those other films. But there's an odd clash of humor and drama here in my opinion that really doesn't always work. It starts out as a mockumentary and gradually morphs into a rather conventional narrative/action-film. In the process, identification is built but satire is unhinged.<br/><br/>Honestly, although the mockumentary style is interesting to apply to sci-fi, I thought it was pretty poorly done here. First of all there's the fact that it drops away and returns seemingly at the whim of the director. This dulls the impact of both the documentary and non-documentary sequences, because there's no sustained illusion of either objective or subjective reality. And then too much of the documentary parts are strictly informational; you wonder if anyone but a 5 year old in this alternate-Earth would really need some of this basic information about the arrival of the aliens.<br/><br/>The implausibility continues, and actually amps up, as the film progresses. Our hero, presented as a dorky bureaucrat, turns out to be the reincarnation of Jean Claude Van Damme. He thinks nothing of using his cell phone or walking into a fast food joint, and although all the military-police in town are supposedly searching for him he always eludes them on foot. He easily escapes from a high-security research center, and then spends the next half hour trying to convince his alien friend that it's impossible to get back in. Of course he decides to try it, and then breaks back in even more easily because his employers never thought to change the codes. Escape is not difficult a second time, because even though the evil corporation knows that he's inside they don't bother to close the garage or post more than one guard there.<br/><br/>These are all just bumps in the road; the major disappointment is that what promises to be both a stylish and intelligent sci-fi film instead degenerates into typical popcorn action. In this way it's similar to films like Alex Proyas' ""Dark City."" The mixture of satire and sentiment leaves a bad taste in my mouth -- too much is done with an eye to the momentary payoff and not the larger structure. It feels like the project was rushed, that there were good ideas in here but the script needed more work."

(apparently all humans enjoy watching other species suffer, we are ALL SO EVIL!) mixed up in a lot of shooting, explosions and blood... <br/><br/>Someone else realized how unbelievable most character's are? - The wife, she doesn't doubt for 1 second that her husband is some kind of pervert. - The wife's father, his daughter's husband? what does he care about him, he can be ripped open for studying and he won't even blink. - The bad soldier guy (dunno his name) what's his aim in life? just killing things, if they're aliens perfect, if it's some infected dumb-ass, even better, all he wants is killing things (really profound character yes...) - Christopher (nice name for an alien Oo), I think he should be Saint Christopher, no matter if he's an alien he really should be made a saint, he is so good he doesn't give a damn how badly he is treated, he'll just go the Gandhi way... - The baby alien, what's that character supposed to be? funny? cute? rather annoying I'd say...<br/><br/>And if a common film of running around, shooting and going after some mcguffin throughout a story full of holes isn't enough we get that EXPECTACULAR ending scene treating the audience as real retards, the last scene says something like, hey guys! I know you are all idiots, so I'll show you, the guy is still alive, but he is an alien now! look at him making flowers as he used to when he was human...<br/><br/>The most remarkable scene is that in which the main character mounted on a robot sends a pig flying at his enemies! I think that says a lot about the movie..."

","Neil Blompkamp is a director and writer to make note of. District 9 is a potent brand of gritty political realism with a most refreshing and original sci-fi twist.<br/><br/>The aliens who are referred to as 'prawns' in District 9 are not pleasant, charming or remotely attractive in fact they are rather grotesque beings. What Blompkamp has done by creating this against the grain extra-terrestrial is provide the possibility that aliens do not have to be wise etc and this is a welcomed novelty. Furthermore, to a certain degree are we meant to feel pity for such creatures if they act so horridly? District 9 follows the exploits of Wikus Van Der Merwe an overly bureaucratic field agent working for Multi National United (MNU), a private company contracted to ensure that the 'prawns' who are languishing in District 9 are taken to new camps in District 10. The best way I can describe Wikus is as a dislikeable David Brent whose eccentricity rather grates. In fact the way he teaches a trainee field agent to deal with 'prawns' and the way he interacts with them is rather repulsive at times. Blomkamp intentionally projects Wikus in this light and that impresses me, no stereotypical hero here. Although, come the end I am unsure what Blompkamp wanted his audience to feel with Wikus I didn't particularly feel any empathy but lukewarm attachment.<br/><br/>The 'prawns' are well developed in appearance if a little, if you forgive the pun 'under cooked' and you empathise with Christopher Johnson and his son (who is rather adorable in a weird way). Much of the aliens predicament is left for us to extrapolate what we want, I feel this is just right, we do not need to be spoon fed all the details. Blompkamp also offers a little witchcraft, which is prominent in South Africa, and this helps propel the story although a little uncomfortably.<br/><br/>The action is brought to us in the slums of Johannesburg, the defintive setting for the themes raised, and evident feel of the squalor, poverty and segregation is brought most vividly to life. The cinematography and editing is mixed well to bring that documentary feel with the necessity of cinematic action. The first twenty minutes do go past quickly almost in a blur as the documentary is cut and edited to bring us to the forefront of the current circumstances. I did feel a little discombobulated by this but District 9 managed to stamp its authority on this set-up pretty impressively as the film progressed.<br/><br/>District 9 is one of the most original sci-fi films in recent years it touches on obvious issues but the manner in which it is done is beguiling and refreshing. Not many films can be as entertaining as District 9 and deliver a serious message with such vibrancy as this little treasure."

","Like all good science fiction District 9 gleans real-world implications from the allegory on screen. If the conflict captured verite between aliens and humans seems reminiscent of the apartheid director Neill Blomkamp witnessed as a child it is no small coincidence.<br/><br/>District 9 is unusual, in its approach of siding with the aliens. Sure E.T. was also pro-alien, but not to the extent that you actively rooted for the destruction of man.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley plays Wikus van der Merwe, who contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable - he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. Fighting for his life, there is only one place left for him to hide: District 9.<br/><br/>Very quickly we discover that in the quest for gaining unimaginable sources of wealth from selling the ""prawns"" technology that we have become less human than the beings we are trying to exterminate. It's too bad that Blomkamp didn't continue along the lines of this and instead ventured into Bay territory with Pig shooting robots."

","I kind of had high expectations for this movie because everyone said it was so good. I like the way it started off and it was an interesting way of showing alien and human co existence. But i couldn't help feeling some things weren't explained enough or things didn't seem detailed enough. The thing that bothered me the most was the lead actor. He was EXTREMELY annoying and he said f*ck way too much and he got old. Plus I didn't feel he didn't do a great job at acting. Overall, the movie is still OK.

It appears to me that the entire scope of this movie is not to entertain but to put humanity in the worst light possible. That's right, there isn't even a role character you can put your hopes on. And the human stupidity was ridiculously, unrealistically exaggerated. Yes it is a new, almost original concept, well here Sci-Fi has moved from aliens bad, humans good to humans bad, aliens good. The action is composed of guns, CG transformers and a few explosions - nothing that we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>There is not much more to be said about this movie.<br/><br/>If you like movies that leave you feeling miserable afterward, then this one is for you."
"DaveDiggler","4","2","4","6 January 2010"," ""The Fly"" meets ""Schindler's List,"" but with Aliens
","""District 9"" is one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen. The trailers and previews make you think you're going into an alien war with the human race, but very quickly ""District 9"" is more about humans controlling aliens and not so much about war, well, for the first half at least. The film opens with a great mockumentary style approach explaining this epic event that took place in 1982 where an Alien aircraft stopped and hovered over a city for three months without moving. What ensues is pretty innovative stuff. Interspecies prostitution, humans understanding the language of the Aliens and vice versa, racial discrimination (Aliens are treated similar to African-Americans in American History) and the sales / trading of illegal weapons. <br/><br/>The Aliens (which might be an offensive term) are put into concentration camps similar to actual historical events. We are brought in and around District 9 by the main character, Wikus, who just got a promotion at MNU and has to notify the prawns (the aliens) that they are getting evicted. This has to be done legal, you understand, and they need the prawns signature. It's hard to wrap your head around this liberal government trying to treat these aliens like humans, or at the very least, equals, while humans treat them like the Nazi' treated the Jews or whites treated the blacks during a time of segregation. Once you do that you're left with the main character getting sprayed in the face and making a Seth Brundle (""The Fly"") like metamorphosis, and then betraying his country and joining forces with aliens. Pretty corny, pretty cheesy and pretty dull. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is mildly good, with an incredible opening sequence, but gradually turns into a dull movie about people you never care for and Aliens you can't possibly care for. ""District 9"" goes from innovative to heavily influenced to a standard, brainless shoot 'em up action flick, but with aliens. As I sat and watched the final third of the film (I became very impatient with the film) thinking, ""I don't care. I don't care about anyone. I don't care how this thing turns out. I just don't care."" I was surprised by my reaction because I was mildly blown away by the opening ten minutes of the film."

Either people love it or they really have some vitriolic sniping against it!!!<br/><br/>Why all the worry and seriousness?!<br/><br/>I watched this film with my girlfriend and we expected a sci-fi movie about aliens. We hadn't looked up any further information or read any reviews so we were pretty much at the mercy of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes there were nods to apartheid, racism and other slight slithers of social commentary... I didn't expect too much as it was a sci-fi film, NOT a documentary!<br/><br/>At the end we both agreed that it was a great movie, it made you feel good. It brought out something human in you whilst you watched. It was a feel good movie with a few feel bad parts in it.<br/><br/>I think it said a lot more about the human condition and our tribal/selfish ways ... how WOULD we react in a situation like the film puts us in?<br/><br/>The answer could very well be quite similar to the way the film's characters acted...not exactly welcoming!!<br/><br/>All these people saying 'Go watch Gandhi' or other silly comments ... No one is here to watch a film like Gandhi! They were looking for a good Sci-Fi film.<br/><br/>That is what this is.<br/><br/>A GOOD SCI-FI FILM.<br/><br/>So go and enjoy it and please, don't take life so seriously!"

"brandon_lee420","8","2","4","30 December 2009"," District 8!
","District 9, a film directed Neill Blomkamp, has to be on your must-watch movie lists. It's like Aliens mixed with Transformers but a little bit better than both. The reason this movie stands out of the rest alien movies is mainly because it shows that we need to get along even if we are aliens or humans, District 9 is also a political film and that's one of the reasons why this lost one star from me. The aliens in this movie are not called aliens but instead they are called ""prawns"" because their characteristics and personality match those of a prawn. The action is mind blowing but at the beginning it's starts out boring and slow but then it runs smoothly and gives you a package of action and a cool story. The acting particularly from Sharlto Copley is more than exceptional and even though it's the second movie he has starred in, he gives one heck of a good act. Sharlto Copley's role is unique because he plays someone who is a fugitive human-alien on the run because he didn't like being tested on and together with his two prawn friends he has to cure himself. One of the reasons why this film lost a star from me is because during some scenes a interview will pop out of nowhere, like cloverfield.<br/><br/>After being exposed to an alien material, a MNU agent is now being hunted by the government because his extraordinary skills can fire weapons made only for the aliens. He makes a strange friendship with a prawn and his son because they can help him cure his condition.<br/><br/>A solid action flick is what you need when you are searching for a good movie. The story, acting, action and all the other small things will have you enjoying yourself for two hours. I hope they make a good sequel!"
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","2","4","28 December 2009"," Mind blowingly awesome and effective and occasionally funny.
","In the month of August two fantastic movies were released. The first one was District 9. A week later, my favorite movie of the year, Inglourious basterds came out. I finally just saw District 9 and I thought"" Some of the fantastic things about Inglourious Basterds are involved here"". That is very true. <br/><br/>For example, Christoph Waltz in Inglourious basterds was one of the best performances of the decade. Besides Heath Ledger's Joker. The thing about Waltz is that you'd never even heard about him before. The same thing goes with District 9's lead actor. Sharlto Copely. We have never heard of him before and he does such an excellent job. I can't wait to see more of Waltz and Copely.<br/><br/>For some stupid reason, apparently, the producers wouldn't give Peter Jackson and Neil Blomkamp the money to do a Halo movie. I don't know why. They gave them money for Aliens in the attic. I'm telling you America is getting stupid. Anyways, so they decided to make this. That was probably the better decision. Because is one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copely stars as Wickus, a guy who is sent out to evict Aliens from out of their slum-like homes. His life changes when he is infected by this oil looking stuff. As Wickus goes on, he starts to decay and becomes a fugitive and helps the aliens, nicknamed Prawns, out.<br/><br/>The visuals in the film are mind blowing. And a ton of the action sequences are awesome. The weapons that they use blow people into pieces. It's kind of funny. This film is actually kind of sad too. Because Wickus' life falls apart. He starts to lose fingernails, his arm turns into an Prawns.<br/><br/>Also, District 9, though entirely fictional, has a way of showing like what the world is like in some countries. The movie is weird also. There is alien prositution going on. It's weird, funny, and amazing. You got to see it.<br/><br/>District 9:****/****"
"belyeuvisionfilms","10","2","4","22 December 2009"," Watch the Damn Thing Already
","I enjoyed District 9 immensely.<br/><br/>I'm not a film critic nor will I try to pretend to be one on IMDb. I just love film. I've even written, produced, and directed a few. But I have to say District 9 really stood out above all the unsatisfying, unoriginal films coming out this past year. So many novel adaptations and defiling remakes are really showing what a cesspool America has for screen writing talent. District 9 soars above the majority of dull, stagnant films being mass produced week after week here in the states.<br/><br/>I don't know how it's gotten this bad, but it's terrible. I have to wait several months, sometimes years before leaving theater saying, ""Wow, what a great story!"". Most of the time I find myself trying to point out the pros of a film like, ""That had some cool effects"" or ""The acting was really good"" or ""I really liked that character"". I want more movies like District 9, while not perfect, still have me leaving the theater satisfied on many more levels than one.<br/><br/>Original, entertaining, stylistic, thrilling, while delivering an important message all at once, District 9 accomplished a lot more with a budget half the size of stale, re-heated Blockbuster attempts (i.e. King Kong, The Wicker Man, The Day the Earth Stood Still....all remakes) Stop giving these mindless, unimaginative writers and filmmakers money and go see films like District 9, PLEASE!!!!!"
"soundmanlondon","10","2","4","18 December 2009"," Fabulous film that appears to have been comment sabotaged!
","This is an excellent film that I watched without having seen the trailers and hype. It has a well deserved 8.4 average and a low 95 in the top 250. How anyone can rate this film as ""disappointing"" and then give it 3/10 is a farce and makes me think this is like ""The Children"" in reverse (loads gave that nonsense a 9-10 and called it ""Brilliant"" when it was, in fact, absolute drivel.) District 9 is fantastic, intelligent and an amazingly crafted masterpiece that is sure to get much higher ratings over time. I can't wait for ""District 10"" and although it will be hard to accomplish, it might even surpass this masterpiece. The political and racial undertones, the governmental corruption awash throughout every country, not just South Africa, the whole gamut of between-the-lines analogies interspersed throughout this very intelligent and socially aware film are brilliant. A thinking person's film, undoubtedly crafted by extremely intelligent and humane people.<br/><br/>A well deserved cracking score, and the CGI is awesome. Look like real aliens, living beings. And that this was done on a ""shoestring budget of 30 million""? IF that is £ sterling, that was good value as in bangs for bucks-if it was $ US, it was an error and grossly under-priced by the CGI studio.

No preview or sample video could do it justice. A simple plot beautifully developed into an emotional and technically rigorous movie. <br/><br/>As you watch it experienced sci-fiers will like me start to envisage all the unexplored potential this movie could have as a series.

Then the movie takes you from thinking the movie is one way and then another. Then humanity shows where you never think it will when you first start watching. There is enough good and evil and enough action/violence to keep most anyone happy. I would say though, that children under twelve should not see and over twelve, the parents should watch it first to see if they want their kids to watch. Some of the violence would be considered epic and well, of mature theme. Over 16 should be OK though. This is a Sci FI masterpiece and one of the best ever made."
"moviemanMA","8","2","4","17 September 2009"," Harmony has a price
","District 9 is Neil Blomkamp's feature film debut as well as his writing debut. With the backing of Peter Jackson, whose films have grossed something in the billions, District 9 has a modest budget but tackles something more complex and unique. Something you don't need hundreds of millions of dollars in CG effects to show. We see a truly modern look at what could happen if aliens came to Earth and tried to live with us.<br/><br/>The aliens live in a slummy refugee camp called District 9 in the South African city of Johannesburg. Their ship hovers overhead motionless since the first encounter back in the 80s. These creatures look like a cross between a cockroach and a crayfish. They are tall, rigid, and very cautious of the humans, often leading to violence.<br/><br/>What is so unique about these creatures is not the way they look but how they act. Some are willing to comply with the humans, often engaging in activities with smugglers for food, weapons, and sometimes sexual intercourse. Both humans and the aliens understand each other's languages for the most part. It's refreshing to see a very foreign race of intelligent life interacting with humans in a non-hostile way, at least for some of the time.<br/><br/>When tensions grow high, MNU comes in, an organization who is trying to relieve the tensions between humans and what they call the ""prawns"" by evacuating them to a distant camp outside of the city. What ensues will ultimately change the course of history and future relations with the race.<br/><br/>The film starts out with an almost entirely documentary style approach, using interviews as well as footage from in the district. We follow Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the man put in charge of handing out the evictions. Copley puts on a great performance as a man pushed to the limit and facing the greatest challenge of all: survival.<br/><br/>Where the film differs from most as I stated earlier is the point of view we are given in regards to the aliens. They are hostile and dangerous, but for the most part they are terrified and in some cases defenseless. Are we supposed to support an alien race while our own is being shot up and killed? The way it is presented, yes, but only because of what we are shown in the film.<br/><br/>There is also a heavy theme of race and equality, something that is all too familiar for this country and around the world. People of so called ""lesser"" races and creeds are often lumped together in these grungy communities/camps, only to suffer greatly. These aliens are going through the exact same thing. It gives the film another touch of realism. This is not something that is so far-fetched for us to do.<br/><br/>One thing I wish the film stuck with was the documentary style. I think it drifts too far from it after the first 20 or 30 minutes, but in order to tell the story I assume we have to. I think it could have been a little more seamless instead of being so abrupt. We literally jump from the cameras used by the characters in the film to the unseen cameras of the films production. It was unexpected.<br/><br/>Had I not known this film was supposed to be amazing I probably would have liked it more out of sheer surprise. Still, I was very impressed with Blomkamp's story, camera work, and overall production. It's also nice to see a film shot in a place other than New York, Los Angeles, London, or something as recognizable. District 9 is a very intense, climactic, and unique viewing experience."
"Tachikoma-2","8","2","4","17 September 2009"," Racism and Corporatism
","District 9, like many good Sci-fi movies before it, isn't afraid to deal with difficult subject matter. Clearly D9 explores the many ugly realities and attitudes behind racism and corporatism. D9 is the most interesting when it examines these uncomfortable and ugly sides of humanity. But when D9 plunges into action, it becomes slightly tedious.<br/><br/>District 9 turns many Sci-fi clichés upside down. It isn't the aliens that hijack us in our sleep and probe us in private places. It is the humans that do humiliating examinations on relatively helpless aliens. D9 shows that it is actually our own idea, to turn conscious beings into guinea pigs. We ourselves are the horrific monsters that we have feared. We treat other life forms as we please. Looking at the way we treat animals and nature, it is not such a radical notion, that we would exploit alien life forms as well. We humans do as we please, when it comes to prestige and profits. If there's money in it, we'll gut open an alien. If It's good for the markets, it's good for you.<br/><br/>The performances are solid and Sharlto Copley is quite good.<br/><br/>What I personally dislike is that damned ""mockumentary"" style combined with shaky camera. That gimmick is really wearing out it's welcome. It often feels like a cheap trick to add some realism into a movie, that's basically just make believe anyway. Why do have a need to pretend other wise?<br/><br/>After about halfway mark the movie starts to disintegrate a bit. It becomes more of an action movie and it doesn't do action all that well. In the end of the movie the hero even dons a mechasuit on. It comes out of nowhere and it isn't particularly memorable. But the first half of D9 is very powerful, so the action at the end doesn't ruin it entirely."
"alex-carsley-1","7","2","4","17 September 2009"," Slightly Disappointed
","The movie really does start with a lot of promise, very original story to begin with and it does capture your imagination. There are a few hindrances to total immersion, I found some of the acting slightly wooden in places, camera work is a bit too manic at times and that some of the story didn't explain fully why things were happening the way they were. Even with these faults the film does still has a great atmosphere and the impending disaster is felt throughout and when it does happen, that is where the film goes downhill for me. I felt that it took the easy route to the finale and became a very stereotypical affair with all guns blazing. But to end on a positive note, once I got over the fact that nothing clever was going to happen, I did enjoy the action sequences and special effects."
"tha_mongoose","9","2","4","16 September 2009"," A feast for the eyes and ears
","It is 12:54am and I need to get up early tomorrow, nevertheless something must be written to account for what I have just seen. District 9, the newest film with the eye and signature of Peter Jackson, is a unique alien picture the likes of which had not been made since Ridley Scott unveiled Alien in 1979 and shook the world.<br/><br/>The aliens in District 9 are an incredible creation, showing immense imagination. With a cast of completely unknown actors, we are nonetheless left with a very well interpreted story. Sharlto Copley (Wikus Van De Merwe), portraying an MNU agent who we feel is undeserving of his promotions and general success career-wise due to his liaison with the daughter of a man of power among the MNU, turns out to be capable of so much more than we expected.<br/><br/>The structure of the film, using interviewees speaking about events and shifting from different types of cameras (one being the MNU security cameras surrounding District 9, the other the actual footage of Van De Merwe's pursuits and the other the TV angle that films the interviewees) makes it so that you never really have to suspend your disbelief completely. Since almost as soon as the movie begins we are immediately put into contact with the creatures, we have longer to get used to them.<br/><br/>Soundtrack, pace and acting-wise District 9 is a winner. The slum is so well shot, and the arid turf surrounding it, that South Africa becomes very real with the aliens inside it.<br/><br/>Something must also be said for the CGI. How these aliens, their weapons, their mothership, and the rest were made escape me, but it was a work of megatronic proportions and deserves applause.<br/><br/>This film gets a 9/10. Even alien cynics should watch."

Endlessly, terminally silly. The nearest approximation I can give to readers is Transformers meets ET meets Princess Bride meets Wall Street.<br/><br/>Sure, I get the point about why it was set in South Africa. Sure, I know the ending was pure schmaltz. Why of course I know corporations are bad (er...does that include the film industry too?). In fact, I felt like I had been hit on the head with these points of reference so many times during the film that I really did feel like leaving the theater after about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Oh, and the point others make about the steady-cam approach to film making...agreed, it gets very very annoying pretty darn quickly.<br/><br/>I took the family to see this.

It usually a go to when the producers want to make a cheap action movie, a snide social commentary or make a nonsensical make sense. It has become riddled with clichés and over all bad story telling.<br/><br/>While District 9 seemed unique, I was quite confident that it was to be a usual alien invasion movie: peaceful aliens pushed to the breaking point, cowardly protagonist becomes macho hero, and all is well as the aliens sail off into the sunset.<br/><br/>This could not be further from the truth. When discussing the movie with my friend afterward, I could not think of one major sci-fi cliché that was used in this movie. This is a truly original work, possibly the first brilliant entry in what I hope is a long and prosperous career for Mr. Blomkamp.<br/><br/>This was not the perfect movie, by any stretch of the imagination.

","The central character is really excellent in this film, taking the dull day to day human with his trivial self into the complete unknown in a world he thinks he controls. His allegiance to man dissolves along with his bodily self in a way that grips. The downright blunt references to apartheid are not lost on the audience but neither are they so bludgeoning as to affect the films art. I loved the way this film teetered on the edge of it's story and the way it slams it's characters in your face. The running news was effective although I found the count""UP"" from the central characters ""exposure"" did not add to the pace. By far the best scene is when Christopher sees the experiments in the lab. Great moment.. The ending also is superb. I love the way that the uncertainty of what the humans have done; that the ending itself is uncertain is perfect. Go see it."
"alexxarian","4","2","4","13 September 2009"," The Chewbacca District
","Yesterday I felt like watching some good movie so I went on the Oslo cinematographer's website and looked through the reviews of the current films. To my great surprise I found District 9 there and it had been given 5 or 6 dice rolls (very common grading system in Norwegian media) both by newspapers and the public. Since I'm a huge sci-fi geek and I'm totally starved for GOOD sci-fi movies, I thought that this must be my lucky day. God, how wrong I was.<br/><br/>Before I start spewing poison here, I want to make some remarks about the good sides of this film. It is visually stunning. The special effects are awesome, even now that we are totally used to them looking 100% real. It appears very serious to begin with. Aspects of it are extremely realistic, it is very visceral and brutal. When it comes to violence and gore it made me feel like I was watching a sci-fi version of City of God. There were no previously known faces to me, not good per se but it helped increase the realism even more. There are some very sad parts, it depicts human cruelty and prejudice very well at times. I'm sure there are many more positive things to say about it.<br/><br/>What is the problem with it then? I'll tell you what the problem is. Where it counts, the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. What is the problem with that, you may ask. The problem is that the movie starts off in a documentary style and tries to appear as realistic as possible. This totally stopped me from suspending disbelief, like I usually do when watching movies I expect to suck in the logic department. From the ratings I had seen and from the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, my expectations were sky high. To begin with I thought that this would be one of the best sci-fi movies I'd ever seen. Then, as the nonsense started to make itself more apparent, I started worrying and hoping that they would fix it somehow. But they didn't, the longer I watched the more apparent it became how stupid this movie really is. It makes as much sense as the Chewbacca Defence. It would be an insult to your intelligence if I had to explain why this is so, but I'll mention some points anyway. There is no way, and I mean NO WAY that the different parts of humanity (and the aliens) would have acted in the way they did. It's as simple as that. The logic in this movie is so completely flawed (and I don't mean the sci-fi stuff, I'm OK with that since that is meant to be accepted) that the story, including the prologue, main story, ending and each individual character's actions, seems as plausible as if the whole world were to convert to Scientology within the next two weeks. In the end I was forced to totally suspend judgment after all (something I am not able to unless I'm watching something that is MEANT to be nonsensical). I managed to take some pleasure from the 'awesome' action and special effects, in the same way that I can take pleasure from eating a McDonald's hamburger. But there is no way I can feel content when I was led to believe that I would get served some gourmet dish from the 21st century.<br/><br/>I am not saying that this is the dumbest movie ever made but it doesn't make more sense than most Michael Bay movies. The main problem is that it gives the opposite signals. It acts and pretends like it is a great and realistic movie but it is not. The story could easily have been so so so much better. I really don't understand what is wrong with filmmakers in this day and age. Is there some conspiracy to keep people dumbed down? I also want to criticize those of you who gave this movie a high rating. Michael Bay style movies don't deserve high ratings, and this movie definitely doesn't. I'm close to completely losing faith in the judgment of the majority, even when it comes to something supposedly as straight forward as entertainment.<br/><br/>If somebody could point me to a movie reviews website where logical coherence is a big factor in judging a movie's quality, I'd appreciate it immensely."
"omahonyjason","7","2","4","14 September 2009"," Excellent movie that works on a multitude of levels!
","I'm always delighted when I see Peter Jackson's name above the title of a movie and while he didn't direct DISTRICT 9, the film is as brilliant as if he did. It's technically fantastic and emotionally wrenching, with all the action, imagination and elements that you would expect from a Jackson sci-fi classic.<br/><br/>The story centres on Johannesburg, South Africa, where a huge alien ship stalled in the skies way back in 1982. The film begins in a mock documentary fashion with reports suggesting the ship became stranded after a command module separated from the ship and dropped to Earth. The command module, however, couldn't be found and when humans discover a large group of unhealthy and leaderless prawn-like aliens, they house them in a camp, called District 9.<br/><br/>The camp quickly turns into a slum with the aliens, who have a taste for cat food and a seemingly low IQ despite their hugely advanced weaponry, competing with one another and swapping alien technology and weapons for cans of cat food. As the years pass, the alien creatures, derogatorily referred to as prawns, are treated like vermin and, in the early years of the 21st Century, a private military contractor, Multinational United, or MNU for short, is placed in charge of relocating the 1.8 million aliens to a new camp outside the city bounds, District 10.<br/><br/>Wikus van de Merwe leads the relocation and during a routine search of an alien hut he sprays himself with an alien fluid, becoming infected with a 'virus'. He falls ill and is taken to hospital when his left arm mutates into an alien appendage. Because the advanced alien technology is bio-engineered only aliens can use it, which leads to MNU becoming interested in Wikus. If his mutated arm is capable of firing the weapons then the genetic code locked in his body is potentially worth hundreds of millions or even billions to the military contractor that unlocks it.<br/><br/>Wikus goes on the run, takes refuge in District 9 and returns to the hut where he was infected. He partners with an alien called Christopher Johnson, who despite being initially hostile towards Wikus, becomes his only ally.<br/><br/>What follows is a fascinating chase movie, part sci-fi but all high tension action as the unlikely new friends form an alliance to get Christopher home and to make Wikus fully human again.<br/><br/>DISTRICT 9 works on a multitude of levels. It's a satirical look at racism. It's a hugely enjoyable, blood splattering action flick. It's a fantastic chase film. It's fiendishly well plotted and looks absolutely gorgeous. The mock-umentary style used at the beginning gives an electric and immediate feel to the film. You feel like you're on the run with Wikus and your attitude to the alien 'vermin' changes as his does. And you finish the film with an empathy for the prawns that seemed impossible at the start. The ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel and I, for one, can't wait to see it or any other flick with Peter Jackson's name above the title!"

","Now that Peter Jackson has fallen into the Hollywood trap directing overlong excessive spectacles, at least he supports fresh talents who make highly original modestly budgeted genre pics with hearts and brains... just like he once did.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's the name of one of these protégés and his first feature-length pic marks an electrifying starting point. This highly entertaining sci-fi action movie creates a tense and unusually credible setting with both tragic and satirical leanings and a seamless blending of doc-style versus clear-cut storytelling and top-notch CGI effects. The talented cast of unknown performers is another plus.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the pic's intensity declines slightly in the second half while the action elements take over.

Now, if you've _ever_ played or watched any SciFi that actually starts by being confusing and puts you in total ""what the hell is going on here"" moments, you know what I'm talking about. In this movie you got a lot of, for example Half-Life game, and it doesn't matter which part, 1 or 2, it's the same at this point.

Now, all those questions rise from not knowing that Science Fiction has exactly that in mind while you are watching it. It doesn't have to be clear to you, it doesn't require you to understand every single part of it or find racism in the entire thing, because many times it proves that the story can be clear only when you finish watching the movie or when you think about the idea.

","I went to see District 9 not knowing much about it. I had seen Neill Blomkamp's short film 'Alive in Joburg' (practically the prequel to D9) earlier that day, as well as 'Landfall' and 'All Arms Race' which Blomkamp made to promote the release of the video game, Halo 3.<br/><br/>I was glad to see an alien/human contact movie where the aliens are not invading and slaughtering as they go. I also enjoyed the fact the the film was set somewhere other than the United States which seems to be, as another movie put it ""The only place where aliens ever seem to land"".<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see a cast comprised of unknowns, as I feel that the overall value of the movie would have been detracted substantially if they had hired an all-star cast.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie were great and the actors were fantastic. The one thing that clinched this movie for me was that fact that it is believable. It feels realistic, which is one thing many sci-fi movies lack these days.<br/><br/>District 9 is just amazing and it is a breath of fresh air for the movie industry."

It was just exhilarating to watch.<br/><br/>I am not so sure a successor movie is a good idea, though. If they are going to do it, it will probably end like ""independence day"".

"michael_the_nermal","6","2","4","2 September 2009"," The Fly meets Robocop meets Alien Nation
","This film is basically an allegory about bigotry. While ""District 9"" seems to have cherry-picked its themes and plot-points from the three aforementioned films, one film it seems to resemble most (based on what I've seen from clips; I haven't seen the movie) is ""The Thing with Two Heads,"" where a white bigot has a black man's body grafted onto him. ""District 9"" has some heart-rending moments, but it seems far more praised and lauded than it deserves.<br/><br/>The allegory is as wafer-thin as the pieces of the aliens' body we see dissected in the underground lab. It should come as no surprise why South Africa was chosen as the setting of this story, and anyone who has paid attention to the past half-century of news will know exactly what is being represented by this film. Some aspects, though, seem to require some intensive knowledge of South African history, which few people outside of the country would be aware of (the ""concentration camps"" into which the aliens are to be herded evokes the time and the place where the words entered the English language: Lord Kitchener's attempts to stop Boer resistance in the 1899-1902 war through herding them into appalling, unsanitary camps). In all, ""Alien Nation"" was much more entertaining as an allegory using the bigotry theme, if only because Terence Stamp made an awesome villain.<br/><br/>I suppose the filmmakers can be applauded by showing the transformation of the protagonist from annoying bureaucrat with no empathy for the ""prawns"" into someone who discovers his humanity while becoming an alien himself. This character is patently unlikeable at the beginning, a yes-man with an arrogant, narcissistic attitude and mush for brains. He closely resembles Tom Green, without the latter's wit, comic timing, or goofy charm; hell, the main character does not even have Jeff Goldblum's tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, even though this movie clearly borrows from ""The Fly."" The bureaucrat protagonist is not a funny, lovable ""Brundlefly,"" but a simpering, self-pitying suit who only redeems himself at the end. The evil corporation that wants to vivisect the protagonist symbolizes the dangers of capitalism run amok; those who have seen ""Robocop"" can sniff out the resemblance to *that* film from a mile away.<br/><br/>The special effects were decent, but I'm jaded to the point where high-paced action, guts and gore, and computer-animated aliens and robots do not fascinate me anymore. The little alien kid was kind of cute, though.<br/><br/>In all, ""District 9"" takes cues from earlier, better movies, with a Tom Green lookalike leading the way. It's highly overrated, but far from the worst movie ever made. Neophyte sci-fi fans may like the allegory, but there are better flicks in the video store."
"BeaverStrike-21","10","2","4","30 August 2009"," A Standard is set
","In the beginning of the film i wasn't very thrilled at all. I thought this was a rather mediocre Sci-Fi in mainstream ""Hollywood-style"" as someone here put it. Just as in ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" this movie is shot very much in a documentary-storytelling way, making it seem more authentic and realistic.<br/><br/>When all the other ""Want-to-be-realistic"" films have failed, District 9 does not only surpass the normal level in the ethical spice, emotional back tone and realistic setting - It has clearly set a new standard.<br/><br/>Anyway, as the film progressed, as did my interest. When Wikus is slowly turning into an alien, the whole perspective is flipped totally backwards. You get to see the nasty side of the human race, and not in a gentle way either. Seeing Wikus lying on the operating-table and listen to all the other people talking about him as a 'specimen' to be exploited really brought out the emotional streak. Also did his conversation with his wife.<br/><br/>What I hate with all the others complaining about this movie, is that they don't seem to realize that this is critique towards racism, not your everyday Star Trek-wannabe. Don't complain on it unless you know and acknowledge that this movie is a masterpiece. What you think is flaws is nothing less than movie characteristics.<br/><br/>In the end you really loved the aliens. If there will be a sequel, I can't wait to see Christopher return..."

Star Trek was good but not brilliant as was Terminator Salvation, spoiled a little maybe by anticipation and everyone hyping up the movies so they never really had a chance of standing up to original expectations, as is normally the case with summer 'blockbusters', pre-release trailers never helping on this count neither always showing off key scenes to sell the movie and giving away plot twists into the bargain! And then there came 'DISTRICT 9' out of nowhere, and its a corker. I wont put any spoilers in but just say that not for a long time as a movie delivered on so many levels.. I knew nothing about this before I saw it, only the star rating on I.M.D.B was used as a guide. So all I will say is.. GO SEE THIS MOVIE... IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!

"dilbertsuperman","8","2","4","27 August 2009"," A well crafted story of first contact with bug-based alien life with a clever plot.
","I'll probably watch this movie again I liked it so much, it's a juxtaposition of African apartheid policies and shanty towns with first contact of a bug/crustacean based alien race. The script is very well crafted and uses a lot of symbolism from human history to tell the tale of how we would probably treat these alien beings. The acting is well done and the lead character has an unusual accent that gives the whole movie a more unique character. The story focuses on his experiences with an alien refugee camp as a ""MN"" worker trying to move the camp away from the city of Johannesberg.<br/><br/>PLOT: Part of a MN team (think UN team) in Johannesberg assigned to a refugee camp for alien life forms comes in contact with some alien technology that creates a great deal of turmoil both with the MN and the camp. Some interesting special effects, but the plot is the main point of interest here, this is a cerebral flick with good action scenes. The movie uses a documentary style at times but doesn't beat us over the head with it like Blaire Witch or Cloverfield- they know when to flip into live action and leave that style behind.<br/><br/>All in all this winds up being a carefully crafted science fiction story with the occasional wow moment of action, good show!"

You will feel for the aliens suffering, although by their nature, they seem to not care too much (hey, they're not human so why would you know how'd they feel?).

","I read a lot of reviews before burning our gift certificates to see this movie on the big screen. It looked like people either loved it or hated it; post-teen gamers and sci-fi lovers thought it was lame, and film buffs loved it. I had to see for myself, and now I know what was up with the reviews. If you want a CG extravaganza a la or ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" or even ""Starship Troopers"", forget it. If you want the rich sci-fi texture of ""Aliens"" or ""Blade Runner"", you'll be disappointed. But if you want a fun good-vs-evil thrill ride like ""T2"" or ""Total Recall"" (with a modern cinema twist), it's worth a few bucks for the in-theater experience.<br/><br/>Mind you, it's way more ""indie"" than any of those movies, but it's an indie movie with mind-blowing CG. The story and the sci-fi do not bear close examination, but the CG does. The trailers do not mislead in that respect. The lead actor is terrific, too.<br/><br/>I came to the movie half expecting it to be social allegory, what with the South African shanty town and legacy of apartheid and all, but they left that alone and let the movie speak for itself. They were smart enough not to be at all preachy with it, which would indeed have made it suck.

"TdSmth5","10","2","4","26 August 2009"," Quite an achievement
","This is a great action sci-fi movie. It's suspenseful as you don't know where the story is going. Because of the way it's shot and edited, it's pace is quick and it doesn't dwell on slow moments. It has great battle scenes, interesting weapons, curious creatures, and teases us with only a few glimpses of the alien world.<br/><br/>While I'm easily annoyed by political agendas disguised as entertainment, the themes here lend themselves to various interpretations, not just the standard one about race that perhaps the writer had in mind. You can think of it in terms of the universal rotten human nature, or in terms of the animalistic will to dominate, or in terms of a post-9/11 militarized global agenda, of the complete integration of the military industrial complex with government and with the media, or the absurd obsession with weapons and the black market it fosters.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that could have never been made in the US or handled in any way by Americans. Were this an American movie it would be full of Wagner-plagiarized orchestration, it would be offensively moralizing and condescending, the casting would have to fulfill bizarre quotas, a love story would occupy half of the time. Instead we get an action movie that is often funny, surprising, and no-nonsense. <br/><br/>The special effects are outstanding. I was surprised to read that it's all CGI. It is rather humorous to watch aliens misbehaving pettily just the way humans do. The acting is good, although I suspect that the writer is to blame for the excessive portrayal of the main character's nerdyness. At some point several people are getting geared up for action and our main character, who looks like the guy from Revenge of the Nerds, has a giant calculator and pens in chestpockets over a bulletproof vest. I'm not sure the story is entirely solid. The more one thinks about it, the more holes one may find so it's best to just go with what we are given and not ask about what isn't said.<br/><br/>Still, despite minor shortcomings, this movie is destined to a classic and I wouldn't mind sequels."

","I had immensely high expectations for this. To have them met and repeatedly exceeded was astonishing. It's been so long since I was last so affected by something I saw that I can't remember when it was, if it has ever happened at all. This touches upon some deep and unpleasant aspects of humanity and science, with countless sequences and ideas that imitate real life occurrences. I urge anyone who comes out from this saying ""nothing like that would actually happen"" to read up on history, and frankly, you sadly don't have to look that far back. The acting is flawless, every single performance. Not casting anyone well-known was the exact right choice. The CGI is beyond reproach, such intricate detail, so imaginative, always believable, everything had a weight to it, and everything living was expressive. I did not feel like I was looking at something animated(in general, you can't tell that this had a relatively low budget). The word ""cartoony"" doesn't apply in the least. This is gritty and strong. Not everyone is going to have the stomach for this, there is a lot of very disturbing content. The style is spot-on, with a marvelous mix of a professionally shot documentary(that introduces the audience to the world of this) and the classic story-telling of a movie. You find yourself completely engrossed. The cinematography is magnificent. There is a lot of hand-held, without it at all being headache-inducing or distracting. This is superior to Cloverfield and Quarantine, to the point that it is just about beyond describing. Do yourself a favor, do not let anyone spoil anything about this to you before your viewing. The plot is excellent, and develops masterfully, and not always in the anticipated direction. This is one of the most original concepts I have witnessed in a long time. I found the growth, the characters and the events entirely credible, not to mention amazingly powerful. The drama is engaging throughout. This is epic, they managed to put such a massive amount into it, and it all works and has an impact, nothing comes up short. I am so impressed it's difficult to put into words. The action is awesome and creative, though it obviously is not the focus of this. There is humor in this, and it's funny without the serious tone suffering. They also don't go over the line for laughs, if there are arguably a few exceptions to that. The pace is perfect. Editing is sharp and skillful. There is a moderate amount of bloody violence and gore, as well as language in this. I warmly recommend this to anyone who enjoys intelligent, satirical and challenging sci-fi, in any medium. 10/10"

","If the aliens were to land, would they be hyper intelligent beings that know things about our galaxy far beyond what we could ever comprehend? District 9 envisions them in a whole different way. Truthfully, it's exactly how it would be in our reality. The aliens here are prawn creatures, suffering from intergalactic income inequality and starvation. Upon crash landing to earth, they are subjected to Jim Crowe-like laws that separate them from humans and are eventually placed into internment camps. The irony: this all takes place in South Africa.<br/><br/>District 9 is half mocumentery and half bodily horror movie. It is equal parts brilliant. It's one of the most innovative and original alien films out there. It approaches this subject matter so soberly, it feels real. It's science fiction, that cleverly treads softly on fantasy.

"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","0","0","20 April 2020"," The movie that got me interested in the idea of film as an artform
","You'd be hard-pressed to find anybody who doesn't enjoy the act of watching movies for their entertainment value. For over a century now people have been drawn to the escapist qualities of film- it is a medium that can transport a person to a different world for two or so hours, and allow them an opportunity to experience something different to the tedium of their everyday lives.
However, films can of course be so much more than simple pieces of entertainment. A film can make an audience think about particular issues, ponder various themes, provide knowledge about numerous topics, and even create profound emotional responses. As people mature, they come to realise this, and I believe almost everyone has at least one movie they watched as a child, or maybe in their teens, that really opened their eyes to film-making as an art-form and allowed them to see just how deep and thought-provoking the medium has the potential to be. For me personally, that film was District 9.
(SPOILERS AHEAD- you've been warned).<br/><br/>I saw District 9 at the cinemas when I was about 14 and a half; I was a simple teenager hoping to be entertained by a new science fiction/ action film. I went in expecting pure entertainment, and that's certainly what the film delivered- I personally find District 9 to be an absolutely riveting film. But it was more than just a ""good time at the movies"" to me; it was also something that opened my mind to the idea of films being a medium in which a director can make a statement.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not saying that the parallels between the oppression of the aliens in District 9 and the oppression of black Africans under the Apartheid is all that subtle or anything, but it's definitely there in the movie, and it's very cleverly implemented. And yes, it was the first time I ever realised by myself that a film I watched had a proper message. It was definitely unexpected, as I'd thought District 9 was going to a straight, pure action film, but the social commentary and the themes explored like racism, prejudice, and genocide really made me think and feel things I'd never felt and thought about during a movie before.<br/><br/>I think I should take some time to briefly gush about District 9 as a film though- it's an absolutely riveting science fiction film with convincing special effects, great performances from a largely unknown cast (Sharlto Copley, who played the main character Wikus is especially brilliant- I'd love to see him in a few more movies), a near-constant feeling of tension, great action scenes, over-the-top violence, a great mockumentary style in its first third, a great twist at the end of the first act, and a really emotional ending. In other words, it has many of the things that I look for in movies, and so for that reason I think it's absolutely outstanding when judged purely as a piece of film entertainment.<br/><br/>But as I said before, the movie made me really feel and think about things, and I found the film stuck in my mind for days after I watched it. I couldn't believe how sorry I felt for these oppressed and abused aliens until I realised that much of what happened to them in the film actually happened to numerous black Americans in South Africa during the dreadful years of the Apartheid, and it's this essential parallel that makes the movie so emotionally compelling and engaging. And yes, we've seen many stories about a white man joining forces with the side he was originally assigned to oppose- see Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas and Avatar to name just the most well-known ones- but physically turning the bigoted protagonist Wikus into an alien gradually as the film progressed was a genius move on the part of the filmmakers, as by becoming one of the beings he so ruthlessly oppressed and abused he can now come to understand the immense pain they feel, and it's his slow acceptance of the aliens that makes his heroic sacrifice at the film's end so poignant and emotional. It all kind of relates back to the noble message of To Kill a Mockingbird about having to put yourself in someone else's shoes to see the world from their point of view and therefore to come to an understanding about who they are and why they act the way they do (apologies for the awful paraphrasing).<br/><br/>People are often quick to call Wikus a jerk, but honestly, I think he's an immensely compelling character who has a beautiful redemptive arc to his character. Yes, we may hate him while he callously allows a shed containing alien eggs to be burnt, and starts to make jokes about the dying eggs sounding like popcorn, but I think this makes it all the more meaningful and significant when he does change as a character.<br/><br/>I know there is more to be said about District 9, but I feel like bringing this ramble to a close now. I think it's a truly great movie, and I really do hope that in time it finds itself ranked up there among the other science fiction classics of all time like Metropolis, Star Wars, Blade Runner, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think it's a great example of the genre at its best, as it discusses and provokes thought about a real world issue by depicting it in a science fiction setting full of aliens and awesome weaponry. Yet despite its science fiction elements, it still feels very much grounded in reality, and I think that is one of its greatest strengths. I think the fairly low budget (for sci-fi standards) for this film helped strengthen its very realistic aesthetic, as it forced the film-makers to not just rely on special effects to carry the movie, and probably also forced them to make use of real locations rather than just shooting the whole thing against a green screen in a sterile environment (kind of like what George Lucas regrettably did for his prequel trilogy).<br/><br/>I am also glad that we have not received word on a sequel yet- I think District 9 tells a perfectly contained story as it is, and although I acknowledge that a sequel could work, seeing as Christopher promised he would return to Earth at the very end of the film, I think District 9 is better off without one. An inferior sequel could easily tarnish the stellar reputation of the original, which in my opinion, is an essentially perfect story as is."

1. The interviews at the beginning of the movie don't feel genuine as they're presented in a documentary-esque manner. They feel like just what they are - people acting and providing exposition.

Reading the 1 star ratings- I can't say I agree- it is a sci fi- which is fantasy fiction- Dr. Who time travels- while I am not a fan of Zombie films except George Romero; or Dracula; or one of greatest Frankenstein & it's variation including Bride of F. . what about the picture of Dorian Grey (the book was better than any film made) all Fantasy & invention - so one has to accept the premise-of an Alien race internment camps in S. Africa.
sure it's a play on racism, hating, controlling the immigrant, underdog, outsider. Of course we've seen this among ppl of the same color within nations. sure it is an old theme,
But this is a truly original Sci fiction movie- entertaining on many levels, just for the stry telling and visuals. Including the script, directing, as well as the creativity of the visuals. Excellent lead. that his own wife is unreasonable, sure.
as an aside, the follow-up Chappies, was a great disappointment- barely 3 out of 10 stars. I hope these filmmakers (writer director) try again.
it says the budget was $30million, so not low budget- there was a lot of FX, special effects. probably a lot of pre- and post production. the Aliens, bug like, had a lot of personality."

Beginning as a poorly filmed documentary on the clearance of an alien ghetto in Jo'berg, within which the history of the arrival of aliens is explained, the plot develops so that ultimately the viewer is drawn inevitable towards favouring the alien cause over the greed-driven schemes of the humans.
The main protagonist (Sharlto Copley brilliantly playing the wimpy Wikens van de Merwe) accidentally sprays an alien fluid into his face and soon finds the liquid has had a disastrous affect upon his body. Thereafter everything goes wrong for Wikens, and it is from this point that the human race begins to show how truly despicable it can be.
The alien creations here are brilliantly crafted - the cinematography is excellent and it is obvious why the film picked up four Oscar nominations.
For the first half hour I was mildly entertained but didn't see much in this film -thereafter it became a real experience. A film well worth watching.

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","4 March 2019"," A sci-fi modern classic that challenges our so-called humanity ..
","In my ""Manchurian Candidate"" review, I called it a fair deal that the film portrayed Americans confusing anti-communism driven patriotism with lunacy, while centering on an existing Communist conspiracy. In the same vein, ""District 9"" exploits archive footage of South Africans criticizing immigrants for real yet without sugarcoating immigration either. I admire a movie that shows us as a whole capable of the best as well as the worst regardless on the color of skin or demographic group.<br/><br/>On that level, the film is as smart as ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and as prophetic. Indeed, there are so many parallels you can draw between the situations of Alien refugees in Johannesburg and the massive wave of immigration in Western countries it's eerie. I read many Youtube comments comparing the Aliens to some communities, even using racial slurs to define them, actually these comments don't miss the film's point, they make it in an indirect way by showing the very rampant intolerance the film is denouncing.<br/><br/>And to the patronizing idea that Black South-Africans are supposed to be more compassionate toward the aliens who are undergoing a new Apartheid (District 9 is a nod to District 6, and you can find all the information on Wikipedia), the unanimousness toward the alien case actually shows a form of universal disdain toward a non-human species that ironically united old enemies. Take for instance ""Invictus"", a movie made the same year and set in South Africa: Clint Eastwood showed how the same passion for rugby united Blacks, Afrikaners and every layer of South Africa's new society into the same united community during the World Cup. Here we have the same effect with a common enemy that doesn't even behave like one.<br/><br/>The film asks a relevant question about alien invasions: what if they don't invade us? And it's a valid scenario given the way these aliens look. They aren't exactly the prettiest-looking and the little one makes E.T. as cute as Shirley Temple. They're constantly referred to as 'prawns' just like the Tutsi were called 'cockroaches' in ""Hotel Rwanda"". Their physical features seem to obey to scientific speculation as much as artistic licenses, but it's important that they inspire instant disgust and defiance. And that's the stuff genocides are made of.<br/><br/>Yes, with all the talk about ""learning from WW2"", the film confronts us to a very delicate question: since we care so much about humans, we defined crimes against humanity, since we believe animals deserve respect, where would creatures we consider lower than both groups stand in our standards of appreciation? And ""District 9"" is interesting in the way the young director Neil Blomkamp, in his debut, guides us into a journey of humility and understanding.<br/><br/>First the film opens with a newsreel, a masterstroke of exposition, giving us enough information and footage to accept the presence of these aliens in South Africa since 1982 as historical reality. Then we get to 2010 where a multi-national corporation named MNU volunteered to relocate the ""prawns"" to a bigger area with better facilities. The supervision of the operation is given to one of these ""employee-of-the-month"" guys I used to despise since my days in Procter and Gamble.<br/><br/>His name is Wikus Van De Merwe, he's played by Sharlto Copley and the act he puts in front of the camera to impress the big shots, especially his CEO (who happens to be his father-in-law) is symptomatic of that human contempt I described. The mockumentary style enhances that biased, one-sided, outsider's ""civilized"" perspective. And we see humans acting with the aliens as if they were a ""lower race"", forcing them to move from the ghetto under the threat of soldiers from diverse ethnicities.<br/><br/>Remember ""Aliens"" when the squad found the nest with the Queen and started destroying the eggs, we couldn't shed a tear for them, we knew how potentially lethal they were. But we've only seen the prawns burning trucks or being annoyances, a commentator explaining that they might not have the same behavior standards (of course, they don't), the worse they did was slashing a man's arm but even then, I hated the casual way Wikus torched the egg-place and laughed at the pop-corn sound it made.<br/><br/>Even his portrayal during the news' section show him as a not-so bright man, compromising and friendly. Wikus embodies our condescending nature, too cocky to even wear a mask, which will start his trouble... and eventually, his redemption. And this is perhaps the best thing about the film. As soon as he's contaminated by an accidental spray and slowly turns into an alien, his personality evolves as well. The film shifts the genre and turns from documentary to more conventional narrative and let Copley lead the show with his spectacular performance.<br/><br/>This is not just a director's but an actor's film. The evolution of Wikus from an slick blue-collar guy with the hair on the side and the yellow vest to a man scared out of death and realizing the extent of humans' barbarity once he's submitted to it, is the true highlight of the film. The MNU shows its true self as well, a greedy corporation resorting to torture and arbitrary killing to get the hold on a sophisticated machinery under a commander whose enjoyment to kill prawns remind of other soldiers from the darkest hours.<br/><br/>The parallel is even stronger when Wikus reveals that the place of relocation is no better than a concentration camp as he tells the one prawn he befriended, ""Christopher Johnson"". I won't spoil the third act. It might feel formulaic with its avalanche of shooting and action sequences but it's in the tradition of many sci-fi classics to entertain and thrill as much as asking thought-provoking questions.<br/><br/>Indeed, regarding Wikus, he might have regained his humanity. But the film teaches us not to take that word for granted.A sci-fi modern classic that challenges our so-called humanity ..."

Putting the ideas of a Sci-fi movie into our own slums and ghettos creates a brilliant depiction of abuse and suffering. This movie has so much social commentary and realism around it, that it'll make you wonder how humans would actually treat aliens if this happened in real-life.

"anselmdaniel","9","0","0","26 January 2019"," A sharp science-fiction action movie
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>District 9 is a science-fiction action movie that premiered in 2009. The movie is directed by Neill Blomkamp and is written by Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell. The movie stars Sharlto Copley in the leading role. The movie is about an extraterrestrial spaceship that arrives outside Johannesburg. The movie focuses on Wikus van de Merwe played by Sharlto Copley that discovers something in the alien slums.<br/><br/>District 9 is a nice surprise. This movie presents science-fiction in an approachable way for mainstream audiences. There is also subtext in the imovie that can help audience's enjoyment of the movie. The movie's plot and direction move at a quick pace while also introducing important plot elements in the movie. All of this together makes for an enjoyable experience for the audience.<br/><br/>The main plot does focus on the lead of Wikus van de Merwe and Christopher Johnson, played by Jason Cope. This focus happens for the entire movie and is enjoyable to watch. Wikus goes through a drastic transformation across the 112 minute running time of this movie. It was great to see his humanization as the movie went on and he became more alien. Likewise Christopher started to care more about Wikus as time went on and the two can be seen coming to a respect for one another. The two are begrudgingly together and trying to solve their predicaments selfishly until they realized they needed to help each other. From the beginning until the end the movie's plot had me engrossed.<br/><br/>Another great part of this movie is the action. As a rarity in the science-fiction genre, the movie has many action scenes. This movie is gory, and visceral in the action scenes. The aliens have advanced weaponry that is authentically presented in the movie. I enjoyed this aspect of the movie as the weaponry is utterly remorseless in its depiction. This doubly goes for the brutality shown by aliens and humans. In addition to being cool to look at, the action drives the themes of the movie which is a great component in this movie. The brutality opens up the drama that is at the core of this movie.<br/><br/>District 9 does a good job balancing action, comedy, and drama. The movie balances all of these things even as the audience learns more about the world of District 9. Much of the movie
relies on the direction and acting. Both of these components are at a high standard and it makes the shocking parts of the movile more memorable. Sharlto Copley is in a panic mode for much of the movie and he balances this with his character's concerns well. He has a good balance between to self-preservation and helping the alien prawns. Likewise Christopher is mainly a voice in this movie and it really shows in his emotions. The two share a memorable emotional moment near the end of the movie.
I highly recommend 'District 9'. This movie had a surprising amount of drama for a science fiction movie. It is absolutely a great movie in 2009.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I'll skip the plot this time and just summarize the pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>Great seamless special effects. They're done so naturally and shown so offhandedly, that they really look & feel like part of the mockumentary in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>A good imagination with the aliens, weapons, ships and technology.<br/><br/>Several entertaining scenes, with lots of humor and action (except that the blend of these different approaches don't work well with each other - see below).<br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>The movie can't make up its mind about its approach and type of entertainment. First it's a really silly mockumentary that revels in awkward Office-like humor (which also happens to be a genre I don't enjoy) with a dumb bureaucrat trying to handle the moving of very wild aliens. Then there's the more serious sci-fi elements and drama that clashes with the silly approach. Then there's action-scenes for a shoot-em-up ending.<br/><br/>The aliens never make sense. They have superior weaponry but allow themselves to be subdued with only a few violent fits, they are extremely dumb, except for one fellow for no particular reason. It's like dogs suddenly invented space travel and weapons - it never makes sense.<br/><br/>The movie wants to draw parallels with apartheid and whatnot, but the aliens are so violent, animalistic and disrespectful in their behaviour, it's impossible to sympathize with them.<br/><br/>Character development is a mess: We get a bureaucrat who gleefully 'pops' baby aliens, then he is forced to live with them when he starts mutating but still stays a bureaucratic jerk, and he only helps them when he realizes he needs them to save his own skin, killing his own brainlessly violent co-workers for selfish reasons. Not exactly satisfying. And yet it seems the movie wants us to sympathize.<br/><br/>Given the above, and the fact that the police also are so cartoonishly fascist and violent, there is no side to take with this movie and nobody that is likable.<br/><br/>Therefore, this is a one-time watch only."
"harryrgrove","7","0","0","18 October 2015"," Original, but not perfect
","Today, originality is rare, especially in the sci-fi genre. When we look at the wonderful blockbusters of recent days, such as Inception, we begin to notice a pattern: almost all major science-fiction films fundamentally have been made, albeit slightly differently, before. In Inception's case we can consider The Matrix, from which many major ideas have been recycled.<br/><br/>Maybe, in District 9, we have something different. In a realistic story that focuses on the politics of an alien invasion as much as the action, I found myself watching a story somewhat unlike any that I had ever seen, in which morals, the true ideas behind characters and who to support in a non-binary are not necessarily clear.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley gives a strong, charismatic and believable take on the character 'Wikus'. This main character is not overly likable but not annoying. However, this is not the brilliance of the characterisation: the character goes on a physical and mental arc, in which his moral compass, ideas and form are changed in numerous ways. These changes make the character brilliantly compelling and watchable.<br/><br/>The design of the aliens are also a positive of the film: they look strong but not wholly evil, which is representative of their place in the story. However, one must question in a film where most aspects seem realistic, whether this design is to be believed, and the answer is, unfortunately, no. The aesthetics of these aliens are too humanoid for the audience to believe that they developed outside of our world, and the idea that they can survive here without any side-effects is overly convenient.<br/><br/>It is this convenience in which I believe the film is flawed. The plot may be the film's greatest asset, in the fact that it is original, but it is also its weakness, as the ridiculous coincidences of some events can distract from the aspect of realism that the film otherwise maintains.<br/><br/>The plot, unfortunately, wasn't the only weakness of the film. For a sci-fi action movie, the action seemed somewhat lacking in creativity; it never looked as though it was going to advance past the stage of immature and unnecessary violence - like people getting blown to smithereens with alien laser guns - and this gives it a painful Michael-Bayesque feel. I wish there were more scenes of exciting hand-to-hand combat of the likes that we saw in 2014's greatest (in every sense of the word) flop Edge of Tomorrow, or 2010s Inception, which certainly was not a flop in any way. To me, it seems a tragedy that these films were not sufficiently recognised by the academy, whereas District 9 (the admittedly inferior film) was.<br/><br/>When we see originality, we must forgive its overly convenient plot and the frustratingly uninventive fight scenes, and focus on what is a surprisingly political story with an interesting message."

","District 9 is the debut movie of Neill Blomkamp featuring largely unknown actors depicting a future in which aliens are residing in Earth along with humans. The movie is presented in a mockumentary-style format with the actors speaking directly to the camera. The plot shows how a normal human is starting to turn into an alien due to being exposed to a mysterious liquid. The emotions captured by the actor are quite realistic and shows how any ordinary person would respond on knowing that he can no longer be a human. The story is quite intriguing which makes this a pleasant watch. However, I am surprised by how overwhelmingly positive reviews this movie has garnered as it has plenty of flaws as well. If you want to watch a slightly different science fiction movie, then give this a try."

","District 9 rides the Blair Witch Project wave in that it heavily utilizes the mock documentary style the aforementioned film popularized some years ago. It also tries new things with its basic premise, putting actual aliens in the position of aliens, as in immigrants. It's a fascinating idea and will naturally allow for a lot of new directions from which to examine the old problem and dilemma.<br/><br/>I only wish it had stuck with that basic idea. Because now it seems that they came up with this great idea, but instead of doing a social commentary or even a satire, they decided to shoot an action film. And sure, an action film can comment on current society as well, but it simply cannot do it as well because you need to make room for gun fights and explosions.<br/><br/>But, don't get me wrong. The gun fights and explosions are nice. This is a good science fiction film. The special effects are topnotch, the alien designs are creative (though, why always bugs), the action works well and the actors are talented. Though I do admit that I find Sharlto Copley's accent to be a bit thick, but at least it's memorable.<br/><br/>District 9 divides opinions. Those that are looking for a good scifi action film with a clever premise will absolutely love it. Unfortunately, those that have listened to the hype and come in expecting a modern classic, a revolution, will be somewhat disappointed. Absolutely worth seeing, but do come in with an open mind."

In real life that simply would NEVER happen! The USA would have immediately stormed in and taken charge (whether asked to or not) and, in keeping with this type of movie, Stallone, Schwarzennegger, Willis and all the other tough guys methodically wiped out the aliens, friendly or not!<br/><br/>As one who enjoys fantasy movies I'm afraid that District 9 left me a bit ho-hum but, if you like the genre, by all means give it a go.

"ahegde3149","8","0","0","1 October 2014"," Neill Blomkamp the new spark in science fiction
","Director/Writer Neill Blomkamp is just at the beginning of his career with 2 films. 'Elysium' of last year was his first film I saw and found it quite good. Now his first feature 'District 9' film is much better and probably a dream debut for any director. Science Fiction being one of my favorite genres I have a feeling Mr. Blomkamp may end up being added to the my list of greatest directors in future, he has already proved it in the sci-fi genre though. The standout point which I liked in his both films is how he highlights the social issues and the feeling of inequality set in our minds.<br/><br/>District 9 begins uniquely with a series of documentary type footage explaining the situation. A mysterious alien ship has halted over the city of Johannesburg,South Africa.After 3 month wait humans decide to break into the ship and the discover alien creatures looking like prawns(hence their name) in number more than million stranded in there.These creatures seemed malnourished and are given shelter in slum-like area called District 9 in Johannesburg. Years pass and unrest among people rise due to the presence of these aliens and lack of mutual understanding the two species. Over 20 years they get to know each others languages but co-existence seems difficult. Finally it is decided to move these aliens to another settlement District 10 well outside the city and Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) of MNC a company handling the alien affairs is the made head of operations. He and the team needs to issue the eviction notices and get signature of all the aliens for the relocation.<br/><br/>The thing that I like about the film is the way it portrays human behavior towards something they don't have much knowledge about. Well this is present in many sci-fi films but District 9 is quite different. We get easily sympathetic towards the situation the aliens are facing. Even if it feels a bit direction-less in its first half but gets really interesting later and filled enough action to entertain those who get bored by mundane sci-fiction.The story is focused on Wikus who has an incident during the relocation operation and his struggle later which later is going the fate of the aliens and his own. Shartlo Copley has done a fine job even if some may find his accent annoying.The CGI is very good, the aliens blend so effectively into the environment that it looks a like a intricately designed costume. I felt the first half had lot of info to chew on that made it less-likable to general audience. Also some elements in the film seem relatively unexplained like the possession of high-grade weapons by the aliens. But still the film looks quite realistic.<br/><br/>Music was good and I really liked the documentary style narration.The ending is again quite unique and many may be waiting for a sequel for detailed answers for some questions. Apart from that District 9 is grand debut for Neill Blomkamp. I am not going to miss any of his sci-fiction movies in the future.<br/><br/>Rating: [4/5]"
"adamscastlevania2","5","0","0","18 September 2014"," A nice plot, but the direction sucks
","(50%) Perfect example of a decent concept hampered by poor directional decisions. The idea of an alien ship coming to earth due to them escaping mortal peril, only for the world population to then not really know what to do with them is a very good refugee based concept. And I am guessing the reason why this film is so highly regarded is because of those political messages regarding how we treat others in times of crisis and the apartheid, but it is all so massively on the nose leaving not a hint of subtlety to anything. The worst aspect of the movie though by a mile is the direction, the makers have tried so hard to make it look as real as possible that it becomes a joke. Why must almost everything look like it is shot via a live feed from a hand-held camera? Why do we need to see fake interviews and news reports? I know the story is not real, so why try and force me to think that it is, the movie is partly about a man that turns into a cricket for god-sake, so why make this way? It's just plain stupid! And even is the movie is true to life then it is still no excuse as it feels really uncinematic and cheap. Maybe in the future this could be re-made once the found footage fad has died out and maybe that will be a good film, this though is a disappointment."

","District 9 is a movie I've seen already four times. A few years ago, while I was watching it for the first time I just found it good. Somewhat, the second and third time I watched it I found it very good. District 9's heady thrills must make District 9 a classic. These thrills are the kind of thrills to make you bounce of excitement. Not only that, but District 9 is also technically impressive, has an original premise and plot, irresistible imagination and it also has a strong emotional side to it thank goodness and adds even better effect to the motion picture beside its thrilling action sequences. The characters' characterization however is kinda obvious and so is their character development. I'm congratulating Neil Blomkamp for his amazing directorial debut work in District 9 and I think he should be really proud of himself for his work in the film - he managed to make an exuberant film. It is clear from watching the movie that he had a passion for filming his imagined subject. District 9 is currently my second favorite film in memory. My rating for District 9 is 8.1/10"

He even begins to sympathize with them. The film is very very good. The only reason it doesn't deserve a perfect 10 is the fact that there is little character development and one or 2 plot holes, but what movie doesn't have a few.

"feyipuk","7","0","0","9 March 2014"," A good premise that slightly drifts
","Starting as a mockumentary about the arrival of aliens to South Africa, the film is a clever take on the problems of immigration and the issues facing integration of different societies. The main actor portrays the pen pushing Wikus with the charm that should be attributed to a mid level bureaucrat. He enjoys his job, he has a beautiful wife and he's just trying to get on with his life, despite the fact that most of the people he works with see him as a mid level bureaucrat. Without his performance this film could have been a lost cause, yet his emotions keep the film together. Filmed in South Africa, there are clips of people on the streets that are reminiscent of apartheid videos from the eighties, and the activities of the Nigerians in the film resonated with South African colleagues. This could have been a more accessible way to deal with race and culture to a generation for whom apartheid is in the history books. Then you have the second part of the film. The aliens have weapons that make human weapons look like catapults, and the producers are not afraid to show them off - in all their visceral fury - making the latter part of the film more like a horror film. Yes, the violence may be needed, it just feels over done to the point of comedy (think the 1987 Robocop). If this film is about apartheid, then this violence is simply scaled; one man against the system, using the weapons at his disposal to make a difference (as opposed to many people with smaller weapons). Yet, that also sits at odds with the helpless nature the aliens portray through out the film. They're shown as starving and cowed by the humans, but they're physically stronger than the humans and there doesn't look to be any indications there was any struggle when they landed. Yes, the aliens could probably have taken over the planet with their fire power, yet at the same time it shows the humans to be more monstrous than the visitors. An entertaining film, with some hard hitting messages and the expectation of a sequel"

The real gripping factor in the movie is the camera angles, they give you the first person experience in many action sequences.<br/><br/>Such sci-fi movie will not be without flaws, and this movie also has its count. But none of that is worth-mentioning because they are over-shadowed by the hero's performance. Agreed the movie does not have a story to tell, but who needs story in action movie. Everything that is needed for the movie to succeed is given at the right potion and the director has given a new dimension to alien-type movies<br/><br/>I am not in favor of gory scenes, and in this script it was completely unwarranted and the climax was a bit of drag, i can't believe the hero had such heavy artillery and still decided to run behind the bushes to save himself, bit childish i believe. Also, too much of the 'F' word in the movie, i almost felt the director would add the F word even in the end credits along with the cast names. All in all your money's worth and the end was classical. The hero does save the day as always or does he? <br/><br/>Watch the movie and you will be thrilled!!!"

","In general the movie is good: it has an interesting plot, a well-done photography and amazing special effects.<br/><br/>What I really appreciate is the physiognomy of the aliens. If they had been represented as lovely creatures, the audience would have immediately take their side. But as they where portrayed as a sort of big and abhorring bug, it is more difficult for the viewers to start liking them. This will only happen when the audience realizes that men are cruel exploiters, while aliens - even if they seems to be the bad invaders - are the innocent victims.<br/><br/>But it also has some defects. For example, I didn't like the very first part of the movie for two reasons. First, I think the actions develop too quickly: aliens arrive, they're segregated and men decide to transfer them somewhere else, all in about 4-5 minutes. Second, I find the documentary technique a bit confusing.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that I consider useless. For example when Wikus cut off his finger: first, he knows that that wouldn't solve his situation; second, there are no more references to that actions after that. Or when he slap really strongly Christopher because he said it would take him 3 years to cure him. It happens and no consequences arise.<br/><br/>I also find the theme of men vs. aliens not originally developed and moreover the film's ending was a foregone.<br/><br/>All thing considered, the movie is worth-seeing but I cannot say that I'm surely going to see it again in the future."

However, out of all the films to come out in 2009, I feel ""District 9"" surpasses the likes of ""Avatar"" or ""Transformers 2"". Proving that even when working on an incredibly low budget, CGI is maturing rapidly beyond ""expenses"" and ""limitations"".<br/><br/>The answer to a failed ""Halo"" movie. A lot of people have already condemned this movie for having no originality, due to the fact that there are so many prior movies sharing similarities such as ""The Fugitive"", ""The Fly"", ""Alien Nation"", ""Independence Day"" etc. Even though this movie contains many elements of those certain films (Few I think fall flat), this still stands strong as something completely different from what we've seen in a long time. Managing to include a lot of heavy themes such as racism, poverty and corruption. As for the actual film WOW! America doesn't get invaded this time. No it actually lands in Africa, where the director and most of this cast originated.<br/><br/>Aliens land not with gifts of wisdom or shiny utopias, but sickness, famine and are sent away to live in the slums outside the city of Johannesburg. ""District 9"" becomes a breeding ground for gangs, shantytowns and clearly the beginning of something much worse. Among them a simple employee from the government anti-alien company ""MNU"", will soon become the answer to either the company prayers or the aliens salvation.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley did a superb job as our main character. For a first time role I'm very pleased his career has got off to such a good start, as well as the supporting cast who do terrific jobs building a real sense of dirt, tension and prejudice that bring out the ""realism"". Again it's clearly Sci-Fi, but why do I feel I could switch on the news now and see a country pull itself apart as depicted in this movie?<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Neil Blomkamp & Peter Jackson have made something truly special. I feel Blomkamp is trying to reproduce and show a little bit more than what regulations would usually allow, but by including aliens in the mix as a substitute it could very much threaten any underlying message they were going for. Either way ""District 9"" was entertaining, and to me began a tradition that I feel we will have at least one exceptionally great Sci-Fi movie each year since. 8/10."

I had reservations when I saw the blurb ""Peter Jackson Presents"" as opposed to a Peter Jackson Film. The holes come from a lot of unanswered questions about the aliens, they've been on the Earth for 20 years, but nobody seems interested in the huge spacecraft hovering in the sky, or who or where the aliens come from. South Africa seems to be an isolated country, they took on the burden of looking after these alien ""prawns"" all by themselves. Where is the international community, all the scientists, why aren't they studying the technology of the ship, obviously, they knew how to get into it. There appears to be no communication with the aliens, where did they come from, and why?

","Please don't waste your money on this train wreck. I have no idea how this thing got rated so high. Most of the movie reminded me of watching CNN or AC360. The movie is NOT an action movie. There is only about 15 min of action near the end. The rest of the movie is just documenting the main characters life. The acting was good and the special effects are above average, but it can not save the complete boredom of the rest of the movie. For example and this is not spoiling the plot at all: The first 15 min of the movie is nothing but the main character's co-workers giving interviews about the main character. Its Painful. So if you insist on seeing this movie bring lots of popcorn and don't be afraid to stand in line and miss the beginning or the middle of this movie. You really aren't missing much."

","I hated this movie. The special effects were good, but the way the movie was put together was terrible. I hated the documentary style instead of the normal way movies are presented. Usually its nice to have someone to pull for, but I found myself pulling for a quick end to this flick. I tried to give it a chance, but I kept finding myself looking at the display timer so I could find how much time was left. The worst part was expecting a different kind of movie because of the cover art and commercials. What a let down. I was hoping for ""War of the Worlds"" instead I got Battle to Stay Awake. I didn't care about the big overgrown bugs, I mean aliens, who acted like thugs through most of the movie. I didn't care about the main human character either. He got a little more likable once he decided to trust the bugs, I mean aliens. This makes no sense because they created the spray that mutated him. Peter Jackson needs to stick to epics like Lord of the Rings and not turn over projects like this to terrible first time writer/directors. The special effects were impressive. But even with that, I would say it deserves a zero. But since I have to give at least a 1, so be it. If you're expecting and want epic science fiction, don't waste your time or money on this garbage."

Maybe I've lost all concept of a good movie. This was a completely unbelievable plot riddled with holes and ridiculous actions taken/not taken by the characters.

","This is one of the absolutely most amazing movies I have seen.<br/><br/>It combines elements from at least movies like Robocop, Aliens, Appleseed, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan and Hellraiser AND it adds it's own particular flavors. It is also heavily influenced by legendary games like Half-Life II.<br/><br/>The artwork, machinery, and weaponry, is mind blowing. It does at least two mind tricks to me (1) it starts out as a hand-held documentary and ends up as a very violent close-up war movie and it makes this spectacular transition in a way that I totally accepted (2) the main character (or hero if you can call him that) is a total idiot, a moron, and in the beginning I have absolutely no sympathy for him, at times I just wished he would die in a horrible way.

"SebaZava","9","3","8","30 November 2009"," A very gritty and compelling sci-fi story.
","District 9 is different. There's no doubt about that. The premise is not totally original, but it feels fresh enough to prevent the audience from feeling they're watching a retread. It's also very smart, very exciting and visually arresting. Like some of the best science-fiction stories of all time, it actually has something to say, and it stimulates the mind instead of killing it. Is what Transformers 2 would have wanted to be - yes, there's even a fight sequence in District 9 involving a big robot and it's a thousand times better than anything present in Michael Bay's movie - and what most sci-fi movies should be. Granted, I guess a lot of people - especially teenagers - will hate it because it doesn't follow the usual rules of ""summer blockbusters"", but it matters not. Although it's got its share of action and special effects, this is by no means a typical Hollywood blockbuster, and I thank director Neil Blomkamp and producer Peter Jackson for that.<br/><br/>District 9 is an interesting motion picture. During the majority of its considerable running time, the film is constructed as a mockumentary, with interviews with ""experts"" and even the protagonist's family being intercut with the actual events of the movie. And the actual events are shot and cut in a very ""in your face"" kind of manner, with a particular sequence - that in which Wilkus is infected - being the most obvious example. (The cameraman is an actual character.) Fortunately, the camera-work is not as shaky as in, say, Cloverfield, and the technique never really turns into a gimmick. Actually, Blomkamp's gritty, realistic approach works wonderfully, giving the movie a sense of verisimilitude that adds some gravitas to the proceedings. It makes the viewer feel like part of this world.<br/><br/>A lot must be said too about the film's special effects, which add to the feeling of realism instead of detracting from it. Simply put, they are top-notch, something that is quite surprising considering the film's modest budget of $30 000 000. The aliens' design is effective, and although they were all created in a computer, there wasn't a single moment in which I thought they were digital creations instead of palpable characters. The few action sequences the film provides with are all pulse-pounding and expertly shot - Michael Bay should definitely watch this movie -. (Consider the finale involving the giant, alien robot, for example.) Most importantly, though, the effects never call attention to themselves, and they make an appearance because they are needed, not because the filmmakers wanted to craft a CGI stravaganza.<br/><br/>Clearly, the film's tone is not very optimistic or cheerful, but that goes with the material. After all, it present a world in which aliens are ""greeted"" with discrimination and greed, and every good intention humankind could have had before is quickly disappearing. From a visual point of view, Blomkamp conveys this with a very gritty, almost black-and-white cinematography - this is a very bleak world in which people - and aliens - get all bloody, messy, dirty and even killed. On the other hand, although most people might think they ""should"" root for Wilke, things aren't as simple as they look. The way Blomkamp makes the viewer see things is very interesting - Wilke is not a ""bad"" man, but since he does things that look as terrible as anything done by a stereotypical movie villain, one doesn't really know if he's a protagonist worth rooting for or not. Maybe that's why the aliens - especially Christopher Johnson - were given a humanoid look and human-like mannerisms. Considering how they are treated, one should expect to feel sympathetic for them.<br/><br/>Still, compared to how scientists and greedy company CEOs are portrayed, Wilke is almost an angel. After all, there's still some humanity left in him - he has a a wife that he loves, for example -, and he becomes even more humane during the last few scenes, even though he suffers a transformation that, in theory, should make him less of a human. If anything, the movie shows how people can be overridden by greed and xenophobia and that, ultimately, they would care more about money and power than the human - or alien - condition. The worst thing about this is that, if aliens ever visit out planet, there are more chances of us treating them like they are treated in the movie, than of being all benevolent and peaceful. One only has to give a brief look to any history book to find proof of this.<br/><br/>District 9 won't make anyone feel happy or joyful, but that's beside the point. It's a very compelling movie that works in both a visceral and intellectual level, and that should be enjoyed by any ""serious"" science fiction aficionado. It's got some exciting actual sequences, amazing special effects and a very well-thought premise but, most importantly, it also has an interesting - and sadly plausible - message about humanity. The film's ending is also something of a set up for a sequel, but unlike other movies, it doesn't feel neither incomplete nor unsatisfying. I, for one, would certainly like a sequel to be made, although I have no idea of how Blomkamp could continue telling his story in such a believable and ""in-your-face"" kind of way. No matter. As it is, District 9 is one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in some time."

"somewhereovertheturnip","8","3","8","8 October 2009"," A very competently made piece of sci-fi (contains spoilers).
","I really enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The main protagonist was brilliantly 'written' (he ad libbed his lines) and portrayed. I found the technique produced a very realistic and engaging character who was very human and reacted to each situation like an average, slightly cowardly worker drone would.<br/><br/>There was no leap from human to super killing machine as there usually with this plot type (The Matrix, Star Wars, etc..), what we see is a highly flawed man being thrust into a fantastical situation and stumbling through it with his negative traits flaring and dictating his behaviour. The only reason he manages to pull off what he does is his ability to use the vastly superior alien tech, and even then he uses it ineptly and frustratingly just like an untrained person would.<br/><br/>(and before anyone gets on this, the aliens were so easily subdued because they lacked the intelligence to use the tech efficiently. Christopher and his son were anomalies.)<br/><br/>I really liked that it took the entire film for the protagonist to realise the flaws in his ideals and opinions regarding the Prawns, and that the only real reason this occurred was due to his transformation and subsequent ostracism from his fellow man. The kind of prejudices he held before would only ever be broken by something so drastic. <br/><br/>That my emotions towards Wikus flitted between sympathy, support, and disgust, only cemented my opinion that the character was portrayed effectively and realistically. <br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The relationship between Wikus and his family and friends didn't need to be portrayed any deeper. We were given all we needed to make the human connection with him at the start. A director doesn't need to spoon feed the audience to achieve this, he just needs to be efficient and I believe, in this case, he was.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The Sci-fi elements were perfectly done. I was satisfied with the explanations and techno-speak. I honestly see any criticism here to be highly pedantic and pretentious. <br/><br/>Also, the argument that humanoid aliens who can breath our atmosphere is lazy is a ridiculous one. It's as much of an assumption that alien life would differ from us so as it is that it would share similarities. Again, pedantic and pointless.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>I've read that some people believe the film to be racist toward Nigerians. Bullshit. The film portrayed HUMANS as intolerant, greedy, malicious, etc... That we have a group of Nigerian militia in a country that is rife with such groups was as realistic and fair as the rest of it.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The action here was 100% better than the over-blown trash that Mr Bay produced earlier in the year. It was clear, humorous. awkward (a good representation of the ineptness of the protagonist), and the effects were stupendous. <br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The ending: I love how open they left it, and I don't believe it was done to leave room for a sequel. It felt much more like the director wanted his audience to go away with mixed emotions and aspirations for the characters and events and letting them fill in the rest for themselves. I love it when film-makers do this effectively, which is very rare.<br/><br/>Of course, if there is a sequel I won't be disappointed unless I'm disappointed. :p<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>My main criticism of the film is the over-use of Wikus' hesitance and awkwardness to produce tension. Even though I consider it realistic in keeping with his character, the frustration I felt toward him at times (taking far too long to get into the mech-suit, running from the highly inferior human soldiers while using the mech suit, etc..) was quite off- putting. <br/><br/>-<br/><br/>So, yeh, I enjoyed the film. It was a very competently directed, acted, and written piece of science-fiction that took clichÃ©d themes and added human elements that are very rare to the genre.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to all sci-fi fans."

The main character (wikus van de merwe) had my sympathy from the start, he seems so genuine and believable that by the end of the film you feel you know him just a little bit. As you would expect this film doesn't disappoint in the effects department either, but i think less is more and here is that example. just the fact that the 'prawns' were so well done it stopped me looking for graphic errors very early in the film.

","This is a GREAT movie about a very plausible situation. A MUST-SEE!! An Alien ship, transporting hundreds of Thousands of Alien population malfunctions and they are obliged to land here on earth. This is an important detail, because later on you will get to understand that they are both technologically and socially much more advanced than us, and they would have not chosen earth as a destination. Actually as they were maneuvering a smaller aircraft coming from the main ship lands, but that is a minor detail that will only become major later. In any case we get to the main ship and bring the aliens down to earth, they were weakened and needed food, so the decision was made to transport them all down to a refugee camp as a 'temporary measure' they somehow were able to breath fine, and particularly enjoyed cat food. The main ship remains afloat Johanesburg in South Africa and down below the Aliens live in a camp that quickly turns into a funky slum. What is great about the movie is making the transition between Alien exotica and 'everyday Alien"", we see them interchanging with humans, trading, and constantly moving about. Although they look like human sized lobsters, and are referred to as ""Prawns"" they pretty much have the same configuration as ours. <br/><br/>The movie starts actually a full twenty years after the 'landing' so all the glamor of news and novelty is gone and the South African Government is just trying to move them to another district, further away from their capital city by forced eviction. At this point the man in charge of the operations, Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley gets infected by a canister that contains a liquid two of the aliens had been hard at work for a long time. He does not know this, he thinks they are gangsters because their hut is full of computers and weaponry, but in reality they are the scientists amongst the aliens that have been working all this time to fix the spaceship, when he accidentally sprays some of the contents on himself he starts triggering a genetic reaction that will slowly change him into one of the creatures in a slow but very visible way. The strong, excellent performance by Wikus is what makes it believable, he is a totally square and regular guy, actually pretty good natured and in the process of this horrific change he maintains his humanity and sanity and has a complete change of heart in his relationship to the Aliens, as he is forced by circumstance to 'bond' with the one scientist who was involved in making the liquid, and his small son.<br/><br/>The film is important in showing the complexities of the exchanges with the Aliens and covers full well the political intrigue and inhumane behavior that is part of our present state of evolution. It starts out very slow and is not particularly great in the introduction of this information, so that at one point I was getting very impatient, but then started to enjoy the flow of the story. The turning point was the intervention of the liquid that changes Wikus and everything about the movie from that point forward. A rare instance in SciFi where violence is not gratuitous and all the tech makes perfect sense. It will doubtlessly become a cult film."

"dave-sturm","10","3","8","19 August 2009"," A landmark in sci fi cinema
","Everyone here is posting about how sensational ""District 9"" is and they are all correct. I won't go on about the plot or the political themes in the movie.<br/><br/>But, some observations: As the movie begins, you share the Joburgers disgust with the Prawns, who are shown urinating in public, digging through garbage and acting obnoxious. They look like walking lobsters. One is shown absurdly wearing a pink bra. Then something happens and the audience reverses course. And I can tell you the moment it happens. It's in the lab when they are testing with Wikus' hand/claw on the alien weapon. They bring in a hapless alien with an X painted on his back and put him up against a wall. You can see that the poor creature is terrified. You think, oh no, they aren't gonna do what I think they're gonna do. They are. Wikus refuses to cooperate and is screaming, but the lab docs force him. I submit that this is the most important moment in the movie because the aliens are put in a whole new light and the audience now takes their side.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, audience disgust shifts to the MNU mercs, who drive around in armored vehicles blowing up aliens. They snarl all their dialogue.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses from here, we get to know the main alien, who is not called Mongo or Zorg, but Christopher Johnson. Note: His first name contains the word Christ and his last name is pure Anglo-Saxon. He has a small son who's kinda cute. Also, he walks and stands like a man, not like other aliens who tend to sway. And he's a scientist out to rescue his species. We are so on this guy's side.<br/><br/>Wikus' character arc is this movie is amazing. He goes from preening twit in the beginning to a rampaging warrior at the end. Tremendous performance. I want to see more of this actor.<br/><br/>The CGI on display here sets a new standard.<br/><br/>Parts of D9 will remind you of lots of other movies, but mark my words, in the future it will be other movies that remind you of D9.<br/><br/>Add to this an ending that will bring a lump to your throat and you have one for the history books.<br/><br/>And there'd better be a sequel because there's plenty of unfinished business."

"DonFishies","9","3","8","16 August 2009"," A wildly original tour-de-force that needs to be seen to be believed
","District 9 is perhaps the best science fiction film since The Matrix. Startling words for a little film out of South Africa with a mostly untested cast and crew, but it is doubtful that the phrase will be contested by many.<br/><br/>Going in knowing very little is key to the success of this enigmatic masterpiece of contemporary cinema. Blending techniques from the schools of cinéma vérité and avant-garde, District 9 details an alternate history of the world where a spaceship lands in South Africa in the 1980s. Its occupants, some 1-million-plus aliens, are given refugee status and forced to live in a shanty town fenced off from most of the human population.<br/><br/>Using government official Wilkus Van De Merwe (first time actor Sharlto Copley) as the central character of the film, District 9 jumps between being a faux documentary loaded with expert interviews, hand-held camera footage and security camera footage, to a gritty, dystopic allegory mixing in elements of Apartheid, big business and even Nazi Germany. But through seamless editing, the major jumps are barely noticeable. While some films find it hard to move from style to style without feeling jarring or blatantly forced, District 9 manages to find a masterful way of movement that feels all too natural (much like Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire).<br/><br/>It is because of this wildly original motif that District 9 stands out as such an amazing piece of film-making. Low budget miracles aside, the film plays out unlike anything you have ever seen. It is truly a unique and original film. Using the relatively untapped documentary style narrative for the majority of the film, the method of storytelling here is so powerful that one wonders why no one else has ever thought to make a film like this before. Doing away with complexities, it is so simple it almost pains me to think that some people just will not get it. In a decade littered with films that ape off of significantly better films or just feel stale altogether, here is a small film that is so wildly off the grid that it practically demands to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>I mention some not being able to grasp the story and ideologies director Neil Blomkamp is putting forth because the film is undeniably and unapologetically anti-Hollywood. There is no flare of contemporary glamour, no big name actors or crew members (outside of producer Peter Jackson), no Transformers-style big budget effects; nothing that screams contemporary American studio-produced cinema. But at the same time, it does not feel like a low budget indie or a foreign produced festival film. It feels like it is one-of-a-kind, a starting point for a breed of experimental film-making. Films like Children of Men, Cloverfield and United 93 have used the stylistic and experimental means of cinéma vérité to their advantages over the past few years and stand out as uniquely made films. But District 9 is the first film in a very long time that really harnesses the medium as an experiment, and succeeds at being so unlike anything that has been released for the entirety of 2009.<br/><br/>Being so low budgeted, one would think that the special effects would not be nearly as well done as a film like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. But rather surprisingly, this film has a sense of epic grandeur that begins with a shot of the alien spacecraft near the opening of the film, and never fades away. So much is done with so little that the story of its production practically begs to be taught in film schools immediately. The aliens, or 'prawns' as they are referred to, are so realistic and lifelike that some shots look even better than those heavily budgeted films. They even have their own language, inexplicably understandable to humans, but so easily used here that it is a great special effect all on its own. Some of the makeup effects are simply astounding for how authentic and terrifying they look. And when the film saunters into being fairly violent, the horrific depictions on-screen are almost too genuine. District 9 is so polished and so seamlessly edited that one wonders why every movie does not look nearly as well done as this one.<br/><br/>The acting, as untested and improvised as it is, is strong across the board. Everyone feels natural in their roles, and never once do we question their acting abilities. Copley is the clear standout of the picture, expressing a multitude of emotions every chance he gets. You would never know this is his first role with just how much effort and ease he appears to be giving. I can only hope we will see more of him in the future.<br/><br/>The film has too few faults (outside of a few minor plot holes) that it almost feels criminal to mention them. There are a few character motives and perspectives that feel off in the final act of the film. They do not ruin the greatness of the final product, but they do detract from it. And while the film's running time practically soars by, there are more than a few things that seem a little too glossed over. A good movie always leaves you wanting more, but there were a few too many points that went unanswered that easily could have been explained in a piece of dialogue. It is a minor quibble, but nonetheless takes away from the film.<br/><br/>Imperfections aside, District 9 is one hell of a ride from start to finish. Some may be turned off by its style, but the film is such a great piece of art that any fan of the medium owes it to themselves to see this film. It is easily one of the best films of the year. Now, do not ruin it with a sequel! <br/><br/>9/10."
"zetes","9","3","8","16 August 2009"," Smart, exciting sci-fi from South Africa
","Newcomer Neill Blomkamp shows up every American sci-fi blockbuster of the last decade. It's not an extremely complex film, but it is coherent, has a decent amount of intelligence, a good idea behind it and fairly interesting characters. That's all you really need, isn't it? The premise: 20 years ago, a gigantic alien ship stalled over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. Inside it were about a million aliens, starving to death and unable to fix the ship. They were brought down and allowed to live in the slums of the city. The human inhabitants dislike them, and want them to be removed from their society. The story: Sharlto Copley plays a bureaucrat in charge of moving the population of aliens, known as Prawns, into a refugee camp some distance from the city. Obviously, with a population now numbering nearly one and a half million, these creatures aren't easily moved. Some of them even have some tricks up their sleeves. The story obviously has parallels to South Africa's own apartheid situation, which gives the movie a little bit of heft. I also thought Copley's character was quite daring, because he's the protagonist but he's really quite an unlikeable little snot for most of the movie (it also supplies a more identifiable alien character, named Christopher Johnson). The little flack the film has gotten from critics involves its basically turning into an action flick in the second half (the first half is actually done in documentary form, which works for the most part). While I admit it's a little more predictable in its second half, I don't see why we should complain that it's an action movie when it's a good action movie. We actually care when the characters are in danger. With all the garbage that has been released in the summer of '09, a good action movie is more than welcome. One complaint I would make, probably the thing that holds the film back from being a masterpiece, is the completely bland villains, led by a dull corporate CEO and a sadistic military leader."

","I understand comparing a Sci-Fi to Bruno may seem absurd but this movie takes the approach of documenting the events taking place.

The movie takes place in Johannesburg,South Africa and it's about Alien rights since they can not go home. While documenting the events the movie takes the approach of depicting Nigerians as Alien eating, bestiality engaging(prostitution w/ aliens) people.

It was like a bad version of the Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield. There was not any sort of smooth transition between the sequences that were supposed to be government recorded and those that were just supposed to be plot...which I found disconcerting. If the entire film was supposedly be from secret tapes made during the occurrence, the film included sequences that could not have been recorded by these secret tapes. I thought the ending left us hanging, as I found no hint that the Alien would indeed come back, or fix our the Wikus, or what would happen when the did."

"lanctot","2","4","13","28 August 2009"," Worst movie since A Sound of Thunder
","It makes me sad that this movie is currently rated as #41 movie of all time. It is the worst movie I've seen in years. The only reason I'm giving it a 2 instead of 1 is because the second half of the movie was visually entertaining because it had some action.<br/><br/>The story is based on a completely ridiculous, extremely unbelievable premise that the human race would nurture the survival of aliens on earth -- and that this goes over smoothly for 20 years. If I wasn't with friends, I would have walked out after the first 30 minutes and asked to see a different movie or get my money back. <br/><br/>None of the characters are likable. The main character is a complete buffoon who would never be trusted in any kind of position of power in real life. The only thing that you can like about him is how he completely loses it by the second half of the movie because everyone around him betrays him. Everyone except for the aliens, of course.<br/><br/>Oh, but it's the humans who are the bad guys? How original! We're selfish and greedy, and all we want are the weapons. The typical dark commentary on the human race. Been there, done that.. but this time it's via an alien race which has somehow developed human rights and gained human trust. <br/><br/>The movie tries to engage the audience with completely disgusting and overly graphic scenes, including self-mutilation, vomiting, sex with aliens, humans eating alien body parts, etc. etc. Really, it is just senseless violence and gore.<br/><br/>Am I supposed to feel sorry that this complete idiot sprays himself with a chemical that turns him into an alien and is now being taken advantage of? Am I supposed to feel good that, by the end, he kicks butt and kills a lot of these ruthless a*holes? No. This would never, ever happen. <br/><br/>This movie is certainly different than the usual aliens-meet-earth sci-fi, but really it's just an overdone plot with aliens in the place of some other organized body. The science is unexplained. The relationships are uninteresting. If you have any respect for science fiction, spend your time and money on something else!"

So much of the treatment of the aliens looked like South Africa and America yesterday and sometimes, if the wrong police officers are involved, today. The documentary style of the movie gave it an authenticity that added to its creepiness like the equally awful Blair Witch movie.

","Let me just say up front that District 9 is a great movie. I'm not sure what influence Peter Jackson had here, as he's listed as a producer and not a director, but someone deserves a lot of credit. On paper, District 9 sounds like Saturday matinée throw-away nonsense. In reality, it is a movie with subtle storytelling, a griping plot, great action, and superb effects. The characters are driven not by silly Hollywood archetypes but believable motivations. I found myself looking down on the aliens, revolted by the aliens, and then cheering for the aliens. The main character is a schmuck, he's selfish, he's a coward...but the movie did a great job putting me in his shoes, making me empathize with him and understand him. The faux documentary style adds to the film and never detracts. Even the hand-held ""shaky"" camera style that I usually dislike was used expertly here.<br/><br/>The best science fiction often hides a powerful message behind a fantastic facade. The message here goes beyond the ham-fisted environmental simplicity found in Avatar. It also goes well beyond the apartheid analogy everyone likes to pretend that they noticed on their own. It's a movie about xenophobia, about becoming something you fear, and about the treatment of those we consider inferiors. There are overtones of First World vs Third World and themes of cultural corruption and decay.<br/><br/>Plus, District 9 stands up pretty well as a shoot 'em up, sci-fi action, monster movie."

After watching almost all of the movie I was curiously waiting for the end and I thought it might disappoint me, but it didn't, it totally blew me away because I was expecting a predictable ending but the ending almost made me cry a little.<br/><br/>District 9 is an extraordinary movie and I believe it stands equally with the Sci-fi classics, The Matrix(1999) and 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968) which of course are my Personal Favorites as well....<br/><br/>Do watch District 9 if you are looking for a nice plot and I tell you its real."

","One of the first sci-fi films I ever saw was a story of a space craft that lands just outside a small, country town in England. When it is discovered, the town's people, who are very superstitious, eventually greet their visitor (a very old, human-like alien) and then proceed to beat it to death. . . the end. That film's premise is the gist of District 9.<br/><br/>English subscripts for alien-speak reminded me of Star Wars. Star Wars didn't try to be provocative. District 9 did, but failed. It is too common for film makers today to treat their audiences as immature. Such gimmicks remind me I'm watching a movie and that the film maker took the easy way in story telling. Communication of ideas can be achieved with imagery alone. The alien mentioned above never said a word, but we understood him nonetheless.<br/><br/>(Have since actually seen the film. Much better than I blindly conceived it to be. And I understand the productions logic for using subtitles. Much more original than I believed it to be.)"

"gregeichelberger","7","5","19","11 August 2009"," Surprisingly good allegorical presentation
","In the 1950s, alien-monster films were often not just outer space flicks, they presented a hidden message (or sometimes NOT so hidden). Movies like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" railed against conformity, while ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" preached an anti-nuclear peace theme and ""The Thing (From Another World)"" was an attack on Communism.<br/><br/>They don't make many allegorical tales, anymore. Most films today are pretty much straight-to-the-point, not much equivocation there. That's why the Peter Jackson-produced, Neil Blomkamp-directed ""District 9"" is so wonderful. It's an alien action/adventure picture as well as a thinly-disguised poke at the longtime South African policy of apartheid.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie takes place in Johannesburg where a huge, malfunctioning extra-terrestrial mother-ship is suspended moon-like above the city. Told in documentary style, the back-story explains that the craft first arrived in 1982 and just stopped. Searchers discovered a crew of malnourished and frightened aliens about, brought them down and tried to assimilate them into society.<br/><br/>Bad idea. No one wanted the aliens around 'cause they were different (resembling a cross between a shrimp and a cockroach), plus they rioted and caused all sorts of trouble (including stealing, killing and rummaging through dumpsters for cat food).<br/><br/>Having little choice, the South African government began rounding up the crustaceans and herding them into the slum camp, District 9. Here, things only got worse with fights, crime, fires, more riots and a ruthless gang of Nigerian humans led by a crippled warlord. Finally, when it comes time to move the occupants to a new, clean concentration camp facility (Distric 10), crews from Multi-National United (MNU) go from house-to-house to deliver eviction notices. Yes, it quite absurd to see this, as most ""prawns"" have no idea about what's going on.<br/><br/>Taking all of this seriously is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a middle-manager milquetoast promoted by his father-in-law to lead the operation. During the evictions, however, Wilkus is sprayed with a foreign substance and his DNA begins to radically change. <br/><br/>When his condition is discovered, he is soon in demand to test the extra-terrestrials' weaponry which was heretofore inoperable in human hands. He soon becomes a fugitive, and so the MNU plants the phony story that he was having sexual relations with aliens to sully his reputation.<br/><br/>Wilkus also discovers that the liquid substance was a very important ingredient that could possibly aid the aliens in returning home; and that the MNU is not the benevolent corporation it claims to be.<br/><br/>Joining an E.T. named Chris, the much-hunted Wilkus now has to return to MNU headquarters and capture the liquid, all the while evading fascist government forces as well as fanatically violent Nigerian rebels.<br/><br/>Populated by unknown South African and Australian actors, ""District 9"" is ""Aliens"" meets ""Starship Troopers"" meets ""Cry Freedom."" The similarities between the prawns' predicament and the blacks who suffered under South Africa's racial policies is drawn immediately by Blomkamp (""Crossing the Line""), a native of Johannesburg himself.<br/><br/>The story is taut, direction is appropriately low-key, pacing is terrific and the CGI is great. It's one of the best movies of a disappointedly bland blockbuster season (only ""Star Trek"" and ""Up"" managing to impress on a big budget), and will give people something to think about while watching aliens, soldiers and rebels go at it.<br/><br/>There will be blood (and body parts), but there's also a message to the madness behind this film, ""watch how you treat people, because that person may just be from another planet."""

When I began to see commercials for this I began to believe it would be a sort of sci-fi documentary, but my was I wrong. One of the biggest issues that I had with this film is that it only surrounds around one character. I believe that they could have centralized the film on ethnic issues or political issues. I believe they could have expanded on the problems that the communities around district 9 were having. At the beginning it seemed like that was going to be the main topic with this film unfortunately it was taken in a whole different direction. So much is going on surrounding the events of district 9 yet they only demonstrate the effects of one character in the whole film. The film becomes very cliché towards the end, they added slow motion to shooting scenes and just ruined the tempo they had created for this film, and of course they had that last heroic event which saved the day. Up until the end they had done a nice job, they hadn't brought any real villains in the film most of the reactions the characters had in the film were just basic survival instincts which made the film a bit more realistic. The characters emotions and attitude did not ad up with his actions, one minute he's destroying the alien race, the next he's saving it just did not make sense.

","District 9 is an over-hyped, underwhelming disappointment. The movie is flawed in so many ways. The movie commences in a documentary style which is used to introduce the background story and lead characters. Unfortunately, the initial appeal and cleverness of this approach is lost with the inexplicable sudden switch to traditional camera-work. The movie as a whole has an uneven and erratic storyboard and a plot that whilst highly original and intriguing suffers from being shamefully thin, overstretched (the whole movie plot can be summed up in a couple of sentences) and full of holes. The action sequences are disjointed and suffer badly from some distinctly below average and ropey CGI. The movie is also poorly edited and lacking much needed refinement and polish. However, irrespective of all these flaws the main problem I had with this movie is that the lead character is a truly vile and loathsome individual. On more than one occasion I found myself really hoping that the despicable anti-hero got shot, blown up or eaten, only to be disappointed that he didn't and I would have to endure more of his relentlessly amoral, spineless and self-centred behaviour. It's not a spoiler to mention that he does have an eleventh hour change of heart that causes him to take one humane action, however this tardy schmaltzy ludicrous nonsense unfortunately fails entirely to make him any more likable. District 9 is a bit like paint thrown at the wall from afar... it's hit and miss, but in general a complete mess and all over the place."

","Neil Blomkamp's scifi representation of the African-Apartheid couldn't do a better job of mirroring humanity's dark side. While the slimy, dubious aliens serve as the focus of this mockumentary it is the capable abuse that humanity can inflict on itself and like-beings that is the thematic subject of the film, and Blomkamp does a wonderful job of displaying it in the most subtle manner. <br/><br/>While this film follows in a bit of the shaky-film line of docu-drama cinematography, the film stays coherent and the second half of the film could be taken as straight fiction with only minor interruptions in the action. The acting is excellently done by all the actors, with the distinctly dis-likable, flawed and yet pitifully sympathetic anti-hero Wikus Van de Merwe being well-played by Sharpto Copley. Wikus serves well to bring focus to the plot through his own perspective.<br/><br/>While there was plenty of drama and perhaps some well-played dark humor, the film was not short of action-packed scenes that escalated with ever-increasing tension and were amazingly represented by the most photo-realistic cg I've seen in some time. For example, the incredibly realistic looking aliens also carried uncanny human expression. I would imagine the large bulk of the film's small budget was spent on the cg.<br/><br/>Possibly among the most unique aspects of the film was its gripping ending that was genuinely heart-felt and disparate at the same time. Please don't miss out on this scifi-classic. (warning: the film has a fair share of gore, strong language and graphic violence)."

","This is the first time I have ever given a comment on a film and I new as soon as this film finished that it well deserved the effort of me loading up the laptop and doing just that. I want every one to know that this film is up there even above the likes of the first Alien and The Original Predator.<br/><br/>THE FILM:<br/><br/>From the very beginning your eyes are given jaw dropping CGI the story kicks in straight away and you feel that need to want to soak up the hole film straight away with its scrumptious attention to detail and gritty realism it could pass as being a real event.<br/><br/>Trust me on this one if your looking for a film that makes you believe, has you gripping the sides of the chair, has you clenching your fist in anger at the realistic acting of the bad guys and want to climb in and help the situation of the good guys then this is it, The aliens themselves get 10/10 for there acting in fact the acting in general is 10/10.. <br/><br/>TO ME THIS FILM IS THE ""BEST""!! I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG LONG TIME IT HAS IT ALL. I HAVE HEARD THE SAYING EYE CANDY WELL THIS IS FULL SENSES CANDY!!!"
"numa-iconia","8","2","5","27 September 2009"," Do you think this movie has holes? read on..because it doesn't
","After reading all the comments from people who hated this movie because it was about politics and because it has plot holes I had to write this.<br/><br/>First and most important this movie is'n about aliens, this movie is about human nature and racism. If you fell insulted that a director who suffered Apartheid made a movie about it and have to disguise it in a science fiction movie for you couch potato, self-centered Americans to see it, well good for him, he did it! <br/><br/>The ""plot holes""<br/><br/>Why aliens with better guns did nothing against humans? for cat food?<br/><br/>1. Humans where trying to help them at first, we gave them a place to live, food and cure them, maybe as humans you think that the natural thing to do was to attack, but maybe this was not THEIR nature.<br/><br/>2.If you check your history you will find a lot of references to this, and that's the objective of the movie: to make you think about this.<br/><br/>How do you explain that millions of civilized American empires did nothing against a bunch of uneducated Europeans who destroyed everything.<br/><br/>As the aliens did, they (Aztecas for example) trusted these Europeans and choose peace, after realizing what these people were about they react but it was too late.<br/><br/>They were not corrupted by money. They didn't want war they just wanted food. (If you find this difficult to accept it is human nature again. As you saw in the movie money is the fuel of all human problems, a civilization without this drive should look VERY different and almost idiotic to us. Humans always thing that a person who do something for free or without a fight are dumb isn't it?)<br/><br/>3. For cat food? Cat food where a drug for them, they will do anything for it, and after 20 years of using it they where completely dumb by it.<br/><br/>Examples in history? Opium, The British Empire used opium to control occupied countries like India or Singapur, it was used also by China. <br/><br/>These ""poor"" countries did virtually nothing against a bunch of people from a small country far away who came to their territories to impose rules, torture and segregate them.<br/><br/>4. The movie explains that these aliens where the ""working class"" only, aliens without any leadership. This was not tho say ""poor"" aliens, poor or uneducated people is the most humiliated and easy to control in all human history. <br/><br/>The real value of the movie is that you can change the face of the aliens to any mistreated people in history or today, American Indians, Pre-conquest Empires, Jews, Muslims, Blacks, Irish or Scothish, Iraquies, Or just people with different views or ideas.<br/><br/>YES, this movie is about THAT, if you fell insulted as human by this (I mean by how advertising made you believe this was an alien movie) don't see it.<br/><br/>If you want and empty action-packed sci-fiction Hollywood movie, it also works for you, but you will find plot holes, if you want to think about human history and walk out with some meaning, you will NOT find any. You will just find pieces of history narrated in sci-fiction form for you to sit for the first time in a movie about it."
"the-scope","10","2","5","25 September 2009"," Some Clarifications of the Negative Comments posted here
","I have been reading the various comments, particularly the negative ones, with interest. Everyone seems to come out with very strong opinions without any due diligence... and jumps to various conclusions pretty quickly. If you had been concentrating or reading up a little more you would find out the following: 1) The fact that the aliens seem to be unable to defend themselves and end up living like aimless refugees is not a flaw. Blomkamp, in several interviews, has explained that they are meant to be like drones, communal creatures like an ant colony who don't have independent leadership and don't operate socially in the same way humans do. Their reason for behaving strangely, not helping themselves etc is meant to be a mystery to us and also the human population within the movie. CJ and son are unique... like soldier drones rather than worker bees - make sense? 2) Everyone is making the assumption that the storyline is based on Apartheid segregation and discrimination about the divisions between black and white and thats is not the case. The country has moved on radically since the early 90s and nowadays the main social issue is one of Xenophobia. At the same time that the film was being made, the countries townships were under fire from local black south Africans attacking outsiders from other African countries. Many of the neighbouring countries, and others a distance away,have seen a huge movement of poverty stricken people into SA. They come looking for gold on the streets (egoli) and end up living on the outskirts of the slums .... just like the aliens. We have a Malawian friend who came to get work in SA and gets robbed weekly by local SA folk. This is the main social, criminal, and economic challenge that the country faces. Perhaps that makes more sense in terms of the realism of the movie for anyone South African and also anyone who actually reads newspapers? <br/><br/>3)The main character didn't only transform because of the fluid ... he was also attacked by an alien and ended up getting is arm ripped open. It was the combination of these events that caused the transformation. Doh ! An excellent, incredible acting performance by novice Sharlto Copley who perhaps should have waited before accepting the A team? A better movie may have been out there.<br/><br/>Nice to see a movie that is brave enough to use gritty, grey smelling setting instead of the Pyramids, Petra, Paris etc.... much harder to make it engaging with such bleak background ! Great for the underdogs to do do well despite Hollywoods lack of support for Halo. Not only is Blomkamp a newcomer, he is also a very young director."
"ctac","3","2","5","13 September 2009"," Capitalism at its best...
","So. I went to see a sci-fi film which also involved deep social allegory.<br/><br/>Half of the film was shooting with big weapons, destroying a wide variety of things, chasing and not only it didn't really discuss any social issue, but it was a profoundly racist movie.<br/><br/>BUT..<br/><br/>I must admit that the guys and gals worked for the promotion and the advertising of the film did an excellent job. A good job at selling a crappy product.<br/><br/>The cgi was as usual, the plot didn't really exist, music don't remember, acting OK (the actors can shoot guns convincingly).<br/><br/>No, I didn't have a good time neither, I was really bored and anxious to leave. Overall, very, very good promotion. Excellent!"
"moonis-mohammad","10","2","5","12 September 2009"," A Classic Franchise is Born !!!....
","God bless Peter Jackson & Neil Blomkamp for bringing relief in the flood of stupid & over-hyped offerings (read Transformers, Terminators etc.). District 9 should not be missed at any cost and there are valid reasons for this. First thing , the alien human conflict was NOT located in New York, LA, Chicago or London. It is based in Johannesburg, and aliens are contained in slums and not in hi tech enclosures. Realistic treatment to the issues associated with human-alien friction was so believable that I was totally absorbed in it. Although the shaky camera work was bit irritating some times, it was balanced by amazing shots of fighting sequence during climax. The make up, sound, editing, background music and visual effects were stand out. The main protagonist is very interesting to watch from his development from a human to an alien. Surprised to know that it was made on a mere budget of $ 30 million. It is much much better than any alien movie ever, perhaps it is the best ever. The ending sequence has already laid the foundation for District 10 and I will eagerly await for it."
"MOscarbradley","10","2","5","12 September 2009"," Is this the year's best film so far?
","The premise is simple; why didn't anyone think of it before? An alien spaceship visits Earth and hovers over Johannesburg. It's big; there are over a million aliens on board but they haven't come to conquer Earth. It's as if they have been abandoned and are refugees from their own planet seeking asylum here on Earth. They are rounded up and housed in the kind of townships we associate with South Africa and it's not long before the townships turn into slums and 'racial' violence of a different kind from what we have become used to, (though maybe not that different), breaks out. In the end it's hard to tell who might be the bigger 'scum', the aliens or the Nigerians who move in and exploit them.<br/><br/>First time director Neill Blomkamp's astonishing feature begins in quasi-documentary mode before turning into the kind of action-thriller that would have done James Cameron proud when Cameron was actually making good movies circa the first Terminator, (clearly an influence). But Blomkamp is too canny a director just to pay homage and turn out a pastiche of better known sci-fi movies. Blomkamp is a South African who clearly knows a thing or two about the state of play down there, then and now, and while never shirking on the action ""District 9"" is also a heartfelt, thinly disguised satirical commentary on life in the townships. Aliens or blacks, it hardly matters; it's the white supremacists who are calling the shots.<br/><br/>There are no 'stars' in ""District 9"" and really only one central character, Wikus Van de Merwe, (a superb Sharlto Copley). He is the man put in charge of getting the aliens out of the townships and into what are essentially internment camps, (concentration camps might be a better term), and it is he who triggers the film's crucial plot device. The other two main characters are aliens, an adult, (the beautifully named Christopher Johnston), and a delightful child who turns out to be wiser than he first seems. It's a smart movie indeed when you start identifying with tentacled aliens, (named Prawns for reasons that will be obvious when you see the film), and even root for them over the humans. It is also a technical triumph with Trent Opaloch's brilliant photography and Julian Clarke's editing giving the movie it's edge even above the excellent special effects. The ending is open-ended leaving room for a District 10. Franchises seldom work though sequels often do. ""District 9"" might just turn out to be the best film you will see this year and if there is a District 10 I have high hopes."
"honorhorror","8","2","5","12 September 2009"," Highly conceptual but also very derivative. The phenomenal narrative style compensated it all.
","Highly conceptual but also very derivative. The phenomenal narrative style compensated it all.<br/><br/>District 9 must be one of the most innovative movie of the year, but I'd say it looked very familiar to those who had ever played a Half-life game or Doom game. The story is actually based on Frantz Kafka's La metamorfosis the novel, in which a depressed blue collar woke up to find himself transformed into a huge bug one morning, and eventually alienated by all his families and died in desperate. District 9 fetched the character of Gregorio Samsa the main protagonist from La metamorfosis and one can easily relate the character in this movie to the novel. The whole feeling, the anti-corporation theme and the apocalyptic atmosphere are all admirable in the movie. Yet this movie was shot in South Africa the place for racial issues, adding more dramatic dynamics to the storyline. In the beginning of the movie, several social workers and related personals were interviewed like a real documentary, and everyone commented on the event in his/her view. One can also easily forget that this is a sci-fi movie and consider them commenting on real racial problems. All of these are very impressive and made the first act of the movie. And later...<br/><br/>Bang! District 9 changed its subtitle from La metamorfosis to Half-life. The infected main protagonist was considered most valuable yet most dangerous by the evil capitalists. He finally broke away from capture and took the aliens side. With alien genes, he was able to handle alien weapons from Rail Gun, BFG, Lightening Gun from Doom(Quake) to Gravity Gun and energy pulse rifle from Half-life. Most fantastically he played Iron Man for 10 minutes in the climax and blew a lot of humans into jam and juice.<br/><br/>Well, this is a movie one can go to purely for its visual effects. Given its $30 million budget, it's really very impressive and more effective than Cloverfield. The shaky camera and the relatively realistic visual presentation will grab your eyeballs for 100 minutes, and make you impulsive to tell others to see it now! However, if you reflect on it you'd probably find a lot problems like underdeveloped technical details and insufficient explanations on both the alien side and human side. Maybe that will leave more space to its sequel, hopefully. The alien weaponry were all created as a homage to popular video games and lack a totally fresh feeling. But we can live with that. You won't want to see it on DVD. Ratherly, you would want to see it in full HD.<br/><br/>Anyway it's still a great movie and a good reason to go to cinema. 8/10."

","I'll Keep this short.<br/><br/>The film has everything you could wish for in a movie! it has a plot which has you dying to find out what happens next...I see so many people saying this film is predictable...I beg to differ, there was many times in the film where I thought Vikus or Christopher would die, or come to the aid of one-another, but didn't...or rather they did when I didn't expect them to! One thing people don't realise with this film and it's what makes me respect it even more than I do already...is that Vikus had no script! It was 90% made up as the camera was shot...Read it up if you don't believe me! the only criticism I can find for this film is the ever-so sightly overdone hand held camera scene at the beginning, but thats so minor it barely needs to be brought up.<br/><br/>Go see it! and best of all respect and enjoy it!"
"mshanahanz","10","2","5","9 September 2009"," CONTAINS SPOILERS- I really liked it, stop reading reviews and go see it.
","I saw this last week and thought it was great. It is not a deep message movie, but it speaks out of recent history in South Africa (as I understand it) gives it an alien twist, and puts it on the world stage for us all to identify with. As well as having heaps of action, cool weapons, lots of blood, a peculiar kind of dark humour and great acting. It is not preachy or anything, it is a would be blockbuster, but it has this background that it plays off. I think the film is something people from that country can be very proud of. <br/><br/>I want to say some things about it in terms of what some people who are not so enthusiatic have said. One is that it starts off as a kind of mock documentary and they seem to think it should have stayed in the same vein, and focused around things to do with the shanty towns and exploring that ""social issues"" side of the premise, and that it loses its way in turning into an action movie. My view is that the action is aimed at the huge alien ship, which is a symbol of transformative power. If the aliens can use their ship again that is like when white minority rule ended for South Africa, it's entirely in keeping with the allegory at the start of the film. In fact it is the only game in town. The action part of the film involves pain trauma and confusion for Vicus. He acts mainly out of his own self interest and fear, he becomes altruistic very very late in the film, probably the last 5 minutes. The fear of his transforming body reflects into this as an allegory of the pain of loss of power and control. All of this plays well with an allegory of loss of political power. But the thing is it plays like ripping good action as he goes from threat to threat, you are not meant to think deeply, but it means the film has a soul through that section, unlike a lot of action films. Some people don't like the mix between documentary style and the ""proper film"", I take it that the whole film, not just the documentary bits, is made for us as if we were the people in the world of the film having to assess what has happened, due to a likely change in future power relations. Vicus may have been a ""traitor"" (though we were traitors to him first), but the fact that he was may now be one of the few things that can help us, that is why the film is all about him, what will he do?"

The camera work and CGI are awesome and at times, it's a like a horror splatter fest.<br/><br/>The characters are brilliant with the main being probably the most reluctant heroes you'll encounter.

","I watched this last night at the cinemas and wow, i was seriously impressed.<br/><br/>When i first heard about this film i thought it was another low budget sci fi film with too much tacky CGI and no story line (i didn't watch the trailer, i saw the cover and judged it from that). I was very, very wrong indeed. This film reminds me of Cloverfield even thought it isn't shot in first person all the time, it tries to give that effect. The CGI is brilliant and they have a perfect balance of it in the film, not too much and not too low. I am a big fan of the Transformers film, but after watching this, sorry to say, District 9 beats it hands down. This IS one of the best Sci fi films in a very LONG time, and i highly recommend watching this.<br/><br/>I applaud the producers and the actors in this film, as they were top notch. This film does move you as well and the main actor in the film does it extremely well.<br/><br/>I also cannot wait to watch this again when it comes out in blu-ray, as it is a must watch and have for when it comes out.<br/><br/>10/10, epic."
"alexart-1","10","2","5","6 September 2009"," A Poignant, Riveting Film Packed with Action
","District 9 is by far one of the best films of the summer. It's not the best, but it's in my top three for the summer. As many reviews have already said, it's one of the best sci-fi films in years. Not only does it constantly have your heart racing for the whole movie, but it also provokes a lot of thinking and great discussion afterwards. Unlike many alien movies, it makes you think.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen the short entitled ""Alive in Joburg"", which is also by Hollywood's new hottest director Neil Blomkamp, then you may not know what to expect. The complicated plot is about aliens that have landed in Johannesburg 28 years ago (it takes place in 2010) and have become a nuisance to the people who live there. They are forced to live in ghettos where there are constant riots from humans and frequent acts of crime. One day, a company decides that they will get rid of the aliens by evicting them from their homes. Wikus van der Merwes (Sharlto Copley) heads the operation and contracts an odd virus from one of their weapons. What happens next is unforgettable and unusual. By the way, it may sound like I'm saying a lot, but all this happens in the first 30 minutes. Yeah, it's complicated.<br/><br/>District 9 is not a film to see for fun. It actually is disturbing and leaves you feeling quite numb afterwards. That being said, it also is a social commentary on Apartheid and other genocides currently going on in Africa right now. The real power of this film lies in its ability to use the aliens as a metaphor for Apartheid. The film manages to make us hate the aliens without even seeing them for very long. It's amazing to see how quickly humans can become prejudiced.<br/><br/>Aside from this, there is a lot of action. I was not expecting this when I walked into the theater, however the action sequences are riveting. Also, the way the story is told is smart. It's told as though it's a documentary infusing interviews throughout the movie. As you may have noticed even from watching the trailer, the film's special effects are unbelievable. The aliens flawlessly fit in with the humans in awesome and somewhat ironic manner. To think this film only cost $30 million is mind blowing.<br/><br/>It's not very hard to figure out what all the buzz for District 9 was about. It's smart and at the same time very entertaining. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those who are fans of sci-fi will definitely be pleased. Knowing what to expect before you see ruins the impact a little so don't read to much online about it, but I would definitely advise people to see it."

","This is one of those movies that comes along maybe once every ten years, and it will forever change the way 'man vs. alien' movies are made and viewed.<br/><br/>During the first part I felt that the movie was meant to drive home the message of how people in various countries treat others that are deemed less valuable, and they did a great job of that. Then it changes and picks up pace but it never deviates from the core message, which is designed to showcase the absolute worst of human nature. This is not a movie about aliens – it's a movie people in all their slimy and ignorant worst.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is a power-house film-maker and with films such as this he is at the very top of the industry. I cannot recommend this movie enough because of the poignant message of basic human greed and how that message can be applied to almost any current social issue on the planet."

The story is very original and I was always wondering ""What's gonna happen next!"" The cinematography is superb. The music is probably what grabbed me the most.

The plot is straight-forward and realistic; you literally see the true passion of the story come out in the actions of the characters. A great combination of action and thriller, it is the kind of movie that leaves you with more questions, than answers. All films can learn from the creativity this movie implores.

Then before I realised it I was hooked. The story is intriguing and all be it the special effects are a bit un finished looking the clever directing and filming cover this up very well.<br/><br/>I have to say I did enjoy District 9. Perhaps it's not as good as the hype and lets face it there is a lot of it but it is a lot better than most of the films coming out of Hollywood recently."

You get the feel of watching a documentary, complete with news cam shakiness and television quality resolution and occasional surveillance cam shots mixed with standard Panaflex shots mixed quite well. You also get a few interviews of family and friends reflecting on the events that are about to unfold on the screen. This was just well done.<br/><br/>That's just the filming style, the story is engaging and you really sympathize with the characters. The only movie I can compare this to is Alien Nation, but the similarities are few. Excellent movie. Blows any summer action movie out of the water if you like substance over CGI. This film is pretty deep, if all you want to see in the theatre is stuff getting blowed up and nucalar kersplosions....stay home and rent a Uwe Boll film (feel free to look that up).<br/><br/>I doubt any intelligent movie goer will prefer Transformers over this."

Not a sequel, prequel or a remake. Great to see gore back in Sci-Fi (harks back to the Verhoven days of yore - though Robocop, Total Recall and Starship Troopers are vastly more entertaining). Special effects put the big boys to shame.<br/><br/>THE BAD---<br/><br/>Plot holes galore. So-so acting. Main character both unlikeable and a bumbling buffoon.

Could have felt much more gritty and real in a Paul Greengrass sense, instead it feels amateur. Humans understand aliens 'click and gurgles' after 20 years? Hmmm.<br/><br/>THE UGLY---<br/><br/>The alien design did not work for me in context. They are meant to feel vulnerable and yet are physically much more stronger looking than humans. If they had been more vulnerable looking and perhaps more relatable, they may have been a more emotional reaction to what was happening to them. Instead they felt like giant versions of the termite creatures from Attack of the Clones (even same sounding dialogue)."
"AudioFileZ","9","2","5","5 September 2009"," A Stunningly Fresh Take On Aliens Inhabiting Earth!
","First, it needs to be said that this is a science fiction movie that is uniformly excellent. Neil Blomkamp deserves much praise for originality in writing and directing. Beyond that, Sharlto Copley's acting stole the show, depicting character Wilkus Van De Merwe like a Steve Carell (The Office's Michael Scott) geek-ed up on Starbuck's and more!<br/><br/>If the story isn't exactly new, aliens coming to earth and living among humans, every other detail screams inventiveness...From the beginning where the amazing gross, but intricate creatures are saved from dying inside their ship to the ending where the government's ""Fortune 500 Army"" stages a no holds barred attempt to kill Wilkus Van De Merwe, you never feel less than rapt by the telling of the conflict you know is bound to happen. Though never overtly a political movie, there's a lot of social commentary that provides an undercurrent regarding greed and war.<br/><br/>This alien movie, when held to a broad assortment of standards, simply shines. As already noted there is a really good storyline-the one must from which everything else springs from. The style of the movie, a shifting between a documentary like film record of the events to the normal third person aspect of ""looking-in"" that we are more comfortable with, seems, to me, as a perfect way to pull the viewer in fast. The special effects, in particular the amazing detailed aliens who we have never seen the likes of, are a tour-de-force...they are strangely gross and compelling-never being reduced to any kind of campiness. Amazingly well conceived and realized! The real ""ace-in-the-hole"" is the portrayal of Wilkus Van De Merwe by Sharlto Copley. At first you think of him an annoying nerdy geek and in short order you become very invested in both his character and his plight. Copley's deft acting works in a way not unlike Don Knott's portrayal of Barney Fife as it almost steals the show from everyone and everything else, his role makes the whole story cohere because you are feel empathy for his character and root for his ultimate survival. He may still be a geek underneath it all, but his transformation from milk-toast Mr. Rogers type nerd to a justice seeking ""Arnold-like Terminator"" is the movies single most brilliant vehicle.<br/><br/>District 9, to me, is an instant classic science fiction alien tale. It starts by grabbing your attention and wastes not a frame in building its story slowly gathering speed and urgency. Most science fiction, as well as a large number of other genre, movies blow it with a wham-bam quick ""tie-it-up"" maximum shock ending that tastes bad and leaves the viewer cold. Not this one...District 9 ends in a worthy fashion that satisfies and still leaves the door open for almost anything in a sequel. This could be the start of another great science fiction franchise. I recommend it to sci-fi fans without any reservations and give it a 8.5! Excellent!"

","I think everyone went to see this movie with high expectations, mainly because of the epic Peter Jackson and Wingnut Films. Those expectations have been fulfilled and surpassed with this, first and foremost, original movie.<br/><br/>What strikes you ass odd at first, is the fact that the movie is filmed as a documentary, but this captures your attention very quickly, mainly because it's a totally new approach to Sci-Fi and because it makes the story much more believable. There are moments when you watch the movie and you feel that you are actually watching the news and everything is really happening in the real world.<br/><br/>""District 9"", besides it's new technical approach, also amazed me with the story. It is not your usual sci-fi story, it is completely original. I will not go into details because i don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it already, all i can say is that the story should strike a cord in people. It adds a very dramatic human element to a very alien environment.<br/><br/>The acting is also great, this being the part where most sci-fi movies fail, this one manages to stay way above the floating line.<br/><br/>Visual effects and CGI... Well i have to say those were some of the best looking aliens i have ever seen. Apart from the fact that they are disgusting prawn-looking creatures, they are masterfully designed, with everything from motion to emotion looking exquisite and realistic. Everything else is candy for the eyes.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this movie has everything we've been waiting for in a sci-fi for the last 10 years. In my opinion it should now raise the bar for all movies, not only sci-fi. A must see!"

","....and that's totally fine.<br/><br/>This movie was a real surprise for me in that I felt like the commercials touted it to be a serious science fiction piece with a moral purpose, obviously drawn from its allegory to apartheid. I have to say though, It was so much more!<br/><br/>Sure there are times where you feel bad for the aliens because of the crimes (against humanity?) the humans commit on the ""prawn"" population, but the movie quickly engages you and takes off into very exciting territory. Maybe its because I am a huge science fiction fan, but the movie is incredible and, at times, very funny. Although the movie is not so much a serious drama, like it seems, that's a good thing because I actually had fun watching this movie. The action is superb and further realized with stunning visual effects that seem both real and imaginative. Some of the best times during this movie were watching the havoc all of the alien guns bring to the streets of Johannesburg!<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is frequently gross and certainly not for the fain of heart (or stomach), but if you can handle it this movie is really fun to see with friends.<br/><br/>I'll be looking for more coming out of the very talented Mr. Blomkamp."

","There are so many things to say and to point out about how incredible this movie is, but I will break them down into 3 categories: plot, filming, and performance, but don't worry; I am not an advocate of spoilers. It is very difficult to put it all into 1,000 words, because there are so many things that deserve light shed; this movie absolutely pushed the envelope.<br/><br/>The Plot- When seeing the trailer for this movie, there are many things that you could have gathered: this is an alien sci-fi, it deals with humans and the relationship with the aliens coming into contact with earth, and this will be another CGI wonder-film. In ways those are correct, but in so many more ways it is wrong. District 9 was a movie that collectively took the interest of humans in the extraterrestrial wonder, but it developed that into a scenario that was more realistic than any other movie about e.t.'s in the history of film. Also taking that concept and having it coincide with human development is remarkable. It took the vulnerability of any being, and took it to the next level. Humans without a doubt would have a completely different outlook on what would happen if we were to come into contact, but District 9 shows us how the way our world is ran would take the comings on and make it into something that it could and most likely would happen, adding to the reality of viewing and relating to movies, in every since.<br/><br/>The Filming- The way this film was approached when it comes to filming in general in cinematography is astounding. I have not seen a film with this much ingenuity. The way they approach the news related information for the film viewer and for the SAKE of the film at the same time is like nothing else: it is brilliant. There are some movies that have attempted to do the same process but none of them have achieved the accuracy that District 9 accomplished. The CGI was nothing less than brilliant, at times I truly forgot that I was watching computer graphics and what was actually able to be filmed. It was incredible.<br/><br/>The Performance- Sharlto Copley I knew had not had too many acting performances that were known to the world of film, but I can say honestly I have not seen a character develop in a movie as considerably as his character has done in years. The character goes from one starting point and takes you on a personal journey, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire film, and has an end point that has you leaving the theater wondering how actors can be THAT good. I give all of my respect to him and I will and have told everyone that watches the film or hasn't even yet at this point that Copley will be a name soon heard everywhere you go.<br/><br/>District 9, I WILL SAY AGAIN, is the best film of 2009, and I will stick to it."
"DJ-75","4","2","5","1 September 2009"," Dumbing Down of America
","Ranked #44 on the list of all-time movies? Are you kidding me? I am flabbergasted that this movie would be ranked so high. District 9 should really be called Titanic 9 because if it was screened for a group of rationale, intelligent lifeforms, it would sink under the weight of its own implausibility. Would an intelligent alien lifeform simply toss the key to its freedom in the bottom of a cannister so easily found? Isn't there a more plausible scenario there? Would a superior in charge of so many logistics accidentally put the alien piece of technology up to his face and smell it to see what it is? Ridiculous! With its cardboard cutout characters of an evil father and doting wife, District 9 is not even close to being in the top #500 of the all-time greatest movies. It's simply a mashup of more eye-popping, special effect/CGI crap that relies less on substance and more on gadgets and guns.<br/><br/>However, the biggest problem of District 9 is its continuity and frame of reference. The first 30 minutes have us following around a nitwit character, documentary-style. It's kind of like watching a crappy episode of COPS. Instead of maintaining its frame of reference, the narration turns into an action flick with no sign of the documentary film crew around. Where did they go? Why start with the documentary style, then switch in the middle of the film? Alfred Hitchcock would be turning in his grave if he saw this movie.<br/><br/>I get the allegory to apartheid and the persecution of minorities. I understand where the filmmakers where going. It was a different angle, that's for sure.<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy District 9 and I am a very forgiving movie-goer. But don't get caught up in the hype. Just because a movie has some cool special effects, that doesn't make it a great movie. Just an expensive one."

","When I first saw the trailer, I did not think I will like this movie. Ugly mechanical-looking aliens coexisting with humans did not really appeal to me that much. When I saw the name of Peter Jackson (of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame) above the title in the poster, then I got interested. However, as the credits came up at the end of the movie, I discovered that Peter Jackson did not actually direct this film, but is just one of the producers. I guess they had to highlight Jackson's name since the director and actors in this project are all unknown.<br/><br/>The whole film for me felt like an extended independent film with a budget for CG special effects. The aliens (derogatorily called ""prawns"") were housed in a slum township in Johannesburg called District 9. The aliens here are left to fend for themselves among greedy and deceitful humans. They lead bleak and violent lives, scavenging for food in garbage dumps and victimized by abusive human gangs. (How is that for a social allegory?) After 20 years of such tension-filled co-habitation, humans decided to move the aliens 200 km away from the city. And this is where the main story begins.<br/><br/>I liked the documentary feel of the whole movie. The scenes were taken from the lenses of a television cameras, hand-held cameras or even security cameras. I liked the fact that there were no name actors in this film. In fact, the lead role was amazingly played by a first-time film actor named Sharlto Copley. His ordeal as Wikus van de Merwe, from the over-eager officer in charge of evicting the aliens from District 9 to his exposure and infection with an alien fluid was very well-portrayed. His performance was very natural, as if he was ad-libbing the whole time . This also added to the indie film feel of the film.<br/><br/>Because of the indie film vibe of this film, I am ready to just overlook the obvious plot holes. The main holes dealt with the nature of the Prawns themselves. Why have they arrived all those years ago? Why have a seemingly advanced alien life form allow themselves to turn into savages? Why was the effort to return to the mother ship only undertaken by a single alien entity named Christopher (and his son)? And what is the exact nature of that mysterious alien fluid? Unfortunately, the film expects us to just accept these things as a given and gives us no explanations. Ignore them as I would, these glaring unanswered questions detract from the overall quality of the whole movie."

","The first inclination of Film Criticism 101 would be to hail ""District 9"" as a genre-bending sci-fi thriller that fuses very real aspects of life in the post-9/11 world with extraterrestrial visitors standing in for illegal immigrants (one character even alludes to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" near the beginning). Had the aliens landed in New York City, the metaphor would be clear as day; but these crustacean-like beings (who cohabitate in the titular walled-in ghetto) are stranded in Johannesburg, treated like literal 'aliens' over the course of two decades. Amid alien/human riots, theft, and overall animosity, the government intervenes to relocate the beings to an isolated tent community. The relocation goes less than smoothly, when Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) stumbles across some contraband that eventually begins his metamorphosis into one of the alien beings (the unfolding irony of his predicament is obvious, but still very well-played). The political agenda of ""District 9"" is strong, but at its core, this is a film about humanity, the destruction left in its wake, and its potential for redemption. Director Neill Blomkamp (who co-wrote with Terri Tatchell) stages the action like an embedded cameraman in a war zone; there is an up-close, you-are-there feel to these gritty, violent sequences. The special effects are nothing short of stunning (the CG aliens are as good as they come). And the notion of staging ""District 9"" as a straight drama (littered with neat gizmos and wild action) instead of a winking parody or heavy-handed satire gives it a weight that has been lacking in similar films with socio-political agendas--in the sea of mediocrity that is Summer 2009, this is an eye-opening gift.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"flintknapper_344","8","2","5","30 August 2009"," Original, technically excellent, and with message.
","The movie uses a Sci-Fi vehicle, in part at least, to make some social commentary on South Africa's Apartheid past (not so subtly - but effective).<br/><br/>The plot centres on how a ship load of alien refugees are treated by humans, using the corollary of how humans treat 'different' humans as the basis.<br/><br/>It is based on a South African short film called 'Alive in Joburg' which in itself was inspired by the clearing/relocation of District 6 in Capetown in 1966.<br/><br/>There is definitely a message about Sth Africa's apartheid past - I just hope Sth Africa's future doesn't emulate Zimbabwe's present.<br/><br/>The film reportedly cost $30 million to make, and took $37 million on it's first weekend.

"highspot","7","2","5","27 August 2009"," Falls just short of greatness
","District 9 had all the potential in the world. It could have been one of greats of science fiction, standing along side intense and thought provoking works such as Planet Of The Apes and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Somewhat disappointingly though, what we're left with as the closing credits start to roll is an above average movie that certainly manages to entertain but falls significantly short of greatness.<br/><br/>The heart breaker is that everything starts out so well! The first part of the movie is presented as a documentary describing how twenty years ago a giant spaceship descends upon Earth and comes to rest above Johannesburg, South Africa. After a few months with no movement from the hovering ship and no contact from whatever may be inside, the decision is made to break into the craft to try and get some answers. What the humans discover is a race of alien beings obviously malnourished and in need of aid. Through the use of news clips, security camera footage and interviews with experts and the citizens of Johannesburg, a meaningful, though not very subtle, allegory of apartheid is presented.<br/><br/>The aliens are brought down to the Earth's surface and given the aid that they need but are soon segregated from the general population and placed into District 9. Living conditions worsen for the beings, known almost exclusively by the derogatory term ""prawns"", as overcrowding and militarization lead District 9 to becoming a slum. Tensions grow as the human population grows more and more hostile towards the outsiders and the decision is made to move all of the ""prawns"" away from the city to the newly developed District 10, another less than subtle reference to the forced removals during apartheid.<br/><br/>It's a simple premise with deep, complex themes. At this point while watching the film I was happily expecting to spend the next hour and a half experiencing a meaningful story that deals with heavy issues all contained within a unique take on the summer blockbuster. Unfortunately this is the point where everything started to unravel.<br/><br/>The protagonist of District 9, Wikus Van De Merwe, is a bumbling, slightly cowardly, less than intelligent man who is very hard to empathize with. He works for the MNU, the company tasked with the job of transporting the ""prawns"" to their new homes, and is given the task of leading the effort to ""evict"" the aliens not through his merits as a leader but instead through nepotism. Like nearly every other human depicted, Wikus is a bigot that treats the aliens as if they don't deserve even the most basic forms of respect or compassion. As Wikus enters district 9 in order to serve the residents with their eviction notices the documentary aspect starts to fade away and a more traditional cinematic approach is taken. The change isn't for the better. <br/><br/>From here on out the movie consists mostly of limited characterization, lots of impressive special effects and more than a few exploding bodies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's definitely fun to watch, it just could have been so much more.<br/><br/>The ""prawns"" themselves aren't given much characterization at all. Most of them seem pretty primitive, intelligent enough to communicate but quick to revert to an animal like state. It seems only a select few have intelligence comparable to humans. One of these few, who's taken the name Christopher Johnson, is presented as the face of the entire race and is the one we are supposed to show compassion for. We know this because he shows sadness over a fallen friend and more importantly, he has a cute, wide eyed child. Through him we're meant to care about an entire race. We do end up caring about Christopher and his kid but maybe it's not just because he seems like a good guy who just wants to get home, but also because all of the humans are just varying degrees of bad.<br/><br/>As stated, Wikus is not a likable person. Almost every action he takes is selfish in nature and almost always ends up hurting someone. If his actions happen to help someone else along the way then it's merely a happy coincidence. He's out for himself first and foremost with very few exceptions. <br/><br/>Still, he's definitely the most likable human here. From the MNU who disregards both alien and human life in the pursuit of weapons technology, to Mumbo, the leader of a black market preying on the ""prawns"", to the MNU mercenaries who are obviously evil (as evidenced by their goat's head logo), humans are definitely the bad guys here. <br/><br/>Having said all of this though, I still enjoyed District 9. Is it as amazing as many people say it is? I personally don't think so. It's smart movie that makes a point that's driven home with bullets and gore. If it had stuck to it's initial idea and presented that same action through the lens of a documentary camera the entire time I think the results would have been more unique and moving, causing it to stand out from the crowd more than it does."

","29 year-old South African director Neill Blomkamp co-wrote and directed ""District 9"", which is based on his 2005 short film ""Alive in Joburg"". An alien force, after years of living in slum-like conditions on Earth, finds a pariah to their ""cause"" when a government agent (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to their biotechnology and has to fight a horrific physical mutation, as he runs away from the authorities who want him dead. The story is simple enough and the not-so-new, hand-held camera documentary-style approached here works, even if some might call it gimmicky.<br/><br/>It's hard not to see ""District 9"" as a scatological allegory of the Iraq War, although we can't tell for sure whether that was the filmmaker's original intention or not. Considering Peter Jackson is the producer, it could very well have been conceived as just a good B-movie, and it works as such, too (Copley, the protagonist, reminds me of Timothy Balme from Jackson's hilarious and gory cult classic ""Braindead/Dead Alive""). If Kathryn Bigelow's recent ""The Hurt Locker"" is arguably the best open account of the Iraq tragedy so far (its vertiginous style feeling like ""Black Hawk Down"" with substance), ""District 9"" is probably the best unapologetically goofy allegory we'll get. 7/10."

But so many parts of this film which started to get me interested ending up being left unexplained. The alien's weapons angle, the 3 years angle (I guess that's when the sequel will take place) and the ""liquid"" and why it did what it did to the main character were the most glaring. I was left wondering a lot of things, with no answers.<br/><br/>To be fair, if you're a fan of sci-fi and you don't mind that camera work and a really uninteresting setting (the slums and HQ, I just wanted this movie to take me SOMEWHERE else for a few minutes), this movie could satisfy.

A few people like thinking of themselves as Sci-Fi fans, I do to, but I can't remember a time in the last few years when I have not been utterly bored by Sci-Fi Flicks, or when all i remember from the movie is some extended dramatic metaphor which at best should have been in a straight drama. District 9, has a message content which is best placed in the movie it is.(yet it is not soppingly dramatical, the action {which is par excellence Spec.Forces like} and the characters, which are well rounded serve as straight knives to tell the story with an emotional force ...which i cannot classify as 'foolishly generic') Living in a foreign country I miss South Africa ..it's diversity, and while others of more cultured states often look down on us, I was glad to see characters which come across with the force and the malignancy of these characters (showing to mass conscious that we SAs are on par) ...some spoke about comic relief. ..(& those who were over-critical of the movie, see in the element I am about to mention... only a message of anti-prejudice... i would argue that no such message is existent. honestly, what message is their in or current dealings with humans.. none, and so there is none in this movie).. these moments were in the Wikus characters mannerism and attitude, frequent swearing (foken, is like f***-en) and the police buddy type friends & eviction notices (aswell as the reports of alien crime, which were of-the-street guys talking about current crime...lol).

"jeromeville","7","2","5","22 August 2009"," An uneven, but well-crafted and unusual film worth seeing
","One of the first films in a long time that stands a chance of becoming a genuine cult movie, ""District 9"" is a throwback to an earlier time when quirkiness, social resonance and independent filmmaker spirit were essential ingredients of cinematic science fiction. It is by no means a perfect movie -- showing his relative inexperience, director Neill Blomkamp seems to have an rich and extensive backstory for it in his head that isn't always evident in the finished product, resulting in some confusing scenes and concepts. The world is also not saved at the end of his screenplay, unsatisfyingly leaving more doors open than the plot perhaps should have.<br/><br/>But ""District 9"" still manages to weave together the disparate elements of modern-day South Africa, special effects, shoot 'em up action, unusual cinematic techniques and thorough characterizations, in such a way that these flaws in the end seem relatively minor. Blomkamp throws a great deal of ideas, techniques and raw talent up on the screen, and a lot of it really does stick.<br/><br/>Everything you have heard about Sharlto Copley's performance is true: it is both an emotional tour de force, and an unrelenting character study of a small, silly man who ordinarily would have no business being the central figure of a sci-fi action flick. He has created an unforgettable character who strikes the viewer as both outlandish in his self-interest and deeply human in his suffering.<br/><br/>The film in fact slows somewhat the few times Copley is not on screen, but the CGI quality is so outstanding that the two central alien characters (father and son) take on real personalities of their own and could conceivably merit their own film.<br/><br/>It's a movie that holds up quite well to many great sci-fi films of past decades, and it ought to be seen by any serious fan of the genre."

Not during one moment does it strike you as ludicrous or potentially unbelievable -- the best and worst aspects of both human and non-human alike are portrayed excellently and executed perfectly. It is able to mesh everything necessary to make a fantastic film and a rollicking sci-fi tale. In short: this is a great film and a amazing surprise for these dark times.

"an_eternal_future","9","2","5","20 August 2009"," District 9 is a fast-paced sci-fi thriller that will glue the audience for 112 minutes.
","Set in Johannesburg, South Africa, District 9 is based on Alive in Joburg, a short film also directed by Neill Blomkamp. Sharlto Copley played as Wikus van der Merwe, an MNU (Multinational United) agent who was sent to work on the non-humans relocation from District 9 to District 10. The non-humans (sometimes referred to as the prawns) arrived in Joburg 28 years ago in a spaceship which still hovers above District 9 in the present day.<br/><br/>During the relocation process, Wikus came into contact with a substance that apparently transforming his left hand into an arm similar that of a non-human. MNU then did some tests on him, including the use of non-human weaponry. Later MNU decided to harvest Wikus' organs in order to replicate them. Wikus however, managed to escape and went back to District 9 to hide there.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the plot unfolded in a fast-paced manner. Although some questions arise in my mind regarding the plot, this sci-fi thriller is surely exceptional. It is however, missing from the plot on how the non-humans and humans managed to establish communication given that the words coming from the non-humans are barely recognizable in the movie. Another oddity is the fact that the spaceship remained hovering over District 9 for 28 years. Looking at how fast the folks at MNU came to the decision to harvest Wikus' organs, how come they haven't harvest the spaceship? They could bust into the ship, why not disassemble it altogether for scientific study? Nevertheless, despite these questionable details, the film managed to deliver the message regarding greed and discrimination.<br/><br/>It is not without reason why I list only Sharlto Copley in the cast. The movie is singlehandedly focused on Wikus that it made everyone else's performances insignificant. Copley's performance however, was outstanding and made as if the movie is actually a documentary. He managed to portray the transformation of Wikus' character from a jovial fellow to a  well, not so jovial fellow, perfectly. I've seen character transformations before but this one is surely one of the best that I've seen.<br/><br/>Overall, I consider this movie as a great sci-fi thriller. The acting was dominated by Copley, but he did it superbly. The plot itself provided a thrilling ride from start to finish, but with some questionable details. For District 9, I give it a 9.0 for giving me an awesome entertainment."

","District 9 is a thrill ride from beginning to end featuring a brilliant blend of emotional scenes, laughs, violence and action. Its by far the best science fiction movie to come out in some time. The storyline is fast paced, dramatic, thought provoking, and highly entertaining. Sharlto Copley does a superb job playing the geekish lead role and providing most of the endless laughs throughout the film. The aliens play a big part of the movie which was a pleasant surprise. Director Neill Blomkamp did an amazing job creating this alternate reality and made it seem truly genuine and authentic. Definitely a must see for any movie goer and we can only hope District 10 is on the way."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","18 August 2009"," Allegory potentials not fully developed, which is not necessarily a bad thing
","This currently box office hit from a South Africa/New Zealand collaboration opens with some tantalizing suggestions of moving towards a allegorical dissertation of the world's racial problems, maybe even as specific as apartheid. This does not happen, which is not such a bad thing. Preachy action movies, whatever the subject matter is, are not easy to make and often end up being pretentious like some of the moments in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After an initial brief nod at social/political commentary, ""District 9"" wisely steers towards the safe course of being a first-class sci-fi action.<br/><br/>The first twist comes at the very beginning, a complete departure from the almost mandatory plot of visiting aliens dominating our planet (think ""Independence Day"" and a thousand others). Instead, aliens in a colossus space station that stays completely motionless over Johannesburg are herded into a ""District 9"", sort of a refugee ghetto, where their numbers grow to over a million in 30 years. The story begins when the city, in collaboration with a global entity called Multi-National United (or M.N.U.) undertakes to relocate these aliens to a remote location, out of being an eye-sore to the citizens.<br/><br/>These aliens (""prawns"") have a face that might have been borrowed directly from ""Predators"", and a body that remotely resemble a prawn (although they are complete with 4 limbs), and hence their nickname. Their speech, which may sound like something transported from the bar in ""Star Wars"", are intelligible to only a few who have studies them, among which is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), our anti-hero type of protagonist with an accent that matches his name. The plot is lunched at full steam ahead when it turns into a combo of ""the fugitive"", ""E.T."" and ""The fly"".<br/><br/>Through an accident, Wikus is exposed to certain substance that slowly turns him into an alien, starting with the left arm. His alien friend Christopher (together with a young son) in the meantime is trying to re-activate the space station and go home. They team up as buddies. While M.N.U. military authorities try to capture Wikus and turn him into a biological experiment, he tries to help Christopher to recover certain ""fluid"" that will re-activate the space station, in return of a promise to restore him to normal human form. Another player is a Nigerian gang that controls the underworld of District 9. Between these various players, all hell breaks loose, producing some absolutely first-class action, real and CGI both, that promises to keep you at the edge of your seat."

","(May be considered as a spoiler to some) Like, seriously, from CGs, to camera angles, to sound effects, everything was PERFECT. This movie is just really really awesome.<br/><br/>I was kinda expecting a typical ""it's end of the world"" + ""Aliens"" movie, with a really cool CGI and sound effects. However, I was was way taken aback by it. As the movie starts, I was expecting like, ""oh, this would happen... and that would happen""... Just like how it normally would turn out. BUT, the director managed to do something cooler, and come to think of it, it's what most people would do/what would happen to most people.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact, that they manage to make certain stuff come alive, and also how the aliens have their own mindset, own character and own language. It's not like a ""freak who comes down to earth and kills everyone till they're satisfied"" kind of movie. <br/><br/>I was also taken aback at some of the camera angles that some of the movie have, which was really, very brilliant. I am pretty sure that this movie costs a lot, and also, Peter Jackson, thank you for presenting this movie to the world. It. is. BERILLIANT!!<br/><br/>So...

","This film was quite unique in offering us a view of how an alien species lives under extreme conditions. The Prawns as they are called, were basically immigrants who needed help from a possible outside world, Yet instead got nothing more than ostracized by our fellow human companions. So much for the open handed theory huh?. It was incredible that once they had settled, that things would be somewhat normal, but because of the extreme culture clash, it was more racist than anything else. It was sad to see some of the Species being experimented on and executed during an experiment. Or having a fellow human transform into one of their kind and become the most hated person on the planet. With every section of the military hunting him down like a rabid Dog. Yet through all of the intense pressures from all sides, our hero manages to overcome the hate issue, and become something more that he would be accepted by. That being the Prawns. His friend who took the mother ship back home, will be back, because he gave his word. And with everything we know of as friendship, being an alien has its greatest advantages. The Prawns have a sense of cohesion, which makes them all very formidable opponents, I see a new war coming that will decide whether or not, our hero will take a side. And if he does, what lies before the future of our planet."

","D-9 somehow manages to juggle four or five things to incredible effect. Mockumentary is hard to do without becoming preachy or self-serving but D-9 makes excellent use of such. Science fiction means different things to different people (some say there's only been a half dozen authentic science fiction films ever made) but D-9 has to be as much if not more ""sci-fi""than; e.g., ALIEN (films like STAR WARS don't even count). The script and editing were great: Not a wasted minute. The special effects were just right; e.g., not too much or too little. There was humor, though maybe its more appropriate to call it comic relief; as the term was/is truly intended. There's a hero, or rather a main character that goes through a heroic transformation. And I don't care what the snobs say, D-9 is great social commentary, quite possibly because such comes so cleverly disguised as entertainment. I'm so glad that every time I start to believe no one will ever make an exciting movie again, a film like D-9 comes along and proves me wrong."

","I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.<br/><br/>Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.<br/><br/>There is, thankfully not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it's all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place. Evren Buyruk from Texas."
"ladymoonpictures","8","2","5","17 August 2009"," ""D9"" Highlights Bondage of the Disadvantaged With Great Subliminal Humor!
","""D9"" demonstrates an aggressive disrespect for the aliens which can be likened, it made me think, to the underprivileged and how humans of power subjugate the less fortunate. Humans have been doing this forever. We will never learn. Aliens fall prey to the same, inbred weakness of those in power: We may not understand you, but we can and will control you. That's one of the messages I got from this rather, quirky (in a good way) movie. The other thing I really appreciated was the excellent humor of it all. Especially when actor Sharlto Copley, who offers an academy award performance as ""Wikus Van De Merwe"", who gets the top job to go through ""D9"" interviewing the aliens and getting them to quickly sign the moving agreement/contracts because we got to move them to another location. Realize that there are 1.8 million to move and they go in, hut by hut, getting these signatures, shooting anything that even looks like a problem. Hilarious! Wikus is married to the daughter of the big boss. The big boss says that relationship had nothing to do with the appointment. Wikus is great. The humans with the guns don't shoot first, then ask questions. No. They shoot first and don't ask questions! It's all part of the general idea illustrated by the director to not show any respect whatsoever for these creatures. That's what we do. If we don't understand you, we are certainly not going to respect you. That's not a criticism. It's an undeniable short coming of ours. Now, as for the space craft. What an innovative idea to have one parked, as in 'broke down' over a major, world city! My thoughts concerning the UFO: Little known, in July 1956, 300 people were witness to perhaps the most spectacularly-defining UFO event ever and were sworn to TOP-SECRECY concerning an actual mother-like ship, that was observed over the White Sands Missle Range, that was sitting at the geo-synchronous orbit (approx. 23,000 miles above the range) for approx 12-hours and recorded (filmed) using Mitchell Hollywood-quality, B&W and color film -- thousands of feet, using an IGOR telescope mounted on a gun mount, producing exquisite pictures and triangulated by two separate crews, who happened to be doing missile telemetry testing, being fired off fighter aircraft of the day, which missions were scrubbed to film the alien craft. They estimated the craft to be 8 to 10 miles wide, based on comparatively accurate measurements. One eye witness, who viewed the craft through a 60X-power, sighting scope said it looked cigar like, and very smooth but without any tapering at the ends, and had what looked like ""moving rivets"" (smaller craft) flying in and out of it. Over 50-years ago; the witness is in his 70's and still most reluctant to be the first to speak out publicly on this. Our government has known about this since then yet they continue to dupe us; deny; and keep us uninformed. (It makes one wonder what really lurks deep in our government...so far removed from the original, founding father's motivation of a government for and by the people). The point is, the movie is worth seeing: There are unexplained circumstances that prove we are under examination from either other worlds or advanced peoples yet unknown to us, from this world. How will we treat them? Probably the same way we treated the aliens in ""D9"" or any other less fortunate or displaced people on earth. The circumstances appear to be the only way the truth of UFO's/aliens will ever be accepted. Parked where all can see and the government has no option but to recognize their reality. Otherwise, governments, ours included will continue to deny in order to keep their own self importance at the forefront. World governments: What are you afraid of? Let ""D9"" be the governmental catalyst of making all files being released to the public, worldwide, where all the world can review and decide our place within this structured universe -- and do it BEFORE one parks over US -- making your continued, perpetual denial look foolish and your lies categorically witnessed by all. We the people demand an end to this form of intellectual bondage that you are holding over us!"

","(Relax, no spoilers here) Please ignore the twits who've lately been rating this ""one star"" or any such nonsense. I sometimes wonder of there's a negative vote-bombing campaign going on? A fair and realistic score for District 9 is: 8/10 Make no mistake. District 9 is excellent and well worth your ticket. It isn't perfect. But it is excellent and quite original.<br/><br/>I won't rehash the plot. The film blends influences, ranging from Robocop to Starship Troopers, to that hand-held documentary style.<br/><br/>Some have called it the next ""Aliens"". I disagree. It doesn't have the empathy or character development of Aliens. The hero embarks on an arduous struggle, yes, but the film ultimately sacrifices pathos for satire. You'll be rooting for certain characters by the end. But there's no pure hero to follow from beginning to end (like Ripley).<br/><br/>Also, it's not a particularly suspenseful or scary film. Really, it's just not that similar to Aliens, other than the two films both broadly being lumped under ""horror/sci-fi"".<br/><br/>The ending is great, and the film is exhilarating in parts, as seemingly hopeless situations suddenly take a turn for the better.<br/><br/>The effects are *AWESOME*. I walked out of the cinema thinking ""This only cost $30million??"".<br/><br/>I haven't got a clue how the makers of Transformers 2 or GI Joe managed to blow $200million on such boring, forgettable movies. Maybe they literally burned crates full of money in all those fires and explosions? Go see District 9, and put Hollywood on notice.<br/><br/>No more cartoon wars based on toys, or rehashes of superheroes, TV shows, or old movies.<br/><br/>We want original and thoughtful sci-fi, full of genuine conflict, and this movie shows how it's done.

","Great movie, that excels without famous actors forced yet again down our throats or outrageous cgi. This is not surprising given that Peter Jackson was involved with this production. However, what I find so ironic, is the fact that humankind has been in contact with aliens for decades, through personal contacts and the scandalous behavior of the secret government. What is happening under the nose of humanity is in truth far more 'entertaining' than this, or any other science fiction movie ever made, yet we are too 'dumbed down' to even see the wood for the trees. As with most science fiction movies and many other genres, this movie is subconsciously preparing the human race for massive revelations that are going to shatter many beliefs and concepts. The dilemma is though, what new programming are we being exposed to with these movies and whose agenda is it.<br/><br/>""All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.""

Not a huge issue, but there could easily be some powerful women in the film. I enjoyed Peter Jackson's film-making, he didn't try to make it too much of an epic film.

","I was in my 3rd deployment to Iraq when I saw the trailer on IMDb for District 9. From the trailer I knew the basic story and being a fan of Peter Jackson this instantly went to the top of my must see list. I was fortunate to come home on leave from Iraq during the time the film opened and went to see film opening weekend. After one viewing I want to see it again, this is one of the best films of the year. The movie tells the story of a gargantuan alien spacecraft that stalls in the sky over Johannesburg South Africa. When no contact is made by the aliens it is we humans who become the invaders and the movie turns the usual science fiction conventions on it's ear by showing us as the monsters. In a nice bit of irony the aliens were more human than the real humans. The best science fiction holds a mirror up to our world and this was a refreshing change from the usual. Just from the trailer I could tell that the movie was an allegory for apartheid and to his credit director Neil Blomkamp doesn't hit us over the head with it. The film's 30 million budget shows that what intelligence and creativity can do. The production values are all top notch with the special effects being among the best I have ever seen. The titular slum far surpasses anything in Slumdog Millionaire and further adds to the realism. The 3rd act of the movie is the weakest being a shoot em up but it is so well done that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.The performance by Sharlton Copley is brilliant. He is a revelation and this a star making performance. This is intelligent absorbing science fiction of the highest order a true classic of the genre not to be missed."

","A sci-fi actioner that doesn't dumb down the elements or make it too complicated.

The movie eventually turns into a balls to the wall visual action treat, but it doesn't ever once seem like a cheap-shot to the audience, in fact it's a reward.<br/><br/>The direction is sublime, the acting is a huge surprise from a cast of mostly unknowns and visually it's realistic and actually quite lovely to watch.<br/><br/>The story is simple but not dumbed down and the pacing is pitch perfect.

One sequence culminates with the scientific and bodily horrors of putting advanced alien bioweapons in human hands. I haven't seen such poignant illustration of the system since Terry Gilliam's Brazil, and found the scene deeply, affectingly relevant.<br/><br/>District 9 sparks the imagination thanks to its (probably) realistic depiction of an alien race and the events following their arrival, but its exposition-free documentary style ultimately leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.

","I have to confess when I saw bits and pieces, and even a full trailer, I was very dubious it was going to be any good, even with Peter Jackson producing, but I am really glad I was advised to go. Basically a massive star ship appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1990, carrying a population of an alien race, nicknamed ""The Prawns"". Twenty years later, the human race believe the aliens have outstayed their welcome, and they are forced to live in squalor in the militarised ghetto called District 9. It is now 2010, and Multi-National United, the munitions corporation, is forcing the Prawns to be evicted, with operative Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) in charge. Things change when while raiding one of the Prawn's houses, Wikus is sprayed in the face by a strange alien chemical, which took years to make, and slowly his health is deteriorating. Beginning with his damaged arm, he finds it has turned into a Prawn arm, and obviously if he is not cured he will turn into a full alien being. Escaping captivity by the scientists and military personnel, the only people Wikus can count on is his two new ""friends"", the Prawns who not only created the chemical, but are planning to leave the planet. Many experts and people who knew Wikus don't know what happened to him, only believing he is alive, we see he did turn into a Prawn, and in the end, the aliens were moved to a District 10, where their population grew. Also starring David James as Koobus Venter, Jason Cope as Christopher Johnson / Grey Bradnam - UKNR Chief Correspondent, Vanessa Haywood as Tania Van De Merwe, Mandla Gaduka as Fundiswa Mhlanga, Kenneth Nkosi as Thomas, William Allen Young as Dirk Michaels, Hlengiwe Madlala as Sangoma, Louis Minnaar as Piet Smit and Robert Hobbs as Ross Pienaar. The documentary style makes this film interesting viewing, and with some great special effects and gory moments, this is certainly one science-fiction action drama you will be disappointed to miss. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Director for Neill Blomkamp, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay.

"vovazhd","6","4","15","15 August 2009"," Excellent premise but mixed execution
","District 9 has a fresh science fiction premise: an alien mothership arrives to Earth and inertly levitates in the sky over Johannesburg, South Africa. Once humans find their way inside, they find a famished alien worker population. There is no value in them except for their advanced weaponry that is rendered inoperable to humans. Like any great science fiction story, there are plenty of things left as a mystery.<br/><br/>It is clear that Peter Jackson's role as a producer has benefited the film in many ways. There are excellent special effects and environments. The alien design is beautiful, although I'm sure that not everyone will agree with me. Their culture, language, and eating habits were reasonably believable. The attention to detail is fantastic, especially in implementing features such as the ""For Humans Only"" signs.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film takes advantage of a documentary style. The story is told through interviews and news footage to retell history as it happened. Soon afterwards, the film follows events through the perspective of Wikus van der Merwe, a field operative played by Sharlto Copley. Although he is one of the more sensitive humans around, he still suffers from arrogance and selfishness. In fact, one of the things that might have hurt the film is the lack of any admirable characters in the cast. I found the alien leader and his son to be the only respectable characters.<br/><br/>If the first half of District 9 is science fiction, the second half is action. Generally I enjoy action, but it was not very compelling here. I was disappointed to find that there was essentially no insight after the halfway mark. No plot surprises, no deep character interactions, and no creative uses of technology. The film simply deteriorated into unbelievable action and illogical consequences. The main characters dodge hundreds of bullets, blow up things (including lots of humans, which effectively burst in a spray of guts when hit by alien weapon projectiles), and manage to survive despite countless mistakes. The ending was strange, but does leave plenty of room open for a sequel (in 3 years?).<br/><br/>District 9 opened fine, but slowly lost its appeal for me as it progressed. It felt like the writers wanted to send a message, but then worried that the audience would lose their attention so they threw in lots of action to try to make an exciting finale. That might be fine for most people, but it diminished my appreciation for the interesting parts."
"jdkraus","5","4","15","14 August 2009"," A unique surprise but still flawed
","Many science-fiction films I have seen are about aliens taking over our world. What ""District 9"" has in store is not the same nor the opposite, but the idea that an alien species lands on Earth and are at the mercy of us. After seeing this movie, it makes me wonder, if aliens ever land on Earth, would we be so cruel to them? Would we only keep them alive for our advantages in weapons and technology? <br/><br/>This main concept of the film, in my mind, is what makes it unique. I appreciate the filmmakers in keeping this film quiet until its release today, for it is quite an interesting surprise. <br/><br/>The film itself is presented like a documentary, with a lot of hand-held work and characters talking directly to the camera, explaining to the audience the story about these aliens. This really helped in developing the plot, but it wasn't enough. There were several things left unexplained and felt rushed. I don't want to give even more of the story away, but I have to mention two things I found awkward.<br/><br/>One, the movie does not explain how the aliens understand our language, much less how we would understand there's (which is made up of deep clicks by the way). There are many scenes throughout the film where a human would talk to an alien, and it would understand them and vice versa. The other thing is how poorly the government enforces the isolation of the aliens from humans.<br/><br/>It is made very clearly that humans do not want to be around them, yet Nigerian gang bangers somehow live alongside the aliens in the slums, selling them food and weapons, as well as scamming them. Why would the government allow this? This leads to another issue on the barbarism and witchcraft, in which these gang bangers believe eating aliens makes you have their ""special powers"". This added no relevance to the story whatsoever.<br/><br/>There is plenty of blood/gore in the film, especially at the end where there is more firepower occurring than any of the ""Rambo"" movies combined together. It's almost as if Neill Blomkamp wanted to sicken the audience even more, showing us how messed up people, particularly ones who live in Africa, really are. It is understandable for shock value. I'll admit that this movie would have been pretty hokey if it were a PG-13. The R was needed, but it didn't need to go Paul Verhoeven on us. <br/><br/>A final remark I'll make about this film is the choice of actors. I didn't recognize any of them but they all did a swell job. It proves that it doesn't take a big Hollywood star to sell a movie. ""District 9"" is not a movie for everyone, particularly for little kids. The aliens in some instances may look cute but there is plenty of ""bloody violence"" and ""pervasive language"". This movie will probably receive mixed reviews, but I find it to be a decent one, though not spectacular."

","In War For The Planet Of Apes, Blade Runner, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, we have already seen stupid settings that humans are evil, ignorant and greedy, while the non-humans are sympathetic, determined and smart. Here in this Sci-Fi thriller, we see this setting again. The plot simply lacks any sense of credibility. The visual effects are cheap and lousy. The cameras are shaky and intolerable."
"Imdbidia","8","3","10","16 March 2011"," Sci-fic renovated and that's entertainment
","A brilliant sci-fic movie. Something that makes the genre proud, but explores new ideas and narrative, and offers a story that is clever, thrilling and entertaining. It had to be a non-Hollywood director, a South African (and some ""Kiwis"" too) to come up with such a good story and cast.<br/><br/>The narrative of the film is great as the film is presented as a documentary that tells the story of the leading character in the past, with the colors and realistic use of the camera of documentaries, but still developing a fictional story that is presented as real. The use of the faded ocher colors it helps to convey realism and past tense, and gives credibility to the whole setting. This has been done before but not, as far as I know, for a sci-fic story.<br/><br/>The main character is superbly played by an unknown (at least to me) Shartlo Copley, who has has done a tremendous job playing with credibility a demanding character that goes from being a naive a little bit jerky soft-mannered public officer to an action fighter.<br/><br/>If you want stunning star special effects this is not your movie. This is a movie in which those effects are powerfully developed but subtly and realistically integrated in the story, which is what matters here. The aliens are greatly designed, especially their language, character, social structure and biology, points that are all relevant to the story, never self-indulgent. <br/><br/>The director has done a super-job in directing a movie that could have been cheesy or comic (in the bad sense) irrelevant and unsubstantial, but is nothing of that. We cannot forget Peter Jackson's production and the creative team in New Zealand either, who deserve a great praise for supporting such a great project!<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie was the setting, the fact that the spaceship stops over South Africa and the relationship that the locals establish with the newly arrived. Don't take me wrong, I think it is great that a country that is not the USA or an Anglo-Saxon country is chosen as a set of a movie; that's great! It is also true that the setting is perfect to explain many of the social reactions that we see happening in the story. My concern has to do with the fact that the movie, involuntary demonizes South African society and black people in general, and Nigerians in particular, who are portrayed as a despicable subhuman group. All of this was unnecessary, truly. Imagine how much verosimilar the storyline would have been if the setting was an invented country in which the social groups are not from a certain known country, just humans. Unintentionally, the script has done something that I usually hate in Hollywood movies - that is, that the bad guys are most of the time black, dark color and/o foreigners from non Anglo-Saxon societies and the hero a white man.<br/><br/>The personal relationship between the leading human and alien characters vaguely reminded me of the one shown in ""Enemy Mine"", although both movies are quite different in story and narrative.<br/><br/>I loved the last scene of the movie, really tender and full of hope. I would say that the movie was left open to a sequel, which I would definitely welcome.<br/><br/>Sci-fic fans will love the movie, and lovers of good movies in general, too."

Because what I saw was a REALLY BAD MOVIE, with virtually NO redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>OK, the special effects were all right, but the special effects are ALWAYS all right these days. And the 'documentary' feel initially drew me in, but then failed to deliver, the jerky, hand-held camera becoming tediously affected and ultimately, through overuse, genuinely annoying.<br/><br/>Was there a point to this film, other than to invite us to substitute an oppressed minority of our choosing for the prawns? Oh yes, because simple xenophobia wouldn't explain those chopper-borne snipers, we had to graft onto the 'plot,' late in the game, a SOULESS, EVIL CORPORATION.<br/><br/>And the less said about the wild west shoot-em-up at the end, the better -- but I'll say it anyway: ""action"" is almost always a cover for lack of content, and that was certainly true of ""District 9.""

","After seeing this film, I have a really hard time believing this movie was written for anything more than to have an excuse for recreating video game weapons on the big screen. If you have ever played Half-life 2 or Unreal tournament, you most likely noticed the weapons were extremely similar to the favorites in the games. In Half-life 2 we have the gravity gun, which lifts and throws objects and can shoot energy pulses. From Unreal we have the lightning gun. Other than the few lame scenes involving alien weapons there was zero action or excitement. I recommended this film to my friends I was going with and 2 of us dozed off a couple times. The plot is the stupidest thing ever written. Please let me sum it up, Aliens came from nowhere, are let to live in in the slums, there are thousands of them, they don't speak English and cant write. The MNU is attempting to visit aliens door to door so they can sign eviction notices to move elsewhere. They fail, and the ship leaves. Lame. Lame. Lame. How can you pay attention after seeing this silliness? I've never felt more misled and embarrassed to recommend a movie in my life."
"jmart99101","6","3","10","19 August 2009"," A racist movie about racism?
","First lets deal with the basic storyline. Basically its a story about aliens which are stuck on earth due to some spaceship malfunction. They are lead to live a miserable life in South African ghettos as refuges. The movie is shot in a documentary style. We enter the movie at the moment our main character Wikus is put in charge of the evacuation of the aliens into what resemble concentration camp because the South African population are tired of them and their behaviour. While promoted as a apartheid allegory, where black people were put into reserve by white colonialist. It bear some important differences, since here it is the aliens ""invaders"" which are being oppressed by the native population while during apartheid it was the invaders (colonialist) which were oppressing the native population on their own land. I would say the allegory is a mix between apartheid and Jewish immigration in Europe/Germany before the war.<br/><br/>I think the basic story is good, but thats were things goes downhill a bit. Nothing intelligent is done about this apartheid/Nazi allegory. I have to say this because this movie is taunted as intelligent sci-fi which its not. But personally I also like action/scifi so by itself thats not a problem to me. Unfortunately I found the rest of the movie pretty boring. Not much is really happening.<br/><br/>The story is: While evacuating the aliens to the concentration camp our hero Wikus is contaminated with some Aliens fluid then begin to slowly morph into one of them ""The Fly""-style. But during the whole movie he stays basically human with an alien arm.<br/><br/>When the government learn about his metamorphoses. They are ready to kill him and nurture his organ for some research. He escapes, meet an alien which tell him can turn him back to being 100% human. They get back into the research center together to steal back the fluid to help the alien escape the planet earth (with the help of Wikus at the last moment). At the end the Alien promises to come back to turn Wikus into an human again. I guess he will come back to get his people too.<br/><br/>While I'm a big fan of Sci-fi including action sci-fi. I found this movie most boring. Simply because there's not much going on. Its basically a escape and run movie.<br/><br/>But what struck me, since this movie is presented as a Apartheid allegory, its how the author Neill Blomkamp seem to not have dealt with his own prejudice toward black/African people. There are a few aspects which make this movie racist. There's the racist portrayal of gangster-flesh eating-Nigerians. Perpetuating the myth of the cannibal native. Natives believing foolishly that eating aliens flesh will give them power. No black person in this movie, set up on South Africa of all places, have any kind of significant role. Its like this movie is set up during the apartheid years, well maybe it is since no African people seem to have any leadership role. All a bit surprising when its a movie *about* racism. Then there's the little thing as black people seemingly showed to be the most racist toward the aliens. Or the aliens themselves being showed in such a unfavorable light that its almost understandable to put them into concentration camp. But I'll take it as a critic of the racist white South African press during apartheid years since the movie is shot in a documentary style. A white invader press which had to propagate myth and fake propaganda to justify the colonization, segregation and racism. And thats the only angle we see of those aliens. Wikus do meet a sympathetic alien, but unfortunately this alien seem presented to be the only one of his kind. As no other aliens are presented into a good light (do they have family values, life aspirations, dream, etc??). Alien are also presented as people which are not able to help themselves, thus need to be saved by the white man. There's no alien leaders, no Mandela or Soweto uprising here. Overall, the movie should have taken much better care since its a movie about racism and apartheid.<br/><br/>In overall humanity is presented as being very evil. While its completely unrealistic considering the specific situation of the movie. For what we see in the movie, it seem there was no effort whatsoever by the human to communicate with them or to know them better. Hell, we could have help them make that damn fluid so they could go back home!! I'll also take it as a critic of the apartheid regime beyond its lapse in logic (we would never treat aliens that way in similar circumstances).<br/><br/>The movie movie storyline was pretty boring, with not much happening. Escape running, that's it. Some lapse in logic here and there as to why the aliens don't use their own weapons for example. The technological backwardness of the alien (coming from a highly advance spaceship with robot weapon). Still worth a 6 (without considering the racist undertone which was hopefully unconscious). While no philosophical point was discussed somehow I wish the movie writer would have dealt with his own prejudice toward African/black people before tackling the issue of racism in a movie."

","28 Days Later + Aliens + Robocop = District 9<br/><br/>Above all the hype on how ""smart"" the film is, forget it, its just basically a buddy chase film.<br/><br/>That is the best I can do and completely avoid spoilers. <br/><br/>The violence and of course some other elements of the film clearly harken back to Paul Verhoeven's Robocop, the movie was also equally influenced by the list I started the review with.<br/><br/>Every one of those movies was good entertainment. So, wisely the filmmakers stole from good source material.<br/><br/>District 9 largely succeeds at being what the abominable Cloverfield wished it could be: one heck of a B movie. Where Cloverfield's premise lost steam quickly after the opening scenes, District 9 changes gears every 20 minutes into almost a completely different movie to keep the pot boiling. The shaky camera stuff has been done to death but thankfully it isn't too overbearing here. Surprisingly, there are some good stabs at humor too.<br/><br/>The special effects are OK, but with the DV shutter drag, we never get a good look half the time. The film feels low budget with really only one or two actors on screen at any given time. And don't get me started on numerous plot holes gaping bigger than that alien ship. Above the endless splattering bodies, crotchety aliens and mockumentary talking heads, when District 9 was over, I really just didn't feel anything. Other weak spots were the commando ""villain"" was very caricature baddie and out of place in the pseudo-reality of the other characters. The social message on the faux Apartheid is there but a bit thin and there really isn't much here we already haven't seen before, but I still enjoyed the ride. <br/><br/>I liked it."
"Bluedragon35","7","3","10","14 August 2009"," An original premise for a Summer film
","This summer has been filled with sequels (Transformers, Harry Potter, etc.) and remakes of old favorites (Star Trek). The best thing going for District 9 is it's originality. I was excited to see this film for that very reason. Something not usually seen in the summer blockbuster. A story with more to offer then a big budget. And I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>District 9 is the story about refugee aliens who land in Johannesburg, South Africa, much to the dismay of the locals. A concentration camp is built outside of the city to please the humans. Wikus Van De Merwe, played with reckless abandon by first timer Sharlto Copley, is a member of the MNU, the Multi-National United, the organization trying to use their technology, mostly their weaponry. He tags along as they begin to move the aliens to their new home, in order to discover more secrets. What he finds is a canister filled with a mysterious fluid. After accidentally spraying himself with it, he begins to change into something ""different.""<br/><br/>Saying anything else would give away to much. The fun of this film is not knowing too much about it. I can tell you that it does earn it's R rating. The violence is relentless, especially in the climactic finish. And the film drops more F bombs than a Martin Scorcese film, almost. But in a film like this, it should be expected. The only flaw in the film is it's different styles. The opening of the film is almost entirely done documentary style. Then it plays out like a Sci-Fi film. Throughout the movie, the film switches film an action style to ""real"" footage from security cameras. It distracts from the experience.<br/><br/>Overall, the film delivers. The premise is without a doubt the most original of the year. Copley is excellent. And the look of the film is great, better then most big-budget films out today (The film only cost 30 million to make). This is certainly worth a look. Don't miss it."

"fatehsmann","9","2","6","17 December 2010"," Greek tragedy meets sci-fi
","Neill Bloomkamp, at the tender age of 30, which is, in directorial terms, infancy, has come up with a masterpiece. A sci-fi movie and a tragedy so moving it could have been crafted by Shakespeare blend together seamlessly to give us one of the most under-rated, and brilliant movies of the decade.<br/><br/>It's initial (and final) segment is made like a documentary, which is a clever ploy to illustrate the present situation in the alternate reality and how it transpired, and what happened after the events of the movie. In a nutshell, an alien ship landed, came to the earth, hovering motionless above Johannesburg. A team then enters the ship to find a group of sick and malnourished aliens, who then are given shelter on earth. After the initial excitement died down, the government realizes there's a problem. The aliens are living in a slum-like crime-infested area called district 9, hardly someplace where we would want the first visitors from space to be staying. So Multi-national United, a private- military company is given the task of relocating them to a new,better location with Wikus van de Merwe heading it.<br/><br/>That's the base. The story takes off from here. Okay, it's not terribly original but what makes it brilliant is the completely different context it was put in, and the different direction it takes from there. It's a powerful story not only of betrayal, greed and violence, but also of morality and love, which can move you to tears. Your heart bleeds for the prawns (as the aliens are derogatorily called) when it's shown what a miserable existence they now lead. You weep for the alien's son when you see hopelessness and fright on his face as the soldiers come to take him. And most of all, you cry for Wan der Merwe and his fate.<br/><br/>The cast, lacking a major celebrity, do an excellent job. Wikus van de Merwe was recently voted in the top 100 fictional characters by Entertainment Weekly despite not terribly handsome, or strong, or cool, or funny. He's always slightly confused and very desperate, all of which Sharlto Copley (now embarking on a promising career that has already seen him play Murdoch in the A-team) portrays brilliantly. The two main prawns, Christopher and his son are splendid and their sad eyes and slouching shoulders touch your heart.<br/><br/>The cinematography is different from mainstream, and is brilliant. There is no air of conspiracy or the 'hero-will-fix' everything in this movie, instead there is an air of hopelessness and despair all over the movie.<br/><br/>While it is as moving, it is not very similar to the Greek tragedies. There are no invincible warriors, nor noble kings, nor any particularly memorable dialogues or quotes. Yet the characters are no less endearing. They are not above reproach themselves, initially putting self-interest first. The ending then vindicates them. You get the feeling this is exactly how a tragedy would pan out in the real world(if well, you overlook the tiny fact that there is no alien ship over Johannesburg, and not likely to be in the near future. But if this does happen, what follows might closely resemble the movie). The movie literally has no style, but is oozing with substance. Make no mistake about it, this movie is a piece of art whose true value not many will appreciate as they will ask for the action sequences, the heros, the jokes and the happy endings. However for me, this represents the zenith of cinema"

District 9 proved once again that something doesn't have to be perfect to be fully enjoyed and valued.<br/><br/>The way the story and the characters were done was fantastic. Of course, there were some one-dimensional individuals in order to fuel up the audiences feelings towards them. But, District 9 was not about a character study, so it's okay. The movie was about struggling in extreme situations.<br/><br/>The special effects were just downright perfect. I didn't see the aliens as CGI but as real characters to feel sympathy towards. Through the great effects came excellent action. To me, action is about adrenaline, tension so strong that you can't relax when watching the movie. The filmmakers made those fast moments sharp and brutal and, therefore, shocking. The limit was probably exceeded, but, it is nice to feel strongly alive.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, the overall atmosphere was refreshing. Today, the look of almost every single film is digitally manipulated darker or brighter. But, in this one, they left the colors natural and neutral. In this way, I didn't feel like I was been told to feel someway about something. <br/><br/>The well done score didn't control. It represented the characters and amplified the emotions and the effect.<br/><br/>The people who made Distict 9 really seemed to care about it.

"estebangonzalez10","7","2","6","16 September 2010"," Surprise Summer Hit
","District 9 was the surprise Summer hit and it was also a great film debut for director Neill Blomkamp who was able to make one of the best sci-fi movies of the last decade. This movie had it all: great special effects, good action scenes, character development (not just of the humans but of the aliens as well), and most importantly an original plot which served as a socio-political satire on discrimination, genocide, and corporate greed. I think almost anyone could understand the message that the director was trying to get across with this sci-fi movie. He criticized how humans treat others as inferior to them and how that hatred develops amongst the different groups simply because of cultural differences. The aliens were just an excellent way to get this message across without being too preachy and at the same time making us realize how fragile we are towards others who we cant relate too. Even the hero of this movie was depicted as a person with several flaws who made very unethical decisions, but changed once he was able to relate too and identify with the aliens. I was waiting a long time to get the chance to see this movie because of the excellent word of mouth it was receiving and I wasn't disappointed once I finally got to see it.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed in a documentary style (like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield) and that was a great addition to the film because it only gave it a more realistic and interesting take of the aliens and their lifestyle. The protagonist was Wikus, played by Sharlto Copley, who worked for a big corporation in charge of evicting the aliens and forcing them to live in concentration-like camps. These camps soon became slums where the aliens lived in very precarious situations and were looked down upon by the humans. Wikus is not your typical action hero, he is very unethical and treats these aliens very poorly and tries to manipulate them because he sees them as dumb and inferior beings. It is not until he accidentally splatters some bio-hazard material all over his face that we see him go through a Kafka like transformation and he also begins to see the aliens differently now and relate to them. Comparisons to the 80s movie The Fly cant be missed here as we see Wikus change not only in form, but in character as well and even becomes likable by the end of the film. He forms an unlikely duo with one of the aliens, Cristopher and in this relationship we get to see the aliens in a different light as well.<br/><br/>You have to give Peter Jackson a lot of credit for producing a movie like this with a first time director like Blomkamp, but the result was great. The director counted with Jacksons blessing and was able to put to use all the resources he was given delivering a great combination of special effects and fun action scenes that lived up to the standards of Summer movies with good performances from the cast and an original plot. If this was Blomkamps first movie as a director I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us as he continues to mature in his profession. His name will definitely be one I will be looking forward to in movies to come. A lot of credit has to be given to Sharlto Copleys performance as well because this movie couldn't have worked without him. He did an excellent job at depicting such an unorthodox and complex hero who went through a range of mood changes and made the audience hate him during some points of the movie and love him at others. This is a must see film that is more than just an action sci-fi movie, it is also a smart social-political satire that will be remembered for years to come."

","You know that many people hated Alien 3. Even the movies in IMDb Bottom 100 that some people are sorry for haven't been treated like that. However, my objection is that there are not really credible or really valid reasons of people. Alien 3 was entertaining, it was dark, it was suspenseful, bizarre (in a good way) harsh etc. but many people did not care about it and it is the same for District 9. The opening sequence of the movie, the introduction part in documentary style was extremely realistic, but at the same time very exhausting, I missed the half of it, it was because I watched the film with subtitles, so couldn't follow that part. The aliens in the movie are the most realistic and also intelligent ones in science fiction cinema history! The visual effects are flawless, again realistic. They look even better than the blue people of Avatar. Wikus is an unlikeable character, not a hero, not an anti hero either, he is a selfish guy, he thinks only himself, again realism here! There were some bloodcurdling, nasty details in the movie: sexual contact stuff. There is an experiment part in the movie, it is cliché, but personally I did not mind it, because the movie is dramatically very powerful, its breaking points are brilliant. If you are not against catharsis, this is your movie. In terms of action, the movie is a fresh, dynamite-like, captivating work. This movie is genius. District 9 has hundreds of themes, subtexts and metaphors. It is a satire, it is a thought provoking film. Let me tell you what I saw briefly. Basically, this movie is about humanity. Furthermore, cruel or sadistic people enjoy harming other ""people"". In the final act, there are some wow moments, I just say I was heavily impressed by the movie. May be in the final act, the movie becomes cliché, conventional a little bit, but I didn't mind. There are some real gore moments, while watching, I said to myself, these scenes must be the idea of Peter Jackson. As for the ending, it is an ending that most of the movies wouldn't dare! but the last image was too naive and unnecessary for such an intense film. Some people might find it ridiculous, but if somebody gives you a ""flower"", you accept it, right?"

","Why do people like this movie? It has an intriguing message behind it: the aliens stuck on Earth, forced to live in a slum ""district"", the escalation of human/alien conflicts, the involvement of black market ops for weapons... However, the main character Wikus was so poorly created. Without divulging anything, his actions at the end of the movie flipped back and forth making his character a slave to the already weak ending.<br/><br/>I felt that the movie could have been saved if the ending was better, but it wasn't. It was anti-climatic due to the multiple, contradicting final actions of the characters and I was left with more questions that answers. I was stunned at how poorly this ended, especially since it could have been a great ending if the filmmakers had stop focusing on the stupid language and ridiculous explosive weapons. Definitely a entertaining to dumb movie-going dudes.<br/><br/>Concerning the language a lot of f-bombs were dropping. It is not the fact that they used it, it was the fact that they overused it to the point that the word held no impact. Couldn't they have used some different curse words? There is a variety of them to use, so why beat the f word to death? It was like a 12 year old boy wrote the script.<br/><br/>I was greatly disappointed by this movie, especially after hearing all the positive hype it got.

","This is a great intelligent action flick. Wow, those are words I thought I'd never utter!<br/><br/>Very thought provoking, and quite challenging. I know people have got angry over some of the themes presented but I believe that it shouldn't be taken too seriously, simply taken the way it's presented - light heartedly. After all, it's a movie and not a UN resolution or anything. The overall message it gives out is very positive even if the final scene is a damning indictment of human affairs.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyable, great social commentary, guns, big explosions, funny.

","This movie gets a 10 out of 10 from me.<br/><br/>Why? The trailers did not show you what was in the real movie. And for me that was good. The trailer presented the movie more as a fight between humans and aliens. This is not the case.<br/><br/>I am not going to go deeper into the story here, since that might spoil the viewer's enjoyment.<br/><br/>The aliens are clearly visible, the graphics are simply astonishing.<br/><br/>The story is VERY powerful and has a clear reference to the apartheid in South Africa. That is what a lot of people seem to miss (it's a very big point in the movie!) I was on the tip of my chair the whole movie, it escalates very nice, it builds up tension, and you can see the protagonist changing.<br/><br/>The fact the actors are not known / well known doesn't make this movie bad. Actually it makes it good. You don't expect anything from the actor so it can only go upwards!"
"chains01","10","2","6","11 October 2009"," District 9
","After The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, Peter Jackson was handed the keys to a Halo movie. But work starting on The Lovely Bones (due out December 11, 2009) and the possibility of The Hobbit in his future, Peter Jackson opted to produce and wanted to pass directorial duties to an unknown South African director named Neill Blomkamp. With an unknown director known only for his short films, commercials, and special effects work and a reported $150 million budget for Halo the producers and studio balked at the idea of Blomkamp directing. After Halo fell through, Jackson offered Blomkamp a $30 million budget to direct the film of his choice. The result, a feature length version of Blomkamp's first short film Alive In Joburg called District 9.<br/><br/>District 9 starts as a documentary. Thirty years ago an alien ship came to a halt over Johannesburg, South Africa. After emptying the ship of it's inhabitants, the government segregates the aliens from the humans into a dirty third world camp called, you guessed it, District 9. The aliens who looks like a cross between insects and crustaceans and are referred to as prawns are forced to live in squalor and filth in rickety shacks and have to dig through trash for food or trade their advanced weaponry to Nigerian gangs for cans of cat food (their preferred food). Unfortunately, everything in District 9 isn't as it should be as the humans want them moved even further away from society, so a plan goes into effect to move the prawns even further from society into District 10. A group of officials from a government contracted firm called Multi-National United (MNU), led by Wikus Van De Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) is sent into District 9 to give the prawns eviction notices stating that they have 24 hours to vacate District 9. During the course of their project, though, Wikus accidentally has some mysterious liquid sprayed in his face which has some devastating effects.<br/><br/>District 9 could quite possibly be the best movie I've seen all summer, my only regret is that it didn't come out sooner. It starts out as social commentary dealing with apartheid, the humans take great pleasure in treating the prawns as less than human, shuffling them around, berating them, and even burning down shacks that contain their eggs. It's this socio-political relevance that really causes this movie to rise above it's sci-fi peers. On top of that, the movie is shot with a real documentary feel, this adds to the gritty reality of the movie. You believe this is happening because it feels like a documentary you'd watch on the History channel.<br/><br/>On top of that, the acting is superb as well. A special shout out must be given to Sharlto Copley who has no acting experience and had no previous acting experience and had no intention to be an actor prior to Blomkamp's short film, Alive In Joburg. His character Wikus is seen in nearly every scene of the movie and you really feel for him despite his early despicable acts in the movie. You always feel for him and you always root for him, and while that can be attributed to great writing, it takes a great actor to really pull that range off.<br/><br/>The real winner in this movie, and what really blew my mind, though, are the special effects. I don't normally mention budgets when reviewing a movie, but here I think it's important. To give you an idea if you were to look at the other action movies to come out this summer you would see that X-Men Origins: Wolverine cost approximately $160 million to make, Terminator Salvation cost about the same, and Transformers 2 cost about $200 million. On the other side of the spectrum, if you look at comedies, Funny People cost $75 million, and last years Zack and Miri Make a Porno cost $25 million. Hell, back in 1991, Terminator 2 was originally budgeted at $77 million but went way over budget. The point: this movie had as many special effects as, say Wolverine, and cost less than a third of that to make and looks 10x better. Remember, all of the prawns, except the dead ones laying out on tables, were shot completely with digital effects and they all look photo-real. This movie easily looks like a $150 million plus movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm really hoping this movie starts a new trend among studios: more original movies. I highly recommend you check it out in theaters, but before you decide to take your kids remember that this movie does earn it's R rating. It has way more than it's fair share of cursing, and exploding bodies (that alien technology will get ya every time). If you have a chance to go alone, or don't mind your kids seeing gore and hearing multiple f-bombs, I suggest you see it now and not just wait for this movie to hit DVD.<br/><br/>5/5"
"dusan-22","3","2","6","23 September 2009"," Pretty weak
","This is a nice attempt of making an interesting George Orwell style SF film. Clear message behind the human relations with alien nation could be used to describe relations between many social structures in our World: Unions, Countries or different social levels inside the countries. First thing that occurred to me is relation between the western ""civilization"" and nations that are announced as ""troubled"" now days, just like ""The Prawns"" in the movie. However, this is about everything interesting speaking of this film. Movie is suffocated by insisting on documentary style which can't follow the SF surrounding making it look like surreal comic book, instead of real. The plot is slow and boring, movie gets a little bit tent at the very end. Pity, as we also have a very convincing acting and pretty solid casting. 3 out of 10."

","When I first saw the trailer, I imagined District 9 to become a serious movie with thought - now that I've seen it I have to regret my naivety.<br/><br/>I will rate this movie 6 just because of the production. The images are magnificent and Johannesburg as location is a good choice. The CGI and gore effects are very good but exaggerated and sometimes they're just over the top, causing the movie to lose sincerity. Peter Jackson: I think you miss the good old times, when you showed us what BAD TASTE means.<br/><br/>The Story was - against my expectations - way too stereotypical with ""van der Merwe"" as critical character. I found it hard to follow this guy and you honestly notice, that Neill Blomkamp is a very inexperienced writer. Van der Merwes actions are just too tailored, making the character perfectly fit into the plot. In my opinion it should be the other way around: You've got a character in mind, and thus create a plot, based on what the actual character would do.<br/><br/>For example: What's with these stupid phone calls with Tanja? It's an irreproducible glitch that destroys so much of the movies sincere side. All they say is: ""I love you, i believe you, don't believe your father, i do believe you"" and all that gibberish for no reason!<br/><br/>One of the worst examples for a major ""clichee-scene"" is when van der Merwe is in the Mech, running away leaving the Alien behind and 5 seconds later he - for no reason - turns around and rescues him. Why don't shoot the military guy in the first place? At that point of the movie it doesn't matter because he has killed like 20-50 people anyways. It is just a bad attempt to create something like tension in all the wrong places.<br/><br/>If I could rate the Production and the Story separately I would give a 3/10 for story and a 9/10 for visualization, leaving me with a 6.<br/><br/>I honestly don't get this overrating delusion everyone is suffering from...."

"screamonerd005","4","2","6","3 September 2009"," Come on internet people, we should expect more from sci-fi.
","After first seeing the trailer for this film (ala the interrogation room scene), I eagerly awaited to see this film. It looked like it had some classic B-movie elements to the movie. Something that really got me interested in seeing the movie. Sadly, it was all GCI happy. <br/><br/>I'll make this short as I can. <br/><br/>First off, the story really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Unless they're planning to do a trilogy in which they're going to explain the story a little more, not much is given. You don't know why the aliens came to earth to be ""refugees"" in the first place. <br/><br/>Then there's the relationship between the human beings and the aliens. I didn't understand it. Were the aliens dangerous or not? in the beginning this one alien kicks this dude in the stomach as they're trying to evict him and the guy practically explodes, and the main character is trying calm the situation down like it was an accident. <br/><br/>Then the worst part of the storyline; the dude becomes an alien just from having some random oil spill on him. They don't explain what it is. Its just, ""oh sh%t some oil!, oh I'm an alien now, I somehow now know how to use all of their weapons.<br/><br/>Listen Internet kids, stop overrating this movie. It sucked. The characters and story weren't fully developed. I understand this movie was supposed to be related to apartheid in South Africa, but even with that in mind it couldn't save this lame story. <br/><br/>I don't consider myself part of what i like to call, ""The Dark Knight Generation,"" People who watch movies and expect as much realism as possible, otherwise their imagination is defunct and they can't get into a story. I love being able to write certain parts off in my head and use my imagination. But this movie had way to many holes to fill, I couldn't get into it. <br/><br/>Take away the violence and all you have is a lame movie about an alien named Chris."
"jaypugh","10","2","6","1 September 2009"," I Agree with the majority
","I haven't seen a movie twice in the theater in a LONG time but this was one that had me back for a second round. I found that I caught a lot more subtle things the second time around. With this shot as a documentary that is full of live news footage there is a lot to read on the screen as well as paying attention to the actors on screen. The depth of the film also left me wanting to see it a second time.<br/><br/>One of the best compliments I can give District 9 is that there no individual areas of the film that stand out enough to make break the feeling of you seeing something on your TV set at home. To be clear, I mean that the action is awesome but it isn't overdone to where you go home saying, ""What an awesome action flick."" The special FX are great but you don't go home wanting to rave about them either. Everything is done with a subtle touch to compliment the story and not stand out on its own. The space craft is meticulously detailed yet they didn't make it in a way that would have you fixated on it. The aliens are very real looking (if that can be said of an alien) but again, they don't make it to where that is what you go home talking about. In the end the story is the power of the film which is carefully handled and everything else simply supports it.<br/><br/>The other thing about the film is that the alien situation is handled so carefully that you originally have a chuckle when you see what it happening to them, which is tragic, but after only a few short minutes you feel sorrow for what you are seeing. This is not an easy task to accomplish but District 9 does it perfectly.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this film is how to describe it to friends so they will go to see it. You can't just say, ""Go see this alien film. It's great!"" After all, most people think aliens killing humans and us hunting them down from a description like that. You can't say it is just a drama with aliens because it has a fair amount of action. There is hardly a description for this film that will fit right for others to understand the depth of the movie. It must be seen by someone so they can make their own judgment as to what the film is to them. Whatever you want to call it, it is great. You can't help but to get sucked into the story and see so many social issues that we are dealing with today which are displayed so vibrantly in District 9. The lead actor was perfect for the role and the entire cast was awesome. This is one of those rare times when I am thankful that the movie didn't have a top name actor to sell it. A big name would only distract from a movie like this. District 9 goes down as the movie of the year for me with ease."

It is to me the best movie I've seen in my generation way better than the Dark Knight and Iron Man combined. Yeah go ahead and stone me. I know there's no connection with this movie but the reason why I say this is here's a movie we really need: An original story. This movie doesn't seem to steal or show any apparent similarities with other films and I like the fact that it doesn't take place in any familiar place like LA or New York but South Africa its just a fresh of breathe air. There is nothing about this film that meets the criteria of Hollywood, it surpasses it. Its not one of your run of the mil movies you go with your friends on the weekend to waste your money on some cheesy over hyped horror or action flick. The film has its unique style of story telling and cinematography that keeps you interested doesn't bore you one minute. Also the special effects were outstanding you almost feel like this is possible I love how they made everything look sophisticated and not over the top for the mechanisms of the alien technology or the props. But thats not the highlight of the film, its the whole spectrum of this movie that makes it an original masterpiece, our generation's Star Wars. Great acting, music, filming, directing, dialogue etc the whole package. Very provocative film."

","Just because a movie is filmed in a Documentary format, does not make it a great movie. If you just go by what formulas movie makers go by, this movie has everything. They could have explained more about the Aliens so perceived plots holes would not annoy the audience. However, in general, no one really cares about the aliens because they look like walking lobsters. The film makers try to humanize them by having the parents protect a baby alien...but again, just because it's a small alien doesn't mean we have to like him.<br/><br/>The main character is really a bad..bad person. We are to believe this guy, who looks like a low level manager, is going to be charge of a mass migration of the prawn to another camp. Except, there are 1.8 million of them and he's going door-to-door to evict them...ugh. He clearly has no morals when it comes to the aliens. I found it very annoying when is he asked to shoot one later in the film that he has a problem with it based on the fact he killed several baby prawn earlier in the film (in a quite nasty way). He's also a mass killer of government employees (his direct colleagues in some cases). Again, just not a guy you are going to root for too much.<br/><br/>The actor who plays him is a nobody and that carries over to the character. He's actually hard to understand sometimes with his heavy South African accent.<br/><br/>His infection with alien DNA is believable, but the fact what infected him is a fuel source that can power ships is not so believable. DNA cannot do everything and it's not silly putty.<br/><br/>I do like the alien weaponry and the DNA on/off switch (ala Stargate TV series). Some pretty cool effects and those scenes are quite enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, I do like the action and pace of the film. I enjoy Alien visits Earth movies, but this comes off as Alien Nation meets The Fly. I give it a 7/10 because of its uniqueness. Remember that 7/10 in the real world is a C- ;)<br/><br/>There is no way this is better than let's say, Alien or Aliens.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it in a theater? Yes, a matinÃ©e priced showing."

Eventually the style changes into an ordinary film, with an extraordinary story.<br/><br/>I won't reveal much more than that because not knowing what the story is only makes it more of a mystery and more entertaining.

","It's nice to see a science fiction film in which aliens are not blowing up New York or Washington or any part of the States. Johannesburg is a refreshing setting.<br/><br/>These aliens are not hostile but they are refugees in need of asylum. So therefore the South African government allows them to settle in the slum of District 9. Eventually the slum becomes militarized and some of the aliens or ""prawns"" become violent. So the weapons company of Multi-National United or MNU take responsibility for relocation of the aliens to another camp.<br/><br/>If those who have watched it have not figured it out, this film directly mirrors the apartheid era, hence South Africa is the setting.<br/><br/>For an international film the visual effects are really good. I am saying this because I do watch these new Bollywood films and the effects are pretty bad.<br/><br/>The violence and gore in this movie makes Kill Bill look like a kids film.<br/><br/>I liked it a lot."
"imdb-12718","9","2","6","19 August 2009"," How long have we had to wait for this?
","When I saw this movie for the first time, I was completely blown away. The documentary style of the opening scenes is more than just a film-making conceit: the whole realisation of the characters, the aliens, the slum is treated in a matter of fact way. No big reveals or false buildups to be seen. And this prosaic approach perversely gives ones reaction to the prawns, probably the most perfectly realised aliens on film so far, more of a sense of wonder than if they had been given the usual big Hollywood buildup.<br/><br/>In fact to me this same factor explains the success of the film on many levels, and unfortunately a large part of this is the contrast between other recent efforts in the same genre. Watching this movie throws into sharp relief just how unutterably shallow efforts such as the Transformers films and Terminator Salvation really are, to name but two. For example, the main character's climactic battle in the alien power suit more than held its own against any action sequence you can name, being genuinely viscerally exciting, but the development of the character through the film, the beautifully understated and touching relationship with his wife, and even the development of his relationship with Christopher, the alien he was trying to protect, also made it profoundly affecting at the same time.<br/><br/>It will be very interesting to see how this movie lasts the test of time. Looking back on it the underlying plot is only just strong enough to carry the film, and there are a number of implausibilities that call for the willing suspension of disbelief just a little too often. However, as a movie of its time, it currently stands out like a lush tropical glade in the middle of an otherwise pretty barren desert for the sf fan. Please please let this be the first step in a new direction."

","District 9 makes no apologies for being a straight-forward heavy-handed allegory for South African apartheid, hence the probability of a malfunctioning extraterrestrial mothership that just so happens to appear hovering in the skies over Johannesburg of all places on Earth and marooning a non-human race of aliens which are quickly given the derogatory slur ""Prawn"" because of their resemblance in appearance to our planet's indigenous crustaceans and are quickly ""relocated"" to District 9's shantytowns and slums as history begins to inevitably repeat itself. The film starts off as a mockumentary with realistic brilliance and abruptly shifts gears toward a conventional plot-driven science fiction story that recalls sociological themes of racial prejudice explored in past science fiction films like Alien Nation and Enemy Mine. There really aren't any likable humans in this film at all, not even the ""anti-hero"" Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) who comes off as a complete bureaucratic tool only interested in (literally) saving his own skin... and that's really the whole point, isn't it? That from an alien's point-of-view their impression of the human race is predominately a vile, greedy, despicably self-serving species whose only objective is profiting from the knowledge and technological ""acquisitions"" that contact with an advanced alien race might bring us and Director Neill Blomkamp explores these shameful and seemingly unredemptive human characteristics with profound existential brilliance.<br/><br/>The ""Prawns"" are the most ""alien"" looking aliens in cinema this side of H.R. Giger's Alien or Stan Winston's Predator and refreshingly features some of the best use of seamlessly integrated CGI seen in cinema in recent years. The more un-human they appear only heightens our fears and anxieties to their seemingly non-hostile intentions and tendencies towards racial animosity. They communicate to us only through a strange audible clicking sound that constitutes their linguistic structure similar to the native South African Bantu and the apparent semantic language differences, cultural customs and communication barriers rapidly deteriorate any hope for peaceful coexistence between our species. For example, the Prawns don't understand legal jargon like ""eviction"" making their ignorance to our common laws easy targets for bureaucratic exploitation and authoritarian subjugation.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to see if the Prawn who identifies himself only as Christopher Johnson would keep his promise to Wikus. After all the deplorable things we did to his kind though why should he? Perhaps that is what ultimately separates them from us and in spite of his race being cruelly segregated, brutally tortured and inhumanly experimented on comes back in three years to District 10 to free his people and help poor Wikus out of moral sympathy and compassion, universal traits that are seemingly lost upon the native human inhabitants of this alienating planet."

","i will say though that after i had watched District 9 and with all the hype for Peter Jackson to do a halo movie i think this is a close as he could get to it. why you ask well there are little pieces all over the movie that point to it.<br/><br/>The first thing related to halo is the white rifles that are handed to the MNU soldiers.the weapon in some regards resembles the battle rifles from the halo game, also you will notice in District 9 all the main pieces of the MNU armor are white, and they stand out very much in every scene. the more i thought about it the more i realized that there was a lot of things straight from halo in this film. MOst of every thing that seemed to have halo written all over it was also painted white. the small white trucks that the MNU soldiers drove resembled maybe a first generation warthog. they may have doors on them and no gun on the top but the general shape and style is very similar. other things that caught my eye were some of the white armor that the MNU soldiers wore. the chest and leg pieces looked like the master chief armor. if you took all the odds and ends that the different soldiers wore and put them on one guy, you would probably have an almost complete set of Armour minus the helmet.<br/><br/>what i mean by pre pre prequel, is that this is the very beginning of everything in the world of halo. this is pre reach, pre super soldier, pre everything. MNU could become the military group that makes the Master chief and all the super soldiers and Peter Jackson did it without any one knowing, possible? he could just be getting as much halo in for a quote unquote cameo. but this very well could be a start to a halo franchise but we just don't know it yet.<br/><br/>another maybe some what out there idea is that the prawns resemble the elites to an extent. there body shape and movements look very similar but the head is no where close but still very interesting. another thing is that when Christopher is talking to his sun about the home planet he says they can't go back and gives no answer why well maybe because his race was exiled and they literally took refuge on earth. Also Christopher kinda takes a different approach to the saving of Wickus. the med station was on the ship why not just take him with you well i think Christopher is going come back with a little help from his home maybe starting the whole halo saga potentially i know this is out there and a pit of a reach, but if you watch it a second time after reading this you might see it. i will also say i am not a huge halo game freak either and think that a halo movie would be some what impossible still or just a flop but i do think if Peter Jackson's used District 9 to push for a halo movie he did a perfect job. i can't wait for a sequel and hey maybe this is the start to a halo movie dynasty that never has the title halo until Master chief arrives. so if you think there is any merit to this leave a comment, but this is really just speculations with no merit or any real research."

Made on a minuscule budget of 30 million, funny people cost 70 million. the special effects, lighting, cinematography, direction and acting are all made with care and skill. <br/><br/>We the viewer, get to follow Wikus Van Der Mew as he embarks on a thrilling journey of self discovery and redemption. We follow ruthless, scary, caring and strange characters in their day to day lives and you might well get so engrossed in the film that fiction and reality might start to blend.<br/><br/>Enjoy it in theatres. The sound packs a bunch and is crystal. I went with friends who are not big sci-fi fans, but all of them enjoyed the ride that is district 9. Go see the movie if not in theatres than in DVD and enjoy. Highly recommended"

","Saw the movie a few days ago and loved it. One of the best things about the movie is no America or Americans in it thank god. No moronic half wits. Lucky it was set in Africa where there is a racial diversity issue cos if it was in America we would of seen just o my god billy bob it be a alien lets shoot it and make love to our sister. It was good to see how a 3rd world area of the world would deal with this issue instead of just America blowing stuff up. I loved the movie on that part and the fact that it was a good movie telling a story and strung together really well excellent CGI all in all great. Cant wait till i can get down to see it again. Once again Yay no Americans."

","Seeing the mothership over the grounds of Jo'burg inspired me in ways that most people can't even begin to imagine. It was truly a glorious momentum for all of us, ""Third World"" cinematic enthusiast. The Aliens visited earth, and no, they DID NOT ARRIVE IN THE STATES. I think this flick represents even more than people realize, it is a clear view of the beginning of a successful world wide cinematic decentralization, one that starts in SA and surely will not end soon.<br/><br/>The film's plot is spectacular. It's a shame that probably it will be treated as the average American action trash, when really, the social critique of a still experimental post-Apartheid country is not only evident, but is the pillar in witch the impact of the movie relies. I think that this movie is best enjoyed if you have a general knowledge of South African history, of the Townships, and of the discrimination that black people suffered during the Apartheid era. If you don't, then you will only be seeing ""a guy who helps an alien go back to his planet,"" and that is a true shame.<br/><br/>Thanks for this amazing film!!!! Enjoy a truly spectacular work!!"

Its been a long time since I've seen a movie executed so well in nearly every area. The acting, the plot, the CGI (wow!), and even the ending was not typical of your average movie.<br/><br/>I left the movie with my wife speechless. We both felt a little depressed. The movie really encapsulates the wraith and greed of the human race... It made me think that is exactly how big corps and governments would act if something like this did happen. Very thought provoking. Its been 2 days and Im still thinking about it and recommending it to everyone.<br/><br/>The last movie that made me think this much was Donnie Darko.

"SophomoreSlump","9","2","6","17 August 2009"," An Original and Powerful Movie with a Message
","Every not-so-often comes a movie that is disturbing and holds such a powerful message that it will definitely leave an impression on you. Whether you enjoyed it or not, it will certainly cling onto you. District 9 is original, realistic, and powerful and it definitely delivers the message.<br/><br/>District 9 tells the story of what happened when a malnourished and weakened alien race is stranded on Earth. Our people give them a place to stay, yet, like any normal human, we fear and hate them. Thus 'racism' is the main subject even after two decades since the aliens landed.<br/><br/>As the story goes, Wikus, an MNU (Multi-National United)agent, is sent to evict these 'prawns' to a new place  or rather, a concentration camp  where they can no longer make human feel uneasy. But during the eviction notification process, conflicts arise and Wikus is accidentally exposed to a biofuel that slowly turns him into the 'prawns'. He then experiences what it feels like to be surrounded by people that hate him.<br/><br/>The movie is way more realistic that  in its own term.<br/><br/>It's told in the form of a documentary, using snippets of 'real and raw' footage of when the alien first came, interviews with people, and also hand-held and even security camera all put together into one beautiful piece of work. The second half however is shown in a clean and edited movie picture. It is so well done that you won't even notice the shift in the story-telling process.<br/><br/>The acting are top-notch and not to mention that the movie is made by a first-time big-budget movie director with a cast of unknowns.<br/><br/>But enough of that.<br/><br/>What I love the most about the movie is that the 'prawns' are depicted not as aliens but as a minority race living on Earth. People hate them. We run tests of them. Abuse and even kill them. Racism and intolerance is a bad thing. And through Wikus we will feel how it's like to be hated. For example, in one powerful scene, Wikus is forced to kill a prawn. He hesitates and was electrocuted.<br/><br/>I won't say any more. You have to see it for yourself and really catch that message it's trying to deliver."
"hovey1127","9","2","6","17 August 2009"," WOW! A winner!
","Director and co-writer Neill Blommkamp has a winner on his hands. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that was so enjoyable. I am a science fiction fan and District 9 delivers. After their spaceship become stranded hovering above Johannesburg South Africa. A million desperate aliens, are stranded for twenty years in a refugee camp called district 9. Prawns as they are called live in poverty scavenging trash in the wastes of the district. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is a government functionary in charge of moving more than a million alien refugees from their camp in district nine to a new facility 200 miles away is the protagonist. He comes across as both a competent civil servant and unaware dupe. (Elisa and I did have a conversation about how in the know Wikus actually is. They needed to make him sympathetic while still showing that he disregarded the aliens as much as anyone else.) He an everyone else seems racist towards the aliens. The callous nature of the approach to moving them re enforces the relationship. They are not human nor are they seen as equal or intelligent. A very interesting juxtaposition considering that their technology is so much more advance than ours. In fact there are governments and multinational corporations searching for a way to use the weapons from the aliens. Unfortunately they are bio engineered and only the aliens can use them. Shot in a style of gathered video it could have been slicker but I do think that the found footage approach did not take too much away from the story. <br/><br/>The rest of the plot centers around Wikus and what happens to him while moving the aliens. He finds a cylinder of black liquid and when it accidentally sprays him things start to change for him. I do not want to give away any more of the plot. Go see this movie!<br/><br/>I will say though, that the tension and action of this film grows from that point on. It transforms into a very good action film and is a great ride."
"Scatterpulse","9","2","6","16 August 2009"," An Utterly Phenomenal Experience
","After only having seen one trailer for District 9, I went into the film expecting an enjoyable yet predictable no-brainer. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find so much more.<br/><br/>The reason this film is so successful on so many levels is pretty obvious: it has heart. You can tell by watching it that everyone working on this movie was pouring themselves into it. From the amazing CGI to the acting to the unbelievably complex and convincing clicking language that the ""prawns"" use, nothing seems to come up short. And best of all, the plot isn't at all predictable. It's true that this film is big, loud, and action-packed, but I found myself truly feeling for the aliens as well as the humans, and the narrative takes a number of surprising twists that keep your eyes glued to the screen. And when you find yourself empathizing with creatures that look like enormous, ugly, mutated prawns, you know the filmmakers have done SOMETHING right.<br/><br/>The only criticism that I can envision someone making has to do with the cinematography. The director chose to use a documentary-style approach to filming that makes a lot of it look like it was shot with a hand-held camera. I happened to like Cloverfield, but those who didn't shouldn't worry; the director obviously isn't a purist and he knows when to back off and switch to more conventional techniques that make the narrative flow very smoothly. It isn't anywhere near as choppy and jarring as Cloverfield or The Blair Witch Project, but it does pull the viewer in and add to the atmosphere of confusion and terror that the characters are experiencing.<br/><br/>Going into this film, I wasn't aware of the District Six inspiration, a sickening event in and of itself. I've seen one review that claims District 9 is insensitive to the Apartheid experience, but personally I don't think that's the case. While it doesn't seem that the director is explicitly referencing or criticizing the District Six horror, it doesn't glorify the incident either. The oppressors in this film are painted in revolting, cruel shades.<br/><br/>While leaving the theatre, I was tempted to just head back in and see the next showing as well. It's also making me itch for a sequel, which, in this day of crappy sequel cash-ins, is really saying something. So go see it! If you're anything like me, you'll be glad you did."
"janarrah1","10","2","6","16 August 2009"," District 9...will there be a sequel?
","I agree with another reviewer here that this is one of the 5 best films of the year so far....I even agree with his other 4 choices!.....Not only is the writing and plot a bit more sophisticated than your typical science fiction film, but the special effects are seamless....The prawns actually do look real and interacting with the human actors.<br/><br/>Now, I wonder if the whole movie was a set up for a sequel 3 years from now? I'll be there! But as my friend commented, what could the sequel possibly be about? Would it take an ""aliens revenge"" approach...or could they show us how to live properly via their advanced technology? I'd be curious to hear what the rest of you have to say about this. Thanks!"

I enjoyed every minute of the movie. The aliens were creepy but believable. The story was great. The production quality was extremely high and the special effects were good. The main character was enjoyable to watch and likable. It was like watching a McDonald's manager trying to run the department of homeland security.<br/><br/>The end of the film left me wanting more.

"JoeB131","10","2","6","16 August 2009"," Awesome!
","This is the kind of movie that makes me a fan of science fiction. Not the kiddie laser gun shoot up, but a thoughtful film that uses Science Fiction as an allegory to examine the flaws of our own society. This film makes a compelling case against racism and corporatism (the two great evils of our age) without being overly preachy.<br/><br/>The film starts simply enough, that a spaceship filled with a million arthropod aliens called ""Prawns"" (implying they are bottom feeders) parks over South Africa (of all places) and they are immediately resettled in a place called ""District 9"", essentially a huge slum. They are taken advantage of by everyone from criminals to a big corporation called MNU.<br/><br/>Enter our hero, a corporate schlep named Wikas. He's put in charge of the relocation plan because his father-in-law runs MNU. He's not meant to be likable. In fact, he is kind of reprehensible in some ways. During the evacuation, he is exposed to an alien mutagen that begins converting him into a prawn.<br/><br/>The kicker is the Evil Corporation (but I'd be repeating myself) figures this genetic modification allows him to operate the alien's advanced weaponry, which they are trying to crack. His father-in-law authorizes his vivisection (and you thought your in-laws were rough!) and he escapes into the alien district. He teams up with one of the smart aliens, who is trying to get the ship to return to their home world.<br/><br/>The nice thing about this movie is (*Spoiler*) everything is not tied up neatly in a bow at the end. Things are left open ended as to the fate of both the aliens and Wikas himself. Also, the interspersed documentary style is quite neat.<br/><br/>See this Movie!"
"EPDirector","10","2","6","16 August 2009"," You have never seen anything like it before...
","Seems like the science of fiction is back, with a bang of such power it shutters your reality and redefines it into something new and unknown. Never before have I seen such raw power, a story that delivers a massive social commentary while gently drawing parallels between humans and aliens. Never have I been so thankful and yet troubled, disturbed and yet satisfied.<br/><br/>I have never been so comfortable within my own skin to award a 10 to film without a blink of an eye ever before.<br/><br/>Beyond the eye-popping and super realistic visual effects that knock your socks off, beyond the action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat, beyond brilliant acting by the lead Sharlto Copley in his acting debut (!!!!!!!), the movie first and foremost comes to utilize the given cinematic tools to deliver - the story. A story that makes you think, at that!<br/><br/>From brilliant 29 year old prodigy director Neill Blomkamp, ""District 9"" is a story of the people and the people who rule them, set in the wasteland of the world - Johannesburg, South Africa. The setting has been chosen not only because it is the director's hometown, but also because Johannesburg is one of the most dangerous cities in the world to be living in. Clearly, the aliens had no better place to get stuck upon.<br/><br/>Without a single consideration of the rules of political correctness, Blomkamp dives in and takes us along, into ""Schindler's List"" all over again, smothered with good intentions. ""We came with peace"", ""We mean well"" finds a different meaning all too sudden and as an audience you are forced to find your ""good guys"" to vouch for. <br/><br/>""District 9"" is a perfect Academy movie, and I hope to see it in it's lists with at least 4 nominations. <br/><br/>I want Neill to go far...as far as humanly possible, so we would enjoy more of his thought provoking and incredibly powerful visual storytelling without a grain of cover-up or fear of polit. incorrectness.<br/><br/>10/10!"
"sox_fan_04","10","2","6","16 August 2009"," wow
","I went to this movie with my 17-year-old son. I expected it to be more of the same Transformers-type action-y relatively plot less sci-fi movie. Happily, I could not have been more wrong! It was very intense, not for kids (rated R for a reason), with a gripping, involving plot. You could feel the desperation of the characters. The ""prawns"" were real characters. The actor who played Wikus was fantastic as well, which was pivotal to the movie's success in my opinion. He was an everyday-type guy who was caught up in an extraordinary situation. I notice that some reviewers didn't care for the ""mockumentary"" style at the beginning, but personally I thought it served pretty well to introduce us to Wikus and it made the situation of the alien slum real. I highly recommend this film."
"arthera09","9","2","6","16 August 2009"," perfect summer film
","I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It has everything a summer movie needs and has everything that a classic movie needs. It has fun explosion and violence galore with plenty of cringe moments. The pacing is impeccable and I have not seen an action film fit in so much character development without slowing down the movie at all. I love the direction choice with the interviews and cutting back to what seemed like a documentary crew, but that sense was quickly loss and it felt like an action film again. The weapons were sweet and the impact that they had really made me believe that people would go through a lot of effort to gain control of them. My favorite part of the movie was the fact that some of the reactions that the humans had to the aliens were so strong, but perfectly mirror the way other humans tend to react to one another in similar situations. The action was fun and the last third of the movie was filled with lots of fun. Some critics complain that the last third was just a standard action flick, but I must disagree and that is because of the lead actor. He pulled off a transformation that matches some of the best performances I have seen this year and he did without a single acting credit to his name. The minor complaints that I have are that the story does not always make sense as it does with a lot of science fiction movies. Now that I think about it most of the time I hate the shaky cam, but this time it did not bother me because it was not used over the top and nothing like what the Bourne movies do. The fact that this movie was made for so little money does not show for a second. The fact that they used real slums for most of the filming completely immersed me in the world extremely quickly. I love the use of dialog and how they were all able to communicate with each other, but never spoke each others languages. The kid at the end was campy, but since it worked so well I do not mind at all. I really look forward to what everyone involved in this movie can do in the future. This movie was so much fun and I cannot recommend it enough and this will probably be on of the movies I will buy on Blu Ray as soon as it comes out and make everyone watch it."

For those of you who have seem the original Outer Limits TV show, the plot of District 9 may seem familiar. The 1964 episode starring Robert Duvall, The Chameleon (which may be viewed from a link on this website), features a very similar plot. Duvall's character is (voluntarily, in this case) surgically altered into an alien simulacrum to infiltrate an alleged invading group of aliens, but ends up 'going native'. The Alien Nation and Robocop influences are obvious and covered in detail elsewhere...<br/><br/>Forget the Transformers, GI Joe and all the other kiddie action flicks.

"aalleekk1989","8","1","2","2 November 2017"," A movie with great potential and some fruit for thoughts
","It is a movie with great potential. Unfortunately, I felt that too much effort was put on making it action-packed, rather than developing the characters and the story line. The worst thing is the action part itself is really not that convincing, and certainly filled with predictable cliché. The almost chaotic action scenes also significantly diluted the intensity of the plot.<br/><br/>The strong point of the movie is really on the metaphorical level. The aliens are metaphor of refugees or lower class labour imported from another country. Depicted in a particularly vulgar manner, they are often viewed as such by the hosting populace. The film even pointed out that the aliens supposedly belong to lower class of their planet. They were stranded and the government did only the minimum to keep them alive, resulting their appalling state of being, which feeds back into the stereotype of them being vulgar and inferior, despite clear evidence that they came from a far more technological advanced civilisation. The superiority is really built upon the situational conditions and artificial construct of the society, yet the majority is too blind to see and cares too less change.<br/><br/>The lead character works for an organisation that created and sustained the said sub-optimal treatment of the aliens; he himself showed very little goodwill in actually helping them. Yet in the end, he really relies on the goodwill of the alien to honour its promise and come back to convert him back to human. It would have been rather interesting if there was more bonding between the human and the alien main characters, but perhaps that was the whole point: when the roles exchange- and it can happen very quickly- there will be little chance to redeem the past. Indeed, when the lead alien character finally brought the whole army from another galaxy to rescue its fellow specie, human would be at their mercy."

","Aliens come to earth and guess what? They are not evil, they are friendly. Unlike all the Hollywood clichés they don't land in the US, they land in Johannesburg, South Africa. The film deals with the problem between humans and aliens in a very original way also in terms of how the story is told. It was filmed in such a creative way that I thought it was a documentary. I was confused and double- checked if I was watching the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The corporation Multi-National United is on a contract with the government. The main character Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is chosen as a head operative when MNU is moving the ""prawns"" (an insulting word for calling the aliens) from District 9 the refugee camp for 1.8 million aliens to District 10 - a new home for the aliens away from the humans, with even smaller shacks.<br/><br/>Wikus and a team of armed forces go to District 9 in order to ""offer"" them to move to the new place. While searching their shacks Wikus is exposed to an alien liquid. After this accident, we follow Wikus in a story that deals with issues such as backstabbing, one sided media and peoples perspective, betrayal, trust and being other.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp, the director, had a great debut with the help of Peter ""Lord of the Rings"" Jackson. Thanks to them I now know how horrid apartheid was and how people still live in poverty in Soweto, the place where the film was shot.<br/><br/>With its spectacular way of filming and entertaining people it has nothing to dislike and so much to like.

"cowboygingerbebop","10","1","2","4 October 2015"," The film makes a mark of distinction with its visual grit and documentary style opening
","Director Neil Blomkamp, guided by movie-making legend Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings trilogy), bitingly makes his directing premier in this thought provoking, gut wrenching sci-fi. The film makes a mark of distinction with its visual grit and documentary style opening that beckons you to enter the impoverished squalor and mystery that is the alien inhabited District 9.<br/><br/>We quickly learn that twenty eight years ago aliens entered Earth's atmosphere. However these aliens are not little green men or the type-cast fear invoking invaders we've come to expect from CGI driven blockbusters. The aliens in the film are insectoid bi-pedals ingeniously crafted and effortlessly real. Despite the weapons at their disposal, which no human is capable of using, the aliens are complacent and fearful of their human hosts who, over time, begin to despise them. Unsure, of what to do with their extraterrestrial visitors, an organization called Multi-National United (MNU) is commissioned to handle their affairs. The organization immediately takes an interest in the aliens' armaments even as they set up a restricted housing area for them. That area, which devolves into a treacherous slum, is District 9.<br/><br/>Insectoid aliens clashing with locals and being price gouged by gangsters at first glance may not seem like the most believable scenario. Yet, the impassioned, and at times heart-rending acting of South African newcomer Sharlto Copley make it stunningly easy to suspend reality. As the viewer begins to peel back the varying layers that have grown in around District 9 we probe at its mystique and danger alongside Copley as the initially awkward protagonist Wikus van der Merwe. Copley's character evolves right before our eyes and his performance takes on a terrifying urgency under pressure that will have viewers pleadingly on the edge of their seats. Most impressively, much of Copley's performance was improvised beside stand-ins for his CGI counterparts. Obviously, Copley never interacts with the alien antagonist deemed Christopher Johnson or battles massive humanoid robots, this is all movie magic, but due to his incredible delivery you would never know it.<br/><br/>Blomkamp has created a reality that is mutated from Earth as we know it just enough so that our minds still have a familiar place in which to conceivably roam. Despite the gory force of the aliens' weapons due to many speculative factors they are unable or unwilling to cast off the prejudice and marginalized personhood they encounter. The aliens are referred to as ""Prawns,"" a moniker that alludes to their mistrusted status as bottom feeders. With the striking image of an incapacitated spaceship hanging in the African sky, Blomkamp constructs a most ominous visual. The movie becomes an unsettling parable for South Africa's history of apartheid.<br/><br/>The result of Blomkamp's vision is delivered with striking effect by combining elements of fiction and history that puts the science back in science fiction. District 9 follows its thoughts to an elegant conclusion that will leave its viewers considering the characters and the fairness of their own infrastructure long after the movie reel and it's clucking aliens have receded to silence."

When forming a relationship with one alien who wants to only take care of her baby and leave the evil government, the two work together in order to help the aliens leave and live in peace. This film has extreme realism to it that make any other sci-fi film look ridiculous. The film interviews its characters to make it feel like a documentary and has perfect visual effects and editing to give visual appeal and keep its genre true to its legacy. Very interesting how the aliens are the victims, and how they are peaceful and a metaphor for discriminated groups such as sexual orientations, genders, or races. Neil Bloomkamp has a brilliant screenplay that isn't cheesy or over the top sci-fi at all. He makes it as realistic as possible which gives it a strong effect and cutting-edge glory. Spectacular visuals are also vital in this film. Gorgeous cinematography that has a very unique looking future and has a genies production design with the space ships. ""District"" is a unique sci-fi film that is for the intelligent only. This is not at all by means a popcorn film. Instead it is a modern classic of the sci-fi genre, and is the greatest film about aliens of all time."

","DISTRICT 9<br/><br/>This is a really good movie.<br/><br/>The film is about a species of alien that has come to Earth but they can't get back to their own planet. The humans are mistreating them and keeping them locked in their own area called District 9. When the humans decide to move the aliens to another area, they send in a group of people to evict them. The leader if this group gets sprayed with some black liquid and then seems very ill. All of a sudden he is being hunted by the humans. He has to ask the aliens for help.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is the way it is shot. The first half of the film is shot like it is a reality show. A camera crew follow the eviction team around and it is shot like a documentary. It's not until the main character is on the run where it gets shot like a movie.<br/><br/>The effects are great. The aliens look really good. You really dislike them at first, but the more the movie goes on the more you grow to like some of the aliens and hate the way they are being mistreated. I love the little child alien... he is so sweet.<br/><br/>As the film goes on you start to really feel sorry for the guy that is on the run even though at the beginning he seems like a douche.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this film is the setting. It makes a change for an alien invasion film not to take place in America or the UK. Instead this time they have come down over South Africa.<br/><br/>The action and violence is brilliant. The alien weaponry are awesome. The humans literally explode... it looks great and is really well done.<br/><br/>The acting is good throughout. The stars of the movie are Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope and Nathalie Boltt. But the stars of the film have to be the aliens.<br/><br/>This film is a lot of fun and if you have not seen it I suggest getting it ASAP.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Get your fokkin' tentacle out of my face!""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","I had no idea what this was about when I began watching it but am so glad I did. This film really shows what can be done with a small budget and a lot of vision. The character progression of Wikus is shaped by his deteriorating situation and increasing problems. That he is unequipped to cope is not surprising, given the predictable and thoughtless cushioned life he has led until now, but just as every human is driven by the instinct to survive, he begins to shake off his naive ineptitude and meet adversity head-on.<br/><br/>The fact that each forced step away from familiar boundaries and taboos is met with initial reluctance, demonstrates that despite the dehumanising treatment he is forced to endure, and the pressing need to ensure his own survival, Wikus never loses his own humanity or sense of who he is. Interlaced with the dramatic and relentless rush towards his fate, his fussy adherence to rules he can't quite let go of is tested to the limit by the constant discovery of betrayals perpetrated by the authority he once represented.<br/><br/>Many heroes, even reluctant ones, having taken that fateful step towards action-hero, become something else, something super-human or possibly less than human. Despite the clear physical changes he is undergoing, Wikus finds the mental strength he never knew he had to do the right thing. He takes a stand and remains his own man - just a faster, motivated and more enlightened one. His growing relationship with Christopher Johnson is the extra-terrestrial equivalent of all those mis-matched cop movies where reluctant partners are forced to work together and eventually gain a grudging respect and fondness for each other.<br/><br/>This is a very touching film but also a very funny one, as the bumbling Wikus we see at the start is literally transformed in the most startling ways. It is so well-judged, that the desperation of his circumstances and the humour in the script run happily along side by side and are never at odds with each other. This is a very human film about men and aliens. The smile never left my face."

"raphaklopper","9","1","2","16 July 2013"," Independence day + Signs + Clouse encounters + clichés = ""District 9""
","The Aliens franchises of films in recent years proved too repetitive: or they were an apocalypse with a huge alien invasion on our planet; or the good aliens arrive on earth and are unwelcome. Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson finally managed to bring back the old spirit of the original Aliens movies with ""District 9"".<br/><br/>""District 9"" unlike other Alien films, scraped together all sorts of Alien clichés, ranging from big cockroaches to super-intelligent beings who can be peaceful and dangerous at the same time, and have a super ultra-pack laser guns ... cool right?! Well, let's start with the story. ""District 9"" begins in 1982 when a massive alien ship (on ""Independence day"" style) begins to fly over Johannesburg, South Africa (yeah, it's not New York or Washington ... finally!). That ship was carrying an entire population of strange creatures (giant super smart cockroaches) called ""The Prawns"". Humans put and housed the aliens in a huge military area called District 9, where ""the prawns"" could live peacefully with humans. But 28 years later, the entire area was damaged into a massive slum with African militias bribing and terrorizing ""the prawns"". In 2010 the multinational weapons enterprise ""MNU"" (Multi-National United), that spent years researching the use of the weapons aliens that were also transported on the ship, was hired to transfer all the aliens to another military district called District 10 (UOL , I didn't expect that). To this they put in charge of the operation the employee Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley)... but like any Aliens films things did not turn out very well, especially for Wikus that after being infected by a strange alien virus, begins a furious fight for his life.<br/><br/>As said before Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell (Peter Jackson worked as a producer this time) put together in a beautiful script all kinds of Aliens clichés in a masterly and original fashion (mainly because the entire movie take's place in Johannesburg and not in a American capital). But while with the clichés, they showed a great originality in two aspects: the first is the fact that almost the entire film is presented as a documentary (this thing has never been done in aliens movies); and also the fact that they present a huge society critic soon after the incident with Wikus.<br/><br/>Wikus who was a huge prejudice towards the ""Prawns"" begins to depend on them when he gets infected and starts to turn into one of them. Everything he had from friends and family begin to treat him like an animal. We begin to feel their pain and rejection, not only because the film has a good realistic touch but also because of the connection we make with the character (thanks to his good sense of humor).<br/><br/>Not only in humanity and philosophical aspects that the film is impressive, but as said before this is a aliens movie, there couldn't be only a drama as ""Signs"". District 9 brings a good set of action with laser guns, thanks to good reality of the film, we can even see the reaction of a human body when it receives a shot of a laser gun (don't let fragile kids watch the movie).<br/><br/>""District 9"" can be one of the best (if not the best after ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") Aliens movies ever made. Along with a great mix of clichés and a good human philosophy, maintaining a good line of entertainment with spectacular action scenes and superb visual effects, is a film to be seen at least once in your lives."

"Raptor-the-amazing","10","1","2","27 June 2013"," Awesome, awesome, awesome.
","How great is District 9? Too good for words my friend, too good. So here's the basic idea; in 1982 a huge space ship appeared over Johannesburg, and from it came 'Prawns' an alien race. Now many years later the government wants to evict the Prawns and move them to District 10. From those few sentences, this film sounds pretty stupid right? Wrong. Well, things don't go as planned, and it's lots of fun to watch the Prawns angrily react. Along the way our main army guy accidentally inhales some alien liquid/gas which causes him to turn into a Prawn himself, along the way he meets a Prawn who he makes a deal with, (The liquid he got hit with is actually an alien gas necessary for the Prawns to power a ship so they can get back to the mother ship and get away from earth and back to their planet.) So they break into the base, cause a massive shoot out/slaughter and manage to retrieve the liquid. Now the army comes to forcefully move the Prawns and get the Half-Prawn guy back, because he is the only one who can get the Prawn's weapons to work. After an intense fight (and an awesome mech suit shoot out) the Prawns leave the guy who was changing but promise to return to change him back. The only problem is that it's going to take three years. As the film ends we get one last shot of the guy who was changing. Now a full Prawn. <br/><br/>The acting was good but the special effects are where this movie really shines! Weather it be the make-up on the Prawns, the explosions, the huge mech-suit that appears at the end. Of the gallons of gore that flies everywhere (even on the camera) it is all really good, the music and lighting are fine as well.<br/><br/>So when it comes right down to it, District 9 is an extremely well done movie. I can easily recommend to sci-fi fans, or fans of action movies or even people who just like lots of gore. District 9 is amazing and I hope they make a sequel (even though the chances are really, really, small of that happening.)"
"justin-hawk","8","1","2","23 June 2013"," An almost-excellent film let down by little details
","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>The film has an excellent premise and is presented in a very slick documentary style. The acting from Wikus and Christopher is outstanding and the director does an excellent job of making the audience care for the characters. Wikus's characterisation is also very interesting as he is selfish, impulsive and flawed which was quite realistic and refreshing. <br/><br/>There are a few issues in my opinion:<br/><br/><ul><li>The overly-cold MNU executives were kind of cheesy and too ""evil"" to be taken seriously.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the CGI Prawns at the start of the movie didn't look too great (understandable with the budget), but of course, overall the CGI is excellent (especially Christopher).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""population control"" scene where they burn down a shack full of Prawn eggs was again overly evil and difficult to take seriously. It can also be interpreted as a heavy handed and out of place comment on abortion, but perhaps I am looking too far into it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In general, the apartheid allegory seems pretty heavy handed and would have been more effective if it were more subtle (e.g. at the end of the film, Koobus refers to Wikus as a ""half-breed piece of s**t,"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Wikus is ill at his birthday party and says ""let's cut some cake,"" there is the cheesiest, cliché echo sound-effect used in cartoons when a character is dizzy (hard to describe).</li></ul><br/><br/>These may seem like little details, but collectively they do drag the film down a bit. But there is only one real issue that is outright inexcusable:<br/><br/><ul><li>They never explain how the ~500ml of fuel that Christopher has spent 20 years collecting is able to power a massive space ship AS WELL AS cause Wikus to transform into a Prawn. Were the Prawns originally humans and did this fuel turn them into Prawns? I mean, that's the only thing you can really draw from that as its what happens in the movie. Is the fuel able to transform any organism into a Prawn? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Also, how can there still be enough fuel after about 20ml at least was sprayed over Wikus's face? </li></ul><br/><br/>How could they not offer some explanation? This will irritate me for ever as it really drags down what would otherwise have been a fantastic film."

","Neill Blomkamp's first feature is fantastic: Blomkamp solicits some great performances from his ensemble cast - notably Sharlto Copley's character Wikus van der Merwe - as the infected Corporate Executive, who soon realises that those he works for are the real threat to society; not the alien 'Prawns' Blomkamp's script (co written by Terri Tatchell) is darkly humorous, whilst his clever docudrama approach yet further enhances the overall realist effect. With a mere $30M budget to play with (Half that of 'Battle Los Angeles') Blomkamp has pulled off a major coup - avoiding all the usual deadly earnest and sickly sweet excesses of Hollywood"

I personally liked every second of this movie and would watch it over and over again. But the reason why I only gave 9 out of 10 is that this movie might be not for everyone.

","District 9 takes real world problems happening in South Africa among places, and transforms it into a fictional sci-fi thriller. Wikus is the Head of Operations for the relocation of the prawn-like aliens. Wikus is a company man and doesn't have mercy for the alien race when it comes to abiding by the companies rules and policies. The company is pretty cruel with the treatment the aliens, they are treated as inferiors to the human race. Let's just say the script is flipped on Wikus as you prepare for this intense ride. The film does a great job of bringing the audience into the character of Wikus and takes for a emotional ride."

"HarryHawcroft","8","1","2","26 June 2012"," District 9.../10
","Independence Day eat your heart out. This heart thumping, adrenaline fuelled, socio-political, sci-fi thriller that is District 9 is making a firm impact on the future of cinematography and it's here to stay. District 9 separates itself from every other previous Sci-Fi adventure and creates its own unique, compelling genre in where the human race is projected as it's evil, selfish, dictatorship form leaving the weaker minority of its non-human race to suffer. The intriguing opening is a carefully crafted piece of cinema. We see the city of Johannesburg shadowed by a stationary mother ship containing one million malnourished, frightened aliens. The scene is quick to change to a humorous setting which contradicts the serious nature of the film. We see Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) comically presenting himself for a television appearance discussing his work for MNU (Multi- National United). Due to public anger and determination the Government are forced to relocate the aliens to a new destination which is effectively a concentration camp known as District 9. The eviction causes much uproar between the MNU and Aliens due to their poor relationship. This is because of segregation, prejudice and racism towards the ""Prawns"", a derogatory term given to the aliens due to their reptilic, back and putrid face. Because of these features it portrays them as different and dangerous yet to you, the viewer you still feel a sense of sorrow and injustice towards the Prawns. The story continues to reveal a much darker Government in where the Prawns are tested on and tortured. Wikus Van De Merwe comes face to face with the deception and lies of MNU and has no option but to become an outcast and live as one with the prawns if he is to ever regain his natural life. The young South Africa Director, Neil Blomkamp (Small Ville and Stargate) clearly has a keen eye for Sci-Fi. His skills presented throughout District 9 shows that a small screen director can make the big leap to the silver screen and pull it off with mighty precision, enhancing his career prospects overnight. The contrast between home video and professional film technique just adds to the realistic value of the production. It is made so well, in such a naturalistic manner some scenes have the power to trick you into believing you could almost be watching the 10 O'clock News. It is clear that Neil Blomkamp has had help from the inspirational producer Peter Jackson, director of the extremely successful Lord of The Rings trilogy, King Kong, The Lovely Bones and winner of the Best Motion Picture 2004. Peter Jackson can now add District 9 to his list of on-going successes. <br/><br/>The out of this world performance from Sharlto Copley is inspiration and moving expressing a number of emotions in such a profession despite this being his first major role. He pulls it off with such adequate that I'm sure he will continue to show himself in future throughout numerous films. People may be put off by District 9's Sci-Fi genre however it is so much more than your average Sci-Fi with a deeper, more emotional, involvement then other films such as: The Alien series, Predator, Independence Day and Star Trek. The film has no specific audience and can appeal to anybody involved with Government Affairs, Politics and ethics as well as film fans and the general public however it does contain some mighty explosions so be prepared for that! Each second of the 112 minute film is a unique piece of cinema and should be seen at all costs. I highly recommend this film as it is a true masterpiece and represents the high standard of the film industry today."

","Expectation: I had heard mixed reviews about D9 but was looking forward to experiencing it. I knew there were aliens, and segregation, but that was about it.<br/><br/>Delivery: I was frustrated by the first 40 minutes of the film, but intrigued as to where it was heading. I felt like I was watching a South African version of US version of The Office – it didn't work for me. My wife began to tire of the style after 10 minutes and eventually we stopped watching after about 30 minutes, it was a movie I'd have to finish on my own and I'm really glad I gave it another chance. It starts (and finishes) documentary style, it annoyed me at the time but on reflection it works as an entire piece.<br/><br/>The film finds its feet once the documentary style ceases (for a time) and the real action begins so if you find yourself struggling, hold out, it'll be worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the latter half of the film, enough to make me forget that the first half hour was a struggle. The moments of frustration were worth it with the pay-off in the final 20 minutes and a suitable ending.<br/><br/>There are online whispers of a sequel, and I'd love to see it."

I don't normally like this kind of film and I have to admit I was apprehensive at first, the documentary section of the film is very well done and serves its purpose perfectly. <br/><br/>Simply put, you have to see it.<br/><br/>Just one thing though, you will hate the South African accent by the end, either that or you will develop one."

","WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS. THIS IS NOT A DETAILED REVIEW, BUT IS AN EXPLANATION OF HOW DETAILED AND DEEP THIS FILM REALLY IS COMPARED TO YOUR TYPICAL HUMAN VS> ALIEN ACTION WAR TYPE OF MOVIE.<br/><br/>District 9 was a damn good movie, but none of my family wanted to watch it with me. I just wish my family could look past all the violence, bloodshed, and gore, and ugliness of the movie, and see that even the ugliest, can be the most beautiful.<br/><br/>Now, District 9 is not your typical Humans vs. Aliens war type of movie. You would think that the humans would turn out as the good guys, but in the end, it was the humans who turned out to be the most ultimate disgusting, disgraceful, creatures of the earth. Once a human was forced to live in an alien's shoes, one could finally see and appreciate that these aliens were as intelligent and emotional creatures as humans were, and they were not just lifeless, psychopathic, animal experiments.<br/><br/>During the beginning of the movie though, I must admit that I had my doubts about the credibility of the movie, especially once everyone left the living room. I thought it was just your typical Rambo war hell type of movie. But towards the end, I realized and understood the truth, and that I could finally appreciate these beautiful creatures and see that my previous judgments really did mislead me. The humans turned out to be the horrid, ugly, monsters, yet this reflects the type of ugliness, war, and violence found in the world today. It is a little sad. Maybe it's a good thing that we have not found life other then this earth, because this movie describes quite accurately of what events would occur if aliens did live on this earth. We would horribly treat the extra terrestrial creatures and take them for granted, and label them as the scum of the earth. Towards the end of the movie, realizing this reality, all what I wanted to do was puke, not at the aliens, but at the human race.<br/><br/>But this is not a new lesson; I experienced and known the ugliness of humankind a long time ago Maybe I find myself being somewhat alien-like and out-casted, but what I need to learn is to appreciate that there are good people out there, and not just judgmental scum. Me, being a human, I know I still have problems with making unfair judgments and creating inaccurate perceptions of others, and it's inevitable. But I am sure I will soon mature, find my peace of mind, and sway away from these inaccurate judgments and negativity through age, experience, discovery, wisdom, and insight. And even when I do fall into the deep hells of darkness, I will be strong knowing I will soon find the light, again. Because after watching this movie I have discovered a healthier and spiritual way of thinking. And knowing that even the most ugly things in life, can be the most beautiful. This movie is pure and philosophical, and it definitely will become a part of my collection for a long time."

","""District 9"" is one of the more original action-movies of the year. Without any stars in its cast it managed to generate a buzz, simply because the story is something you don't get everyday. (I'm too lazy to sum it up here, so please just check out the official IMDb plot summary) Also: The CGI is almost flawless (the prawn-like aliens look really convincing), whereas the main character is appropriately flawed. He's not a clean cut hero, but a nice guy who just has to deal with a series of really unfortunate things happening to him - which makes him all the more sympathetic.<br/><br/>In a way ""District 9"" reminded me of ""E.T."". You root for the aliens and against your own race, because in these movies humans only seem to think about violence, war and profit. ""District 9"" is, of course, much bleaker than ""E.T."", almost misanthropic, which takes away some of the fun. I'm not sure if the movie is intended to be a comment on Apartheid in any way - seeing how it's set in South Africa and how the aliens are forced to live in ghettos -, but if it is, its message sure ain't very deep. ""District 9"" has nothing else to say than that you deserve death and will be killed if you are a bad person. All the bad guys get shot or literally torn apart at some point. This leads to a third act that consists of nothing but people shooting each other. It's kinda exhausting.<br/><br/>What bothered me even more was that some plot points just fall into place too conveniently. For instance: The fluid that transforms humans into prawn people is the same ultra-rare fluid that aliens use as petrol. Another thing: The prawn people can turn transformed humans back to their normal self. How? When would they ever have performed that procedure?<br/><br/>Well, maybe some of these things will be explained in the sequel, that the ending of ""District 9"" obviously begs for. A ""Return To District 9"" could actually be quite interesting, maybe explore areas that the first part hasn't touched, yet (where do the aliens come from? What's our hero's fate?).

","Apparently audiences around the world are so starved for a movie that lives up or exceeds expectations that they are willing to take anything that is mildly interesting and proclaim it's an awesome movie. That's really the only explanation I have for the incredible overrating of ""District 9"".<br/><br/>This sci-fi movie starts out with a very interesting premise, of aliens being stranded on earth, forced to live in a slum, and constantly abuses and scammed by the humans. The first thirty minutes of the movie, shot in mock documentary style, are actually very refreshing, interesting, and poignant. There is even some social commentary, which, although very obvious (I don't even know if this still qualifies as an allegory for Apartheid, it's extremely thinly veiled) is very welcome in a blockbuster.<br/><br/>But the ""secrets"" hinted at in the (admittedly excellent) marketing campaign are never revealed. Instead, the movie soon evolves into a fairly standard action romp/buddy movie..and carries with it just about every cliché in the genre.<br/><br/>Granted, the action is decent and it seeing alien weaponry disintegrate stuff never really gets old. But when there is no disintegration going on, you can't help but cringe at the unbelievable sentimental moments, the incredibly predictability of the second half of the movie, and the vast amount of plot holes.<br/><br/>I kept hoping there would be some great twist that explained why the vastly superior aliens allowed themselves to be trapped on earth and treated like dirt, or why exactly one of them bothered to try to return home, or why on earth somebody would but surface-to-air missiles in a slum, or a dozen other things. The twist never comes though, and what we are left with is a very silly and very predictable second half of a movie.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype. ""District 9"" has an excellent marketing campaign and an interesting premise, but it's little more than a below average action movie in the end"
"hedcommand","8","1","2","19 September 2009"," could have gone deeper
","I liked the feeling they went for when trying to shot it as a documentary/different news feeds. And to make it all believable which I personally think that the director managed to do, making us believe that this actually happened. I liked the idea that for once the aliens could find another part of this wide world instead of the U.S which every alien seams to land in for some unexplainable reason. (U.S.A has the 3rd largest landmass, Russia and Canada is in 1st and 2nd place. And not to mention, China is about 34.460km2 smaller. Part from these 4 we have about 190 more countries, so our planet isn't small at all). Anyway to move on with my review before it sound like Im jumping on the states. I did find the scenes to be very well done, same goes for the CG's. However! They could have included more information in the beginning, as of now it felt rushed through and could have easily been 15-20 min longer (I know that other feels that way too). All in all, characters where well preformed, scenes nicely done, plot was done with great precision that too, showing how power and greed corrupts people. Even how it was forbidden for the aliens to even posses their own technology, and humans tried to R&D them, weapons lead to power, power leads to money, money leads greed. According to me they did manage to make the movie all believable and true in its own way. One final note! After seeing the movie it feels like a prelude to a sequel."
"aralith-1","6","1","2","16 September 2009"," Disappointing
","That is the best word for my experience with this film: disappointing. I wanted to like this film, I really did. I thought I would. All of the hype around it seemed, for the first time in a while, as though it was worth it. As though it was deserved. I am sad to say I was wrong. What I thought would be a brilliantly conceived piece of cinema epic in scope and just reveling in gritty realism, turned out to be just another summer action flick, that was more concerned with its CGI than the issues it raised.<br/><br/>The premise from the trailers seemed interesting. The aliens had technology we wanted but couldn't operate, and we were somehow keeping this advanced race prisoner on our own planet, causing god knows how many issues for both ourselves and them all for the sake of a military advantage. And for all I know, all of that could still have been taking place in this world. Only problem is we never saw it happening. There were only a few times throughout the film that the story seemed to intersect this premise, and none of them were at all satisfying.<br/><br/>The film starts as a mock documentary, giving us the necessary information so we can grasp what we'll be seeing for the next hour and a half. This, I will concede, was brilliant. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half hour of this film. The gritty realism was there, it seemed as though it would be raising some serious issues, and it had a delightfully macabre atmosphere and feel to it. Then, for no reason or warning at all, we are thrust into a cinematic film, rather than a documentary.<br/><br/>It was an odd, unexpected, and shocking change of pace. I think it would have worked very well if they'd kept it there. But instead, they insist on interweaving their documentary feel between the cinematic portions. I believe this was done in an attempt to give different feels to the two stories. All it accomplished though was to constantly force you to watch the film differently every ten minutes. And when the two stories finally became one, the documentary feel didn't go away. Making the character study portion of this film hard to stomach. There's no point in studying a character we don't care about and feel detached from, thanks to the documentary feel established earlier.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another flaw of this film that made it difficult to watch. It never really decided what it was about. In the beginning, it was about an alien race that had landed here 28 years ago and hadn't left. This portion was most enjoyable, as it gave us a good window into this alternate world, and showed the fallout of this tremendous event. Then the film became a sort of horror/thriller as it became more focused on the story, the mysterious substance, and the mortifying transformations it was causing in Wilkus van de Merwe. This was still interesting, but definitely not as much as the feel before. And Wilkus mutating into a prawn seemed like it was a story element straight out of Paul W. S. Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" films.<br/><br/>From here, the story finally thought it might become a little more epic. Wilkus and Christopher, neither of which I really cared for, decided they would try to break into this top secret lab, steal the fuel back, and make a break for the mother ship. Betrayals and surprises were abound, but I didn't care about any of them. Mostly because I couldn't care about the characters, feeling too detached from them after the documentary style introduction to them. During this portion, the film was half action flick, half character study of Christopher. Both seemed out of place, but the second one especially. Once again, what is the point of studying a character we have no stake in? After that the film just descended into action. It actually managed to maintain its cinematic feel for about forty five minutes while all this was going on. Then, suddenly, we're back to people being interviewed and it closed as some kind of feel good documentary about Christopher's possible return and the unknown fate of Wilkus. All the while managing to avoid actually doing anything about all of the issues it raised. So instead of an intellectual, gritty, and twisted sci-fi experience, we were given some kind of half thrown together action movie that pretended to be smarter than it was. In essence, the film could have been far more cerebral than it was. The fact that it wasn't was the biggest disappointment of all for me.<br/><br/>All in all, I give the film a 6.5. It had some good moments, but the story was bogged down by the relentless use of documentary inserts (sans the forty five minutes previously stated) that were a good excuse to slip in any information we would need to understand the upcoming scene, but ultimately made the film feel too detached for the less than epic story it was telling."

"whatutalkinaboot","7","1","2","15 September 2009"," Good but well short of greatness
","There's no getting around the fact that this is a good film. It has suffered from being over-hyped and overrated by initial reviewers but it's still a very decent effort at a Sci-Fi flick with a difference. It's largely original in concept and execution and for that it should be lauded. However, i must echo many other reviewers sentiments in that you can't help coming away from the film feeling a little disappointed. It was an opportunity missed, a chance at greatness squandered. The first half of the film is great, and the sense of a potential epic builds within the first 45 mins. From there onwards unfortunately, the film dips in story and credibility and never really recovers. It doesn't turn into a bad film, but simply fails to take advantage of the initial momentum. Too many holes in the plot become badly exposed. Why was getting the tube from the lab so easy? Why weren't the aliens using their own weapons against the humans? Why was there such a clichéd bad guy in the leader of the mercenary troop? What was the point in having the Nigerians there at all? Still, its a decent film."

The main character felt like a beginner in many scenes, and according to what I have read - that's about true.<br/><br/>The CGI department is where this movie's strength lie. It's well designed and on a level that doesn't shift the focus entirely away from the characters and the story. But in some parts i wish it did.

","Excellent Makeup, Amazing Effects, great cinematography, and a very, very convincing sci-fi movie. But, what was it really about? I have been to South Africa a few times, and I have seen some of the slums, and here's what I think it was about. Neill Blomkamp, and Terri Tatchell wrote, and directed a spectacular movie, with a superb story line, based ""entirely"" on the pre-apartheid era in South Africa. There were similar districts in South Africa, where blacks were located, and even relocated from, to other remote locations. One example is the District 6, in Cape Town. These relocations were required for exactly the same kind of reasons talked about in the movie, i.e. because the inhabitants (blacks or aliens) were encroaching on white settlements, and because of crime. Wikus Van de Merwe, in my opinion, symbolized a white, male black-sympathizer, who had strayed over to the ""other"" side."

","District 9 is easily one of the best Science fiction movies that I have seen for a long time. Neill Blomkamp is not yet 30, but has shown immense potential by churning out District 9 as it is from the sort of budget that we cannot associate with mainstream sci-fi movies in Hollywood. The characters have all been well etched out! My admiration for the movie only doubled after reading in IMDb that the actor Sharlto Copley had not acted before. He did give one steller performance.<br/><br/>Although the movie falls into the sci-fi genre, it was one of the very few which makes people believe that things that are being depicted, could have happened. Even after hours of watching the movie, I was still left thinking about the beauty of the characters and the plot and this, was precisely the driving factor behind me preaching the movie even after numerous people have already done the same !"
"wizard-121","6","1","2","29 August 2009"," Some philosophical overviews and perspectives on the aliens
","After hearing much about this film from friends and being a very big sci-fi fan, I was excited to see this movie tonight. I left the theater feeling mildly entertained, but not really moved subjectively or intellectually speaking. The movie was brilliant in its technical aptitude on so many levels, yet it lacked that awe-inspiring, fascinating, and eternally mysterious quality of wonder. You know, that feeling of wonder...of what it would be like to meet highly evolved extraterrestial beings that traveled such unimaginable distances (for our species) to arrive here on this pale blue dot (carl Sagan). <br/><br/>Perhaps its just me, but when it comes to sci-fi films I go the route of Stephen Spielberg in portraying aliens as actually highly intelligent beings that far surpass ours due to the millions of years they had to develop and evolve their alien culture and civilization. I always think or hope that we can have some modesty as humans and know that if anything had the level of technology to travel several thousand light years across to reach our solar system, they will sufficiently be far more advanced in every way, sociologically, biologically, technologically, psychologically, philosophically...in ever way, in hopes that we may actually LEARN something from them to evolve past our own predicament of ""the human condition"".<br/><br/>So my point being is in relevance to this misguided marvel of a film, that as brilliant as it is in its originality and realism, it does a major flop in its presentation of the alien beings that where supposedly sick from something in the mother ship.<br/><br/>My first impression of the aliens in the film in the way they where portrayed, was utterly disappointing. Not because of their appearance, but by their mannerisms as if they where mindless primitive savages that only wanted cat food. Clearly, they where portrayed as beings who had the intelligence of lower life forms. This was extremely insulting to my intelligence and basically rendered the movie as just another sci-fi masturbation flick of the stupid kind. How can I take this film seriously after that? <br/><br/>There was no mystery or beauty like Space Odyssey 2001 or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. This film could have been so much better, in fact it could have been a masterpiece had someone with a extraordinary vision and philosophical depth added some dimension to leave the viewer contemplating in awe and wonder. <br/><br/>HA! I know I ask too much, for such kind of films come by perhaps once every decade. Nevertheless, it was fantastic entertainment at best, but not of the interstellar kind. Those kind of movies don't make money, only mindless action flicks do. Typical Hollywood Formula crap.<br/><br/>I give it a rating of 6 due to the originality of the film and the technical achievement. Truly top notch. Could have been a 9 if the movie didn't insult my intelligence so much.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE: Please, all future film director and writers, if you are going to make a sci-film with aliens in them, <br/><br/>A) Please don't make them look like they are mutated from lobsters.<br/><br/>B) Give them some level of intelligence will you? These are not stupid beings, they are far,far more advanced beings than we can possibly comprehend.<br/><br/>C) Extremely intelligent beings know that less is more. Their ship designs would be very simple and elegant in their design and would not need thousand miles of piping in the exterior of their ship...that's a human model of engineering.<br/><br/>D) Aliens would have more advanced communication skills than we could even comprehend, they would be doing us a favor by lowering their level of communication to ours. Get over yourselves humans!<br/><br/>E) Please demonstrate a highly compelling reason why the aliens have traveled thousands of light years to arrive here in this tiny microscopic corner of our tiny little galaxy in a universe filled with billions of such galaxies x 10. Please demonstrate something of great of wonder and reason. Are they here for example to give some clues to the origins of the universe? or are they here to help give us a gentle push into the next evolutionary leap of mankind through advanced philosophies, systems, and sciences so that we can open our eyes and start REALLY exploring what is out there? or are they here to help solve the ongoing problems within our own species, like war, poverty, money, greed, stupidity, religion, etc.? or demonstrate new models of reality we have never even contemplated or seen?<br/><br/>Movies have power to move, make it so future sci-fi film directors!"

","8 January 2010. Take TRANSFORMERS (2007), THE FLY (1958), THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999), CLOVERFIELD (2008), ""The Chameleon"" episode 31 of THE OUTER LIMITS (1963) together with the former South African Apartheid and you have something patched together that somewhat resembles a movie that attempts to appear more than it really is. Unfortunately the great photography and camera work is wasted on an inconsistent pseudo-documentary style technique used in CLOVERFIELD along with some camera work similar to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, however, it then transforms primarily to a traditional linear movie cinematographic technique with intersertions of the documentary style that only serves to become more a distraction and gimmick than anything else, there is an almost TV COPS feel to this movie that only serves to focus on the perverted action instead of the genuine moral message that this movie superficial portrays. The main character doesn't seem cast right because he's more a parody of the boss's wife's son who actually doesn't seem to have much in the way of a redeeming character, an unpleasant, almost pitiful man really. There are weak flaws in the movie - one alien almost humanlike characteristically slams a door in anger, the superphysiology of the aliens at one moment seem superordinary and then by the end almost pedestrian and humanly fragile, the alien cannister is hidden unnecessarily where instead it could have been secreted and taken and used to power the ship without all the action and melodrama. There are many predictable, overly dramatic, exploitative, and manipulated scenes in this movie - the vicious evil human's demise at the end who survives for the climax, the overly wrought wife and the wife's deception. Overall, this movie while visually interesting, would have been far superior if shot in the JARHEAD (2005) Desert Storm motiff and the script carefully incorporated a more intelligent, more insect alien mentality, and a more credible main character. The pseudo-documentary in a way really was unnecessary, instrusive for this mystery, alien, thriller...and taking away some of the mystery of the ending. 5/10."

","When done properly, no other genre has the kind of capacity to deal with heavy issues, and raise scary questions, as science fiction. In much the same way as the classic Blade Runner (1982) and more contemporary Moon (2009) have done before it, District 9 raises a whole host of ethical issues including discrimination through apartheid, xenophobia and a generally broadened perspective of what constitutes common humanity, all of which contribute to an exceptional final product.<br/><br/>In his first feature-length film, Sharlto Copley plays MNU employee Wikus van der Merwe. The organisation he works for is in control of District 9, a refugee camp housing a multitude of aliens (derogatorily referred to as 'prawns' by their human captors) after their ship landed on the outskirts of Johannesburg during the Cold War. While entering the compound to serve some creatures with an eviction notice and check for illegal activity, he is infected with a foreign substance that causes him to slowly mutate into a prawn. A wanted man in the eyes of every scientist and soldier, Wikus becomes an outcast on his own planet, and must find ways to survive until the procedure can be reversed.<br/><br/>This film does a great job of introducing and thoroughly developing a range of themes without becoming too preachy. It dosen't take much to recognise the parallels drawn between the mistreatment of the aliens in the beginning of the film and the similar life led by modern- day refugees and other races once seen to be inferior, particularly during the era of apartheid in South Africa. <br/><br/>The more significant and central theme is the way Wikus is forced to change his view of the creatures as he becomes more and more like them. Initially indifferent towards their plight, he is left with little choice but to abandon that way of thinking and turn against the very organisation he once worked for. Indeed, as corny as it may sound, he does not prove his qualities as a compassionate being until he fully develops into something physical inhuman, beautifully illustrated in the film's final shot.<br/><br/>One easily overlooked positive of District 9 is the impressive way in which it is shot. Opening with all the elements of a mockumentary (use of hand-held camera and informative sequences intercut with 'experts' offering their opinion regarding the state of the alien compound), it seamlessly merges into a more traditional style (invoking the proverbial fourth wall) when required. While working under MNU, we are given an inside look into just how Wikus earns a crust. But as he begins to morph, we are very much on the outer, no longer familiar with the happy-go-lucky individual we were introduced to, all to the credit of director Neill Blomkamp.<br/><br/>If I had to give this film one criticism, it would be the poor characterisation of the antagonist, a military officer with the task of capturing Wikus the fugitive. Virtually every line of dialogue he is given is painfully cliché, and in one instance his poor choice of words really dampens the intensity of what should have been a highly emotive scene. Regardless, Blomkamp delivers a film high on self-purpose, with a dash of social commentary for good measure. Never have I felt such anticipation for a possible sequel.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

This movie is entirely believable from what I have seen in the 56 years of my life. I am talking about the cruelty of man. I witnessed a lot of this during Vietnam.

","OK, so by no means a perfect film, but does ask a very original question. Exactly what would we do if 2 million + aliens turned up on our doorstep tomorrow with nowhere else to go ?<br/><br/>They have interstellar technology but no power left to drive it, 99.9% of the aliens have no idea how to use it anyway and worst still the moveable pieces of technology they have (ie..weapons) are useless to us as they are all DNA encoded so they will only work for the aliens themselves.<br/><br/>I think it offends a lot of 1st world viewers of this film that we would actually treat a space fairing species this badly, but I think a lot of 3rd world viewers watch it and probably have a more realistic view of life, if they are not strong enough to take over and have nothing for us to exploit, somewhere like District 9 is pretty much where they would probably end up.<br/><br/>So, to change things around, I'm going to start with the weak points..<br/><br/>1) South Africa - I just wished that the film could have been based anywhere but here, while appreciating that a lot of the on location shots didn't even need to be created I think the impact would have been a whole lot bigger if the alien landfall had happened in a deep southern state of the USA. I just felt it gave a lot of people a 'cop out' to be able to think it wouldn't happen like that here.<br/><br/>2) The Bad Guys - OK, we all like bad guys to be bad guys, but these were like sooooo bad guys !!! A little less would actually have been a whole lot more.<br/><br/>And the good stuff...<br/><br/>1) Sharlto Copley - Starts out as a total nerd, someone you actually really dislike at the start of the film but come to like, admire and finally cheer for at the end of the film. A stunning performance and a credit to the actor for doing something I don't think I have ever seen anyone do so well in a film before.<br/><br/>2) The effects - Seamless in a way I'm pretty sure none of us have seen before.

"lasttimeisaw","7","2","7","7 November 2010"," District 9 - Overrated
","DISTRICT 9 is the final film of 2009 Oscar BEST PICTURE nominated films I saw (what a relief!), nevertheless I still hold the opinion that it is unwise to double the numbers as an awkward truth is that at least half of these films are plainly fillers (for example, this one), it only makes the ceremony longer and offers these fillers some popularity. <br/><br/>It seems to me that DISTRICT 9 is an overrated film, surely it has its own singular novelties such as its pseudo-documentary shooting, low-budget cost (30 millions) and carries an indie halo to subvert the Alien Vs. Human platitude. The story brings to the audience an intensely compact experience after 20 minutes until the end, but all the set pieces are far from innovative (for example 1. the most unimaginable way to take back the fluid in the lab is to snatch it simply like what the film shows; 2. the evasive usage of the precious fluid whose small amount takes a whole 20 years to produce, of course the background of these prawns is eschewed as well; 3. the stereotyped design of the villainous military man, to kill prawns without a cause as he is just loving to do so), unfortunately it's only breath-taking rather than mind-blowing. <br/><br/>The low-budget quality also hampers the film from taking a more grande scale to see the alien sides (the mothership), in which fans are mostly interested. Another flaw is the ending, maybe they did run out of money, which is nothing to complain, it ends hastily without a clue of what will happen next (a sequel is promisingly under the way I suppose). Actually if we substitute any other disadvantaged group (the poor, the disabled, the distorted, etc.) with these prawns in the film, the film is able to remain intact, maybe less fun. The political attitude is obvious but I feel numb about it since it is banal. <br/><br/>As his full-length debut, one must admit Neill Blomkamp has done a great job, his future is bright (should thank Peter Jackson too), I am looking forward to his new project, however I sincerely wish him that the best is yet to come. <br/><br/>PS: After seeing all 10 BEST PICTURE NOMINEES, I would replace STAR TREK with DISTRICT 9 and A SINGLE MAN with A SERIOUS MAN, period."

","I heard many negative comments from a few of my friends, and overheard two cinema workers talking about how much this movie sucked, so I did not go see it in theatres due to the fear of being disappointed. Anyways, I was on a flight to Orlando, Florida on January 6th, and District 9 was one of the available movies to watch, so I thought to myself: Why not? and basically here are my impressions. Overall, the context of having the Apartheid recreated with aliens was an original idea but I felt that the script was a bit lacking ideas. I mean I felt that in between the final fight and Wikus's escape, there wasn't much going on besides Wikus complaining that he doesn't want to turn into an alien. Speaking of Wikus, I felt that Sharlton Copey had a good portrayal of him, and made him feel likable, even when he was being a total jerk to the aliens.<br/><br/>However, while there didn't seem to be anything extremely cool during the ending and part of the middle of the movie doesn't mean this film bored me. The whole part about dealers willing to eat aliens to master the power of extra-terrestrial technology was pretty interesting. The acting was good and while the effects aren't Avatar looking, they're pretty awesome for a movie whose budget was about 30 million dollars. While the documentary aspect bored some other people, it captivated me on the other hand.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's a creative premise met by a somewhat lacking script. I only wish there was more action in this movie, but bear in mind that this is not a bad movie. It's pretty good, and while I wouldn't call it one of the year's best, I still feel that this movie has a lot of heart and that it is good. Worth at least a rent, but I think I'm going to buy the DVD when I can."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","7","6 March 2010"," A Different Type of Sci-Fi
","District 9 (2009) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A sci-fi film with brains is somewhat rare especially when it's released during the Summer Blockbuster era but this one here actually works on both the brains and action. In 1982 a spaceship comes to Earth and hovers over South Africa. Over the years the aliens take refuge in District 9, which becomes a run down slum so a group (MNU) goes in to evict them but soon the main guy (Sharlto Copley) is facing tensions from both sides as well as himself beginning to change. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film but it turned to be rather impressive, although I'd stop well short of calling it some sort of masterpiece. I think the film does manage to bring its political message without being too preachy and I enjoyed the fact that the alien race pretty much fills in for countless races that could have been used in a non sci-fi film. I also liked the fact that these aliens didn't attack New York, Chicago or various other large cities as we quite often see. Setting the film in South Africa makes for a certain look and atmosphere that the movie picks up and runs with. The scenes of the ghetto filth the aliens live in can certainly be viewed a couple different ways as could all the angry hatred being thrown at them. For the most part this movie tries to thrill you with its smart writing, although you know you're going to have to eventually get to the action. When the action does come it's quite impressive in its over-the-top, gory nature that has countless bodies being blown up and other carnage. The film also has a rather dark sense of humor that comes across quite well. The CGI effects are never overbearing and they never take center stage over the story, which is a major plus as is the fact that the overall look of the film is very impressive and realistic. I think another strong aspect of the story is the fact that we can believe everything we're seeing. Performances aren't too bad, the direction very solid and we get a nice music score. A very impressive little gem, although I would argue it runs a bit too long in the end."

","This is one movie that made me go WOW when the end credits started showing. Frankly speaking I wasn't expecting anything from District 9, because the names are all unknown to me; Neil Blomkamp, Sharlto Copley etc.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised about the concept, I thought this would be another movie on the lines of the MIB series, or Independence Day. That was not the case, another plus point of this movie is that it has been shot in the form of a documentary, just like Cloverfield gave you the impression you are watching amateur handycam footage, District 9 gives you a Discovery Channel feeling, which is very different.<br/><br/>Special effects are absolutely amazing, they are not over the top and fit the concept. The interaction between humans and aliens look very convincing, just one thing remains confusing; how do the humans understand alien language? <br/><br/>Performances are wonderful, with Sharlto Copley standing out as Wikus. He is simply marvellous and delivers an award worthy performance, I am confident this dude will go very far. The supporting cast was very effective, cinematography is just great. <br/><br/>All in all, District 9 is a masterpiece in the field of Sci-Fi, it cannot be compared to other movies, besides the alien factor. District 9 is worth 10 on 10! <br/><br/>YOU MUST GO FOR IT!!"

","This movie was the only movie that had me gripped till the very end. Like Alien, there was a raw believability about most of what happened and a subtle approach towards the special effects.<br/><br/>There was an air of attention to detail which kept the disbelief well at bay, not just well-done but artistically impressive. The characters were very honest and well acted, and really drew me into the story.<br/><br/>A lot of the storyline is also unknown, which gives me that feeling I get when I look at the stars. This is the feeling that draws me into SciFi and is very rare to come out of a film. At least for me.<br/><br/>There were references to apartheid and other social struggles which is common for this kind of plot line (see Alien Nation) but in this movie it was very subtle and left up to the viewer to decide.<br/><br/>A very intelligent film which seems to include the Hollywood ""storytelling essentials"" without becoming cheesy and up it's own backside. Well, maybe once (""save yourself!"")..."

"debjyoti1981","9","2","7","1 December 2009"," Exhilarating !!!
","Exhilarating!! I think this is the only word I can think of for describing this movie.<br/><br/>For those who have not yet seen 'District 9' this is a Science Fiction Action Adventure directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>As far as I know this was Neill's first project. Without any prior information on this movie, I think I decided to give this movie a shot when I saw that Peter Jackson was also involved. Any way I was not at all thwarted.<br/><br/>To tell the story in a nutshell, we are told that some time back in the '80s a massive alien ship appeared over Johannesburg, SA & it looked to be marooned as its command module got separated some how (which we are not told how) and fell to earth. After sometime the people from earth formed a probing team who discovers a million unhealthy extraterrestrial species, which are later given refuge on earth. However in a matter of time the initial welcome gets washed out from human community as some of these aliens called as ""Prawns"" (As they resembled the exoskeleton of prawns) gets involved into unlawful activities. The asylum camp where these aliens were located was called as 'District 9'. After some time a militarized Private Company called MNU (Multi National United) is given contract to evict the population to a new place. While the on going story we are introduced to the protagonist Wikus Van De Merwe who acts as the operative in charge for eviction. Somehow during the process he gets accidentally infected to one alien chemical component which leads to mutation. The story ultimately revolves around the MNU's exploitation on Wikus' newly infection in order to accelerate alien weapon system, which they had been working on for some time, without much success. Side by side we are shown the dark side of the human & Wikus' flight to escape from this new nightmare.<br/><br/>Wikus character is intensely performed by Sharlto Copley; I think I will not be forgetting this very soon. Considering the budget to be less than 40 million I think the special effects and the Alien design was simply brilliant. After a long time we are provided with story which has a soul in a literal sense.<br/><br/>This movie is prepared in the way to give it a documentary look, but it never goes beyond overdo. Neill succeeds in steadily converting the light hearted nature of this movie to a fast paced dark action narrative, which is definitely praise worthy. I think every one should see this once to make their on conclusion. Overall I think this is a nice production which might fall under the scanner of the Academy Awardsif not for the 'Best Picture'may be for the Visual Effects."
"joebloggscity","7","2","7","1 December 2009"," Great tale about aliens who come to earth and the real danger is to themselves......
","Peter Jackson isn't exactly orthodox with his choice of films, and he continues in that vein with this gem. Aliens (or ""prawns"" as they are referred to) have arrived and are cornered into ramshackle ghettos in Johannesburg South Africa. Bad enough for humans, the aliens themselves appear degenerate in their surroundings. Along comes the ""MNU"" unit led by Wikus van der Merwe to evict the aliens and force them into a squalid camp which is nothing less than a concentration camp. Winke is a man who had landed his lead role through old fashioned nepotism and is seriously out of his depth. By some accident, he becomes infected by a liquid which slowly is transforming him into one of the aliens themselves. The race is on for him to find a cure to reverse the condition and the need to forge an unlikely alliance to get this done.<br/><br/>The storyline may not appeal to most but it is actually very fascinating. The film turns the genre on its head in many ways. The aliens are generally weak despite being technically advanced, our lead character is a weak man (no Flash Gordon) and the setting is the unlikely location of Johannesburg (South Africa). The last part is important. The film really is a social commentary or reflection on South African and racism from the old Apartheid days. It's quite startling and a bit of an eye opener. Maybe as it's not humans as the victims, you feel less uncomfortable in watching it but there the point hits home in a way.<br/><br/>The initial mock documentary style direction gets you into the action and story, whilst the acting by our lead man is great. He has to make you change your emotions for him a number of times in the film, from humour to horror to disgust and then to sympathy and so on. The aliens are very inhuman in their appearance but the CGI is excellent and you really believe they are for real at points. Some good action carries you along but the portrayal of the Nigerians in the camps is understandably controversial. That's a discussion for another day, best just see them representative of a gangster group (no matter what colour, race or nationality).<br/><br/>Anyhow, it's a very good film, but definitely more for adults (not at all for kids). It can amaze and frighten, and at the end you will have a lot to think and talk about. Good themes and great direction. The film is open-ended so allows for a sequel. On this showing, many will be looking forward to its release."

","The hype around District 9 (2009) was big a few months ago and I also in a way was taken by it: from the first released pics and teaser trailers I ""already knew"" that this would be a great one. I wanted it to be something original and different, maybe even a modern classic of some sort. Sadly, the finished film isn't any of those things.<br/><br/>The film's premise is an interesting one (minus the multiple plot-holes), presenting a very obvious reference to the apartheid and people's common intolerance towards anything ""alien"" (and that being real aliens in this case), but the story that follows is a downslope from a somewhat good first half of the film to an unimaginative action rampage that destroys everything the first half had managed to accomplish.<br/><br/>The film is presented mostly in a documentary -style but the feel of supposedly watching one is lost very early on in the film. It wasn't solely the plot-holes, the far-fetched story elements or such but the way the film was shot and edited – it's not a documentary I'm watching. Also, the beginning feels a lot like an extravagant episode of the Office (with all the goofiness and quirky characters presented) or something like that, rather than a seriously taken story of man who loses everything.<br/><br/>The star of the show, Wikus Van De Merwe (played by Sharlto Copley) feels more like an unused ""white collar office worker"" -caricature from some sketch -show, than a successful government agent leading the relations between the human race and the extra-terrestial refugees. Sharlto does decent job with the character even though the character's arc from a quirky pencil pusher to Rambo 2010 is everything but believable – or interesting.<br/><br/>The film looks good; the CGI is decent, the hand-held camera style fits the events and the South African slum setting is well put together (though in parts unbelievably racist: the way the Nigerians are presented in the film is a very odd and miscalculated step in my opinion). Technically the film is OK but the story and the script possess all the elements that keep District 9 from rising above the sea of mediocriticy; heavy thematical underlining, lousy story elements, poor character development, unimaginative dialog and so forth. The premise offered an endless array of great stories to tell, it's kind of sad that the most boring, the most easiest and the most obvious one was selected. 3/4"

","An extreme and original surprise, spilled out from you-wonder-where, that presents an explosive portrait of the human character of all times, in a context unexpectedly chosen and unexpectedly highlighted, with small pieces of today-reality particularly relevant to the African/ South African setting. Having as a plot the inhabitance of an alien species for 20 years, with the status of refugees, and victims of the environment and of intolerance, altogether with the more than current obsession of human beings for armed power development, and exploitation of all available resources, the film presents, in a documentary manner at first a very realistically build story of a human representative, common and apparently without anything of the extraordinary, at first a victim of the intersection of the 2 species as well as of the already mentioned obsession, which turns against those whom he called as being alike, finding support and friendship exactly in the middle of the so- called hostile, obtaining or rather spinning to the surface strength, courage and will to fight under the influence of his survival instinct, moments in the production that reminds me from time to time of the unfolding events from another favorite of mine - The Fly. The special effects are extremely well made, with all the horrific elements extremely realistic, and focusing on detail and movement. Eat this, Transformers!"

","To start with, this movie is a boring-fest for the most part. Later comes some cool visual effects from the alien guns, which raises the question as to why those aliens didn't do anything with this advanced technology other than trading it in for cat food. Seriously, aliens like cat food? Who came up with that idea? Let's talk a little about the main character. He's this naïve, stupid looking man who is not likable by any stretch of the brain. In fact, I found myself wishing several times that he got dismembered by the ""Prawns"" because he was so annoying. And, I know this has been mentioned numerous times, but I'll mention it againhow are humans and aliens able to communicate with one another? The movie thrusts this blunder shamelessly expecting the audience to simply accept it with no questions asked. The ending aims to instill sympathy, but it fails even at that. I'm not one to write unnecessarily long reviews (like so many who comment in this site), so I'll leave you with this—District 9 was an experience that entertained a little and over-hyped a lot. <br/><br/>And so, I was a prey, yet again, for the overwhelming hype. By skimming reviews for this film, I've actually came across words by such magnitude as ""masterpiece"", ""amazing"", ""epic""etc. What a shame. I realize that every person has his/her own tastes and preferences, but when I see a movie of this caliber get 10/10 (perfect score) by so many people, there's something wrong in the world."

","I have to admit I was sucked in by the TV commercials for this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It didn't take long to link the events of this film with the realities of many parts of our world. The aliens are the oppressed, and, realistically, the earthlings have interned them in camps and allowed them to create a dystopic society. They feast and are feasted upon by the exploiters. Like the Native-Americans and many other disenfranchised creatures, they have become a nuisance, and the society that is treating them so badly is now going to move them to a ""more convenient"" place. An overzealous public official, the central figure in the movie, gets his jollies by treating the aliens as if they were non-sentient creatures. He does a Steve Irwin kind of commentary as he invades their homes and tries to get them to agree to their relocation. He is so cocky that he doesn't realize that swipe from one these beings could cut him in half. In his stupid recklessness, he infects himself with an alien canister and begins to transform into one of them. The strength of this movie, however, is the ""humanity"" of the aliens. They have personalities. They are not bugs, though they look like them. They love, they fight, they survive in horrid conditions. This is a very complex movie that doesn't go for the cheap thrill, although it does occasionally go too much to the special effects and predictable battle scenes."
"VinS","5","2","7","21 August 2009"," Good action movie, disappointing drama
","Oh, what lofty expectations I had for this movie. I had watched the short ""Alive in Joberg"" on which the movie is based. I had seen the high ratings IMDb users gave the movie. Maybe we would we see how the world reacts to aliens. Maybe we would we see how we learn from them, communicate with them and try to reach others from their planet. An intellectual discourse on what would be the most massive discovery ever, that aliens exist.<br/><br/>And then it turned out to be just yet another action movie with a very flimsy plot. Aliens were trivialized and we are led to believe they are treated how say a million of North Koreans seeking asylum in South Africa would be. There are stock characters in the movie. A stereotypical 'bad guy' who of course has a final climactic encounter with the hero. A random Nigerian warlord who is allowed to freely live with the aliens and profit from them. Really? Is the international community so disinterested in aliens? The most puzzling thing of all is how can these extremely intelligent aliens with literally weapons of mass destruction let themselves be bullied by humans. Put that aside as well. The humans want them out. The aliens want to get out. The aliens and humans can communicate. FFS, cant they just ask the humans to shuttle them to the mothership and get the hell out? <br/><br/>OK, forget an intellectual discourse for the moment. Lets make the whole thing very narrow in scope. What do we have? The initial half of the movie is actually quite well done. It is a documentary style description of the events starting from the alien landing. After that it is all downhill when the hero vs. humans battle begins. Peter Jackson and Blomkamp run out of original ideas. It's one movie cliché after another. One could be forgiven for imagining they are watching Iron Man reprise at one point. But hey, we are a generation hooked on comic book movies so here's another one for the collection.<br/><br/>Great premise destroyed by a poor storyline."
"d3jean","6","2","7","16 August 2009"," Good Movie But A Masterpiece Hell No
","OK for the last 3 months we all have been curious as to what this movie would be like considering the teaser trailer that played in front of Wolverine was mysterious and didn't give much in the way of this film's plot. So finally after months of waiting i caught this film on opening night wanting to see what all the fuss was about. Everywhere i read people were claiming this was a masterpiece, the second coming of sci-fi, and a classic in the near future. Well everyone what i saw on Friday night was good and watchable but nothing like the praise this has received on the internet and your local paper. First let me get to the good points the CGI was amazing for the budget they had especially the aliens and spaceships that were presented in the film (My personal favorite was the ship rising from under the ground and heading toward the mother ship). Secondly it was nice to see aliens that were sympathetic and who you wanted to see make it to the end of the movie. Lastly the entire third act was action packed and made up for a very sluggish slow-moving first two acts that made you consider wanting your movie back. I'm glad I sticked around. Oh yeah the acting was good all around.<br/><br/>OK now for the bad points as i mentioned the first 50 minutes or so are very slow moving and is done in a documentary style as if your watching something off the history channel. For instance as the main plot is going on with the main characters the film suddenly switches to random interviews with scientists and government officials who explain in vivid detail everything that's going on within the scene you are watching. Other complaints i have is the sickening use of shaky cam during acion scenes which make it impossible to see what's going on. I am so sick of this this shaky cam nonsense it adds nothing to the movie it just simply irritates since you know action scenes can be handled properly like old school Schwarzenegger or Steven Seagal movies who used steady cam and where you could see what was going on. So simply stop using this crappy overrated technique. My last complaint has to do with the ending which felt really unsatisfactory and left wide open for a sequel. Spoiler alert: The end of the film consists of Wilkus the main character getting infected with an alien disease which over a 74 hour process will turn him into an alien. After being taken in by the government and temporarily used for weird experiments Wilkus escapes and goes to District 9 to find a cure. While there he meets Christopher the leader of the aliens and his son who tell Wilkus that they can cure him but only with the cannister that Wilkus accidentally sprayed himself with while trying to evict aliens from District 9. Wilkus tells Christopher the cannister is at his job's basement and they'll half to blow it up to get in to retrieve it. They do this successfully and after a huge big battle in District 9 with the corrupt military and evil Nigerian terrorists Christopher while reprogramming the mother ship to go back to his home planet informs Wilkus that the curing process will take 3 years to complete and the real cure is on his home planet. He tells Wilkus he'll come back in three years and cure him. Suddenly after Christopher leaves the planet with his son title credits come up informing the audience all the aliens on planet earth have been moved to District 10. The final two scenes of District 9 are of Wilkus' wife showing the audience a flower her husband gave her followed by Wilkus as an alien in District 9 showing the audience the flower he gave his wife. The End turn the lights up while people in the audience groan and shrug as they realize they have been ripped off thinking they were seeing a stand alone original movie but instead sat through a 105 minute set up for the sequel inevitably called District 10. So overall decent to watch worth seeing once at the theater or DVD but please please don't believe anything these nerdy bloggers have to say on the internet proclaiming this is a masterpiece because it isn't. It's a good movie overblown into something it is not aka The Dark Knight. So to all you nerds out there get a life your overuse of words like masterpiece and classic to describe every movie that comes out makes you seem like the nutcase you really are and makes your arguments seem not only childish but really irrelevant. Make your own mind up as to whether you liked a movie or not don't just listen to the podcasts on the internet and think they are the end all be all. When you do that then i will take your word on movies seriously and you can be a legitimate moviegoer again. Sorry bout the tirade i just had to let it out."

Sharlto Copley clearly deserves a nomination as best actor.<br/><br/>The special effects/sound etc all work brilliantly to create a world and a situation that is (if one were to think a bit) so unlikely as to be nearly impossible; yet the movie manages to immersively grab you and not let go for two hours that seem more like twenty minutes.<br/><br/>On a (relatively speaking) shoestring budget of 30 million bucks Peter Jackson has produced a masterpiece here; I only hope that the inevitable sequel lives up to the quality of part one!"

","What a brilliant way to make a science fiction film like this! There are so many interesting parts for me to discuss, and I will try not to miss anything. To be honest, I am impressed by both the content and the form, which is rare in such an alien film, but this is no doubt a surprise to me in a good way.<br/><br/>Although this is a pure science fiction, the form appears to be a documentary film. All the events are recorded on camera, and so are the interviews of people participated in the subject or not. On the other hand, the director leaves no arguments in debating whether the story is true or otherwise, and that is one good way to make it almost real. However, I don't think this documentary form is just meant to mislead the audiences, I suppose, moreover, the narrative method is ironic contrast of people who only care about themselves and believe in things they want to believe. As we can see, the nature of human beings is nothing superior to the aliens, yet we regard ourselves as victims while some of us keep hunting them down. No wonder there are so many science fiction films describe that mankind will eventually be destroyed by ourselves if we still being so greedy and selfish.<br/><br/>Wikus was the leader of the moving project in the beginning, but he soon got infected and arrested by their own people for experimental test. After escaping from the experimental center, he had no choice but to hide in his alien friend's house he disrespected for the most of the time. Then, the turning point is when Wikus was convinced that he could be cured if he helped his friend to get on that floating boat, and there is somehow a way for everything to return to normal. As a matter of fact, this was not so shocking how the story evolved, for that we already knew the ambition of the people who wanted to wipe out all the aliens and the determination to fulfill their ambition. At the end, we ought to be impressed by the heroic behavior Wikus did to help his friend get on the flying saucer and watched it's launching.<br/><br/>I kind of sense that the story is not simply describe the war between mankind and the aliens, moreover, this is a metaphor which suggests human beings always have trouble tolerating those who don't resemble us, and that is not just the case in the history."
"shreejithindia","10","2","8","4 November 2010"," Pure excellence.....a masterpiece !!!!
","District 09 is one of the highly entertaining films with science fiction violence. I got an opportunity to watch this film in theater and reached onto a fully satisfying conclusion. Neill Blomkamp was really good with his first big budget work. I never heard the name of this guy before because his work with computer-generated effects were not much known overseas. I mainly preferred watching this film in theater because it was an instant hit in the country and was produced by Peter Jackson. I do believe that Blomkamp could become one of the best directors of the science fiction genre in the upcoming period of time and within a decade we can count him among the science fiction legends like Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and George Lucas.<br/><br/>Talking about the movie i can say that it is one of the best, flawless science fiction films ever made. Credit directly goes to Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell (writers) for creating such a classic. The plot of the film was one of the major strengths due to which it was widely acclaimed.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned it deals with the invasion of a distinct population of maggot-like humanoids to earth. A slum-like area called the District 9 is allotted to them to stay and survive. The defense forces consider it a golden chance to conduct various studies and researches on them (to know very well about their strengths and abilities), and on the other hand the locals hate their stay. The plot takes a twist when the lead actor unknowingly comes under the contact of alien biotechnology and gradually some bizarre changes start taking place inside his body.

","District 9 has shown us that a first-time writer-director can make a great film if he has the talent. A mysterious alien spaceship flies over South Africa and freezes in midair. After a while, several people inspect it and find prawns, shellfish-like aliens whose appearance will remain in your mind forever. Agents of MNU steal their advanced weaponry to use for their own benefit. Eventually, one of those agents has his DNA contaminated with that of the prawns. He begins to turn into one, losing teeth and growing claws. Wikus, the name of the worker, escapes to the one safe place for him now: District 9, where the other prawns are kept. The prawns then make a deal with him that if he can help them fix their spaceship, they will find a cure for him. The movie is terrifying throughout. Gory as it is, it is never gratuitous and many people will be impressed by the semi-documentary aspect of the film. The ending is emotional and, thankfully, refuses to take the route of satisfying and pleasing. Not only is this an unbelievably original sci-fi flick, but it also mixes politics and aliens in an effective way. The gore can be over-the-top, but once you get past it, District 9 proves to be a wonderful addition to the sci-fi genre."

","Filmed with what at least appears to have been a fairly cheap video camera, in order to give D9 a more documentary feel - and yet injected with all these impressive CGI effects. This unique combination is primarily what sets the movie apart from the plethora of increasingly dull sci-fi films made in recent years. That, and the manic direction and D9's off-the-wall events.<br/><br/>D9 starts off very much in a Christopher Guest mockumentary vein (""For Your Consideration"", ""Waiting for Guffman"" etc.), it's a sci-fi but with obvious leanings towards comedy. Not particularly funny, but definitely interesting. Johannesburg as the setting was a refreshing change.<br/><br/>As unusual as it is, the story has a major flaw: first we are watching a sci-fi comedy, with a highly animated central character, but somewhere around the half-way mark the film starts getting increasingly serious, this inexplicable ""change-of-heart"" in D9's mood being underlined by a quasi-Mid-East-sounding soundtrack doodling melodramatically in the background. So now we're suddenly expected to take this man seriously? The same character who looked as if he had escaped from a Loony Toons cartoon just 45 minutes earlier. To expect that kind of switch from the audience is asinine. But then, of course, most viewers are easily manipulated sheep."

","Shot partly in documentary fashion, this sci-fi epic tells the story of an alien ghetto that is being emptied by the government. It plays out like the Nazis invading the Warsaw ghetto. Set in modern-day South Africa, the alien ghetto has been in place for nearly 30 years, following the arrival on Earth of a disabled space ship. The aliens are truly frightening to behold, but (not surprisingly) they prove more human than the humans seeking to eradicate them, like so many American Indians. One individual caught up in the eviction process becomes part-alien (see the movie) and ends up fighting on the side of the aliens (""Avatar,"" anyone?) when the eviction procedure turns into a massacre. A one of a kind movie, highly believable and with some of the best CGI I have seen ""Starship Troopers."" A must-see, but for adults only. Plot bears some resemblance to ""Alien Nation."""

","Walking out of the theater I felt like I had watched The Terminator or Jaws for the first time in my life. It is a movie that will be loved for decades from now. People will look back at Neill Blomkamp's career and still remember this fondly. I felt very lucky in the theaters for the start of this director's what will be wonderful career. <br/><br/>While the story is none too subtle it is quite entertaining. It was a great story of social commentary that works even if you know nothing about the history of South Africa outside of Lethal Weapon 2. <br/><br/>The effects are spectacular. Excellent use of CGI. Not overdone but enough to create the world around them. <br/><br/>What really strikes me is that this is Blomkamp's first turn as a director. Most director's first movies are, while entertaining, still flawed in some way. Even the greatest of directors have some flaws in their early movies, usually that are overlooked by the quality of the rest. District 9 appears like it was made by a veteran director of forty movies. <br/><br/>In the coming years people will look at Blomkamp's career and think about how wonderfully he has made his movies.

This really is a brilliant sci-fi flick with excellent development and has a engaging story and character to go with it. When I saw the trailer to this movie, I was expecting some good things from it but it really did beat my expectations in almost every level. The movie has slight flaws though, and something are just not answered very well like the reason why the aliens came to earth in the first place being one of them.

"btm1","7","2","9","3 March 2011"," Aliens and apartheid - fascinating science fiction
","One of the things I liked about ""District 9"" is its avoidance of typical science fiction film clichés. As in many science fiction movies, a huge flying saucer arrives and hovers over a major city. No, not New York or Washington, but post-Mandela Johannesburg, South Africa. Another premise that shows the writers, Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, are not dealing with clichés is that the aliens in the saucer are emaciated and unorganized. <br/><br/>The South African government helps these aliens get out of their ship and cordons off an area in the city for their use. They call that area ""District 9"". Over many years, the South African population grows disenchanted with the aliens because of their disgusting habits and dependence on the public for their housing and sustenance (they consume large quantities of cat food.) District 9 has become a disreputable slum. So the government decides to relocate the aliens to a different area (District 10) far outside of the city. This is obviously a reference to South Africa's apartheid past, when blacks were required to live in designated townships. <br/><br/>The story is told in a documentary reality TV style, with never-shown videographers following the actions of the bureaucrat assigned to manage the transfer of the aliens that we the audience are supposed to be watching. Like other films and TV series of that genre (""The Office"" comes to mind) we soon see scenes in which that format no longer works. One could imagine that the documentary film makers had filmed a staged reenactment of what had happened, but as we do with ""The Office,"" it is easier to just ignore the discrepancy. <br/><br/>The second half of the film does have some clichés, notably a super-powerful and nearly indestructible machine that is controlled by movements of the person inside it. <br/><br/>Although the first part of the film is good drama, it eventually turns into an adventure film with violence, weapons, and chase scenes. The capabilities the writers give to the alien technology is perhaps inconsistent between the early scenes and later ones. <br/><br/>But the film accomplishes what many good science fiction novels and short stories of the past have done in giving us some philosophical issues to ponder over."

There's a sort of 'over the top' kind of feel to his performance but it works oh so well. And the film's documentary element also gives it a great spin.<br/><br/>For a Sci-Fi, this film is easily amongst the best I have ever seen and that's saying a lot.

","District 9 is certainly not what I expected. Hoping for another action packed, effects laden, edge of your seat sci-fi epic, I was sorely disappointed. Even scenes from the previews implied that there might be some kind of intense confrontation on a grand scale between humans and aliens. Instead, we are again being lectured, better yet indoctrinated, as to what's proper and what isn't. It was like sitting through the remake of the Day the Earth Stood Still all over again. The theme of ""man is bad"" is really starting to wear thin. How many more seminars on politically correct behavior is the movie industry going to have us sit through?<br/><br/>Nearly the first half of the film is told in a ""you are there"" perspective like ""Cops"", hand-held camera and all. We accompany security forces as they raid a squalid ghetto in Johannisburg, South Africa and begin evicting the alien residents who came to Earth some twenty years ago. Humanity has grown intolerant of them and they are to be resettled in a new and improved concentration camp. The aliens of course resist and are gunned down at the slightest provocation.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley stars as Wikus van der Merwe, the head of the conglomerate MNU's security forces. He is assigned the task of cleaning out the alien ghetto and we see from the start that it is a job beyond his capabilities. He stumbles, fumbles and bumbles and eventually is exposed to a fuel the aliens have been synthesizing for the last twenty years. He immediately begins to mutate into an alien and of becomes the target of a huge manhunt, so now the tables are turned.<br/><br/>This reminded me of Vic Morrow's scene in Twilight Zone the Movie where he faces the Ku Klux Klan. Van der Merwe is now dependent on the aliens for his survival. As the film reaches it's conclusion, the pace does pick up. There are shoot outs, crashing spaceships and great CGI effects. The alien ship which has hung menacing above the city for decades leaves Earth and Wikus completes his transformation.<br/><br/>Another big problem for American audiences is the fact that the cast are all unfamiliar faces. Their accents and speech is so Afrikaaner, that subtitles are used even when they're speaking English. There is nothing unique or original here. The movie is like ""Cops"" meets ""Alien Nation"". The special effects are superb but alas are wasted on such a trivial, mind numbing endeavor."

","Sci-fi movies are my favorite. They fill me with such mysterious and the idea that we are not really alone out there and that we are being watched. The idea of alien invasion has been adapted by many films. Although they try to be different, they all end up feeling the same. Neil Blomkamp takes the idea of alien invasion in a way I have never seen it before. This film presents aliens as the ""poor"" and humans as the ""rich"" , and to be honest, it is extremely refreshing and makes District 9 of if not my favorite sci-fi film and it feels like a one of a kind movies. <br/><br/>The movie takes place Johannesburg (where you guessed it) aliens come down and instead of killing every human like the typical alien movie, these aliens are weak. They are sick, and don't have the ability to take off and go back to their home planet. So the humans decide to build them a camp and have them live there. The camp is getting old and rundown, so they try to get the aliens to go the new camp, but with the uprising of human gangs in the alien district that have possession of alien weapons it isn't so easy. We follow Wikus Merwe portrayed by Sharlto Copley as he is tries along with many members of the Multi- National United (MNU) to try to move all the aliens to this better camp. I can see why Blomkamp has Copley in all of his movies he basically became his character. It was so easy to understand his emotions that it almost seemed like he was portraying a real character. His best moments are with Jason Cope who voices the main alien Christopher Johnson. It is very hard to give a whole lot of character depth in a role like this, but Cope does a amazing job. He makes the alien seem like more of hero than the main character. Although they are supported by a decent supporting cast they aren't really that big of a part of the film which makes me a little disappointed because there could be such amazing development with the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>Although the acting and story are superb the real star of this film is the screenplay. Although a screenplay for a movie like this is very hard to make Blomkamp couldn't of done it better. All the events flow so well together, from moments with Johnson and Merwe talking to heart pumping action scenes, this film feels like everything is just placed perfectly together and personally makes this one of my favorite screenplay.<br/><br/>I should talk about the fantastic cinematography and editing, but instead I am going to talk about the action scenes. Of course this is a sci-fi film with aliens that have destructive weapons, so there has be some cool actions scenes and this movie delivers on that front. Although there isn't a ton of action scenes ,the ones that the film has are amazing and they are all made better by the kick ass special effects and all the weapons are great and well designed. When I mean the weapons are great I mean they are fantastic, some of the best weapons I have ever seen in a film. From a electric gun that explodes people on contact to a giant mech with mini guns and the ability to stop enemy bullets and throw them back at its attacker, this movie feels like a big action movie except with less actions and a amazing story.<br/><br/>Overall District 9 will be remembered in history for not only being one of the best debut feature film ever, but for being one of the most clever, brilliant and one of the best sci-fi movies in history. This movie makes me feel the right emotions at the right time just because of how well it all flow together it almost seems like the movie was meant to be great, the second the screenplay was done. The bottom line is this. Whether you like sci-fi films or no, you can not deny the effect it has had on sci-fi films. I know that Blomkamp isn't at the best point of his career right now but, I still have faith and firmly believe that we will being getting a film just as good as district 9 in the near future.."

"DonaldDooD","4","1","3","19 July 2014"," An Unchallenging, Simplified View of Racism Leaves Much to Be Desired
","After I watched District 9, if you told me that it was considered a decent, lesser-known sci-fi action film, I'd be moderately impressed. The setting of the South African ghettos is unique for this genre and well-executed, and the CGI is quite good for the time and budget. But I can't disagree more with those claiming its one of the best sci-fi films of all time. To say it is an accurate allegory of human racism is like saying Salon Kitty exposes the flaws of the Nazi regime.<br/><br/>Prejudice does not grow on trees. People don't hate everyone that's different from them. There are centuries of cultural evolution and conflict behind people's perceptions. While some people see other races and ethnicities as dumb or savage, they rarely treat everyone with disdain. For example, a white person who hates ""ghetto"" culture may find the work-ethic of East Asian nations admirable. Its a complex, important topic that needs to be addressed to break the barriers between us, yet District 9 contributes nothing to the conversation but villainous stereotypes.<br/><br/>As far as I know, the Prawns have done nothing to even agitate the human race. Yet the South African government, completely unimpressed by the appearance of intelligent life from a distant galaxy, does not show a shred of humanity. They send the Prawns to ghettos, kill them in weapons tests, and even abort their unborn without a second thought. They are just as bad as the Nazis, but without centuries of prejudice to support their actions. Yet barely any time is devoted to explaining this xenophobia. The government is evil for the sake of being evil, and is thus unrelatable to prejudices seen today.<br/><br/>Just because the film brings up racism in a new context does not mean it should get a participation trophy. Its ultimately as safe as an episode of Sesame Street, allowing its audience to pat themselves on the back, never thinking of their own prejudices. Nor would they think in Neill Blomkamp's next film, Elysium - a practical remake of District 9 with changed nouns, discussing economic division only deep enough for it to be a plot point. The 10% of the world could pat themselves on the back, knowing that, no matter how greedy they can be, at least they're not the 1%! <br/><br/>I suppose it can still hold up as an action film to some degree. But when all the praise seems so misplaced, its hard to ignore the bad world building and stock, two-dimensional characters. Its an alright popcorn flick, but even among action films, you can find many with better plots and characters. I personally wouldn't even recommend it to sci-fi fans, who usually seek films with intelligent writing, not a generic action movie with a sci-fi coat of paint. A lot apparently liked District 9, but I feel that's settling when we deserve much more depth than black-and-white, good-vs-evil."

The impression I got from the first minutes was: what an absurd storyline! I mean, aliens living (legally) on Earth feels too eccentric for my taste. However, as the movie goes, I got used with the idea. In fact, in some scenes I felt sorry for some invaders being so badly treated by humans. The movie DOES have great special effects, but its lack of thrilling moments made me feel like I was seeing another science fiction blockbuster. It's too few of a thriller. Acting is just normal. Also, maybe a better writing would've left me more satisfied. In the end, ""District 9"" is nothing more than an average flick."

","The presentation of this movie is horrible. I wasn't even sure I could survive watching it after watching the first 20 minutes . I watched Elysium right before this one and enjoyed Elysium despite the worse reviews. The first half of District 9 feels like a history lesson or like watching the news (which is quite boring in my opinion). Second half of the movie was better, but honestly not worth the excruciating first hour. The aliens are kind of creative, and the plot isn't too horrible but it's not acted out well. I didn't notice any good music tracks which is too bad, because good music can really add solid emotion. In fact, even the emotional parts felt really bland in this movie. I would never watch this movie a second time."

","An alien mother ship hovers over Johannesburg, South Africa, for several months without any contact being established. Finally, humans manage to get inside and discover almost 2 million sick and malnourished ""prawn-like"" aliens. They are resettled on the outskirts of the city and soon their compound begins to resemble a slum. Eventually, the decision is made to relocate them further away and an armed group is sent in to evict them. Trouble immediately follows. So much for the basic plot. That said, at first I wasn't really sure what to think about this film. It has some parts which are extremely slow and some of the action was almost equally boring. The special effects were very good. Some of the best I have seen in awhile. However, apart from the acting of the lead character, ""Wikus Van De Merwe"" (Sharlto Copley) the overall acting was pretty much non-existent and quite honestly failed to impress me. Even so, from what I understand it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards and won the Saturn Award for ""Best International Film"". It has also made over $115 million. So apparently there are a lot of people who liked this movie. And while I didn't necessarily dislike it, I just couldn't bring myself to get that enthused with it. No doubt many will disagree with me and that's fine. Be that as it may, this is one of those films that audiences who love CGI and action will probably really enjoy as it has both in spades. So if that's the case then I would strongly recommend this movie. But for those who like science fiction with a more ""human element"" then it's possible that they may find it to be a bit disappointing."

","Director Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa.District 9 is a science fiction thriller that was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell that features Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James. The story of the film pivots on the themes of humanity, xenophobia and social segregation.<br/><br/>It's been 28 years since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from the skies, nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our society. Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome intruders, a private company called Multi-National United is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But the organization is less interested in the aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate, the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man on the planet. Ostracized and isolated, Wikus retreats to District 9 in a desperate bid to shake his dogged pursuers.<br/><br/>Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, the film has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science- fiction classic.That is one reason why it is a must-see film."

","Aliens arrive on Earth, and are treated as unwelcome refugees. Advanced technology doesn't necessarily make all of the aliens intelligent: the majority in the ship are ordinary workers. The film is set in South Africa. The similarity to apartheid is obvious but well observed, and serves to heighten the parallel between racism and ""speciesism"". The way the relationship develops between the central character and the senior alien should make us feel humble as mere humans, as Christopher was clearly the nicer guy. After watching this film, do you know who you can trust? The ending should bring a tear to the eye. All in all, the best sci-fi film since ""Dark Star"", and just as thought provoking."
"estreet-eva","6","1","3","5 December 2011"," Visually stunning by-the-numbers science-fiction-as-social-commentary.
","District 9 is very much in the tradition of what kept Star Trek from being an obscure, short-lived sixties television series ? discussing incendiary social issues in the context of fantastical alien stories. Here space aliens stranded on earth are saddled with derogatory nicknames, penned onto scrub land and harassed by the government. It could also be the story of native Americans, Palestinians, Eastern Europeans during World War II, Australian aborigines among many, many others. Given the South African setting the most specific reference is to Apartheid and the film must have particular emotional resonance in that country as well as many others on the African continent subjected to colonialism. Beyond being a technical marvel (somehow the movies solves the common problem of real actors not appearing to actually be looking at the CGI creatures when they share scenes) the film captures the techniques of oppression with great fidelity. The government?s representative trying to move the aliens, Wikus, from their squalid encampment to something more like a concentration camp (as he later admits) provides a running narrative for the press explaining what may seem like oppression and harassment is really in their best interests. He uses the threat of taking away their children to gain their compliance in the context of ?only doing what is best for the children?. Inevitably, Wikus is infected with alien genetic material and begins a transformation so that he can eventually come to understand things from their perspective. Here the visuals become less impressive as Wikus follows the physical transform patter of the original ?The Fly? (one arms turns alien first) and the remake of ?The Fly? (his fingernails start to fall off and he starts eating unpleasant things). As you realize from early in the film he winds up finding on the alien?s side. This predictable story line (shared by Disney?s ?Pocahontas?, James Cameron?s ?Avatar?, Kevin Costner?s ?Dances With Wolves? among many others) is one of the film?s weaker points as is a lack of characters that we can care about (the only sympathetic characters are aliens who are too, well, alien, to gain much audience sympathy). See it for the movie-making skill but not so much for the story."

","Just brilliant, this film is the best viewing i've had in ages. I love the attention to detail, the realism is enviable in both the special effects and the documentary style. The parallels with racism and apartheid come through really well and you really connect with the extra terrestrial life forms (prawns!-they've even given them a derogatory name). The mental transformation of the lead character is full of beautiful irony. I seriously cant find fault in this movie and will be looking out for more films made by this production team.

","The first genuine science fiction masterpiece I have seen, as many critics have already said, District 9 really is the unsung hero of our time. With Avatar having stolen the sci-fi hot spot, while it is still a brilliant movie, Peter Jackson's District 9 is in every way a superior film.<br/><br/>The first half of the film incorporates an extremely realistic documentary-like feel, all about the fact that aliens have taken refuge on earth for many years. The second half is more focused on the main protagonists, Wikus and Christopher Johnson, but retains a realistic feel and has a larger emotional feel. Despite this divide in the style of the film, it all felt natural and the documentary-style was done seriously and added to the suspense of the main plot, creating a unique kind of film I have never seen before. It adds a grittiness to the world of the film, even to the point where I believed the events of the film were very possible.<br/><br/>The story itself is outstanding. Peter Jackson intended to show human beings in a truthful light. Upon their arrival on earth, rather than giving the aliens temporary shelter and help them leave the planet, as humans would the government became obsessed with alien technology and intended to harness their superior weaponry for warfare. As for the aliens, or 'prawns' as they are nicknamed, they were given relatively comfortable homes for several years. But the story opens with Wikus (the protagonist) being assigned to evict the prawns from District 9, into a concentration-camp-like area where the prawns would be isolated from humans. Harsh? Oh yes, and the events of the film kick off from here. Iwon't reveal anything as it really is a film you have to experience, but the pacing of the film finally picks up as the main story begins. The story tackles the issues of corruption, trust, betrayal and cruelty as well as the emotional struggle Wikus is forced to deal with. I loved the fact that the second protagonist is a prawn named Christopher, as well as his young son, who have been planning something for a long time. <br/><br/>As for the special effects, the film truly is perfect. The prawns are 100 per cent convincing as creatures, as well as the technology and prawn space craft. With some beautiful shots of South Africa, District 9 is in the shadow of Avatar. It deserves to be in the light."

","Review Three: District 9<br/><br/>A very original film from Blomkamp, District 9 is the film everyone was talking of in 2009. A brilliant mix of a pseudo-documentary and an alternative action thriller, this slow starting film turns into a spectacular display of both writing ability and directive talent. The first feature length film by Blomkamp based of a short he wrote years earlier does anything but bore its viewer. <br/><br/>Even in our extremely slow opening sequence, it's hard to ignore the charming lead Wikus (Copley) with his entertaining mannerisms and strange behaviors. As unrealistic as he can get, it's hard to deny an emotional connection to this well built character. By the end of this film, you'll explore every emotion with him and the so called 'prawns'. Prawns are ironically, very much the most realistically deep characters. <br/><br/>Visually, little is flawed. While these aliens don't look real, it's easy to accept them, as it's likely due to our contexts which originally denies their appearance as satisfactory. The so called UFO is stunning, as are many of the commonplace effects (explosions and the likes). The few flaws are easily overlooked, such as the aliens not being as blurry as the shots they sometimes appear in front.<br/><br/>Some scenes are harder to watch than others, and you may find yourself laughing one moment and then averting your eyes the next. As a demonstration of human emotion, this film shows how to achieve any.<br/><br/>Despite the movie being spectacular, I can honestly say I have no craving to repeat viewing it any time soon. The film is often hard to watch, often strange and never predictable. Every twist and turn will leave you hanging closer to the edge of the seat.<br/><br/>As a popcorn film, or a film to make one happy, this film scores a low 3/10. If you're willing to let go and admire the well written story, deciphering it as you go, then it easily becomes an 8/10. Hollywood follows formula to make viewers comfortable, but District 9 puts most alien involved films to shame, and through construction of characters, environments and stories, you'll feel uncomfortable with many other alien films from here on in. District 9 has a spark which not many films have. Highly recommended. A SOLID 8/10"

","When i saw the trailer i wasn't much into it. But 6 months later i bought the DVD and i really was taken a back.What I expected from DISTRICT 9 was miles off, the film painted an interesting picture of aliens that have not invaded the U.S as you might expect but have invaded the city of Johannesburg in South Africa and have taken refuge in the city's slums.<br/><br/>The film was different in terms of the setting, where instead of another major American city we have the capital of South Africa, where you get a completely different culture of people that are your typical South African and that along with the setting is what sets this film way apart from other Sci-Fi films.<br/><br/>Being a resident of South Africa myself and I'm also familiar with a lot of South African films and actors, I have never seen any of the actors in this film before but they give stellar performances throughout.<br/><br/>However, I have spoken to people that didn't like this film and I've spoken to people that did like it, which almost makes it difficult for me to recommend to others, I did like the film of course but my expectations were different, but overall I thought the direction was great the story was also great as well as the acting and the action scenes were thoroughly entertaining but if I was to recommend it I would say lower your expectations because this is the kind of film that will get mixed reactions, so it will be best to watch it with an open mind."

Who is Sharlto Copley?? my god, where has the film industry been hiding him? he is simply amazing, very natural acting with a twist of fabulous humour and with the brilliant direction of Neill Blomkamp at the helm, will Seth Effrica become the new Hollywood? They most certainly have done a vastly better job than the usual big guns in the industry.

"HarleyD07","7","1","3","6 February 2010"," Not What I Expected!
","The movie ""District 9"" is done in a documentary type style and is about aliens that find themselves stranded in Johannesburg, South Africa. The alien ship breaks down over Johannesburg and remains stationary over the city for about three years. Without any activity from the ship occurring during this period, the humans decide to cut their way into the ship. Countless malnourished and sickly aliens are removed from the ship and brought to Johannesburg.<br/><br/>Over several years, the interaction between the locals and the aliens becomes strained. The movie theme of social oppression and prejudice becomes quite apparent when the humans decide to place the aliens in a militarized camp. The camp, which is known as District 9, quickly becomes a shanty town that subjects the aliens to squalor and deplorable living conditions. Crime runs rampant due to a local Nigerian gang having taken control of the camp. Within the camp, cat food becomes the only food that is readily available for the aliens. The gang members use this to their advantage by controlling the supply of cat food. In order to survive, the aliens must trade their weapons and possessions for cat food. As well as being brought to the brink of starvation, aliens are subjected to physical abuse by humans throughout the camp.<br/><br/>Even with the aliens being contained in this internment camp, the locals want ""District 9"" to be moved further away from Johannesburg. Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van De Merwe, is put in charge of evicting the aliens from their homes, such as they are, and move them to a new camp. During the eviction process, Merwe witnesses the murder and abuse of defenseless aliens. At this point, Merwe views this as business as usual. While going from shack to shack within District 9, Merwe is exposed to an alien substance that initiates his transformation into an alien.<br/><br/>What Merwe is subjected to during the next 72 hours, are the vary abuses that he and other humans subjected the aliens to. In order to have any chance of returning to normal, Merwe must befriend an alien that he had attempted to evict from his home. The irony of this situation is that Merwe starts to defend the aliens that he despised a few days earlier. Although partially for self-preservation, Merwe risks his own life to allow his new alien friend to get out of District 9 and to the alien mother ship.<br/><br/>Although done in a different style, the movie ""American History X"" has a similar theme of prejudice and involves one group's hatred for another because they are different. In addition, one of the main characters changes his perspective after a life altering experience in prison. He also befriends someone who he previously despised.<br/><br/>Setting plays an integral part in establishing the theme of the movie. The fact that the alien ship becomes stranded over a city that has a historic reputation for social oppression of minorities was no mistake. The aliens being place in an internment camp by the human majority helped to drive home the theme very early in the movie. Motifs were used throughout the movie to support the message of the theme. The deplorable conditions of District 9 and the abuses that the aliens were subjected to were symbolic of the socially oppressive conditions present in South Africa at one time. Stereotyping of blacks as criminals and whites as the leaders of the camp were additional reminders of the movie's theme.<br/><br/>The theme of ""District 9"" was a complete surprise to me. I didn't read the DVD cover prior to renting it, so I was anticipating your typical alien science fiction movie. This movie was anything, but typical. The message was about as subtle as being shot with one of the alien weapons."
"toomey02","10","1","3","4 February 2010"," Great movie- more than just special effects!!
","District 9 started off immediately grabbing the viewer's attention. The film dives into news footage of an alien space craft hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982. The news footage continues to show the outcome of the space craft up until present day. The inhabitants of the space craft were aliens that are later named ""prawns"" as a derogatory term. These prawns were designated to live in District 9, a filthy slum. The news footage then switches to interviews with staff and friends that knew Wikus Van De Merwe (actor Sharlto Copley), an MNU field operative. Interviewees exclaim their disgust and shock of the actions of Wikus. Wikus was in charge of evicting the prawns from District 9. <br/><br/>Wikus is ambitious, kind, and wishes the prawns no harm. The viewers have no idea what Wikus could have possibly done to upset his friends, co-workers, and the general public that were interviewed. Eventually Wikus finds himself in a battle for human dignity. Wikus is forced out into a world that is not necessarily on his side. He must choose his path even though many do not agree with him. <br/><br/>Wikus experiences many struggles throughout the film, internal and external. Wikus is intent on sparing as many prawns lives as possible, even though the general public does not like the prawns as many of them have performed unfavorable acts. In time Wikus finds himself on the side of the prawns as his fellow MNU co-workers attempt to experiment on Wikus after an unfortunate accident. Wikus finds himself fighting for his life throughout the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Wikus's experiences are beyond himself, representing a universal theme; similar to the theme in the film Avatar. Both movies reveal the struggle between the human race and another species. This is only the theme on the surface; a much larger theme is represented. The visual effects in District 9 are incredible. The prawns have a unique appearance, not like any alien that we have ever seen. The setting is perfect to give the feel for a true ""slum"" that the prawns live in. The lighting exemplifies this in the film. When viewing District 9, the scenery is dark and dirty. The shacks have hardly any light. On the other hand, the MNU building is bright and white. This contrast reveals subtly the difference between the two races, human and alien. Another affect that was used in the film is hand held cameras. In the interviews and during the evictions, the use of hand held cameras was used to give the viewer the feel that it was real. <br/><br/>Overall, District 9 was an excellent movie. It surpassed my expectations that it was only going to be great special effects and action. The film not only had action and great special effects but it had a storyline with a universal theme that everyone can relate to. There are several themes in the film that anyone can relate to; it is open for interpretation. My interpretation is that you have to do what is right no matter what the majority thinks."
"phenomynouss","10","1","3","30 January 2010"," A movie about people
","It sounds simplistic, but really, in a situation that was so set up, the movie did spectacularly in focusing on the main plot line while keeping the background story adequately explained without overwhelming the main story. Never is there a point where Wikus Van Der Merwe and someone else bring the movie to a grinding halt with expository narrative like ""You know, 20 years ago when this first started..."" The trailers gave us what appeared to be a faux-documentary style, involving a modern-day Apartheid... with aliens. That alone would get my butt in a theater seat. Holy hell.<br/><br/>In a time period where unique and genuinely great and entertaining movies are a scarcity, this one is a welcome blessing. I hate to do this, but I feel forced to; ""Avatar"", nearly $300 million dollars to make has some of the best and most realistic CGI ever. And it has a story a 4th grader would find lame and stupid.<br/><br/>It's story is not unique, not good, not interesting, full of stale cliché's, total lack of surprises, and a tiresome Human-bashing with a glorification of Na'vi culture that is a near perfect mirror for Native American societies before we extinguished them as the evil creatures we were.<br/><br/>This movie, meanwhile, is wholly unique, as much as it can be in a day and age where the audience has seen pretty much everything. The setup is right there: Aliens come to Earth as refugees, and rather than go to the stereotypical places of New York or London or Los Angeles, they end up in... Johannesburg, South Africa.<br/><br/>After the initial awe of first contact fades, these aliens become the source of most all racial hatreds of the local residences. The story is right in front of it: Wikus Van Der Merwe, set up as a doofy, bright-eyed, largely average and sheepish worker for MNU, the company tasked with caring for these aliens (who are revealed to not be very bright, and thought to be proverbial ""worker ants"" of a hive-mind society, or else the slaves/lower classes). The movie begins with a documentary which right away foreshadows exactly what will happen, in a brilliant way that neither draws suspicion nor gives anything away. Wikus seems inexplicably villainized by some of the documentary people for reasons you assume to be due to him being MNU, or being stupid, or making enemies or such.<br/><br/>Turns out, he's married the daughter of MNU's boss, and thus cries of NEPOTISM can be raised when he's put in charge of a vast eviction of the alien inhabitants of District 9. The eviction scenes are where the movie's only humor comes, easy and naturally, as Wikus and a co-worker, and a genial, fat MNU soldier go hut to hut trying to get the aliens (called ""Prawns"") to sign them. Rather than show us every single one, they separate some of them with convenient and brilliantly paced and placed bits of exposition, with documentary-style narrative of how the Prawns have existed, how they're treated over the years, how they've committed acts of violence, and how District 9 has attracted gangsters, primarily Nigerian, and how they exploit the Prawn's love of cat food by selling them the stuff in exchange for alien weapons and technology, though this technology is somehow bioengineered to work only for the Prawns. By the time the end of the eviction scenes comes, you're filled in with huge amounts of information, most from these asides, some from Wikus explaining things to his co-worker buddy.<br/><br/>The chemistry Sharlto has with the two of them is shockingly good, considering he's never acted before, save for a few seconds in Neil Blomkamp's short film ""Alive in Joburg"", which District 9 is actually based upon. His natural charm and humor is a welcome relief from even atrocities such as a Prawn ripping off a soldier's arm, then being shot to death, or a hut full of Prawn eggs being exterminated with a flamethrower, while Wikus jokes that their deaths sound like popcorn popping.<br/><br/>Probably one of the best things about the film is that it doesn't give us a trite, stale, and boring bit of character ""development"" or sudden shocking change or try to make Wikus perfect for the audience's sensibilities (which is exactly what ""Avatar"" does). Wikus curses a lot. Wikus is just as racist towards the aliens as the average person. He regularly calls them Prawns, calls them ""Fookin' creatures"" when accusations are made that he had sex with one of them, he is mean and nasty to some of the Prawns that get unruly or uppity during the eviction, and threatens to take away CJ's son when he throws a lollipop at Wikus's head.<br/><br/>Even when Christopher is trying to help him, Wikus remains racist. It isn't until the end that he comes to realize that Christopher is his friend. Even then, we aren't given any ""big revelation"" moment to show that he's changed. Well... we are, but not in that way! Puns ahoy~! It's violent, gory, has ""foul"" language, and it will make you cry. It is also one of the best movies of the year, potentially of the decade.<br/><br/>And it bears mentioning... Avatar put on a visual spectacle for $300 million that turned out to be a colorful Candyland version of ""Dances With Wolves"" without any of the compelling drama. District 9 more than exceeds it at literally 1/10th the budget. And while there wasn't as much CG, it bears mentioning that the Prawns are ALL CG, and they look just as realistic as any creature in Avatar---perhaps even more so."

","District 9 is a somewhat rare gem. Rookie director Niel Blomkamp and the always faithful Peter Jackson team up and make one of the best science fiction films since James Cameron's Aliens. Sharlto Copely plays an unsuspecting and rude field agent who has been ordered to evict the Aliens from District 9 from which they have been designated to live after landing 28 years earlier, and in the process he finds a can with liquid in it and accidentally sprays himself. This contact with alien fluid quickly turns Copely into an alien and in the process makes him wanted by the government. He has to make peace with the aliens he tried to evict earlier in the day and is now in a crossfire between helping the alien race and keeping himself from being used and killed by his government. An amazing achievement in film-making and an amazing story, acting and awe inspiring visuals, District 9 has once again rejuvenated the quickly dying Science Ficting genre. I'm hoping that they get an Oscar nod for Visuals, Director, and Picture. Very deserving."
"brando647","9","1","3","18 January 2010"," Neill Blomkamp Amazes with First Major Film
","Director Neill Blomkamp's first major film proves that he is a filmmaker worthy of keeping your eye on in coming years. While the trailers intrigued me, I had no idea what to expect from his film until I finally sat down in the theater and was blown away. Part mockumentary, part drama, and part sci-fi/action film...Blomkamp's movie touches on a few different genres and is an exciting run. In the film, an alien spacecraft arrived over Johannesburg, South Africa twenty years ago and the malnourished, confused inhabitants were brought down to the surface to live in a cordoned-off section of the city. Over the years, anti-alien sentiment has risen to explosive levels and the film begins with the corporation responsible for overseeing the aliens beginning an eviction process to move them further from the city. The film follows the character of Wikus Van De Merwe, an agent of the corporation, who is exposed to alien technology and soon begins a horrible transformation that draws the attention of the company, as well as a group of Nigerian terrorists. Wikus is then forced to seek refuge amongst those he's spent his life oppressing.<br/><br/>The film is said to draw many parallels to the apartheid situation from South Africa, but I'm unfamiliar with the history of the topic and therefore was able to watch the movie for what it was. The story covers elements we've seen before and Wikus's transformation is heavily reminiscent of Seth Brundle's in THE FLY (1986) but it's what Blomkamp does with the material that makes it so entertaining. The film begins in the style of a documentary, interviewing Wikus and those close to him (both family and co-workers) as well as experts and historians knowledgeable on the aliens' existence since arriving on Earth. All of this would've been more than sufficient to keep my interest but halfway through the film, it shifts into an action-packed summer popcorn film. It unloads a series of action sequences that keep the audience riveted until the closing credits. Despite the film's $30 million budget (low compared to most other summer blockbusters), the film is brilliantly done. The visual effects of the aliens and their weaponry are seamless and rarely, if ever, feel like CGI.<br/><br/>Just as DISTRICT 9 is Blomkamp's breakout film, it is also star Sharlto Copley's first real acting gig. Considering a good portion of the dialogue was shot was improvisation, Copley does an incredible job. He's charismatic and likable in the beginning as the bumbling Wikus but rises up as a heroic character for the final act of the film and he does a great job throughout. The majority of the remaining cast were minor supporting characters and Copley was the primary driving performance in the film; for a first-time actor, he went above and beyond some of the even more experienced Hollywood stars today. There really isn't anything to dislike about this film and it should appeal to almost anyone."
"wabio","6","1","3","14 January 2010"," Decent, but story had some major oversights
","The movie wasn't bad, but IMO doesn't have much replay value. I'm sure many have asked the same questions I have. Why in heck would intelligent aliens trade advanced weaponry for cat food? Couldn't they just invade the local Coscto? Did they feel that threatened by our 9mm handguns? Is barbed wire kryptonite? Seriously. Also, if they couldn't go home 20 years ago....how are they (all of a sudden) able to fly home at the end? Also. A virus that can transform one species into another? Really? How would you rate a movie where a virus transformed a pig into a monkey? C'mon now.<br/><br/>The story has merit and potential but IMO doesn't succeed in capitalizing on them. Basically, human greed for power and money trumps the rights and well being of the individual, animals, or in this case....an alien race. This basic theme applies to both the MNU and the Nigerian gang, but I think much of this main message got lost in the cinematography."

","Well, I have seen the IMDb rating and the hype before I've seen this ""movie"". I overrated the movie before even seen it. I only decided to write a review, because only hypes can be read here, as reviews that lack of any objectivity.<br/><br/>Luckily I could watch this show for free, before the Hungarian premier. I'm grateful for the guy, who provided me the free ticket for this show, because after this movie, I became very disappointed.<br/><br/>Well, to be honest, the plot started genuine! Finally a scene outside USA or Europe... South-Africa brings us a bit variety. The idea, that an alien ship is coming not to invade the Earth, but because they are starving and waiting to become dead on their ship: that was awesome! And the final action part was spectacular. And that's all the good part of the movie.<br/><br/>Aliens are making alien weapons in the ghetto secretly, but paying unbelievably much ""money"" to get cat-food. They could even claim the food by their alien-weapons, but no. I laughed my stomach out of me... Who's idea was the cat-food anyways? The aliens could run over everything and everybody (due to their numbers), but they still lived in the ghetto after long years. At the end of the movie, our so-called hero slowly transformed/mutated into an alien...<br/><br/>Well, if this is the movie of the year for such many people... maybe I was born into a wrong century."
"kaysmj","8","1","3","1 January 2010"," Skip the first 30 mins
","I'd heard and read nothing but rave reviews for District 9, even from a stranger standing behind me in the Red Box line who whispered ""great pick, you'll love it!"". But within the first five minutes we were convinced that once again, we were completely out of sync with the general movie viewer's tastes. First of all, I don't find documentary style movies particularly enthralling, and secondly, the ghettos of Johannesburg hardly makes for interesting or beautiful cinematography. Add an entire cast of total unknowns with sometimes difficult accents to understand, and we thought are they (people in general) kidding? But for some reason we kept watching, and just as I was about to hit 'stop' on the DVD player (about the half hr. mark), the documentary thing ended and an actual movie with characters and a plot kicked into gear. From there it took off and held us on the edge of our seats throughout the entire rest of the movie. We actually cared and rooted for these insect looking aliens and the interesting relationship with the human(s) that developed. District 9 really is an amazing accomplishment for such a small budget and really deserves the big budget treatment for the inevitable sequel."
"YouHadMeAtDolphins","4","1","3","31 December 2009"," Nice effort, but not that great.
","The film could've cut about 20 minutes from the beginning and skipped the whole documentary bit following Wikus around, as well as all the interview bits describing what kind of a good man he is. Instead, they should've just used news bits to say that, and moved right into the story. The film was trying to balance the weird and strange dry humor of the South Africans in the documentary bits, but all those interviews of the people were completely unnecessary as nobody in the audience cares about what they had to say. The film was relatively low-budget for a sci-fi of its calibre and thus I suppose it needed filler to make it the length it is, otherwise it probably would've been about an hour long, which goes to show you that the filmmakers weren't too confident in the stories involving the characters who are actually in the action. For example, the 2 buddies are able to all of a sudden just smash and grab and escape without too much hassle. That scene could've been much more interesting had it explored more ways to bring out the relationship between the characters, including those in the military and the government, and it would've been nice to have seen much more of the city where the building stands! We don't even really find out how they get to the building! They just show up with an explosion, and that's that. The 2nd half is much better than the first, simply because we get to see much more action and sci-fi of the aliens, the ship, the robot and the computers. The story doesn't even explain how that alien battery liquid could've had the biochemistry to transform into what he is. It just happens, and that's it. The whole scene of the surgery is rather unimaginative, as we all know, if that sort of thing happened they would've knocked him out with drugs and gone right ahead with surgery/experiments. Anyway, overall it's a nice effort, but I wished they had not done the whole interview & documentary thing."

"work1113","6","1","3","27 December 2009"," Mixed Review
","So, after seeing this movie, I actually liked it for the first few minutes after it was over. The next though, was a different story as I began to analyze.<br/><br/>First - if you're a sci-fi lover, you will enjoy this movie, if you are not, you still might actually like it due to the hypothetical and theoretical undertones regarding race, acceptance, ""What ifs"" The story takes a short peak at (What if the extraterrestrials we encounter to the first time and nothing of what we expect) they are lazy, gross, and don't enlighten our society - maybe even less of a race than we are.<br/><br/>So it is even more ingenious that this fill takes place in Johannesburg, one of the most racially and culturally historic place sin our world.<br/><br/>The CGI is absolutely incredible. The story is a little lack-luster, but the special effects are great enough to override the dull story.<br/><br/>The not so great: These aliens in the first few minutes are by far superior in physical strength - but at the end of the movie, they are being pushed around, jailed, and subdued like they can't fight back. I found myself saying ""Comon, fight back aliens! 30 minutes ago you were kicking people to the moon and ripping the enemies arms off"" - half way through the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, this race - that is confined to slums typical of Africa - cant' do much put eat tires and jump all over the place. But all of a sudden, one of the members can make a super fuel and also have a supreme plan for getting his race back to the ship - so, 90 percent of the race cant figure it out, but one dude has all the answers - doest make much sense.<br/><br/>Also - the choice for some dork faced actor for the lead role is awful. I had no sympathy for the guy at all - and I lost interest in what might happen to him - I felt disengaged.<br/><br/>This is a good story as it takes a look at racial confliction and hate, and how unaccepting our society actually is - at a 3rd world level - and then adds some alien weaponry.<br/><br/>Still a good idea - but the story could have been enhanced. If Peter Jackson would have been the director, instead of taking a weak producer role - it might have made a better movie.<br/><br/>The alien weaponry is awesome, but th"
"clauslykkebo","10","1","3","24 December 2009"," Incredible!
","From the start I haven't been taking District 9 very seriously when I first saw the posters in the cinema after watching Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince with one of my best girlfriends this summer. I've totally forgotten about this movie till a couple of days ago and decided to finally watch it. Now I'm sitting here on the couch and really regret my first thoughts about this film. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!<br/><br/>First, I really like the combination of documentary and fiction and in this case it's done to perfection. The only thing which I found a little confusing was the shifts between 'documentary camera' and 'fictional camera' and my mind was thrown a little out of the 'movie feeling'. Though this didn't last very long. You get use to it right away, also I didn't find it as disturbing as in many other films and most people probably wouldn't notice it at all so actually there's nothing to criticize. I can't point out anything about the animations. They are very convincing and composed beautifully with the real scenes and I haven't been able to point out any animation glitches at first hand. You don't sit and think it's 3D animations. The story isn't as unrealistic and 'American' far out as many other alien movies I've seen. The story takes place in Johannesburg and how many other Alien movies have ever done that? Nice idea. Like almost every other movie ever created District 9 also leave the viewer with some unanswered questions like ""How can black liquid fuel mutate a human into a Prawn?"" and ""If the prawn's mother ship where able to move and beam things up by remote why did the prawn had to fly towards it?."" But this isn't something you actually think about when watching the movie so it isn't that big a deal. I can't say anything bad about the actors. They make it really realistic and convincing that there's a 2.3 meter tall alien right beside of them. Also the actors speaking to the camera about Wikus, great work!<br/><br/>What can I say? I've given District 9 10/10 stars because it's a brilliant movie. Peter Jackson has done it again and Clinton Shorter has also done a great piece of work! So to all of you bored by reading this: Put on a smile and watch or re-watch District 9! It's incredible!"

","I will start by saying, if you haven't seen this film yet, do so immediately. I won't spoil any of the storyline, I just advice you to see it.<br/><br/>Now this movie is set in the present or at least the not to distant future. A alien mother ship hovered over the city of Johannesburg in south Africa and the crew was brought down to the city. the ship was malfunctioning and the aliens who knew how to drive it was either killed or refused to reveal their identity. Soon of course the ""temporary"" living areas for the aliens becomes a slum, and can literally be called a ghetto. The movie is shot like it's a documentary and is centered around Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley. now I'm gonna stop here because i don't want to spoil any more.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the CGI is amazing. The movie is incredibly realistic and believable. I really don't know what more to say, it just looks amazing. Only warning is that it's a very adult film. it's not your typical action space adventure. it's a bit gritty and dark but that is what makes it so believable. it will evoke emotions but it's no action adventure, but I'm pretty sure you're aware of that.<br/><br/>All I can say this movie gets a 10/10 from me.And it is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the decade."
"BJBatimdb","8","1","3","22 October 2009"," Something different in scifi
","District 9 is uneven in places but basically a very innovative, enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>The documentary style perfectly suits the near-future world where aliens have visited the planet and been coralled into townships around Johannesburg. Obviously the whole premise is based on Apartheid South Africa's treatment of its native population, and this really gives another level to the movie.<br/><br/>The lead - Wikus Van Der Merwe - is the best anti-hero in any movie I've seen in 20 years. The bumbling fool who is given an important job because of family connections is perfectly played. There are laughs aplenty - particularly if you have any knowledge of South Africa and its inhabitants - and the plot and pacing are really tight.<br/><br/>At the end District 9 does succumb somewhat to Matrix-style shoot-em-ups, but is redeemed by the bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>All in all, a remarkably original and entertaining flick."

I had to watch it several times to know what makes this movie so special. in the beginning you think ""oh no another fake documentary, but the unique script and great play of the actors, makes it so divine to watch.And which would be a greater place for this futuristic mythology to take place, than Johannesburg.

","Firsty, as a South African I actually hate South African cinema. It was always third-rate rubbish in my opinion, lacking the slickness and production values of its Hollywood counterparts. Secondly, I *really* hate films with any hint of shaky camera-work.<br/><br/>So it was with great uncertainty and low expectations that I went to see a film produced in SA that reportedly contained hand-held footage, having only seen the poster beforehand (somehow I've missed any promotions while living in the UK).<br/><br/>How wrong could I have been? Apparently very, very wrong indeed! I'm not going to rehash any plot here, but I'll just say this: if you want your faith restored in cinema, go and see this film! If however you are partially brain-dead, have the intelligence of a 10-year old, or prefer watching moronic action movies, stick with Transformers.<br/><br/>My only grumble is that this movie's success will ultimately be its downfall. Many a good movie's legacy has been ruined by bad sequels, and I can already picture Sony lining up the likes of Bruckheimer or Bay to produce a dire follow-up. Which would be a shame, because this film deserves far, far better."

","After good word of mouth from work and a sky-high average vote, decided to check out ""District 9"" in the theater. Overall it was a mild disappointment given the expectations. Went in knowing very little. Starting out what really bothered foremost was an absolutely grating, idiotic protagonist dumbed down and really single-handedly written as to almost sink the picture. He doesn't think, wails and complains, and mixes what sounded like Australian and Dutch accents on his English all while cussing feverishly. Acting isn't the problem here as newcomer Shalto Copely acts his heart out, but the writing is a joke as writers throw logic and reason to the way-side in exchange for shoot-em-up action and foolishness. Ever watch really bad horror movies where cheesy characters do ridiculously thoughtless things? Well you get that here unfortunately too. Had the protagonist been created more cerebral instead of such a twit the movie would've made it to at least solid footing. It has a fabulous alien concept and rendering as well as a decent plot. Minor grumbles include how one-track the ""evil weapons"" corporation was, the now heavily heavily clichéd in all types of movies single female voice singing screaming ""drama"", and the use of ""News and Interviews"" as sort of a pseudo-documentary which frankly detracts and distracts from story-telling. District 9 had potential to make it to much greater heights as a lot of effort and thought has obviously been put into details of effects, locations, costumes, dialects, languages and sociology of what's going on. It's executed marvelously. But At it's core it's too much of a violent shoot-em running amok - rewriting is needed. Worth a watch though for the spectacle of it all."

","Neil Blomkamp's debut feature film is a sterling effort. The South African director's talents were first noticed when he made short film Alive in Joburg, and it didn't take long for Peter Jackson to hire Blomkamp to both direct and write District 9, a full length version of the aforementioned short. Blomkamp obviously wasn't overawed by the prospect. D9 is one of the freshest and most original sci-fi films to hit our big screens in a very, very long time. With a hint of comedy, a splash of drama and two big cups of action, science fiction has rarely been so rewarding.<br/><br/>With a meagre budget of only $30m you would expect there to be some shortcuts taken with the special effects but wouldn't you know my surprise when I found the CGI to not only be seamless but inventive to boot. The disgusting 'prawn' aliens are a sight to behold, their slimy faces and emotional eyes are perfectly executed and they interact with the actors fluently. I was shocked to learn that no physical effects or makeup were used to create the creatures such was there realistic appearance. Those who have seen Jackson's earlier film Bad Taste will see the definite influence he had on Blomkamp when it comes to the amusingly gory deaths in the final scene.<br/><br/>Lead actor Sharlto Copley has never acted before yet his transformation from bumbling idiot to South African Rambo (via outlaw on the run) is highly believable. The accent can sometimes cause unwanted laughs but I reckon Blomkamp and Jackson knew this already and subsequently turned the joke on us, the choice of humorous dialogue designed to ham up the Efriken accent proves this.<br/><br/>I didn't notice it until I was walking out of the cinema but D9 also features one thing seldom seen in a movie that also features exploding heads and grotesque aliens: a remarkable story. Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell have crafted a tale that incorporates messages of racial discrimination (most apparently the Apartheid) and profiteering, but never do they rub it in our face. Instead they choose to allow the audience to get involved as much or as little as they want. Don't want to think about the issues? Well sit back and enjoy the glorious action. Like a bit of deeper-thinking in your sci-fi's? You're covered too. No-one is left out and this is what will make D9 a long term favourite like genre classics Alien and The Thing.<br/><br/>I wait with baited breath on what Blomkamp decides to do next, but in the meantime directors Michael Bay (Transformers 2), Stephen Sommers (G.I. Joe) and McG (Terminator Salvation) should be taking notes: this is how you entertain an audience.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

A superb production by Peter Jackson with great direction that shows the movie as if it was a National Geographic documentary but it never stops being a real movie.<br/><br/>There isn't just action and amazing, seriously amazing special effects, 'District 9' has an interesting script more realistic than many sci-fi scripts I've seen.<br/><br/>We are not talking about a Hollywood super sci-fi production like 'Transformers' or 'Star Trek', however when it comes to entertaining the public and keeping you at the edge of the seat 'District 9' has nothing to envy those films.<br/><br/>It is not an action movie where everything you see is human fighting aliens non stop and a blood shed, quite the contrary there is a lot of interesting dialog and realistic scenarios, nonetheless you will see some mayor action and very brutal combat.

The creatures are amazing. The effects and realism that they bring is something that is rare upon films these days, and while this film does bring up some memories of other films like Transformers(effects-wise, not quality wise thank god) and Cloverfield, the effects in this film go beyond of those films. The story is a conventional action film, where you have your hero and then the side character, in this case the extraterrestrial, but the film executes the story in a more unique and rare way. The editing, the camera-work, and the documentary style all raise it up above other action/ sci-fi films of this decade. Sharlto Copley gives a great performance, and he creates a character we feel for. The sound effects in this film remind me of the sound effects of Cloverfield. AMAZING!

"mirwais-orbit","9","1","3","16 September 2009"," A great alien movie since Alien (1979)
","I've never seen so many critic films being produced and consumed by the masses as in the last few years. Movies that disseminate political and social issues disguised as action, fantasy or fiction. It's the old story, using allegories and metaphors the audience captures the idea without being blocked by their own prejudices. Disctrict 9 (2009), Watchmen (2009), Cloverfield (2008), V For Vendetta (2005), 28 Days Later (2002), 28 Weeks Later (2007), X-Men (2000)... are some of the last examples of important subjects discussed and disguised into pure entertainment. That's really clever.<br/><br/>Disctrict 9 is pure entertainment, but also a very different way to feel how humans can be so mean and cruel. The subject here is not about aliens or the probability of any invasion (even if it can also be a probability), but yes to discuss what's the worst of us. For sure the movie is a clear reference to what happened in South Africa in late 40's and what is called Apartheid, but just replacing black people for aliens. But if you replace again aliens for any kind of people or community, the main subject would not change in any way comparing to all that's happening and ever happened around the world. That's why this movie can be entertaining, but also a very interesting way to discuss current matters.<br/><br/>The movie itself takes the primal idea of movies such The Blair Witch (1999), REC (2007) and Cloverfield (2008), and also from games like Halo and Half Life. Like those movie references, there're no familiar faces or big names in it, which pumps the reality feeling of the events since everybody is unknown as in fact it would be in reality. There are some moments that you just can't understand why things are happening that way, for example, when Wikus uses the robot armor. That's nonsense, but it doesn't mess with entire movie or the rest of the idea.<br/><br/>District 9, above it all, is a great alien movie that I haven't seen since Alien. Cloverfield is also very interesting, but District 9 intensifies the idea and gives you another point of view of things."

I can't imagine that it would be just sitting there for 20+ years empty so that when the aliens flew up to the ship that they could just leave and no people would be on it...lol</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>what of the views of the humanitarians (which on any subject there are some)?? There was not any pro-alien ideas presented, so the documentary angle did not work in that aspect. </li></ul><br/><br/>Its things like those above, that turn the movie not so good... those issues should be better explained and explored!! If there is going to be a sequel, i hope they explain those flaws... this sci-fi story have a lot of potential!! <br/><br/>Why?? Examples:<br/><br/><ul><li>Its unique... its a different perspective about Humans Vs aliens!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The way the perspective switches from mock documentary style to standard third person certainly contributes to it. ""Real"" news footage and interviewers tell the story in retrospect, as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. I think it all added to the realism of the experience and always manages to stay fresh and surprising throughout. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's about betrayal, loyalty, trust, relationships, and sacrifice. It can actually be pretty deep and thought provoking with many themes floating around. The story is really a fresh, gritty, original concept, which is good to see nowadays. While the creatures can be most readily described as monsters, though they are like us. Family and friendship are still important ideals in their world. The film explores a fine line between human emotions and monsters. With all the selfishness, hatred, and greed within us, maybe we are the real monsters or at least that's how it can be perceived. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Awesome CGI, great action and godlike alien weapons(if you guys ever played Unreal (PC Game), you know what im talking about)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The action is not passed in America... FINALLY!! it was a very good idea placing us, viewers, in another set besides Hollywood!!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The story moves at an incredible pace and the acting... WOW... just awesome, specially the main character Wikus (Sharlto Copley).. he is a revelation and one of the most memorable aspects of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>I recommend it... Sci-Fi fans will definitely enjoy it! I give it 6.5 to 7 stars! Plot holes are a disappointment, but there is no reason to give the movie 1 star only because of that...LOL, if this is a 1 to 3 stars movie than its impossible to rate Dragon Ball Evolution because there is no negative scale on IMDb (Unfortunelly... but you guys get the point)!"

","I, probably like many others was not expecting much from this film - the trailer was very short and the idea was far fetched. The only reason for viewing this film was the high ratings on IMDb.<br/><br/>Wow, was I shocked. The trailer of this film shows a snippet of the actual film, probably accumulating the first 20 mins of the film before we actually get into a great, original, compelling piece of film and artistry! I don't want to give the game away but the idea is new and fresh throughout the whole film. The shooting style is fresh. The South African language is fresh. My only annoyance was the way that the lead character swore. I never want to hear anybody say ""Fooking"" again - in fact, it became comical by about the 4th time. This film has a somewhat unserious tone to it and certainly doesn't take itself seriously.<br/><br/>Overall, 9/10."
"katemhebert","9","1","3","14 September 2009"," Not a feel good movie...
","District 9 is a fast paced movie which introduces you to a main human character that is not entirely likable though generally sympathetic. You also identify a specific alien and through him find more 'humanity' in the otherwise animal-like aliens. Through the human's story we learn the basic background about the alien arrival and follow his experiences leading a team that plans to move the aliens.<br/><br/>The movie is not filled with suspense, you can see where things are going pretty easily and not too much surprises the audience but there is good deal of yickiness and goo and a feeling of tension and urgency. You do not need to be a science fiction or alien fan to enjoy this movie. The story is extremely subtle in its commentary. There is an obvious apartheid comparison but if you have kept yourself informed about African history and refugee camps there and around the world you will draw comparisons between the horrible things that are done to and by the aliens and humans that live with/near the camps and real life events. If you aren't interested in the social commentary the movie moves quickly and has action and ends with a giant question mark leaving the opening for your own conclusions or possibly a sequel.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be unsettling and still entertaining. I would highly recommend it to any but the most squeamish people."
"snaki3","9","1","3","14 September 2009"," Disctrict 9 -
","There is a lot to say about this movie, as it has to be one of the best sci-fi films I've ever had the chance to see. First of all, don't expect it to be some kind of Star Wars or Star Trek not even a common alien movie. This is completely different. The aliens live among human population and they are treated like scum, living in deplorable conditions like a lot of human beings actually live nowadays. So yes, they're aliens, but they're mostly humans with another skin, because they have FEELINGS, which is something that it seems to be always forgot when it comes to this type of movies. Why do aliens have to be cold as ice and appear operating with high-tech machines and computers? Of course they are technologically more advanced than we are, because they come from space with an enormous spaceship, but they act like humans would act if they were in this trouble.<br/><br/>It can't be classified as a drama, because it has a lot of action, but I can't say it's an action film because there's a lot of emotion and depth in it, so it becomes a lot more than only an action movie. What am I talking about, then? I'm talking about a mixture of styles, which makes the experience really unique and helps the personal immersion. Also, I have to add that Wikus is a great character who seems to be a coward at the beginning and ends like a hero, not because he is right with all he does or because he solves ""all"" of his problems (better see the movie to get this), things that don't happen, but because he is, in the end, a strong person and fights for his life and for the rights and lives of others.<br/><br/>My advise? Go see it, District 9 is much more than it seems."

","The first hour of the movie was meant to be funny. I was a funny mockumentary. The accents are very thick..of everyone. (Not all south Africans have such a thick accent, just some.) Vicus was not the brightest...etc.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people are missing the satire/ irony of aliens living in District 9 in South Africa until 17 years ago. Non-white South Africans were forcefully moved from one districts. e.g. district 6 to another district until the 1980s.<br/><br/>These apartheid laws etc. were mostly implemented and followed through by afrikaans people ( white people with the thick accent, Vicus van der Merwe is such a very typical Afrikaans name the other one is Kobus.) The awkward scenes are really funny and meant to be funny. Also the scenes where he gives candies to aliens / pops their eggs is very funny dark humor.<br/><br/>Comedy needs to be added to genre! so make it: Action <> Drama <> Sci-Fi <> Thriller AND comedy<br/><br/>If you don;t get this you might miss a * or ** from the movie and the first half might seem a bit boring.

"raimund-berger","6","1","3","10 September 2009"," Not that bad.
","First off, note that this film mostly consists of standard ingredients we've encountered in so many books and films over time. There's the ghetto situation, inhabited this time by stranded aliens but which you could as well replace with an Indian reservation or a slum of undefined location, the unholy mingling of corporate interests with politics, where the former apparently dominates all, and finally the classic anti hero, a thorough opportunist who, unwillingly, is forced to finally take a stance one way or the other. Then, to provide for the action as well as a personalized look on it, two basically independent events - the forced relocation of the ghetto and the attempt of a chief alien to repair a hidden drop ship and maybe escape earth for good - are thrown together to take us through enough melee to keep our senses busy. That's really the whole story already.<br/><br/>Add to that this being shot in a pseudo documentary style, with the obligatory, constantly swaying and sickening camera, hectic cuts also to pseudo news coverage, pseudo surveillance camera footage, pseudo whatever, and you'd agree that the whole piece hardly deserved mentioning safe maybe some notable special effects. But provided one can stand some heavy handed swear fests and blood splatter, I still think this film offers some nice twists which maybe don't make it a great one but still fairly likable.<br/><br/>One of them is that the lead act is basically an unknown actor but still does really, really well. Don't know about you guys, but I'm so thoroughly tired of big shot Hollywood names of the Christian Bale and Russel Crow kind and their polished but unaffectionate performances that I'm deeply grateful for each fresh face that comes up and does well. This is especially noteworthy because a large part of his job here actually is vocal work. And not some accent he had to master and would go brag about later on talk shows how difficult that was, no rather all the moaning and grunting which make up a large part of the latter half of the film and give credibility to his suffering and turning into the stripped down, reduced human being and creature he finally becomes. And that's no joke. It's his, I'd say totally convincing, inarticulate vocal expressions which give this film some credibility, on the emotional side.<br/><br/>Then, the other nice twist is of course not the suppressed actually being the ""better people"", which is a common theme as well after all. It's also not the opportunistic coward becoming a full human being by being forced into their point of view, as he's abandoned and potentially exploited by his own people and really taken care of only by the supposedly violent underdogs. No, what I'm referring to is that fairy tale theme, where the prince, by a curse, is turned into a frog and will turn back again only after some condition is met which deeply relates to humanity. This is what basically happens here, the (anti) hero being turned into a creature and forced to stay that way for a prolonged period of time, thus being forced to face himself as he really is until ""the curse"" is lifted. This really connects nicely to those age old fairy tales one might remember from childhood and provides for a, well, sweet touch.<br/><br/>So altogether, though really not original in many aspects, I'd still recommend this film as providing some good entertainment albeit severely lacking on the cinematographic side, which seems to be a lost art these days. And as said, at least the lead act saves the show for me. An impressive debut of his, if it was one."

Anyone who paid attention in school knows that Johannesburg is in South Africa.<br/><br/>It's really embarrassing how ignorant most of us Americans are about the rest of the world, if most of us knew even a little about South Africa more may have enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>So listen up fellow ignoramuses.<br/><br/>South Africa which is well known for having had Apartheid, i.e. legal discrimination against blacks, only being outlawed in 1984.<br/><br/>So it's not a stretch for them to treat aliens in the way they did.<br/><br/>This film had comedy, racism, violence, drama, a love story and a happy ending.<br/><br/>What more could you want?"

","After seeing Sharlto Copley in the new Sci-Fi Film District 9, would highly recommend this movie to people who want to see a new well done film. I mention Sharlto Copley because his role is so central to this film that he basically carries the entire film. It is a great performance in any context.<br/><br/>Neil Blomkamp writes & directs this film and it is quite an effort. The film very much starts off as a documentary type of film with Sharlto Copley at the center going into the story of how an alien ship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. It then goes through how humans invade the ship and move the aliens out of it and onto a colony known as District 9. The visuals are so realistic that you'd swear this is the real thing.<br/><br/>The documentary part of the film then smoothly transfers into 2 stories- one involving Sharlto Copley's character getting exposed to alien matter and evolving into an alien, & the other involving a couple of the aliens trying to manufacture fuel so they can leave & go home. There is a cover story for the film as well about the South African effort to relocate the alien colony into District 10.<br/><br/>The film is not done as a typical sci-fi film in that it is gritty and really feels like it is depicting real events. The film always sticks with the base cover story and leaves a wide open door for a sequel. It will be interesting to see if they do one since the main line related to this is ""I will be back in 3 years"".<br/><br/>The film is excellent at drawing characters & stories from different points of view together & relating all of them. In fact the documentary part of this film is done so well that it actually feels like better reporting than the real media can actually do. There are also some other stories & commentary I have not brought into this review. This film has a depth rarely seen in the Sci-Fi film genre."

","Ideologically, the main attraction here is the absolute and savage refutation of the individual-versus-the-corrupt-system cliché – you know, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' and all that. When the anointed leader of the alien-concentration-camp operation (Sharlto Copley as a nondescript bureaucrat, a fascinating and brave choice for an action movie protagonist) starts physically embodying the error of the us-and-them approach to the alien invasion, he is not only deposed from his seat of power, he's sent straight to the basement, where the secret labs are. Not only that, he remains an opportunistic rat bastard almost to the very end of his mutation. Still though, as an allegory it's pretty messy. If producer Peter Jackson wanted this to be his 'Intolerance' – atonement for the unga-bunga racism of his 'King Kong' – then he kind of goofed by making all the African ganglords into grinning cannibals. Rejecting gauzy sentiment is one thing, but those scenes play like Nollywood with a budget, which is the last thing the world needs On the other hand, this is exactly the kind of ideological blind spot that is all over the place in all but the very greatest of classic speculative science fiction, and THAT is the pigeonhole this movie fits best. It's not a metaphor, it's a specific imagined situation: what happens when the 'alien invasion' of yore smacks up against late capitalism's grotesquely elephantine military-industrial complex? This is a compelling rendering of that premise, even if they cheat by ditching the mock-doc conceit in the second act; it was really just a device to compress the exposition. And boy, is it ever compressed; the roller coaster moves fast enough to jump the gaps, holding steady until almost the very end, when a gratuitous bionic suit shtick provides one spectacle too many."

Suffice it to say that once the interesting plot line gets going it REALLY gets going, with characters that I found I cared about in the end, even Wickus whom I didn't really like at the beginning.

"mhudson-17","7","1","3","26 August 2009"," Finally, a new movie that exemplifies the title of ""movie classic""
","I must say that even when I saw the first preview to this movie I knew that this movie would be at least mildly entertaining. After viewing it, I have no problem in saying that it makes my top ten list of greatest movies of all time and this is why: 1. the aliens: for the first time in the age-old genre of alien sci-fi, District 9 presents the audience with a new vision of aliens--not the creatures that attack or harvest humans, but rather the exact opposite. This movie actually makes the aliens seem ""real"" and in doing so give the audience a sense of emotional attachment towards them. 2. political background: this movie was, in essence, a dramatization of the actual events that took place in Johannesburg's District 6 with the forced removal of black Africans from their homes to keep them away from whites. I honestly believe that this movie showed apartheid in a way no other movie has and it also showed how evil humans can be, no matter what year we are in. 3. realism: this movie also made the aliens and the story seem believable. At the premise, humans were not sure what to think about an extremely large mother ship that lands on earth and then took in the aliens and went from trying to accept them to basically enslaving them in order to gain use of their weaponry. The scene when Wikus is used as a medical and biological experiment was done both emotionally and brilliantly. 4. actors: finally, this movie offers very good acting from a group of performers that had totaled less than 100 hours of previous acting. Shartlo Copley's first blockbuster was a huge success and I would not be surprised if he receives an Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>Finally, the ending was probably the weakest part of the movie. However, it did set up very well for a sequel and I would be interested to see if Jackson would consider a return of Christopher Johnson and how the plot line in that event would pan out. This movie was easily the best of the summer and one of the best sci-fi movies to come out in years. A must see and when released a must own."

I thought the 1st half reminded me too much of that Borat movie and the main character reminded me of the Borat character. The main character was kinda annoying to me due to the character not being as funny as intended. If you're into silly slap stick comedy, then you may find it funny-not to me though. I just kept wondering if he would get seriously injured by the aliens or not when attempting to evict them. That was the only suspenseful part during the 1st half of the movie. The 2nd part is where the action and suspense happens.

Your heart goes out immediately for them. Even the ""nice"" guy that interfaces with them for the eviction is a prick, at least until he understand their predicament from experience. The intelligent alien and his son are VERY endearing and capture much more sorrow from me than any human in the movie. Heck, the aliens even have greedy pawn brokers preying on them. One sad scene is when the military industrial complex is testing one of their weapons on a Prawn and the poor thing is looking around with fear. Pretty funny that the Prawn love eating cat food. Effects in this are stunning, action is compelling, though this is a rooster film and the chicks will enjoy it less. Pretty violent and gooey. It really captures and holds on to your interest.

","District 9 is an allegory of District 6 which occurred in Cape Town when the apartheid government forcibly removed 60,000 black habitants in 1965, declaring the zone a whites only residential area. It is the viewers attachment to the aliens, the segregation and discrimination taking place and the acceptance of that policy that is disturbing. Sadly, District 9 paints a very real picture of what would be, and sadly what is, in some countries. I would like to think that given such an event mankind would look past an opportunity for weapons and money, for that of intellectual advancement and inter-race development, sadly it is history that presents a very different picture.<br/><br/>Saying all that, this is an excellent film, certainly one of the best I have seen in the last couple of years and well worth seeing."

","First we had movies like Terminator Judgment Day and Transformers and now G.I. Joe which personally didn't satisfy my pallet along with a few others not worth mentioning but this movie has it all, weapons, humor, violence, and the human monster which is a good wake up call that is much needed in the sense of noticing the similarities to what's going on in the current state of affairs with Terrorist propaganda. One thing that really got out to me was how big brother's eye in the sky was always there throughout the whole movie. It's touching in the sense of showing how people can change under extreme circumstances with the choice to do what's right before they fall completely out of grace. The only thing that I didn't like which could be considered as a major plot hole is how these 'prawns' where unable (or unwilling) to use their own weaponry and the reasons for this was not explained at all. But nevertheless, the effects were great and the story was original. It made me aware of certain things and that's a good thing. Go see this when you can."

This movie is gruesome! I went to see it with my girlfriend and she had to turn away several times because it was so gross! This movie reminds me a little bit of Aliens and a little bit of Predator. It reminds me of Aliens because this movie too is ground breaking, and it reminds of predator for 1 simple reason that I can almost guarantee you will notice."
"jmr1948-1","10","1","3","20 August 2009"," Excellent on all levels
","I found watching District 9 a completely satisfying experience. It's one thing when an arty independent film is complex and involving, but when a sci-fi action flick transcends its mainstream genre in the way District 9 does, that's great cinema. The last film that made me feel this way was the first Terminator back in 1984, such a completely unexpected and powerful experience. Completely entertaining and yet uncompromising in its complexity and what it expects of the audience. It's a miracle that this was the top grossing movie last week. One can hope that the success of this film will open the door to other creative minds that want to demand more of their audiences."

","I enjoyed it, but several plot holes took out some of the endorsement. 1) They can't track a cell phone signal? Give me a break! (OK they eventually get around to it, but it takes forever).<br/><br/>2) The main character takes forever to discover he has the ability to open a can of whoop_ass on the bad guys, and even then he doesn't hold onto his weapon.<br/><br/>3) The bad guys are (as usual) horrible shots and even suspend shooting for dialog. <br/><br/>Still very much worth going. The cat food angle is fun and I am a bit ashamed that I enjoyed the aspect of home-boys in the hood gambling with the aliens. I wonder what Nigeria thinks about this one?"
"alecwest","9","1","3","20 August 2009"," Surprisingly good.
","I went to see it knowing only the basic premise - that alien beings were being kept in a sort-of refugee center. And when I saw the first aliens, the first thought that popped into my head was, ""They look a lot like PREDATORS."" As someone else said earlier, this film ""borrows"" a lot from earlier science fiction classics. And that is why I took one star away from the film. Other than that, I was mightily impressed.<br/><br/>Actors didn't sound like ""actors"" - mouthing out meticulously scripted lines. The actors sounded like ""regular people"" caught up in a dilemma that strained the boundaries of humanity and humaneness. And the central figure who came in contact with the alien ""liquid"" substance was forced to choose between allegiance to two species.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I'll say no more since it might be construed as a ""spoiler"" comment. Suffice it to say that this film will satisfy every expectation of the science fiction fan and, in some cases, will exceed them. If you like science fiction (and have a strong stomach), you owe it to yourself to see this film."

(Ok.. it took about 10 minutes for me to get into this movie and the last 10 min or so dragged a bit but other than that, a good movie.) District 9 was very different than anything I have seen before. Usually I am not into alien movies. Saw the previews for this movie months ago and probably would have never thought to have seen it if I hadn't read all of the great reviews about it before hand. I am not surprised at how many people have liked this movie because it was well done."

","Seriously. I love this film. Last year, two movies made me crazy, which were Iron Man and Dark Knight. This year, it's Harry Potter 6. Hangover, and this. Amazing action, great story, and touching. This will show Transformers and Terminator with GI Joe that a Sci Fi movie can have a story with amazing effects, that too with only a 30 million dollar budget. The background score is electrifying. The performances aren't the best, but they are believable. Which brings me to this: this movie is too believable, too realistic. You might feel a bit uneasy, but if you're emotionally strong, you can take it. Hats off to Peter Jackson to slapping the Sci Fi film genre back to it's senses."
"wannabeanalice-1","9","1","3","19 August 2009"," Keep the Prawns Out
","So I was like really excited to see this film for weeks before it was released and then last Friday when it was released I ran out and saw the very first showing. District 9 is directed by a first time director, and produced by famed director, Peter Jackson. Just from the previews I knew I was in for a huge treat for the mind and the eyes, and you know what I was right! This movie is directed by a professional special coordinator, Neill Blomkamp, this happens to be the first film that he has ever directed. When his initial movie fell through Peter Jackson provided the money and the resources for him to bless the big screen with the phenomenal film, 'District 9'. I saw an interview with Neill Blomkamp in which he said that if the special effects were not up to par, he would quickly lose his audience. So in this film we are presented with extraordinary visuals, which are extremely believable. Many time through out this film, my jaw dropped open in suspense and surprise. For this movie is unlike anything I have ever witnessed in theaters. I have to give a huge amount of kudos to the director, for first time directors usually fail on their initial film, 'District 9' however is a huge success. I will buy this film probably on the first day it is released, and I will put it right there in my amazing movie collection with all my other sci-fi films. I usually rate films on, whether or not they have an impact in the cinema community, or if they will be quickly forgotten. I can see 'District 9' being remembered for a very long time. We have another first for this film; main character Sharlto Copley is a first time actor. In witnessing this film I would have assumed that he had been acting his whole entire life. Thus making this film, more enjoyable, strong, and surprising to watch his character Wikus Van De Merwe fighting for everything in his life that he loves. Many scenes are so hard to imagine that he's not a professional actor. The surprising amount of emotion portrayed by this character is hard to fathom. I enjoyed watching his work, for it really was a piece of art not to be overlooked. This movie has an incredible story line, written by the director Neill Blomkamp, many times towards the end, I was gasping in horror, that he might have made a spectacular film but didn't quite know how to end it. That wasn't the case at all, from beginning to end; I was surprised, shocked, and amazed at the impact of the story line on his film. Towards the end, there were times when I thought, ""oh that's it, that's how it's going to end"" then the story would twist in an opposite direction. It does this throughout the last quarter of the film probably about 5 times. 'District 9' has an immensely perfect story line with underlying political statements, of segregation, population, and occupying of an assembled area. Only with a twist to the story line in which Americans are not occupying a falling community, not even humans are, but an alien species. Most of the time, my film critiquing gets in the way of noticing subtle political points. However, I was very proud of myself for understanding it in this movie. The political statements in this film, is just another pro about this flick. It doesn't take away from the storyline it only emphasizes it. The special effects in this film were so up to date; I wondered how they ever managed to stay under budget. It was so realistic to watch it almost made be believe that somewhere hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa would be a huge space ship filled with cockroach looking extra-terrestrials. 'District 9' has an immensely perfect story line with underlying political statements, of segregation, population, and occupying an assembled area. Only with a twist to the story line in which Americans are not occupying a falling community, not even humans are, but an alien species. I recommend this movie to everybody. I saw this film on Friday, and I was initially going to go by myself, until my mom looked up the overall rating, and saw that it was getting a 9.2 on it's first day. So she came and witnessed it perfection with me on the first day at the first showing. I then took my little sister and my four little brothers, they also enjoyed it, on the following day I took my best friend, and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. So yes, I do recommend this film to almost everybody. I feel privileged to have been able to see this film and critique it. So in conclusion, I loved Neill Blomkamp's first film 'District 9'.<br/><br/>-Wannabeanalice- I have a running movie of the day blog if you would like to read it on myspace."

","Because I had heard so much buzz about the film, I tried to not learn anything more. That helped, because as I watched the film, I didn't know where it was heading, and got nice surprise after surprise.<br/><br/>It's a shame that other writers, producers, and directors can't have visions like this. They spew out the same 'Transformers' and 'GI Joe' crap year after year, thinking CGI and explosions makes a good film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong-- 'District 9' has plenty of explosions and CGI, but they make sense, add to the visual excitement, and feel realistic. For a tiny budget (by Hollywood standards), they pulled off something amazing.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know if my fiancée would like this. I decided to watch this without her, knowing I'd probably like it. It's good enough for me to see again, and maybe I'll take her (she went to see 'The Time Traveler's Wife' with a friend instead. Without even seeing it, I'll bet I can tell you the beginning, middle, and end of that movie).<br/><br/>'District 9' seems ready-made for a sequel: 'District 10'.<br/><br/>If you enjoy intelligent, witty, well-made science fiction films, and can handle some gore, this is the movie for you."

","As always let's start with the basics <br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/> Great Premise  Awesome Special Effects  Underlying commentary about the highs/low of human nature  Fantastic immersion in the atmosphere.  The Alien weapons were awesome they had a gravity guy even! <br/><br/>Cons <br/><br/> Some weird parts  Some of the improvised dialog in combo with the thick accents was hard to follow at times.<br/><br/>This movie by far was the best Sci-Fi movie I've seen in a long time. It also shows-up every other big movie this year that had ridiculous budgets and we're mediocre at best. District 9 reminds us that it's still the acting, directing, and writing that really make a good movie. The main issue (in my opinion) that could drive some people away from the movie is the ""gross"" or ""really weird"" scenes here and there; for example: the Nigerians eating the aliens to try and get their power. However, if those things don't really irk you then it's all good. I thought the best attribute of the movie was how it immersed me in the atmosphere or ""feel"" of District 9 the grime, the smell, the violence, and all the other hardships that were forced upon the Prawns. I will say the violence was brutal but wasn't glorified or overdone like other movies. The acting in D9 was fantastic considering how much experience the cast had in fact, the absence of A-List stars added to the realism of the footage given everyone looked like a normal every-day person. In conclusion, if you like pure sci-fi then you should like this movie the aliens looked phenomenal, the premise is very original, the weapons were sick, and the final 20-30 min climax was spectacular.<br/><br/>-AX"
"cateye-6","10","1","3","17 August 2009"," Loved it
","This film was extraordinary. I found it to be very entertaining and the visual effects were breathtaking. I was very excited to see another Peter Jackson production and boy was I impressed. The whole movie has you on the edge of your seat wondering what could possibly happen next.<br/><br/>This is not a story about aliens in outer space trying to kill everyone, but a film about a race (the aliens) that along with any other race are segregated and forced to act out in order to survive. So this story is so much a Science Fiction film as it is a story about people and some core issues that the people of South Africa struggled with for so many years. <br/><br/>I think this film can be targeted to the person's throughout the world that do not really concern themselves with any issues dealing with people that are not in their immediate circle. This takes film and connects a mass audience to show you the issues on another scale. The core of discrimination and segregation are all the same, person's who are not deemed 'worthy' of our respect because of educational barriers or simply the color of their skin (or in this case DNA makeup) shall be treated like garbage. I think this film brings many different people's entertainment levels into one. Where one would not have found a story about an ordinary guy's shift from watching a fight to living the fight anywhere exciting, this movie brings you that entertainment aspect along with the dramatic story of how a world revolving around politics can be the greediest and most distrustful experience imaginable."

","This film is one the was of great interest to me. When i first heard about i thought it would be just another usual, 'aliens visit earth attempt to destroy it, human somehow win', movie. But it wasn't. It was one of the most original films i have ever seen. The idea of humans accepting to live with aliens was a very original idea. Although a little too violent, the visual effects are the real standout in this film. The way the humans and aliens blended together seamlessly in every scene was quite stunning. They really were deserving of an Academy Award. Another piece of brilliant originality from Peter Jackson was that the film, set the audience up to side with the aliens. A truly daunting task, that was achieved superbly. The film was seemingly set up for a sequel at the end, which would be much anticipated. District 9 is a very original and solid film. However, some of the violence in the film was rather excessive and may turn away some viewers."
"Khalid01","2","2","10","28 August 2009"," Total Disappointment carried on the back of a slug
","From the previews, I expected District 9 to be a dark, suspenseful movie that would shock and frighten me. I was wholly disappointed.<br/><br/>From the beginning I did not find any of the movie believable, from the way the aliens acted (For instance, in one of the scenes with the gangs: how could an alien be so foolish to stop by for a second to have their head blown off, and worse yet, why didn't any of his companions stop and try to gain some measure of vengeance?) to the pseudo-government/paramilitary organization (which didn't have any intervention from other nations, as far as I could tell), I couldn't find this movie believable despite the decent SFX and camera work.<br/><br/>This might be forgivable if the movie had picked up the pace. Yet, for a movie that spans less than a week (in movie time), it seemed three times as long as that and it crawled at a slug's pace, and it was just as boring (not that I want to put down slugs), most of the time.<br/><br/>Finally, the end of the movie is far too anti-climatic to be satisfying and screams that there will be a sequel in tow, but I can't bother to care the least bit. If the story takes more than a movie's length to gain momentum, then I'm rather sure the sequel won't be worth watching."

News reports too. <br/><br/>24 hours eviction notice, over 1 million signatures. wtf?<br/><br/>The language the aliens used was supposed to be understandable by humans yet sounded completely inaudible to me, I tried to listen out for familiar 'words' or sounds when they did speak but couldn't catch a thing.<br/><br/>Other things I couldn't get my head around....selling a suit of armor for 100 tins of cat food, when you could, well, have just put on the armor and over powered the humans and nicked it. The 'prawns' being able to kick and kill a human to death in the blink of an eye but are completely over powered by 20 Nigerian outlaws with a few guns. <br/><br/>Far too many questionable gaps in the plot for me, i didn't care about what happened and couldn't wait for it to finish.<br/><br/>Overall, if you take films seriously, over the age of 25 and want real quality when you pay to go watch a movie...don't watch district 9.<br/><br/>I'm sure it will do well with kids though."

","District 9 had all the makings of a new generation of science fiction films. District 9 had a very interesting concept that could have explored human/alien rights issues and how human beings treat those they do not understand. While the idea was good, the script and the director failed to fully capture the mood that could have produced a very insightful film. District 9 was still an entertaining film. The acting was not the greatest, but it was better than the usual syfy movie of the week. The script was not on par with ""Alien"" but was better than the typical sci-fi movie and the direction was better than the average ""direct from music video"" directors we have seen in the past. There were too many holes in the script and the aliens did not receive the screen time that would have made this movie propel into a classic. The inhumanity to the aliens was touched upon, but should have been included more to have a feel for the life that the aliens had to live. Why did aliens with superior weapons allow themselves to be treated this way? Why did the ship come to Earth? How could millions of aliens allow themselves to be beaten and battered? These are things that could have been explored. I still enjoyed the film, but the hype is too much for an above average sci-fi movie."

The movie opens up with the feel of a documentary complete with interviews and somewhat shaky in the field footage. This combined with some CGI aliens create a very novel experience. I have never seen another movie that brings together sci-fi content and documentary style and for that I must tip my hat to District 9. Something about the documentary style makes you stop and think for a minute, ""Wow, what if Aliens really did land on Earth?"" <br/><br/>Now, that aside the unfortunate part about District 9 is it has a very weak and rather uninspired plot. There are no great plot twists. Its actually a pretty conventional story adapted to fit the context of this movie.<br/><br/>If you are a big lover of content and great story lines you may want to skip this one for that reason.

It made the whole situation seem plausible. <br/><br/>I like a good film that can make me frown upon humanity and society and this done so. You develop complete sympathy to the aliens ""aka, prawns"" and frown towards the ways in which the government treats and responds to them. When the Protganist begins to transform into one of these aliens, the story really heats up. It was also very unexpected to see.

Those looking for plot accountability are idiots - and have missed the point. It's not a staggeringly deep film, but it's a really good watch, with some very interesting points to make about long lasting prejudice, and our obsession with violence. It presents some potentially rather predictable set pieces with novelty and poses difficult moral questions in a tragicomic manner. See also: The Host, Four Lions.<br/><br/>The film constantly references the sci-fi genre, but never with the tired dreary one-upmanship of an action movie.

"seka-gaula","8","1","4","6 August 2011"," Excellent flick but with flaws like any movie
","The global movie fraternity has hailed District 9 as an astounding rare breed in the history of the sci-fi genre, one which comes once in about 50 years. I watched it, purchased it and I corroborate every positive review it generated. But like any movie, it has flaws, which the same fraternity has astonishingly declined to mention. The lack of character development is visible throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For starters, Vanessa Haywood, who brilliantly portrays the character of sole ostensible protagonist's wife, Tania van der Merwe, only appears in the commencement and the end of the movie. Personally, I felt it would have been more electrifying to have her character developed in the form of her defying MNU instructions and going out to look for her husband, Wikus van der Merwe, relentlessly endeavouring to discover the truth pertaining her husband's sexual intercourse scandal with aliens (allegations proapagated by her father) and even involved in some fighting hypothetically speaking.<br/><br/>Additionally, character development of Wikus' chief nemensis Kobus Venter, corrupt MNU CEO Dirk Michaels, Nicolas van der Merwe, MNU heads and the likes would have at least complented this classic flick. This is one error that Neill Blomkamp has to discard in future movies. In the disc's featurettes, Neill enunciates that he didn't want the action to be so over-the-top. But from what I witnessed, the action became so over-the-top that Neill declined to mommentarily deccelerate the pace of the action in order to give a more analytical detail to the storyline (the illegal genetic research programme performed on Wikus to be precise), as was the case with the Incredible Hulk, when Thunderbolt Ross explained to Emily Blonksy the serum that was developed and what culminated to scientist Bruce Banner evolving into the green hulk, and Banner and Betty Ross sharing a private conversation in Betty's House.<br/><br/>Maybe Blomkamp was hell-bent on completing the movie within the running time of 108 minutes. But despite the flaws, District 9 rates amongst the best science fiction movies, if not the best, ever made, largely because the great stuff that transpires in the movie outweighs any minor flaws I have detected. The movie prosperously combines sci-fi & comedy, but simultaneously evokes emotions, as its end almost left me bursting in tears. And this is all thanks to Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell for an unprecedented original story. 8.8/10 is my rating.<br/><br/>Seka Samuel Gaula Cape Town, South Africa"

"hill68","9","1","4","29 April 2010"," District 9
","The film, District 9, is shot in a documentary style, which takes us back to 1982, when we discover that ""we are not alone"", as an alien spaceship hovers over Johannesburg, South Africa. The film documentary then brings us back to the present, with the last known days of the main character, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), as he contaminates himself with alien DNA, begins the alien transformation, learns empathy for others who are different, and to some, becomes a hero. After the humans make the initial contact with the aliens in 1982, they are escorted off of their spaceship and confined to a concentration camp. The film then goes to show the present day and you hear the frustration and prejudice views the citizens of Johannesburg have against the aliens. This is the scene that first presented the theme of the movie of racism and prejudice. The citizens interviewed for the documentary didn't seem to know anything about the aliens, except for their preconceived notions and fear of the aliens being different. District 9 was filmed on location which made the whole experience seem more realistic. The use of natural lighting left nothing to question. You were able to view the aliens, their surroundings, and their interactions. From the interactions of the alien, Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope) with his son, I was able to see the aliens were sympathetic creatures. If the humans had taken the time to understand why the aliens were on Earth, instead of trying to exploit alien technology and weaponry, they might have learned that the aliens just want to go home. The sound of the film made it interesting for me. The narrative of the cameraman asking questions about Wikus and whether he did the right thing was interesting. I knew from that point that something must have happened to Wikus; however, I wasn't sure what he had done. The alien language was also something that held my attention. It was unlike anything I had heard. It also seemed to present a language barrier between humans and aliens, which could accountant for some of the citizen frustration. It would be hard for humans to understand the aliens if they weren't able to comprehend what they were saying. The film seemed to reiterate the fact that even though individuals and cultures may be different, we all need to take a step back and try to put our preconceived notions or stereotypical thoughts aside. It is the only way that we will be able to live together. It is sort of like the film, Crash, in which both films exploit character stereotypes and prejudices against others through their interactions. However, by the end of the film many characters were able to make a change for the better."

","I recently bought this movie on Blu-ray sight unseen and I am so glad I made the purchase. The faux-documentary style was a bit off-putting at first but upon reflection I think it works very very well. It is a great story that is well acted.<br/><br/>The CGI in the movie is incredible. The ""prawns"" (the derogatory name used by humans to refer to the aliens) look like they are real. Visually they are not attractive and their behaviour (by human standards) is gross, but by about half way into the movie I found myself starting to empathize with them.<br/><br/>This movie will captivate your attention and stir emotions in you that you would not expect possible."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>The eyes of the world fall on South Africa when a giant alien spacecraft descends over it. Some of the aliens come down to earth and end up living in the shanty huts, but face prejudice and oppression from some of the earth dwellers. Finally, a giant government agency comes in and tries to forcefully relocate the aliens and in the process gentle, compassionate Agent Van De Mere (Sharlito Copley) swallows some fluid from the alien camp and finds himself morphing into one of them. It is then that he finds out just how corrupt the government are and is forced to go on the run from them...and to try and forge an allegiance with the very beings he had previously been trying to help get rid of.<br/><br/>With it's sorry history of apartheid and segregation, South Africa is a clever backdrop to set this off beat sci-fi tale against, and with aliens and humans in place of blacks and whites. Told in a post modernist, mock documentary style, which seems to be the style these days, District 9 is an inspired and original science fiction story in a day and age where the genre is dying on it's lozzells. The camera lens and style of filming create the perfect sense of atmosphere and tension.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp and Peter Robert Garber are the directors at the helm, but this is a Peter Jackson production and the special effects genius is in his element on a doubtlessly smaller budget than most of the other projects he's involved in, delivering some impressive 'prawn' prosphetics and make up. The aliens are given really sweet, gentle, puppy dog faces which makes you end up feeling for them even more. In the most important role, Copley similarly delivers an earnest, rootable hero, speaking in South African, that most weird of dialects that is a mix of cockney and Australian, but sounds more Irish coming from his mouth! <br/><br/>Destined to become a cult classic, this is a unanimously pleasing effort for Jackson Productions (the same can't be said for the Lord of the Rings films!) *****"

","It seems that every film is either a remake or a sequel and no one seems to want to make original films anymore, especially with sci-fi films. The first time I heard of District 9 was seeing the ads on bus and subway stops or posters plastered near construction sites. Then I got to see the trailer and I thought this looked awesome. I finally got to see it in a theater (haven't been in one for a long time) and even though I had to sit through a gazillion commercials for everything from real estate to Fanta, it was worth it. <br/><br/>How unique was this film compared to the crap we're force-fed? The aliens were victims. Humans were the evil empire. The setting was Johannesburg instead of the usual cities like New York or Los Angeles. You didn't have women used as eye candy. You didn't have sidekicks used for occasionally offensive but mostly unfunny comic relief. You had parents that acted normal as oppose to being shrill and annoying. You have a protagonist that wasn't the usual pretty boy/muscle-bound/wise-crack spewing nob you usually get. You have dialog that felt real and not like it was written by twelve year olds on pop rocks and Ritalin. You were able to enjoy the action without feeling like you need to reach for the barf bag every time the camera swished and swoshed around. You can actually follow the storyline. I repeat: YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE STORYLINE. Gee, why can't Hollywood make films like this anymore?"
"diegoavilarodriguez","10","1","4","8 April 2010"," Original, visually stunning and one of the best sci-fi films seen in a long time.
","One of the most original science fiction films that have come out in a long time, District 9 has all the right elements to be one of the best sci-fi films ever.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the story/directing: Now ever since E.T., I've been waiting for a science fiction film that truly had something interesting to say and of course combine it with some good old fashion sci-fi style action that we all love. Some elements of this film have been seen before, but only in very little and unimportant aspects, in here the aliens come to our world and become minorities, segregated from other humans and kept in closure inside the very small area of District 9, where particularly a man working for MNU (which is a fake government agency invented in this film), Wikus Van de Merve, is sent to transfer the aliens to a new sector, oddly enough he becomes infected with a certain chemical which begins to mutate his body, eventually finding out what the real reason why the prawns (aliens) never left earth, and also becoming the most valuable artifact in the world. The beginning of this story itself is very original, it doesn't do like most movies would, it begins fast, quickly explaining the cultural and economic situations that Johannesburg is in, also it's a much better beginning because this way you don't get too confused focusing on secondary characters rather than the main ones (Wikus Van de Merve and Christopher).The direction was fundamental to district 9's originality, it's like a combination between documentary and regular film style, the beginning might seem boring to some, but i found it to be great, quick and informative about the story, we see and learn all we need to know about the film with the quick 5-8 minutes of documentary like footage. The story develops well from the moment it started until the end of the film, of which I will hope that Blompkamp makes a sequel of.<br/><br/>Now the acting/characters/interaction between them: First of all one must cut some slack for the leading actor Sharlto Copley (Wikus Van de Merve) because this his first big film, and I must say for being his first time, he does it very well, not like an outstanding actor, but for his first time it's very well done and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised for his performance, his character Wikus is not meant to be an all powerful savior or hero without many exceptional capabilities (except that he is the only human who can use alien weaponry), he is more of the working class type of person, who isn't picked by fate or anything, he was just a regular guy whose life changed in within a matter of seconds and I liked that rather than a prophecy hero of legend or a man on a mission, Wikus could of been anyone of us. Now Christopher, despite being an animated character with no one in particular giving him a voice, is a very important character whose personality moved me, being him one of the few prawns that actually had a plan or at least seemed to be smarter and much willing to do things for his people and his son, I found him to be a very important character that if done differently it would have compromised the great story this film brings. The interaction between both Wikus and Chris is original as well, if you're expecting the E.T thing where they becomes friends out of nowhere then you'll be disappointed, in here it's much more realistic, Wikus and Chris don't necessarily become friends but merely work together due to a quid pro quo case where Chris promises to stop Wikus' mutation and cure him if Wikus helps him get his fuel back so that he'll return to his planet, thus this means that they aren't mutual friends, they were not suppose to have this type of E.T scenario where I will cry if you go away. No, it's more realistic in this sense. Now as for the acting from the secondary characters and their interaction, they were also very good. During the documentary style beginning everyone (prawns included) made it feel real and believable, and for the non-documentary scenes, characters such as Koobus (David James) are the great villain cliché we all like to see, mean, evil and typically has a problem with our human protagonist.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Now don't get me started with the special effects... they're just marvelous and outstanding, the main thing that helped keep the realism of the film was how incredibly realistic the CGI was, now I know that CGI doesn't make a film great, but unless it's story requires good effects than it might as well have some decent CGI. What is also great is how dirty and grungy the aliens, and their technology is rather than shinny and new, made it feel all that more amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, the film delivers well thought out story, with amazing jaw-dropping special effects and great acting. Definitely one of the best science fiction films I have seen in a long time."

"Buddy-51","8","1","4","2 February 2010"," sci-fi with style and depth
","As ""District 9"" opens, we learn that a mysterious spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa since 1982. After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the aliens are referred to derisively as ""Prawns,"" due to their crustacean-like appearance). Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself. Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands). However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity. <br/><br/>(Though set in South Africa, the movie's provenance is actually New Zealand).<br/><br/>Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie clichés (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard). ""District 9"" also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre. Like ""Alien Nation,"" it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia. The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos. They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit, clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out. The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of ""The Fly,"" as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity. Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an ""other"" to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in ""Avatar,"" actually).<br/><br/>Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, ""District 9"" would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the picture with the human heartbeat it needs to be effective. A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for a an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless. Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through. It is he and he alone who lifts ""District 9"" to the level of compelling human drama.<br/><br/>Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make ""District 9"" a one-of-a-kind movie-going experience."
"benjamin_lappin","7","1","4","21 January 2010"," The Tale Of Intergalactic Discrimination Has Never Been Told So Ruggedly (If at all)...
","South African director Neil Blomkamp's debut is the ultimate fusion, and homage-payer, to nearly every sci-fi film over the passed twenty or so years, that tells the tale of an alien species stranded on earth and herded in a slum outside Johannesburg. Blomkamp got this opportunity by creating his own five minute live action sequence taken from the, now somewhat defunct, ""Halo"" film project. Viewed by, and obviously having impressed, Peter Jackson, the New Zealander promptly gave his backing, both in critical and financial terms to his new protégé to create this intergalactic tale of discrimination and very big guns.<br/><br/>Comparing both the aforementioned five minute ""Halo"" trailer and ""District 9"" you cannot help but notice Blomkamp's delicacy when it comes to the implementation of special effects into a film. Too often are films overloaded with computer generated effects, both from other worlds and this, that do not convincingly real, despite all the money that is pumped into them. Blomkamp has a keen eye for being able to blend the virtual with the real in an almost seamless fashion, which in a film where half the cast are non-existent ""prawns"" from another world is somewhat of a key trait in selling the film. Also, equally as noticeable, is Blomkamp's exceptional directing technique when it comes to shooting, but also editing, the high tension action sequences. He knows how to create tension with the use of long tracking shots, interspersed with crisp cuts that, while chaotic, actually keep you up to breast with the geography of an all-out gun fight. Keeping perspective of where your characters are in the grand scheme of things and creating the heart-pounding tension that the audience needs to be immersed, yet follow proceedings, in the world is not an easy skill but one Blomkamp ensures happen with worrying (for other directors of the same genre) accuracy and style for such a young director.<br/><br/>The cast which carries the story is led wonderfully by Sharlto Copley as the bumbling and out of his depth ""Wikus Van De Merwe"" as he manages to entice sympathy from the audience and then just as suddenly the reverse, without ever making his character unbelievable. The script, which is very well written for a film of this genre, provides Copley with just the right balance of humour, emotion and as many uses of the word ""fok""as an actor could possibly hope for. Copley carries the film extremely well, given he is often the only ""actor"" on screen at any one time and finds himself wonderfully backed up by a whole host of weasel faced antagonists who provoke the right amount of spite and venom from the viewer, despite them never being fleshed out as anything more than clichéd ""bad guys"". <br/><br/>Book ended by a documentary styled account of the events in District 9, the action during the middle segments romp along at a great pace, yet while on first viewing is enough to engross the viewer, on second there is a slight problem. Initially there is so much going on, so much that feels fresh and unique that you can't help but be swept away by it, but on second viewing you have to question the longevity of a film such as this. While it is undoubtedly a good piece of action-cinema, the sci-fi element demands more than simply big plastic guns that make people explode. Blomkamp creates his own intergalactic apartheid in ""District 9"", yet never explores the connotations of the why, when and what for. Science fiction is a genre not simply of aliens, but also of philosophy and meaning. If you look at the classics like ""2001"" and ""Solyaris and a great many anime's there is always an underlying meaning or reasoning, something to get the audience thinking about what is being shown on screen, to delve deeper and explore the film as well as themselves. ""District 9""'s only failing flaw, is that it fails to explore the separation of the humans and aliens, why they have been separated, what has allowed it to have come to this, why are the aliens being treated with such disregard? Is it simply because these people are the sort of white supremacists that caused so much damage in South Africa? These and more issues are either glossed over or never addressed at all, and I feel that perhaps if Blomkamp had tackled even one aspect as to ""why"" there was such discrimination, as opposed to the mere one line ""justifier"" in the opening montage, that it would push the film into epic proportions. <br/><br/>While the criticism of the film is a heavy one, it does not tarnish what is otherwise a superb science fiction action fest that audiences and lovers of the genres can get their teeth into. Blomkamp delivers on the promise that was his online snippet and has now set himself an even higher bar to which to aim his next project at. He has created a self encompassed world that requires no sequels, prequels, tells its story efficiently and drags its audience along for a ride that hallmarks one of the more impressive films, never mind debuts, in quite a while. My only wish is that while the stylised homages to The Fly and Aliens show a director who has knowledge, and command, of the sci-fi genre, the director continues to progress in the right direction and perhaps for his next challenge includes the gut-wrenchingly profound that District 9 finds itself separated from."

","Why isn't anyone talking about how similar ""District 9"" is to ""Avatar,"" the other attention-getting sci-fi film of the year?<br/><br/>In both, a man belongs to an organization intent on oppressing an alien race. In both, he undergoes a kind of transformation that puts him in the aliens' place and causes him to sympathize with them. In both, the villains are thuggish military types, horror-show caricatures.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for ""District 9,"" though its similarities beg comparison to ""Avatar,"" it pales in comparison in just about every respect. It's a well-made allegorical tale about apartheid in South Africa, but I can't say I enjoyed watching it, as it's nasty and harrowing in a way that's off putting rather than exhilarating. The main character is sprayed with a liquid that causes him to become one of the aliens, and his slow transformation, as his human body disintegrates, is dealt with in stomach-churning detail. Also, the film's version of humanity is depressing and demoralizing, as is its depiction of an alien race. It was hard to root for anyone, because nothing much seemed worth saving.

"anarresa","4","1","4","2 January 2010"," Well filmed, but too dark
","The previews I saw were vague so I had little expectation and got the DVD based on general ""good"" reviews. The movie was certainly filmed well. It uses a documentary style, but a very professional and cleanly filmed documentary, not like the Blair Witch style. On-the-scene footage mixes with interviews and clips of security footage to set the background and then real time scenes move the story forward with no relation to the documentary. Subtitles are a necessity, I hope the theatrical version added them where needed. The aliens might be entirely CGI, or maybe a mixture of CGI and puppetry, but they were excellently rendered. The technology is finally up to interaction with real actors. So there are several aspects that deserve the good reviews.<br/><br/>My low review score is based on the fact I had to stop a little more than an hour in because the story was just too dark. Almost every human in it was crudely and casually violent, cruel, and uncaring, both to the ""prawns"" and other humans. It was a cast of near psychopaths. I don't need a happy movie, and I certainly expected violence and prejudice based on the film's description, but it was so unfeeling as to be unbelievable for me. Yes there's cruelty and torture in the world and apathy, especially from a distance, but my town doesn't get together to run crazy experiments, riot, murder and eat our foreign neighbors simply because they're different, and bug-like aliens or not these were clearly sentient beings so that's the parallel. I would have preferred more subtle discrimination with perhaps a few scenes of cruelty to show what humanity is capable of. The Johannasburg citizens are a part of the developed world, it could have been Paris or Washington or Shanghai. And scenes that reminded me of the Rwandan genocide descriptions were plopped right downtown. The evil corporation and mercenaries were too much for me. Just be aware of the tone before viewing."
"mknoiret","10","1","4","17 December 2009"," some thoughts on what else District 9 has to say.
","This is a story worth both telling and hearing. It is no comic book quest for a magic trinket but a tale of a flawed mans growth under fire. Onto this story, i believe the director writer has woven very subtly but intentionally a large well crafted system of historical and religiously allegorical elements. I am however that this film maker has painted a gospel like image on a blank jigsaw puzzle, and sewn the pieces randomly but truly and effectively and elegantly into the film from beginning to end. When I first saw District 9 I wondered about 4 significant elements. What does the ship mean? It is after all the 500 lb gorilla in the room and if this film has echo of subtext it has meaning certainly. The transformation of the lead character is a fundamental element in the film, of primary importance. The VERY strange dual nature of the black fluid is deliciously puzzling as a symbolic element and must (if I am correct about the allegorical nature of District 9) have meaning. and I was struck immediately by the central character's enduring love. Now, I feel I am just scratching the surface of this very literary work, but here are a couple of ideas which lead me strongly to feel that there is plenty to muse over under the surface of the admittedly wonderful surface. (Heh) What the heck is this fluid allegorically. Half the answer hit me like a brick falling. The contact with this fluid began the transformation of Wikus van der Merve. His transformation was an essentially positive one from a moral and ethical point of view. It was a BAPTISM! Symbolically speaking. Im still mulling over the fluid as the motile power of the Ship. The Nigerians are in my view a rather uncomplimentary reflection of the Roman Catholic Church. Eating the flesh of the aliens (here perceived symbolically as divine) echoes the mass. The acquisition of weapons which are useless to them seem much like the accumulation of holy objects so widespread in Catholicism. The intense exploitation of the aliens (now perceived symbolically as the populace) seems to be a commentary on Catholic abuse of the laity for its own purposes. I believe the return of the ship may be viewed as the resurrection, either as the ship itself returning in three years or the return to humanity of Wikus which Christopher promised he would effect. Wikus himself takes on a Christlike character by becoming one of the aliens, just as God became one of the humans. Clearly this is all loosely assembled but the parts are all here unquestionably and this inner playground of symbolic life gives the film a wonderful suggestion of deep moral direction viewed as it must have been as a subject worth the andornment of so many spiritual themes. I've only touched on a few ideas here but I have no sense that I am grasping for meaning where there is none. This movie is well made at every level and I am not ashamed to admit that the maker is more subtle, skilled, clever and intelligent than i am in chasing out his little bits of added material. This movie is worth the trouble and I hope to be able sometime soon to describe it very coherently in this way, because I believe District 9 deserves a thoughtful, complete appreciation of its inner and outer life. -- OK, so I have had a few insights into District 9 but obviously there were a few things I've overlooked. What the does the ship mean and then...the fluid... baptism, clever, yes, but what is the black fluid as fuel for the ship mean? I believe this director wants EVERYTHING to be meaningful. He has such a rich creativity that he has it all under total managmement. I believe I've figured it out. This film maker is not only making a religious allegory, he is commenting on our civilisation.<br/><br/>What is the ship? It is US! Huge, technologically advanced, capable of amazing things but.....what if this magnificent engine of ours, this modern society runs out of............................OIL! That black stuff symbolises just what it looks like. OIL. Imagine us in the future, our giant infrastructure and big machines. All rendered inert because we are out of oil. weve destroyed ourselves. This movie is a sobering comment on the future of mankind if we allow ourselves to come to the point where our entire modern miracle comes to a grinding halt. Those million starving aliens in the immobiised ship? Thats US! This movie maker has created a sobering look at so many parts of human life. our misbehaviors, our capacity for redemption, our headlong flight into self destruction. and all played out on a backdrop of the socioligical madness actually existing in South Africa."

","I like the combination of drama and science fiction in the story, very similar to what we see in a film like Blade Runner; It has touching moments like E.T. but without it being corny; nothing against the Yanks, but it's a breath of fresh air it not having anything to do with the United States.<br/><br/>I agree it has elements of a lot of other action films, what makes this one different is that it involves so many elements of our own human history: the scene where they first find the non-humans is like when nowadays they discover a cargo of refugees or illegal immigrants; the experiments the do to them is similar to what was done to Jews or Chinese during WWII; the official and social treatment given to them like as if they were cattle, pretty much the way so many ""civilizations"" have given to unwanted minorities, (or in South Africa's experience majorities). Add up the media manipulation pushed by greedy interests of the war industry conglomerates. Issues others fail to bring up and place in the spotlight.<br/><br/>It's so deliciously shocking, what's not to like about it? Unless of course, it makes your subconscious feel uncomfortable. Then again, it's achieving its purpose.<br/><br/>Gave this movie a 10, because I can see it's generated a lot of hate voters."
"Kroshe","10","1","4","29 October 2009"," One of the best Sci-Fi I have seen..
","I was already familiar with other works of Blomkamp, including some commercials and short Halo movies (you should check them out), but this movie is something else. I am really impressed not only by the storyline, also with the CGI effects and the acting. The effects are fantastic, most importantly fun to watch. I loved the documentary style of this film, the dark humour, the quirky character of Wikus, the acting all round, the script, etc, thought it was all incredible. I would whole-heartedly recommend this film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about District 9 is the way in which it never plays by the usual genre rules; there are elements of thought provoking ethical docudrama, dark satirical comedy, fugitive chase, gory horror, conspiracy thriller, sci-fi mystery and all out action weaved together.<br/><br/>Don't miss out. It is an original movie.. and a good example of Sci-Fi."

","I don't often write reviews, but this movie blew me away and perplexed me. It does of course follow certain movie-making traditions, scifi conventions, and even some pretty classic action movie type sequences... but this movie has something extra and something special. It's hard to put my finger on it exactly, but I guess in a way the characters, the plot and even the aliens, they're all so absurdly human and somehow completely believable.<br/><br/>I'm a huge scifi geek, so I reckon most non-geeks probably won't ""get"" this movie, but for me, personally, it feels like an instant cult classic. Nice to see a hyped movie that lives up once in a while!"

","Well, besides any comment that's been made about this film not being a classical sci-fi one, having original concepts, and being well told and interesting through the whole 112 minutes, i'd like to point out the fact that's probably one of the bests low budget movies out there, and if there's something that i liked on this film -without spoiling anything- it's the way the aliens are made, not being a stereotypical dumb which expands really fast race or the totally opposite, super smart ones, but just a kind of human one where there's dumb and intelligent ones, that along with their attitude was the kind of alien i've wanted to see on a movie.<br/><br/>I certainly liked the start with it's documentary style, and i liked the end, opened to a 2nd movie, that the producers will hopefully start to work on sometime soon.<br/><br/>About the plot, it was good, not awesome, yet OK, there was a little detail about a line of the main character that i wouldn't have done, but nothing really wrong.<br/><br/>Just watch it, really worth it, and i guarantee there will be unexpected stuff.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 7.8 if possible."

"stiva","10","1","4","14 October 2009"," Bloody Brilliant. I have never seen anything spectacular as this since Ridley Scott's Aliens and Steven Spielberg's E.T.
","This is the best Science fiction film I have ever seen in my entire life so far.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie starts with the introduction. the spaceship crashed on earth, hovering above the city of Johannesburg. It seems like they have lost a key to the main control. So they settle outside the city. The government provides protection. The District was officially named as ""District 9"". But, the people are scared and they want the aliens to leave the planet. So, the government find a new place far away from the people and the city where the stranded aliens can settle themselves. What happens after this is the entire story and how it goes from here.<br/><br/>I assume that you came to watch this movie expecting it to contain lots of visual effects, high end graphics and hard-core Action sequences. If so, then you are in for a shock and a real treat. It is very unique in it's own way. Very less CGI effects are used. Less budget involved here. Not that much action sequences. We see how the aliens are treated and the consequences of our actions and mistakes. We see some similarities between us and them. We learn a lot of things from them. We get to see some high technology devices and weapons but not a lot and definitely not at all times, but only when necessary.<br/><br/>The movie is gripping, terrifying, suspenseful, realistic and brilliant. The director has given us something that no other director has done in a very long time. New cast members and they have done an excellent job. Aliens look simple, yet terrifying. The storyline was crafted and written very well. Awesome camera work. This movie will serve as an icon for future movies in the film industry. This movie is a masterpiece. It'll become a legend. It'll be talked about for years.<br/><br/>I hope more good movies will come in the future by learning from this. Kudos to the entire team for giving an amazing movie.<br/><br/>A movie not to be missed."
"rshan-ali","10","1","4","1 October 2009"," Aliens are humans too
","Carl Sagan would have loved this movie. It does what he did all his life- expand man's horizons. It reminds us that we're only humans and that we're but a 'speck in the vast cosmic drama'. Through great characterizations and heart wrenching acting, it breaks down the 'us' and 'them' divide that so plagues man's life from the moment he or she is born. For once great science fiction and great literature merge- the human condition meets the non-human condition. And for all those scientists who hope fervently for a kind of science that touches man's heart- this is it- art through science. To say anything else would be an overstatement- such is the subtlety of this film. From Wicus Van De Merwe's big-hearted, naivety to the gigantic alien ship that hangs silently above Jo'Burg reminding us that there are other things in this universe, far greater and nobler that man, this film will be a constant companion to those who love the vision of science."
"agmoldham","5","1","4","27 September 2009"," An intelligent Sci-Fi movie
","For every good Sci-Fi movie there are probably a dozen of stinkers and fortunately this belongs in the former category.<br/><br/>District 9 is based 20 years after an alien Space Craft parks above Johannesburg. The aliens from the space craft are 'housed' in a ghetto called district 9. The first 20 minutes are played as a docu drama in the form of news-clips which is wearing a bit thin by the time the film takes a more conventional structure. It is decided to move the aliens out of the city and Wikus is charged with serving eviction orders on the aliens.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that the film was made on a low budget, the effects are quite good. The lead actor Shalto Copley plays Wikus with relish and the directing is also very well done."
"The_Dead_See","8","1","4","26 September 2009"," A wild, gruesome, kinetic epic with a big heart.
","I went into District 9 expecting a 2 hour mockumentary but I got far more than I bargained for. The first half hour or so is indeed an entertaining mockumentary but then (fairly suddenly and shockingly) the film shrugs the pretence and moves into a more straightforward story, though still on hand-held camera for the most part.<br/><br/>There haven't been too many films in the past few years that really hit a satisfying note with me on both an emotional level and also on a level of pure (or some may say puerile) entertainment, but District 9 did both. You can watch it as an effective, thought provoking commentary on the nature of segregation, poverty and mans inhumanity to man; or you can watch it as a violent (and oh is it violent!) video game with possibly the best special effects I've seen on a movie screen since the original Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Fair warning, it's a bloody movie - the third act is filled with decapitation, dismemberment and exploding bodies; but it's also filled with intelligence and a poignant, powerful message that there might just be hope for compassion left in us yet.<br/><br/>I won't go so far as to call District 9 a masterpiece, but it was a tremendously well-executed, occasionally moving, always fascinating movie. You could do far, far worse than dropping twelve bucks on this one."
"heisenberg83","10","1","4","25 September 2009"," Terminator 4 / Transformers 2? Eat your heart out!
","Ace movie – loved every second of it! Influences are: Doom, Half-Life, Robocop, Aliens etc! I honestly went into this movie TOTALLY cold. Glad I didn't read Total Film review (just read it now and it is spoiler city). The trailer (which I did see) really marketed the film differently. It didn't give anything away which was great. The comedy vibe in the first 15-20 minutes really threw me – but I was laughing loads. The main actor was GREAT. He reminded me very much of a South African Bruce Campbell (replace chainsaw arm with alien arm). Also, the humour was very reminiscent of that South African comedy movie Gods Must Be Crazy. Well impressed with how he flicked from geeky patronising comedic character to Daniel Craig style action man. I laughed out loud in loads of bits. Didn't expect it to get so touching. Loved the Alien that helped him and was really worried he was gonna get killed. Honestly didn't have a clue how the film was going to progress from one scene to the next. Couldn't help thinking how much this film totally blitzes recent robot/alien movies I've seen like Terminator 4 and Transformers 2. They're so bad compared to this.<br/><br/>**spoiler**<br/><br/>The tone of the film really switched from uncomfortable comedy to disturbing/violence when they were experimenting on him with his Alien hand, and got him to shoot the Prawn. And then were gonna split open his chest. I wanted to look away there, but was so glad when he fought back and I realised we were in for a Doug Quaid/Half Life esquire breakout from the Lab.<br/><br/>The Alien weaponry at the end scenes were fantastic. Loved the Robocop II esquire suit that froze all the bullets shot at it, and then fired them back at people. And the way people got splatted by the weapons like a frag in a deathmatch. That captain grunt looked just like Michael Ironside. Blows away Starship Troopers to, don't it?<br/><br/>**spoiler finished**<br/><br/>Definitely one I'll be buying on DVD."

Its takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions and leaves you drained but wanting more and more by the end.<br/><br/>It's tough to watch in parts not just cause of the violence but for what you have grown to feel for aliens.<br/><br/>When you think about the film after you can actually imagine that this is what would happen to aliens if they did actually land on earth, which just adds to the whole realism of the film.<br/><br/>This is a must see and one of the greatest films i have ever seen and not just for science fiction fans as even my girlfriend was in awe or it and she hates sci-fi!!"

A masterful mix of emotions and styles, blending comedy, sci-fi and action together in such a seamless manner. I didn't really know what to expect before seeing this film, only that it was set in South Africa and had something to do with aliens. I came away shocked by what I had just seen and just hoping to god that they will make some kind of sequel because I need to know more. The characters are brilliantly acted. The special effects suit the movie perfectly without ever trying to take over from the story telling. Please please please can we have more movies like this and less of the god awful Hollywood blockbusters such as Transformers. This film proves that it is possible to make a good special effects laden movie where the story shines through. Well done to all involved and thank you for a truly magical cinema experience."
"jonnyk12","10","1","4","16 September 2009"," Better than you'd expect
","District 9 (15) - ***** I had read rave reviews on this film so I expected a decent film. It was not what I expect, it was better.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that 20 years ago a huge alien ship had hovered and stopped over Johannesburg, South Africa, in the ship there ends up being refugees from another planet. They are then taken in by the MNU who give them an area to live in called District 9. 20 years on, District 9 has become a slum full of crime and fraud; this is when an MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) has been given the task of moving over 1.8 million aliens to a new area. While he is doing this something happens which puts him under extraordinary circumstances, as the MNU may not end up wanting to help the refugees after all.<br/><br/>To tell any more would ruin the film, but the story and the script is top notch. It is good in the fact that it is very realistic even with a very unrealistic plot, the aliens aren't all powerful and has very human qualities and the main character reacts incredibly realistically to every situation he is in.<br/><br/>The CGI is brilliant and makes the aliens look almost real, even with the surprisingly cheap budget for the film.<br/><br/>It is made by the little known director Neill Blomkamp and is based on a short he had made earlier, also as the company which made the film quite small Blomkamp was aloud to choose a little known actor like Sharlto Copley. Who did an amazing job with very realistic reactions throughout the film; he also improvised for parts of the film which most likely help with the realism.<br/><br/>As I've go on about this film is very realistic, it makes think if there were alien refugees this is how'd they'd be treated. I don't see this film as a film about alien refugees coming to earth; I see it as a film about how one man copes with extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>I loved this film and I'd say it is defiantly the best film of the year so far and probably the best film I've seen since The Dark Knight. Go and see this film."

And I also love The Alien Christopher he was awesome as well but his friend dies in the beginning but oh well! Wikus Is A great Man And the actor who played him did perfectly! At one Part of the movie (near the end) he shows a picture of his wife and I nearly cried. I think The Real villain in in this movie is The MNU because the treat the aliens So Badly and the use Wikus as an experiment! The only thing I didn't like is when I bought the DVD, It didn't come with subtitles so I didn't understand what the aliens were saying."

There was not many people, but it did not matter because I can pay attention to the movie better than having people climbing around you just to get popcorn.<br/><br/>This movie was a big sigh of relief for the summer movie dribble that has been coming out. This movie is not a remake making you say to yourself that I saw this movie before. This movie is not a book to silver screen type either. Complete originality oozes from every frame of this film. This film is going to in the Oscars you watch.<br/><br/>There are people that will look at this movie and say what is it? Trust me you don't want to go for that proverbial pop corn run, if you do you will miss something.<br/><br/>Here is a film that is shot in a quasi ""point of view"". No, it does not have the annoying camera shaking that some directors think that it shows frenzy of action or create tension for example Quarantine, Cloverleaf, and even Transformer movies where a still camera or establishment wide shots are not the norm. Here in this film there is shaking and POV shots, but they are controlled and used very infrequent only to be used on those shots that enhance the plot. You will not get dizzy heading for the barf bag in the first hint of action.<br/><br/>This movie is shot perfectly, pace is perfect, direction, and art direction are spot on. Worth the $7.50.

"freemantle_uk","10","1","4","13 September 2009"," Great, meaningful Sci-fi
","District 9 was a surprise hit in the American box-office, and it is a excellent example that people are willing to pay for quality. Here is a sci-fi film with a modest budget from South Africa, with only a big name producer and an excellent vile market campaign.<br/><br/>Set in an alternative world, an alien space ship has been hovering over Johannesburg for over 20 years. They was a lost, malnutrited alien race, and a 'humanitarian' crisis happened. The South African government isolated the aliens, derogatorily known as the 'prawns', into a crime ridden slum in the centre of the city, known as District 9. District 9 becomes an embarrassment for South Africa, and the government, using a private agency, plan to evict the aliens to a camp outside the city, so they are out of sight. Bureaucrat Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is assigned the mission to evict the aliens. But as he tries to do this he becomes inflected with a strange fluid and he himself ends up as a science experiment. Wikus ends up becoming a fugitive, and ends up hiding in District 9. He forms an alliance with an alien called Christopher and both have to help each other out.<br/><br/>This is a very ambitious film, especially for a first time director, Neill Blomkamp. It is clear that Peter Jackson had a influence in this film. Neill Blomkamp was able to sci-fi into a metaphor and a message about a number of themes. An obvious theme is apartheid because of the collective affect on South Africa and Neill Blomkamp's personal experience. It shows have a group end up being separated and end up becoming second-class citizens. They is also the theme of immigration and xenophobia, two issues that are affect South Africa as a moment. A recent poll show sadly that South African are on of the most xenophobic people in the world, and Blomkamp tries to show it in this film. Another theme is the idea of forced removal and preventing people being seen. This happened in South Africa, and has happened in other nations like China. As well as these major themes, they are other ideas explored like organised crime, drug addiction, illegal experimentation, superstition and traditional African witchcraft, the evils of the weapons industry and late-nineteenth century style American immigration (i.e. Ellis Island style treatment).<br/><br/>They is a strong story, with Wikus being a reluctant hero and seeing the error of his ways. They is an emotional story, about the transformation to Wikus, both physically and mentally. They is also a good emotional story involving his friendship with Christopher and the father and son relationship with the film. I actually felt for them. There is a excellent, gory sci-fi action in this film and the special effects are pretty good for a film with a $30 Million budget. Blomkamp shows his background in computer graphics. The aliens themselves where designed very well, looking like bugs, but having very emotive eyes: it was very effective. The film is shown both as a faux documentary and as a standard movie, both style working very well. The film reminded me of the excellent Cloverfield. Blomkamp adds elements of dark comedy to his film which is enjoyable and helps break the tension of the film. He can do serious and light-hearted.<br/><br/>A brilliant film ***** of *****"

"Kinetek","8","1","4","12 September 2009"," The Gaza Strip Of Alien Flicks
","This movie ticks all the right boxes - great direction, competent acting, realistic SFX with a story and plot that harks back to the good old days of cinema.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting (and overseen) aspect of this film is the social commentary that permeates throughout. The 'aliens' are shown as the lowest of the low, with barely enough intelligence to breathe of their own accord, barbaric and happy to live in squalor, trading weapons and sex for drugs... which just happens to be cat food - go figure.<br/><br/>This stereotypical view mirrors many minorities in western culture - and the decision to base this film in South Africa is an inspired choice, given the troubles the country has seen since the sea-change it has endured in recent times.<br/><br/>The aliens appear cockroach-like, seemingly wandering aimlessly around District 9's wasteland, as if they are missing a vital piece in their social jigsaw puzzle. They are not without humour however, or a misguided intelligence that at times disproves the human view that they are merely pond-life (the derogatory term 'prawns' is the racial slant of choice).<br/><br/>The humans are anything but - the lower castes relishing in their new found status, demonstrating furiously at the fact that District 9 and its inhabitants are even allowed to exist, oblivious to the fact that they were, until the arrival of the aliens, tarred with the very same brush by those with a higher status - the social domino-effect is on full display here.<br/><br/>Its a brave man who takes on the issues highlighted here and applies it to a sci-fi movie - but Blomkamp has really pulled an ace out of nowhere with this. At the time of writing this review, District 9 is rated at #49 on the all-time list, but I'm not in total agreement with this. While it is a fantastic watch riddled with dark humour, moments of unease that make it difficult to watch and some great dialogue - District 9 doesn't, in my opinion, shine a candle to the likes of Blade Runner, Donnie Darko or The Matrix. However, it is worthy of a straight eight out of ten from me.<br/><br/>Don't let this review distract you from going out and watching this movie, however. It will appeal to all but the most cynical viewers of sci-fi and cinema as a whole - and is a fantastic addition to the genre. I must add that along with others, hope this remains as a piece of film that stands on its own merit, not needing to rely on a sequel to reiterate a story that is more than adequately told here.<br/><br/>Great stuff, extremely refreshing and gutsy. See it today!"

"nielsboex","10","1","4","9 September 2009"," Even if you're not a sci-fi fan !
","Let me start off by saying that I began watching this with a little suspicion because I'm not usually in to sci-fi movies. I also watch a LOT of movies so I've seen almost everything there is to see when it comes to different kinds of movies and I'm not easily impressed.<br/><br/>This movie is not all about shooting, not all about plasma-guns and all the other stereotypes you usually see in movies like star wars, etc (no offence). No, it's about human nature and the way we act around beings we don't know and don't understand. We want to make everyone change to benefit ourselves, some because they don't know better, others because of sheer cruelty and bad character. In District 9, the bad get separated from the good. Don't get me wrong though, it's not all emotions, there's still plenty of action and suspense and let me tell you, the action junkies will get their share of the fun too. I personally feel these two elements are perfectly blended together. Enough action, enough suspense, enough emotions AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: it shows two sides to the story, as opposed to Independence Day where we only get to see the human side of it (again, no offence). I'm not going to say anything about the plot, you can read about that in the summary if you want to. All I can do is tell you it touched me, it really opened my eyes to human nature. That we think we know everything better than others and often don't give the unknown a chance.<br/><br/>There's no annoying camera movement (note: in the beginning it's filmed in a somewhat documentary-style), the script was just good and surprisingly original, the acting even better and you get really drawn in to the story.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 10/10, maybe a 9/10. All I know is I've rarely seen a movie like this and I understand why this is already in the top 250 movies of all time. Give it a chance, no matter what genre you prefer."

","Best science fiction movie I've seen in a long, long, long time. Has all elements of classic sci-fi.

I congratulate the writers for making a movie that can be complex and approachable at the same time; a sci-fi flick that doesn't follow formulas and yet has what it takes to succeed. <br/><br/>Has great character development, showing growth and dawning understanding in a way that is believable and real-life like an everyman / everywoman would.<br/><br/>Absolutely 10 out of 10."

","I saw this movie 3 days ago, and I want to see it again. It's fast, no way you'll get bored with this one! The way the film makers portrayed people in this movie is disturbingly realistic. In moments I thought like: ""damn, this is how it really would happen!"". The CGI is awesome, flawless, surreal. The story is totally unexpected for me, that's what made me watch this film without words, and I've seen every sci-fi movie I could get my hands on. This is a must see, it's the most original film I've seen in years. I'm sure critics will find flaws in this film too, but it's just because they're payed by other film companies to do so. Starting from now, this is my favorite sci-fi of all time. 10 out of 10 stars."

","This is probably one of the best alien on earth movie since ET a few decades back. The story is very modern and shows the different shades and aspects of human nature, what people are willing to do to obtain something. The acting was great, you'd hate the antagonist for what they do and you'd actually pity the protagonists both human and alien. It is not an action movie as I expected, something like starship troopers, this is solid drama something to match last year's Dark Knight effect on me. Everyone should watch this movie, at least once, kids would enjoy the bits of action while adults can witness one of the greatest cross-cultural drama."
"zeedunn","9","1","4","7 September 2009"," Science Fiction Evokes Strong Response
","Peter Jackson's new protégé, Neill Bloomkamp, has created a film that takes the science fiction genre to a higher plain. On the surface, you think you are getting a typical science fiction evil alien story. That is certainly what my expectations were after watching the trailer, which is mighty misleading. But the story here is about the essence of humanity and what humans are capable of when they forget what the word ""humane"" means. It is sure to provoke a strong response in whomever watches it.<br/><br/>The film goes back and forth between a mockumentary format and a regular narrative film. Our setting is modern day Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years ago, a large spacecraft came and hovered above the city. When the local authorities finally get up the courage to break into the ship, they find a horde of aliens that are half-starved. They move the aliens to a ""safe location"" for them, which is really an internment, called District 9. The local government feels this is necessary to protect its human citizens, since the aliens began to exhibit violent tendencies.<br/><br/>Now in our current setting, the population of Johannesburg is unhappy with the alien presence. They want them gone. So the government decides to relocate the aliens to a new location through forced migration. We can see District 9 has become a slum, and we understand why the humans want them removed. They plunder the land, fighting over tires and trash. They own weapons that humans can't operate, and they eat cat food. But we can see why the aliens might live this way. First of all, if you are starving, you will eat anything, and if the only option is cat food, well, you eat cat food. Also, when you force a bunch of people into a tight spot, they are going to fight for ownership over the little land they have. The aliens act as any oppressed people group throughout history has. They begin to act like animals.<br/><br/>The way the humans decide to do this migration is silly indeed, and they are just asking for trouble. Unfortunately, most of the trouble lands on the heads of the aliens. The task force given the job is headed by Wikus Van De Merwe. Van De Merwe is a typical bureaucrat. He has his clipboard; he has his rules; and he'll write your name on the board if you get out of line. Hovering above at all times is the military in their helicopters, and if any aliens get out of line, they have no problem just shooting them on sight. The task force feels they are required to give the aliens 24 hours notice. They are supposed to get each alien to sign the clipboard, and if they won't, they threaten their kids or give them cat food--whatever it takes to get them to sign.<br/><br/>The crisis point that begins our story is when Van De Merwe finds a device that is hidden in the home of an alien that must be their resident scientist. He innocently plays with the device not realizing it has a potent fluid inside that, if not impeded, will turn Van De Merwe into an alien, or prawn. Van De Merwe accidentally sprays himself with the liquid, and he slowly begins to turn into a prawn. Van De Merwe now finds himself the hunted, where he was the hunter. The ones he oppressed are now the only ones that will take him in. The scientist prawn, who is named Christopher Johnson, tells Wilkus he can fix him and get back to his planet, if they can get the device back. But there are many forces blocking their path, and everyone will show their true colors by the end of the movie. This is not a hero's tale, but it's realistic and involving.<br/><br/>The story moves at a good pace. At no point does the action drag or waste time on meaningless or confusing plot lines. In addition, the director makes wise choices in how much violence to show. Since most of the violence in this film is done to aliens, there is that protective mask you can hide behind since the victim isn't a human, but these aliens do evoke feeling from us. Sure, they look like Jabba the Hut's ugly cousin, but they wear clothes, they talk, and they have kids. They cry for their friends, and they do feel pain, even if the most of the humans in this movie seem to forget that.<br/><br/>The actors all do a great job, although only a few humans actually have more than a minor speaking role. You won't recognize any of the faces here.<br/><br/>On a deeper level, we understand that we aren't really talking about aliens here. If you take away the spaceship and the alien bodies, any racial group that has faced oppression could be substituted for the aliens, and we would have the same story. The aliens have a few advantages: they are from another planet, so they have the option of escaping in a ship, and they have some technology that humans don't. Unfortunately, in the real stories where humans have been placed in internment camps and forced to leave their homes, their was no escape plan. The fact that this film is set in Johannesburg adds a deeper level, since many of its racial groups suffered similar fates as the alien prawns under the apartheid era.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie. It was intense, and difficult to watch sometimes, but it does what I want my movies to do: grab me with inventive, exciting storytelling, and evoke strong emotions."
"martyncymro","10","1","4","7 September 2009"," If you watch one film before Christmas - make it this one!
","I read the views which were all pretty good, but that didn't prepare me for what really was an 'excellent' film. It's a very political film. It is set in Jo'burg, South Africa and draws on apartheid and its form of 'separate development' with its black townships et al. Neill Blomkamp, the director, made a short (6 minutes), called 'Alive in Joburg' (2005) which I have yet to see, but I have a feeling that this film may be a sequel or at least on the same theme as that one, as it concerns an alien spaceship appearing over Jo'burg and the racist reception the aliens are given. In 'District 9' the storyline is good, the opening and closing docu-drama direction style is very effective, special effects are amazing, the acting is top drawer. See this film!"

I didn't realize that it was THAT strong.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant... I was blown away by the time it ended. There was so much going on that I couldn't believe that the film is going in that direction. The whole message is so deep and cleverly infiltrated into the plot.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley did an excellent job. Even though I've never heard of him I was amazed by his acting skills. God job and very convincing.<br/><br/>The special effects are good and realistic. The whole concept of the film is remarkable and unique. It shows the core of ""humanity"" and the fear of the unknown that transforms into aggression. It doesn't have to be the aliens, but others who are treated like they are ""NOT WELCOME"" and who are not in position to defend themselves.<br/><br/>It's scary, emotional, well-paced and thrilling experience. I was at the edge of my seat. It's not important to see this movie because of the effects... honestly, they are all good these days, but because of the message and it's originality.<br/><br/>I could go on and on just talking about this work of art, but I'll leave the others to get the point by watching this.

","One of the best of the year. District 9 is a intelligent, well made, well acted, action packed science fiction movie. Great story, great special effects and had enough in it's locker to keep me engaged for almost 2 hours. The mockumentary first part was quite funny but dragged in places and I began to wonder where the movie was going. But the second half made up for all of that and was absolutely awesome and this is where the film really comes into it's element. The movie projected themes we could all relate to and the fact that it all takes place in South Africa, gives it that Apartheid sort of feeling towards it. I actually felt sorry the aliens and the treatment they had to endure under their human caretakers. Bleeding red blood and having human eyes was a smart move to try and get the audience unto the side of the aliens. Performance wise, Sharlto Copley was annoying in the first half of the movie, but I ended up rooting for him towards the end. He was great, comedic and dramatical at the same time, never easy to do. Supporting cast do well also and maintain the flow of the of the movie. Special effects were absolutely great, the aliens look incredibly life like. They interacted so well with the humans, I actually forgot they were computer generated. All in all, Blompkamp has made an original sci fi movie that puts many of the other blockbusters of 09 to shame. Intelligent, well acted, great story and solid direction make District 9 a memorable and unique cinematic experience. Watch this NOW!!!"

"Rebel-Without-A-Crew","7","1","4","5 September 2009"," Interesting and surprising
","Firstly, this is by no means the 44th greatest film of all time. Well, that's where it's currently listed in this very site's top 250 films of all time. This is no A Clockwork Orange which is a mere 53rd; it's nothing compared to Raging Bull which is a whole 31 places bellow District 9; and, to compare it with another great sci-fi film, this doesn't even put a scratch on Alien – which is holding strong at 64. In fact, I'd be so bold as to say it doesn't even come close to the being in a list of the 250 greatest films ever made, but that's not my choice.<br/><br/>However, despite all this, District 9 is an amazing and surprising film which I highly recommend seeing; the film itself is truly one of the best films to come out this year. The film tells the story of a one Wikus van de Merwe, a worker for a fictional company called M.N.U. Although this does not seem to be a character film it truly is that. This film is one of the best films to come out, possibly in the last ten years, to have such a strong lead character played perfectly by Sharlto Copley.<br/><br/>Along with the excellent leading man the film is directed wonderfully by Niell Blomkamp, whose interesting shooting style and interesting camera-work keeps you from ever losing interest. Along with this the film has some of the best visual effects that when set against the slum of District 9 in which it is set seem almost real If you're into sci-fi, this is the film for you. If you like action – and you'd be surprised how much action this film actually has – this is the film for you. Also, if you like something with a deep political undertone, then this is defiantly the film for you. If you like all three you're sorted."
"Dunharrow","7","1","4","25 August 2009"," Not as good as it could have been
","It was entertaining. Innovative, even.<br/><br/>However, when a filmmaker begins with a premise that just shouts out 'Allegorical telling of Apartheid', you expect him to say something. To say something about man's corruption, about man's evil.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is pretty good at tapping into this. However, the allegory is wholly abandoned within the first hour, and it becomes a Sci-fi flick. It's a fine film. But could have been much better. <br/><br/>Also disappointing was the xenophobia and corruption by the native Africans. They don't pity the 'prawns', they prey on them. They become indistinguishable from the Afrikaners that created Apartheid. <br/><br/>Which then begs the question: Why South Africa? It served no purpose, other than taking the allegory and rubbing our faces in it. If the history of South Africa taught South Africans nothing.... Well, it makes sense, because this film also teaches nothing."
"griffolyon12","9","1","4","25 August 2009"," A Surprise!
","Aliens have been the source of many films since the fifties. Over the years, alien films have gotten far more sophisticated and less corny. District 9 is a perfect example of an alien film steeped in realism.<br/><br/>District 9 is the story of an alien race, referred to as Prawns, who twenty years agohad their ship break down over Johannesberg, South Africa. The Prawns were feared by humans and forced into slums called District 9. The story follows Wikas, an agent for MNU, the corporation who controls the Prawns. Wikas accidentally gets infected with Prawn technology, and after many odd outbursts, slowly begins to transform into an alien himself.<br/><br/>It is safe to say that District 9 is a fairly bizarre film, but in the best sense. It is odd at times, but that is mainly because there has never been anything quite like this before. Originality is bursting from the seams. The story is a superb allegory towards racism, the way in which the humans treat the Prawns is heartwrenching to watch, at times even disturbing as military soldiers hold guns to alien's heads. Very often when a film includes such themes and moralistic messages, many skip out upon viewing it, but District 9 manages to lace these themes within the package of a sci-fi action/thriller and it works beautifully to reach a wider audience.<br/><br/>The film was directed by first time director, Neil Blomkamp. Blomkamp has done a superb job here, evoking sympathy from his audience for these not too attractive alien creatures, in particular the father and son Prawns, who are probably the most prominent aliens in the film. Blomkamp has done the film in a pseudo-documentary style. It switches back-and-forth between a propulsive narrative, like your normal film, and between the faux documentary aspect, making the film and its world feel very rich and alive, while still getting a certain layer of depth to the characters. Of course the standout aspect of the film is its visual effects. I sat there wondering how this film was made for $30 million. The CGI is spectacular, being some of the finest I've seen this year and definitely worthy of Oscar contention in the visual effects category.<br/><br/>Overall, there isn't much bad to say about District 9. It's a deep, philosophical film that also has tons of action to boot, though due to the disturbing nature of certain scenes and the fact that this film is so different than anything you've probably ever seen, many filmgoers will probably not appreciate this film. Even still, District 9 is a terrific film, well worth a look for any die-hard fan of science fiction.<br/><br/>I give District 9 a 9 out of 10!"

","I want to stat off by saying that I went to see this movie ONLY because my boyfriend thought it sounded really cool and I have a very open mind artistically and am willing to give any movie as well as music and things such as that a chance. So let it be said, science fiction is NOT my thing... Say what you will about me after I state this but at this point and time I have yet to see ANY of the Star Wars movies in their entirety. I absolutely intend on seeing at least the first and deciding from there... That may all seem completely beside the point but I just want to make it clear the fact that I really am not a science fiction fan generally. Sooooo, when my boyfriend informed me he wanted to see this film I initially laughed, thinking he was joking cause after seeing a preview I just thought it looked ridiculous. Either way, this movie came out about 4 or 5 days ago (depending on if you go based on when you go to sleep or 12am=next day...) and I knew I was going to wind up seeing it sometime within the first weekend it was out. So, cutting to the chase, the boyfriend asks on Saturday to go see it with two friends and I was probably the one who least wanted to see this movie out of the four of us.

"andymcguckin","10","1","4","17 August 2009"," Excellent film with a stark message
","This film is one of the best films I have seen in many years because it asks the viewer to engage their brain and their conscience as well.<br/><br/>The film is about prejudice and the setting of South Africa is no accident as the eviction decree has the fascist bootprints of apartheid stamped all over it. The first ten minutes of this film are difficult to watch because of its eerily recalled riot suppression like in Soweto and other townships of the Apartheid era in South Africa. The MNU vehicles are all symbolic white as are their weapons again evocative of the apartheid era. Humanity's one fault over and over again has been the prejudice of difference and minorities. We see this starkly realised with the aliens, labelled 'Prawns', in the film being blamed for the rise in crime and we see signs of segregation where there are 'humans only' areas reminiscent of not only South Africa, but The United States as well.<br/><br/>Some see this film as funny in places, I don't! I realise that this film is telling us about how we will use anyone to get what we want these days. The weapons testing scenes are saying that the Military Industrial complex will do anything to make money. MNU, the company at the heart of the issue had chosen a scapegoat to go into District 9 and enforce the eviction order because the people higher up the corporate food chain needed someone to blame if it went badly. However Van De Merwe our anti-hero or accidental hero is contaminated and begins to transform into an alien and the old adage that you have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes before you understand them; this is his predicament and it comes crashing down on him as he realises that his own kind want to vivisect him and the only place he finds to hide is district 9 where he begins to understand the alien point of view. The substance that contaminated him is a fuel source that will enable the aliens to launch a rescue mission to their home system to eventually save the aliens and Van Der Merwe in 3 years and he will see what it is like to be an alien in this time as he will be one of them.<br/><br/>I believe this film is intended to show how easily prejudice occurs and before you realise it you are complicit in the oppression of another people, country, religion or just a minority with different views to yours. Van Der Merwe goes from being a tool of oppression to being saved and accepted by the oppressed people, a salutary lesson indeed.<br/><br/>I did find the Cloverfield documentary style a bit irritating, even although it is an aid to story exposition.<br/><br/>In the beginning Van Der Merwe is a man with a clipboard throwing his weight around and is not likable and the final scenes show a change. The change has the pathos of Frankenstein, with the now transformed Van Der Merwe making flowers and leaving them for his wife to find because he feels she wouldn't be able to accept as he is now and a sign of his love for his angel."
"choldren89","10","1","4","17 August 2009"," Best Movie I've seen this Summer
","At first I didn't have very high hopes for this film. I knew very little about it besides what I had seen in the very vague previews and a ""human's only"" add my friend had put up on her bathroom door. To me it just looked like a serious and more dramatic Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>I was wrong. This movie turned out to be amazing. In fact I'm even planning to see it again tonight with my girlfriend. The first half of the movie sets up a great storyline involving a government agent's job to inform the aliens of eviction. Although a friendly guy, you can tell he does look down upon the aliens in that he has a general prejudice towards them that many others share. As the story progresses our main character comes in contact with some alien technology. It's at this point that the story takes a turn leading to a dramatic and action- packed second half that will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Believe me, this isn't a movie just for sci-fi geeks. If you want to see a movie with a great story, great action, and the occasional laugh then I would highly recommend this."

","Firstly, the marketing campaign for this film was genius. Going into it all I knew was that there are aliens on Earth, and we don't want them here, that was about it. Second, the high quality mockumentary style was so well executed you almost forget that you are watching a fictional story with aliens. Also, it was nice to see great performances come out of unknown actors, that also added to the relatively surprising nature of this film. The method in which the aliens are portrayed is also a welcome change in the genre of science fiction. They are anthropomorphzed to a certain degree as to garner a level of sympathy for them, compared to the standard Hollywood alien that seeks to destroy/eat/enslave/exile humanity, Don't want to give away anymore details than that, just want to say that this is truly the first new and refreshing Sci-Fi that has come along in a very long time, DO NOT MISS IT!"

In so many ways, there is a twist, and yet, the twist is not really a twist at all. Is that vague enough?<br/><br/>The Cinéma vérité element of the film certainly draws one in. The essence of the film is thusly put forth in a paced and palatable manner.

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","1","4","16 August 2009"," The power of the unexpected
","I'm getting to be really sick of reading review after review of ""District 9"" praising it as a revelatory masterwork of great depth with superb social commentary to boot. It's not, and if this is what cerebral science fiction now is, that's very sad news for those of us who have devoted hours and hours and hours of our life to that great genre. ""District 9"", however, is an example of what action SF should aspire to. The content is substantial enough for the film to earn its desired emotional weight, the satire clever and incisive, the action very well-executed, the story fairly well though-out, and the delivery and construction of the film clever and powerful.<br/><br/>In short, this is what you'd want from an expensive genre production. It's a smart crowd-pleaser but also a fairly smart narrative in its own right. Criticisms of the movie's action-packed final act make little sense, as the entire film is paced as a thriller, and while there's no question the first two thirds are less chaotic and probably a great deal more focused than the last third, the transition is quite seamless and fits in perfectly. It's enough to sell the movie as 'cool' to sell tickets, but also part of the story and if not totally necessary that the scenes drag on for as long as they do (and that's really the movie's only major fault, there are too many contrivances leading up to explosions and badass weaponry), then at least they fit somewhat organically into the narrative. Sharlto Copley plays the lead extremely well, and he's apparently never acted in a movie before! Not bad, not bad.<br/><br/>The characters are pretty well-drawn overall, which is important in selling this sort of film. For once praising the effects is praising character, as the 'prawns' here become very sympathetic and convincing, convincing enough that in the crucial scenes you're not really always thinking 'that's fake' in the back of your head. The story is simple (Aliens come to earth. Aliens are forced into slums and camps and an apartheid system. The rest of the narrative isn't really worth spoiling), but is delivered in an interesting style which mixes faux-documentary and fiction narrative.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's debut as feature film director is extremely impressive. His handling of tone is remarkable, the ugly, bleak, and totally miserable mixes seamlessly with vicious satire and even some sillier comedic moments, and exciting, coherent action. He is destined for a great future in the film industry, and based on the overwhelming reaction to this film over the weekend, this might come to be known as one of the great mainstream debut features. It's not totally flawless, not at all, and one gets the nagging feeling that concessions to the mainstream derail the film a bit, but overall it's just a great roller-coaster ride, and a damned good effort from everyone involved from the director to the actors to the effects folk. It also possibly makes more of its relatively small budget than any other film I can think of. Very impressive film."

The other thing is i am getting tired of watching films like this where the hero is a blooming moron. Its called a convoluted plot device. The hero has to be stupid so he does the thing that gets him in trouble which is part of the premise of this film.Then they dump the mockumentary crap and start a great movie.

","Producer Peter Jackson and director Neill Blomkamp bring us to Johannesburg, South Africa where a pack of extra-terrestrials, called ""prawns"", are being evicted, and they also have a spacecraft that has been in the sky for 20 years. Also, MNU eviction officer Wikus gets sprayed by this weird, black alien liquid, and later on in the movie, he starts to grow alien claws, and he starts becoming non-human. Mainly, the whole film talks about innocence and risking the lives of others. Jackson and Blomkamp have created a well-organized feature with a talented cast, a shocking script, incredible visual effects, and a great mixture of mock-umentary, and live action. Sharlto Copley brings an incredible performance where he is scared as crap, as he gets dragged more and more into the dark side. I thought he should have received a Best Actor nomination in 2009 for his role in that movie. Director Neill Blomkamp knows how to arrange technologically advanced effects, an incredible script, a brilliant cast, and the feeling of documentary and live action, and brings it all together for a movie that involves everything ""alien"". ""District 9"" felt like a movie where it's ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" meets ""Transformers"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"". By meaning, the movie was met with use of alien effects, and with effects of robots and motion capture. This movie is menacing, suspenseful, thrilling, and every moment took us on the edge of our seat, and it made us wonder what will happen next. It's one of the best movies of the year, and it is a high recommendation for those who love alien movies. ""District 9"", in my review, ""a surprising thriller, with groundbreaking effects""."

","In ""Esthetic and Ethics"", a very interesting section of French script doctor Miguel Machalski's book, ""The Screenplay"", the author reminds us —one more time, because it is often forgotten— that every product of cultural consumption contains ideology. In ""District 9"", director and scriptwriter Neill Blomkamp tries to cover all bases: what a better center of contradiction, abuse and progress than South Africa, to place a suspended spacecraft above Johannesburg, where whites, blacks and aliens are all victims of the big businessmen of the planet, rulers of the World Organization of Nations (or something like that, a construct that is behind the omnipresent weapon factory MNU), and, after a discouraging ending, Blomkamp adds an even more pessimistic post scriptum, about the growing number of marginalized aliens on Earth, and the trial of the protagonist's assistant, for revealing secret MNU information. But as Machalski adds, ""Silence speaks volumes"", and besides the denunciation of world powers, organizations of united nations, and weapon manufacturers (generally, lumped together), there is no mention of the worldwide audiovisual industry, the biggest power on planet Earth, capable of the unspeakable —for being impossible to measure. Beyond this, the film is attractive during the first hour, with a style that mixes techniques of musical videos, TV reports and documentaries, and benefited with a cast of practically unknown faces that do not distract from the story. But around minute 64, the memory of ""Enemy Mine"" surges, and we go back, once again, to the 19th century melodrama, secure, comforting, conformist and reinforcing the status quo."

","District 9 is everything I love about science fiction. For me, Science Fiction at its very best is provocative enough to make you question what it means to be human, and consider deeply how you feel about those qualities. This film delivers all that while also terrifying and thrilling the audience with a very interesting story.<br/><br/>What would we do if an alien ship planted itself above any part of our world and didn't move – but also didn't attack us? How would we treat an alien race? Unfortunately, not terribly different than we treat each other sometimes. This movie explores these concepts with such realism and emotion that you almost believe you are watching a documentary. I am heartbroken by human evil, but I don't deny it's a very real thing. This movie touches the very core of that.<br/><br/>The production is phenomenal and the special effects are stunning. The acting is appropriate and raw when it should be. Even the ""prawns"" evoke real emotion, which is quite an accomplishment. The violence is extreme and not for the faint at heart, so prepare yourself.<br/><br/>So How Does It End? I didn't want to place any spoilers above this because I feel like this movie is best viewed with a clean slate, so please read no further if you haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>I was deeply touched by the ""prawn"" father/son relationship in this movie and feel it was key to a real connection with the viewer. The scene where the little ""prawn"" likes Wikus, and Christopher says its because ""you are the same"" I was deeply touched and tortured. There's something very profound and meaningful about the expression, ""walk a mile in their shoes."" It doesn't really have a true ending, but the final shot is haunting and beautiful. The mother ship leaves but not before promising to return and save all the ""prawns,"" as well as fix Wikus back into a human. I was sickened as the final MNU mercenary was ripped to pieces by the ""prawns"" because I was wondering how much of their violence was true to their nature and how much of it was a response to our treatment of them.<br/><br/>This film makes you question what you might be capable of in the face of fear or the unknown. It also makes you wonder whether you would have the strength to achieve redemption if given the opportunity. It is thought provoking and wildly entertaining. While it is not without a few flaws, it is an excellent and unique film. I give it 5 out of 5."
"Tweekums","9","1","5","10 June 2011"," Aliens in Jo'burg
","In films when a giant spacecraft arrives on Earth the aliens are greeted by friendly humans then to proceed to wage war on humanity; here things are different. When the aliens arrive their ship doesn't appear to be functioning and they are starving. The million or so alien refuges are then forced to live in the eponymous District 9; a squalid Johannesburg township. Here they live for twenty years until it is decided to move them away from the city. The man in charge of the evacuation is Wikus Van de Merwe; an ordinary civil servant, certainly not the sort of character one would expect to take the lead in a science fiction action film. While serving eviction notices he accidentally becomes contaminated by an alien device, he soon gets ill and is horrified when one of his arms becomes like that of the aliens. His superiors don't help him though; they take him to a lab where they plan to vivisect him as his new arm gives him the ability to fire alien weapons something no other human can do. He manages to escape but the only place he can hide is in District 9; here he will have to earn the trust of the aliens as well as avoiding security forces who want to capture him and Nigerian gangsters who want to eat his arm! His struggle will see him fighting his own people alongside an alien is some fairly spectacular and slightly gory action scenes.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film; it made a nice change to see a film set in modern Africa that wasn't a worthy film about various bad things happening to the people there. It is possible to see the treatment of the aliens as a metaphor for the old apartheid system but it isn't too heavy-handed. I don't know if the actors are well known in South Africa but they were all unknown to me, which had the advantage that I didn't immediately know who the hero of the film, was going to be. Much of the early part of the film was filmed as though it was being filmed by a news-crew giving it a realistic feel even when there were loads of CGI aliens on screen! The actors were good; especially Sharlto Copley who played Van de Merwe; he wasn't your standard action hero but brought plenty of humanity and a degree of vulnerability to the role. If you are a fan of science fiction and haven't seen this yet I highly recommend you give it a go."
"dan_libra","9","1","5","22 September 2010"," Beyond superficiality
","Whether intentionally or by accident the creators of this movie concocted one of the most original and unorthodox sci-fi movies in the recent history. It is not perfect but it is certainly not conventional in typical Hollywood sense.<br/><br/>This is the movie where I think you can find a lot of things to think about, besides the wrapper of explosions, gore, aliens and space ships.<br/><br/>But let's dispense first with the superficial. The special effects in this movie are astounding in their realism and relevance. The movie doesn't feel overburdened with them nor do they take the priority over the plot of the movie. Unlike in many modern movies, the special effects here seem to be seamless with the rest of the movie and help deliver it's punch ever more successfully (Avatar comes to the mind where my feelings are completely the opposite - brainless assemblage of special effects)<br/><br/>Here are some things and ideas that I think District 9 raises and leaves the viewer to think about (and perhaps this will answer some of their criticisms of the movie)<br/><br/>1) We as humans anywhere on this planet are inherently racist and suspicious of anybody acting or looking differently than we are no matter what our race is or nationality. This quality is perhaps a part of our animal nature and transcends our race origins. There is a large history of white colonialism and apartheid, however it is a mistake not to see that any groups of people in power, majority or any significant numbers have inherent prejudices toward other groups that are somehow different from them. We don't have to go very far in history or geography for an example: the Rwanda genocide.<br/><br/>2) Why aliens became a subjugated formless mass or what separates the civilized advanced society from the mass of people simply fulfilling their base desires? We live in an advanced society filled with computers, advanced metallurgy, advanced chemical processing, space shuttles and particle colliders. But take a hundred individuals off the street and how many know how to and where to find, mine and process ore, how to synthesize various chemical compounds, how to create semiconductors, perform integration or differentiation or recite a table of chemical elements. The fact is it took a humongous amount of time of trial and error and a few geniuses to propel our understanding of the world. Where would we be without Newton, Gauss, Copernicus, Archimedes, Enstein, Darwin, Tesla and etc.<br/><br/>3) Why sometimes a superior mass of people cannot/doesn't rebel against it's oppressors? Well we don't have to travel very far in history to see such examples: Holocaust, various terrorist hostage situations where a handful of terrorists can command a huge number of people.<br/><br/>But the movie is not just the ideas, it is also filled with truthfully delivered drama of the main hero struggle to first fall in-line and do his job, then with his egotistic desire to save himself and any cost and finally liberating himself for own sacrifice to help the suffering creatures."
"kurronbhatt","10","1","5","17 July 2010"," The best and most original sci-fi masterpiece of this millennium
","'District 9' comes across as a sci-fi drama which is highly realistic in nature, mainly considering the basic backdrop, being Johannesburg, and not the usual Manhattan, Washington, etc. The writer/director Neil Blomkamp set out to create a film about the differences in social awareness within different communities. In this case, he has well presented the race issue in Africa, metaphorically represented by the 'prawns'(blacks) and humans(whites).<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is a delight. The camera-work and editing, used for the unique documentary look, were perfect. The special effects blended with real backgrounds created an amalgam which is highly praiseworthy. The story is very fresh and the screenplay is highly engaging due to a great pace. The character development couldn't have been better. All the actors did their home-work quite well for the authentic output. But, of course, the pick of the lot, is the central character, Wikus Van De Merwe, played brilliantly by débutant Sharlto Copley. He makes the viewer feel the pain and anguish that he suffers during the 'transformation'.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a terrific movie-going experience. The audiences will be eagerly waiting for Blomkamp's next venture, especially the sequel. I would place this film in my 'Top 10 sci-fi films of all time' list with 'The Matrix', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', 'Blade Runner', 'Avatar', 'WALL·E', 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial', 'Alien', '2001: A Space Odyssey'and 'Inception'."
"seishino","9","1","5","28 March 2010"," Painfully gripping
","This is not a feel-good movie. This is not a movie that will give you a sense of accomplishment over impossible odds, or will leave you imbued with the permanence of human spirit and love. This is a gripping, gritty, sad tale of one man's descent into the mess that he helped architect. In that respect, it is an incredibly compelling movie. The subject matter is an only vaguely masked parable about the squalid conditions in South African relocation camps. We the audience become exposed to the details of power politics, acquiring food, having children, and making a living in the middle of this disposed community. We see the abuses of the haves from the have-nots, and the dark ways the have-nots respond.<br/><br/>The Science Fiction aspects are never backseat to the political messages. How the bug society functions, and more importantly how the humans respond to it, are all thoroughly and uniquely fleshed out. The movie never loses focus on the meaning of human interactions, but the science aspects are simultaneously well fleshed out.<br/><br/>Do not go into this movie expecting Aliens, Total Recall, Close Encounters, or Men in Black. This is a very different experience, similar in tone to a World War 2 biopic. I'd consider it one of the most ""important"" movies Hollywood has produced this decade. It isn't fun, or satisfying, or pleasant. But it is deeply meaningful, and very much worth experiencing."

","I didn't know what to expect before watching District 9, and i'm not sure quite what i think of it having seen it. Ostensibly a sci film set in South Africa where travelling aliens have been settled the story, told in past tense, follows the strange events of MNU alien evictor Wikus Van De Merwe. Ultimately he's wanted by the aliens, humans, and the Nigerian gangsters who operate out of District 9 - think Aliens crossed with The Fugitive. Blomkamp's real success here is taking a fairly standard human story along the lines of wrongful conviction and giving it a unique alien twist. In the opening chapter of the film i expected a sci fi with social commentary but in the end this work of art really is about the person at the heart of the plot and his tragic fall from grace. The direction is superb throughout - from CCTV to hand-held to newsreel to interviews with witnesses it really is a masterclass in technique. To the point even that the heart-string tugging ending doesn't seem trite, it's a little clichéd perhaps but those clichés are really just standard filmic techniques being deployed to maximum desired effect. The effects too are definitely worthy of glowing praise - to come up with the creature effects and designs are one thing, but to so seamlessly interweave them with live action is incredible: it really does feel at times like a genuine documentary. All things considered District 9 is an overwhelming success that should be sen to be believed, there are unanswered questions from the outset but maybe here the problem is that i'm asking unimportant questions rather than the film not fulfilling its full potential. A film i'll watch again and again, worth a DVD purchase."

","No doubt, Avatar is a great, wonderful movie, worthy every second of it - but District 9 is a top notch sci-fi drama, outstanding in all aspects, the like of which very rarely emerges on big or small screen. Avatar is a ride on a theme park attraction; District 9 penetrates your heart and soul and stays with you long after the play is over. It has that quality, that something that can't be explained, but makes all the difference. It's not a movie for the general public or the weak of heart, though, as it's loaded with tension, suspense, and death, all of these masterfully conceived and executed. Temptation to go for a sequel should be resisted: this one-of-a-kind opus should probably be better if left alone, notwithstanding the (probably intentional) minor plot holes and the story's outcome making space for at least one more look at the ""prawns""."

","Try picturing this: you're a visual effects artist and aspiring filmmaker, and your work has caught the right person's eye, so much that said person gives you the chance to direct a highly anticipated video game-based movie. For various reasons, the project falls apart, but instead of leaving you empty-handed, that same person gives you a useful sum of money to make any picture you want. Doesn't happen every day, does it? Which is what makes District 9 such a terrific achievement: shot for only 30 million dollars after the proposed Halo film was shelved, it was made simply because producer Peter Jackson (yes, the man who made a certain Oscar-winning trilogy) believed in the talent of first-time director Neill Blomkamp. The finished product proves his faith wasn't misplaced.<br/><br/>Based on Blomkamp's earlier short film, Alive in Joburg, the movie's faux-documentary storytelling focuses on a tricky situation taking place in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa: for twenty years, a spaceship has been standing still in the sky above the city, while the aliens that came with it are forced to live in a slum called District 9. Cruelly mocked by the locals, who call them ""prawns"", the only reason they are still alive and well is they possess technology the army and the MNU (Multi-National United) find interesting. One day, however, the creatures are meant to be evicted, and during the procedure one particularly ambitious but dimwitted MNU employee, Wikus van der Werve (Sharlto Copley), is infected with a substance that slowly starts transforming him into an alien. As his condition worsens, he must collaborate with the ""prawns"" if he ever wishes to become normal again.<br/><br/>What strikes the most about District 9 is that, unlike most science fiction films, it focuses on ideas rather than impressive effects: undoubtedly due in part to the low budget, this enables Blomkamp to deliver an anti-blockbuster that is really about people, not aliens. Following his own Alive in Joburg template, he goes for a hand-held, gritty, fast-paced style and chose to shoot the entire film on location in his home town for a very specific reason: look past the fact that the slum is inhabited by extra-terrestrials, and this could easily be a documentary about life during apartheid (something Blomkamp experienced). The use of science fiction as an allegory isn't anything new (after all, the word ""alien"" derives from the Latin ""alienus"", which means ""other"" or ""different""), but in the decrepit locales of District 9 it becomes frighteningly real. The unique setting is also a refreshing change of scenery after countless UFO stories set in America (remember the gag in Monsters vs. Aliens?).<br/><br/>Another kicker, perhaps more impressive than the bold screenplay and direction, is Copley's central performance, and not just because his character undergoes a truly moving, Cronenbergian transformation (echoes of The Fly are evident throughout). No, the astonishing thing about his work is that, for one thing, he'd never acted before (minus a cameo as a sniper in Alive in Joburg), and, on top of it all, he improvised every single line, which explains why, like in Judd Apatow's body of work, every other sentence is deliciously profane (and the South African accent makes it even funnier). And for those worrying about the budget's impact on any set-pieces, rest assured: Wikus's metamorphosis from human to alien is matched by the film's move to recognizable sci-fi elements (although still done intelligently), including a climactic battle that is scaled down compared to, say, Transformers, but pretty spectacular nonetheless (not to mention refreshingly bloody).<br/><br/>In short, District 9 is a miracle of sorts: a small sci-fi movie that thinks big, delivering the goods whilst keeping its focus firmly on storytelling and thematic relevance first, and action second. A stunning piece of work."
"antonjsw1","10","1","5","24 January 2010"," A taut, engrossing and involving science fiction classic
","This is a superb film.<br/><br/>While dark and violent, the gore is not too much in your face. In fact the violence is played for dark humor the film as a more subtle, but similar vein to the way that director Paul Verhoeven used black humour in ""Robocop"" and ""Starship Troopers"".<br/><br/>The story is this films strength. It is dense and interesting, which rewards the viewer as when seeing it again other things come to light. The social comment is there in spades, from the less subtle metaphors for apartheid (in a general rather than specific sense) to the more subtle comments of creation of a subclass, corporate greed,conspiracy, personal prejudice (and a personal reassessment of it)and the very clever use of the use of cat food as both a plot device and further social comment.<br/><br/>The directing is superb for a first time film-maker. While the interspersing of mockumentary recordings with a traditional film structure does take a bit of getting used to ( the cinematography between the mockumentary and conventional filmic scenes is too similar - it should have been degraded it a bit more) this is the only very minor quibble I had with this movie. What is so good is that the directing is restrained and controlled, as is the special effects (kudos to all the companies involved). The alien characters are can be related to, particularly the 'alien son' character. Very impressive when considering the size of the films budget compared to usual Hollywood fare. It is certainly true that this film is a classic example of 'less is more'.<br/><br/>The acting really brings the story to life. There is not a bad performance anywhere. Small parts are incredibly well realised and really allow you to connect with all the characters - all I can say is bravo. The actor who plays the reference for the key Alien characters is superb and his relationship with his 'son alien' character brings an incredible amount of heart to the story. In fact, is allows the films climax and pay off to be incredibly emotional and powerful, even though its not a neat stereotypical one.<br/><br/>However, the ultimate star in the acting department has to be Sharlto Copley, who performance as a corporate drone who undergoes a transformation both literally, but more importantly psychologically, is a tour de force and I find is really surprising that this performance was not acknowledged sufficiently at formal award ceremonies. It was known that their was a lot of improvisation in his acting, which certainly has contributed to a fascinating character that you end up really caring for by the end of the film. The character's personal journey was what keeps you engrossed throughout the film, and shows you don't need a $200-$300 million dollar budget, a 3 hour running time, and expensive action/special fx sequences in every frame to make a sci-fi movie that lots of people will enjoy, remember and think about after they have seen it.<br/><br/>Having said that, the action sequences are extremely well done, with a reality,inventiveness and black humour to them. In fact, they remind me of the low budget inventiveness of films such as the original 'Terminator','Robocop' and 'Predator' from the 80s, which had to figure out what could be achieved without CG. Film-makers had to create a better balance of inserted post production effects with effects on camera filmed live.<br/><br/>Design and and cinematography, shooting with digital cameras rather than film was excellent(apart from the minor aforementioned gripe). The music by Clinton Shorter, while similar in style to Terminator and the Zimmer/Newton Howard Batman scores, works very well with the film, particularly with the layering in of native music and sounds.<br/><br/>In all a fantastic achievement. I look forward, after 3 to 4 years to the follow up, which will hopefully follow in the traditional of the tradition of Aliens, T2 and The Dark Knight as strong sequels to an excellent initial film."

"TheEtherWalk","9","1","5","18 December 2009"," How to make a great action movie with a relatively small budget
","District 9 takes place in South Africa, and the story centers around a government worker assigned to help relocate the first aliens to ever land on Earth. The massive ship they came in has broken down, and they have nowhere to go. The aliens live in the giant shanty town of District 9 and live off of garbage; clearly they are undignified creatures. But they are not stupid. They have advanced weaponry that only they can use, because it responds only to alien DNA.<br/><br/>The main character, Wikus, played by the excellent Sharlto Copley, becomes infected by a strange liquid while inspecting an alien dwelling, and begins a hideous transformation. Now having partial alien DNA, he has to hide from the government goons who want to sell his parts for astronomical amounts of money, as well as local gangs who want him for his ability to use the aliens weapons.<br/><br/>The story is highly original and quite compelling. Wikus is a guy you can cheer for the whole way through, and his character is developed brilliantly. He sort of reminded me of Lionel from Braindead: a quiet, dorkish man who ends up becoming a total badass through sheer determination to live. On a side note, Jed Brophy (Void from Braindead) makes an appearance in the film, although I'm not quite sure when. Having Peter Jackson as producer clearly helped the film immensely, and his WETA digital team helped make amazing CGI shots for a budget of only $30 million. Take that, Michael Bay!<br/><br/>One of the aliens becomes a main character partway through the movie, and maybe it was just me, but it was hard to care about a hideous CGI prawn alien and his son, probably because it's hard for their personalities to come through the tentacles and whatnot. As a result, the story of him and his son trying to return to the mother-ship ends up being the weakest part of the movie for me, and the story gets slightly overpowered by the visuals. This is a minor complaint however, and the strong social themes throughout the film make it a fairly edifying experience.<br/><br/>The trailer made this look like a small budget sci-fi film with a little bit of action. Let me tell you, this movie has bigger and better action than most movies with 3 times the budget. The last half hour is a gory, bullet riddled extravaganza like nothing you've ever seen. The cinematography is brilliant, putting the viewer right in the middle of the action, and the visual effects of the weaponry, the ships, and an amazing, near-indestructible mech suit are nothing short of mind blowing.<br/><br/>There will no doubt be a sequel to this, as the ending leaves many things open. Although it is not quite a masterpiece, District 9 is one of the most entertaining and unique films of the year."

","Peter Jackson has used his name to gain the widespread hype and attention needed for a film like this to succeed. That's a good thing, but the film is actually directed by Neill Blomkamp, a South African director who shows a need for a different mentor, if that is their working relationship. Blomkamp's structure shows both elegant and sardonic economy in giving us the exposition. District 9 is a self-contained, symbolic parable that sets out as a documentary made in a sci-fi universe. Oddly enough, it gradually begins to almost literally dissolve into a bullet-paced thriller, and from there an exploding bodies convention. But when it does, the story has entirely absorbed you in its backhand-slaps.<br/><br/>The story, adapted from a short film by Blomkamp, is told by way of the sci-fi genre so that the social issues relevant to him through what he's seen so closely are dealt with from a fresh, exotic perspective. Indeed, the title itself, as well as the premise, of District 9 are apparently drawn from events in South Africa during the apartheid in Cape Town called District Six. That is all I should say, because the strongest element to the tension is the way it conceals each still developing plot point so that it all surprises us from the very beginning. I am curious as to how closely the true story and the plot of the movie resemble each other, if the real account has been degraded by the artifice, especially when the climax devolves into nonstop futuristic gunfire turning countless figures in a row into showers of gore and goop.<br/><br/>Whatever the case may be, it is absolutely refreshing to see a sci-fi film with truly engaging concepts rather than machine wars or magical lands that have no bearing on anything whatsoever, which though they have their quality canons have been done to bland and stale excess. And the special effects, set design and various facets of practical and aesthetic details build organically from those clear concepts and serve both allegorical and perspective-shifting backstory purposes. The acting is not pat by any means, but rather ingeniously real in the case of a few particular main players. Sharlto Copley, who evidently was reluctant to take on the role, is totally and completely becoming as his neurotic, quick-on-feet character.<br/><br/>I don't believe that most special effects-driven American audiences, including the audience with whom I saw the movie, want to think about what it's trying to say about state reliance on worldwide corporations as a means of privatized government and military. But I'm sure that they'll enjoy their fictional representatives here as evil characters they'll love to hate. I doubt they'll know or particularly care if the film refers to contemporary evictions and forced removals to new suburban ghettos in post-apartheid South Africa and the resistance of their residents. Most Americans are all but unaware of the high-profile attempted forced removal of Cape Town settlements to temporary relocation areas or evictions in the shack settlements. But I believe they'll deeply sympathize with the oppressed aliens in the film. And it is that audience reaction that will gratify those in the know, many of whom will be people, like me, who only read up after seeing the movie. And that is the most important benefit of films like this."

","Just the other day, I was lamenting the fact that films these days seem to spend less than 5 minutes building up the story and developing characters. Then this film came along.<br/><br/>District 9 started off in a documentary/news style, which made it appear more 'real'. The film took its time building up the kind of man that Wikus was, and we the audience are better for it. From start to finish, there is a real transition in his character development, which is something that's generally lacking in films (not just science fiction films).<br/><br/>What sets District 9 from other alien films is that it avoids sci-fi techspeak. Yes, there are some great CGI effects, and we see all manner of explosions. But the way the story is delivered, it was social commentary disguised as a sci-fi film. It reminds us that we're all suspicious and prejudiced against things we don't understand.<br/><br/>This film made me feel the same way as The Shawshank Redemption. Ultimately, it's a film about hope. A film that shows how cruel people are (or can be), and how (despite all that) the protagonist is shown not to have acted in vain.<br/><br/>If you like films that aren't completely predictable and even a little leftfield form the norm, you won't be disappointed with District 9. Yes, certainly elements of the film are predictable (as with any film), but ultimately I doubt many viewers can actually 'see' where the film is going after the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>~ squodge ~"

Above all is its creativeness, this is what I was left to admire most. For people that question this, they Clearly do not keep in mind that this situation is 20 years from when the Aliens first arrived, and the parody to South Africa's past is a clear reminder to what us Humans are really like and a wonderful alternative concept to the usual Aliens visit the earth film, where 'paranoid rednecks' often wonder around with shotguns, or one A Lister takes on an entire army of pan galactic super beings from the third dimension, ( always reminding the Aliens that it is our humanity that cuts us apart).<br/><br/>A top score of 10 is well deserved, as this has all the hall marks of being marked down as a classic, and a marker for all future films to try to equal or better."

The core of this film is politically fuelled but there are comedic elements too so it really will appeal to a wide audience.<br/><br/>Whether you're into Sci-Fi or not, if you like a movie to keep you captivated this is the one to check out.

Why had they come? Why had their ship not moved? Why had they needed to be released from their ship? Who was the captain? Why, if they had these great weapons, had they never used them? Hadn't ANY earthling learned anything about the alien technology? Why had ""Christopher"" been in hiding for 20 years? Wasn't it tremendously coincidental that the moment Christopher finished harvesting the secret fluid was the same moment he was being evicted? How is it that fluid that somehow energized the alien ship also had the property to transmutate Wickus? (Was that the same secret, amazing fluid -- in black form -- Mr. Spock used in this year's Star Trek? I haven't seen the new Harry Potter yet, but am I going to see more secret, wonderful fluid there? -- perhaps in green?) What was the deal with cat food?

","District 9 is one of the most original, emotional, and just plain amazing science fiction movies released in many years.<br/><br/>Its young director has managed something truly extraordinary, weaving together a multi-layered fable in which inhuman treatment of alien refugees in South Africa is a direct analogy to the gone-but-not-forgotten apartheid regime, but also discusses far more wide-reaching issues of racism, political expediency, corporate inhumanity, and the evil that human beings perpetrate upon one another.<br/><br/>Probably the film's most amazing achievement is how effortlessly it makes us despise the humans in the film and barrack for the aliens. Even the film's human protagonist vacillates between reluctant hero and desperate coward, allowing his fear and selfishness to guide his actions at several important points in the story.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable film, made on a relatively small budget, and exhibiting an extraordinary degree of sure-footedness for a first feature. In can be violent at times, but never gratuitously so - everything that happens is in aid of the story.<br/><br/>District 9 is an instant cult classic, and I hope it achieves the kind of box office it so richly deserves."

","When you first start watching this EXCELLENT film, you want to compare it to Alien Nation. However, this film takes a different approach. Rather than the human race almost happily welcoming the ""Prawn"" into society, we shun them, and treat them disgustingly.<br/><br/>The documentary approach to presenting this film makes it nearly believable. It gives you an honest impression of what our race would do, and how it would treat, a stranded alien race. How our species would prey on them to advance our own, and subjugate them into a second class stature.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the weak of heart. It is not exactly a ""gore fest"" alien movie, but one filled with social parallels, and social commentary.<br/><br/>Some are saying that this is currently the ""best Sci-Fi movie, EVER"", but I would definitely place in in the top five."

","There's a scene at the beginning of O Brother Where Art Thou where a blind seer foresees ""many ob-stackles"" to be overcome by the three heroes -- a light-hearted slam at the story pyramid version of Aristotelian aesthetics. Act One sets the scene until turning point 1 creates rising action. Act Two builds to a climax and turning point 2. Act Three provides resolution after many ob-stackles are overcome during falling action. Without the ob-stackles, you don't really have a movie, goes the received wisdom. Serious critics will complain about a ""lack of obstacles,"" implying a movie is lame or shallow because it doesn't follow guidelines now taken as gospel.<br/><br/>Many stories just don't need a slew of meaningless ob-stackles to provide a satisfying path. District 9 is one of those stories.<br/><br/>Despite howling plot devices -- fuel that doubles as a genetic virus, a control unit that falls conveniently from the alien spacecraft, a Nigerian criminal who follows the evil genius rules (never kill Bond when you can blather while he unties his hands), pivotal characters repeatedly meeting by chance -- we buy into the suspension not only of disbelief but also of impatience with formulaic laziness, due exclusively to the exotic nature of the set decoration, locale and CGI creatures. Unfortunately, that all falls apart when the hero engages in a standard chase containing so many homage points they're not worth tallying. And in that chase, we encounter, and become impatient with, many ob-stackles.<br/><br/>It's a credit to the set decoration, locale and CGI creatures that with all that I still rate District 9 six stars."

","The movie was.. good in its illustration of outer-worldly humanoids that, instead of taking over the future earth and blasting Mount Rushmore with the mothership, for whatever reason just hovered above the damn thing for a good long time until well the humans found that they were their refugees. Now, it had everything transcending average movie elements other than a plot that wasn't so﻿ predictable. Annoying foreign man mistreats aliens like all other overly aggressive humans in the movie, suddenly discovers some alien green goo that changes his genes, hah, and then he saves the aliens by fighting the big bad humans! Instead of dying a horrible death that he should.<br/><br/>Is it an accurate representation of how humans would treat their outer-worldly friends? Probably not. We certainly wouldn't bring them from their ship to earth and wonder at what to do about them after tossing them in some landfill in south Africa. Also, why is the almighty omnipresent media able to enter dangerous combat zones in District 9 everywhere the scenes turn; mercenaries mindlessly shooting our smarter humanoid counterparts every waking moment does not seem strangely unproductive to the future world? Little smidges like that build up and leave me quite bored and unenthralled towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I suppose the movie is exceptional to the average unsuspecting populace who overrates dazzling action, sci-fi movies such as this."
"Vic_max","Null","1","5","17 August 2009"," This time, we're the problem, not the aliens ...
","I liked this movie. It was definitely not a traditional sci-fi theme (like ... destroy the monster, save the world, destroy the scientific breakthrough that mankind isn't ready for). It was more of a tense sociological theme where a large number of aliens are being interned in an impoverished, restricted living zone. It kind of brings to mind ""Alien Nation"" from the late 1980s.<br/><br/>Aside from the above, this movie has several things going for it. First, the alien effects are pretty darn good - modern monster design is hard and these folks did a really good job. The pacing was good - there were no dead areas in the film where nothing is happening. There were also no big-name actors used, so the movie succeeds on Peter Jackson's association and the power of the acting, script and production - which were all good. It's also great to see that this movie only cost $30M; I hope this encourages studios to greenlight more of these movies.<br/><br/>Now, the movie is not without a few issues. I would liked to received some more background info on the aliens and what has been learned about them. Also, a lot of the scenes were a bit formulaic, so as soon as you see the setup, you know the outcome.<br/><br/>However, all in all, there's a lot to like here. If you're a sci-fi fan, I recommend seeing it. You'll either really like it, or at worst, think it's decent. It's the most interesting offbeat alien scifi movie in a while and we'll probably see a sequel in the not too distant future."

They could have made a series out of it and blew a lot of the garbage out of the water that is being shown on prime time TV.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the story and the characters.

","I just got back from seeing this and thought it was good - as in a solid 7 out of 10 good. There are a lot of perfect ratings, which I think has to do with people not expecting much going into it. The previews do a great job of not giving the drama away. To me a 9 or a 10 would be ALIEN, ALIENS or the first two TERMINATOR flicks.<br/><br/>I like my eye candy, even if it's only a tracking shot of a desolate ROAD WARRIOR landscape. My main DISTRICT 9 criticism is the shaky cam, washed out, docu-style shooting. Considering the setting is a slum, this approach looks even worse. I would have preferred smooth photography and shadowy lighting. Now, that doesn't keep me from enjoying BLAIR WITCH or CLOVERFIELD, but I think of how much more I would enjoy these movies without that docu-style gimmick. Granted, this camera work is nowhere near as disorienting as those two, but I can't say that I want to eagerly revisit this world of shaky slum shots. The movie is like SLUM DOG ALIEN MILLIONAIRE! <br/><br/>Some people are in awe of this being ""only"" a 30 million dollar movie. Did you expect Peter Jackson to ratchet up the WETA bill on his own production, or go with the low bid? There are no 20 million dollar actors in this. The aliens and effects are the stars of the movie, supported by a cast of unknowns. That's a good thing, because if the lead character was played by Tom Cruise, you would have certain anticipations. With the character of Wikus Van De Merwe, you don't know what to expect and that's the way it should be.<br/><br/>What worked best about this movie was how the storytelling would paint the main character into a corner and arc him out of it. It's a classic polar transformation. What is equally impressive is the morphing of the aliens into something we ultimately care about.<br/><br/>I like a lot of sci-fi and horror, so where does DISTRICT 9 sit for the year? I have to admit that I enjoyed STAR TREK a lot more. I would put this one in the mix with TERMINATOR: SALVATION and OUTLANDER. I really enjoyed those, more than probably most people. (I wouldn't ever expect McG to direct to the level of James Cameron, so no disappointment on my end.) Those movies are all easy on the eyes, whereas DISTRICT 9's superior characterization is counterbalanced by ugly backgrounds and photography. (I don't care how intentional that is, it made me enjoy it less than its potential.) TRANSFORMERS 2 was shallow fun, but sits near the bottom of my list. I still have to see WOLVERINE, but am not expecting much from it. EDEN LOG was just okay and if I had to pick on a movie, it would be DANTE 01, which was beautiful to look at, but bored me to tears. I haven't seen MUTANT CHRONICLES and some others.<br/><br/>I'm anxiously awaiting PANDORUM, SURROGATES, DAYBREAKERS and the year end biggie,...James Cameron's AVATAR. Cameron's movies are what most modern sci-fi is compared to, so I'm anxious to see if he can live up to the hype after his long hiatus. I think DISTRICT 9 will probably end up as one of my favorite top 3 or 4 sci-fi movies for 2009, which is a good showing."

As with Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Cloverfield, destruction looms huge above us but we are stripped of our omnipresent role and given the subjective, exclusively human pov. We merely steal upwards glimpses of the larger theater. We'll see a few more films in this direction I'm sure, that will build on the failings of these attempts.<br/><br/>Sure, there is a storytelling spine that guides the vision. Familiar reversals, about a flawed protagonist who must rediscover his lost humanity (and limited pov) by broadening his view to encompass the other, the opposite. And the obvious social metaphor that gives it some topical relevance.

","Nominated for Best Picture and some audiences thought it should even win, District 9 is an instant science fiction classic that looks beautiful and entertaining.<br/><br/>In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed ""The Prawns,"" appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years later, the human are starting to get annoyed by the aliens and want them gone. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley, newcomer) in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends. Although this is his first official acting role, Copley is the best at it. Playing the role like he was an experienced actor, Sharlto Copley was unfortunately snubbed from the Oscar race.<br/><br/>The visual effect amazingly vivid and the make up is stunning, but perhaps what is more important is the writing. Writing alien/human interaction is obviously not new, but there is something incredibly refreshing about District 9's script that made the movie all the better. Nominated for an Oscar, Neill Blomkamp's first major writing job is quiet impressive and he's definitely got a career in writing ahead of him.<br/><br/>District 9 was absolutely deserving of the Best Picture nomination and perhaps the best science fiction film of 2009."

The animation was awesome and the storyline original. The movie makes us question things about tolerance and trust. In the movie, we see that the aliens whom had grown up there had simply copied the local human population when it comes to behavior. We also get to know that as good as all of the aliens are﻿ of a ""workers caste"" and not amongst the ""brightest"" of their species.<br/><br/>The main character makes a transformation from treating the aliens inhuman to identifying with them after becoming﻿ a victim of biological exposure. He started out this innocent coward to a kind of hero. It ended quite well with a lot of action.<br/><br/>The director himself has stated that he wanted to show the similarities between the treatment of﻿ the prawns (unemployment, forced location, and intolerance) and the treatment of black South Africans during apartheid. He's know for his past films about apartheid. So.... No, not racial and in fact I'm totally correct. Maybe you should Wikipedia, the facts instead of trying to insult young kids that are only guilty of posting their opinions. If you don't like the movie, go somewhere else.<br/><br/>Well he threw in hints of﻿ similarities, not a direct plot about apartheid. Like I said, the director has made several films about apartheid so this one is a SCI-Fi film with subtle similarities. I seriously don't think the direct goal was to make the viewer reflect all the similarities but just give them a little something to think about between the action sequences. I think you're taking it all a little too much to heart. It's an action Sci-Fi film and personally, I think it's a great one! If your going to watch it and you have a faint stomach for vomit, watch out in the beginning.... Ha.... Kind of disturbing but otherwise, Best movie﻿ ever!"

","90/100. What an amazingly imaginative film, and it has a totally unique plot and you can't help admire a filmmaker who can present something so unusual in an era known for borrowing plots from other films. This is not all flash and special effects, it has a real story to tell, and a very interesting one at that, with fine character development, realistic and stylish cinematography, it's brilliantly edited, and a heart pounding score that enhances the film. It's exciting with a pace that takes your breath away. The special effects are indeed special. This isn't a film just for sci-fi fans, it is an amazing tale of relationships and human behavior."
"jarretch","9","1","6","14 December 2009"," The summers best film
","The best movie I saw this summer. A great blend of action special effects with some thought provoking allegory. Despite how grandiose the special effects and action sequences are at times, the film's drama does not get upstaged by them. The acting was quite good as well, Sharlto Copley gives a tour de force performance in the leading role. I have a feeling we are going to be seeing a lot more of him in the future. I was equally impressed with the direction of Neill Blomkamp, who also co-wrote the films screenplay along with Terri Tatchell. This is the type of movie Hollywood is capable of making, but so often does not. I have a feeling that when we look back in 15 to 20 years: we will be saying that District 9 was to Blomkamp what The Terminator was to James Cameron. This film will undoubtedly go down as a sci-fi classic. The best film of the summer, one of the top 10 films of the year so far."
"Turbotape","6","1","6","14 November 2009"," Vacuous misanthropy
","This could have been a subtle and thought-provoking portrayal of the dark sides of mankind – instead it presents its message as wet defecation spurting out all over the place in an attempt at social and political satire. The film, which technically is a masterpiece, could have shown us how we as humans meet the unknown with fear and prejudice. How the single individual may appear as devoid of malice, while it as a part of a group might contribute to incomprehensible evil. Instead the film chooses to present the humanity as some sort of a Hollywood-esque caricature of Nazi-Germany. In this world, evil and egoism – in its simplest meaning – are the prime force of human actions, while the aliens on the other hand, annoyingly anthropomorphistic, seem like simple and unselfish individuals. District 9 fails to point out what's interesting about human evil – the fact that it doesn't emerge from the individual consciousness, but from the collective unconsciousness.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp is a hair's-breadth from the head of the nail – but misses and hits his thumb so hard that it fractures in at least two places. The film is entertaining in its technical flawlessness, but fails on a deeper level, and ends up as vacuous and naive misanthropy."
"cogitocata","8","1","6","7 October 2009"," When minuses don't make a difference
","I gave this film 8 out of 10 because there where two major flaws which I had to count as minus points in the final rating. The first one is that the movie is too much like a Rambo movie at some points. Millions of bullets flying around and hitting no one, or at least no one important. The second has to do with only one scene but it suggests a possible deeper problem of the script. Of all millions huts in District 9, our hero, when chased by the military, ends up by pure accident in exactly the right one (adding more details to this would make me have to check that ""contains spoiler"" box, and I don't want to do that). Such a turn of events puts the viewer's good faith at great pains, but there are plenty of good things to compensate for these weak spots (that could have been easily avoided, in my opinion). Without a doubt, the best thing about the movie is the originality of the story. I mean, you can search all over, but you will find no other movie that makes a social problem out of a first degree contact. The deeper social critique of the movie may not be immediately accessible to everyone, so I will not go into it here. The ending is beautiful and it leaves you in a wonderful state of suspense, though some may experiment this as uncomfortable and unconcluding. But concluding is the last thing this ending should have been and the worst thing the producers can do is think of making a sequel. But knowing Peter Jackosn a sequel is the least we can expect."
"sphinxbit","8","1","6","7 October 2009"," A Realistic Perspective on Alien Invasions
","""District 9"" is shot in a documentary style and takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2010. Twenty years ago a space ship arrived over Johannesburg, and hovered over the city for three months without moving or communicating. The government found alien workers sick, dying and without leadership. The Johannesburg's government took it amongst themselves to take the aliens workers off the ship and put them in a ""refugee camp"" called District 9. Fast forward twenty years later and we see there are riots and shooting involving the aliens, who are now referred to as ""prawns,"" because they look like a cross between a crawfish and grasshopper. With tensions high and people growing hostile towards the ""prawns"" and the South African government, they decide to contract a private company called Multi-National United (MNU). The MNU is only intersected in the advanced weaponry that the alien have. The man in charge of the eviction is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). When Wikus goes into District 9, we see him searching one of the shanty houses. Wikus comes across an alien tube that sprays on his face and into his mouth, this fuses his DNA with alien DNA and he is now the most wanted man in South Africa.<br/><br/>Throughout this film we could see the director Neill Blomkamp intention of showing an alien invasion in a realistic way and showing what would happen if aliens landed in a third world country. Neill Blomkamp even said that he used some news footage from the Apartheid riots and put the aliens into the scene to make this Sci-Fi film more realistic. Although this is a Sci-Fi film, I was entertained from beginning to end. It is very refreshing to see a new perspective on an alien film. Also if this were a film about human rights and social injustice, a film that this would have been looked over."

"jeffrey4949","9","1","6","7 October 2009"," A must-see movie; a real surprise for the adventurous movie watcher
","I love movies like this: I knew nothing about it before I sat down to watch (I never read a DVD cover synopsis, preferring instead to allow the director to tell his story; and I hadn't read anything about District 9)and the movie proved to be an absolute delight.<br/><br/>Shot in a grainy, hand-held camera, documentary style, this movie (set in South Africa) introduces many interesting and fresh features compared to Hollywood's rather stale handling of alien action films.<br/><br/>With its unique story line; rough editing; sometimes indistinct audio (the South African accents are not always easy to grasp - and even the aliens don't speak English!), viewers have to engage and stick with the flow so as not to miss anything. But, for me, all that just added to the pleasure of the experience.<br/><br/>The movie also has interesting sub-messages: comparisons with the apartheid times and reminders of classes of citizenship; the shanty towns in Soweto; issues and infringement of human(or rather alien) rights); likely emotional attitude/fears towards aliens on earth; man's failure to harness advanced technology; and alien/human inter-breading and social order. (I may have missed one or two).<br/><br/>But hold on - don't let the last paragraph turn you away. This movie is absolutely enjoyable without ever consciously thinking about any of that. The story is very strong - just as a story in itself.<br/><br/>Also strong, as a warning, is some of the action, which is graphic in places. But, frankly, I never felt out of my comfort-zone (and I abhor extreme/unnecessary violence/foul language on the screen).<br/><br/>I didn't know any of the actors (which also I like in movies) and the acting was totally believable. As for the special effects - Superb, without being over-the-top. The aliens looked as if they were just standing around like you and me. I take my hat off to the technical team.<br/><br/>Little to say thats negative about this movie. It won't suit everyone, but actually the crazy mix of story, rough shooting, effects and message gives it a wider audience than your average action-packed adventure.<br/><br/>My recommendation - watch it!"
"thepts","9","1","6","5 October 2009"," District 9 delivers - is sci-fi back?
","District 9 is a movie set in Johannesburg, South Africa. The well known plot of the stranded extra-terrestrials being on the receiving end of apartheid and hatred, starts off this science fiction with excellent originality - and develops from there.<br/><br/>The main premise is that the aliens' learned and scientists, have died off due to unknown reasons. This leaves mostly the ""worker class"" of the aliens, an aggressive, stupid, egoistical breed. The animal-like behavior of these ""drones"" seems the main driving force for the lack of tolerance between humans and aliens.<br/><br/>Now for a little bit of criticism: I think the premise of this conflict between humans and aliens, should be explained more thoroughly. We don't really get any proper explanation for why humanity falls into the Nazi / apartheid trap AGAIN.<br/><br/>First off, we know that a million sociologists, historians and activists would be standing in line to protest this familiar genocidal scenario.<br/><br/>Secondly, later in the movie, Wikus - the main character - in a pressured moment, claims he ""always considered the 'prawns' to be intelligent"", revealing some of the prejudice against the aliens. This prejudice seems unrealistic. The aliens have a spacecraft that has hovered over Johannesburg for 20 years, without external power. They have advanced weaponry. Obviously, they have potential for high intelligence.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just had to get that off my chest, due to how excellent the rest of the movie is. The thing is, basically, this movie delivers. And not where you expect it to. It starts off as a documentary, and without revealing too much, it morphs through many other genres during the film. Throughout, it captivated me. I wasn't bored at any point.<br/><br/>Like other people have mentioned, there are no known actors - excellent. I am fed up with familiar faces. The setting is completely new - excellent. I am also, like many others, fed up with action movies set in the US. (Producers should take notice: Movies that dare to challenge the Hollywood setting, often do well!)<br/><br/>This movie was all over an excellent cinema experience, it captivated me through it's originality and drive. The inspired story reminded me of the intellectual science fiction short stories from the early 1900s. Peter Jackson is a brilliant producer, and Neill Blomkamp is an excellent writer/director. This bodes well for the future."

","Alright before you discard this comment as simple hater's fodder because of the rating please stay with me.<br/><br/>First I want to go forth in stating that District 9 is ABSOLUTE FAIL!!! There I said it, I gave you fair warning that if you pay money to see this in theater your brain will melt! I first came to love Peter Jackson's work with the film everyone thought would be near impossible to produce, Lord of the Rings, and seeing some of his other films I expected a lot more out of this one than I should have. It's not entirely on the fault of Peter Jackson's reputation that I saw this movie but also my friends and the idiotic comments of worthless praise heralding this film to be, ""the best new Sci-Fi movie to come out in 10 years!"" or, ""its not your typical Sci-Fi movie of brainless action and destruction, it in fact has a very deep plot dealing with betrayal, relationships, politics, yada, yada, yada."" WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP, if not complete lies and the ratings these saps gave the film is just ridiculous! Its almost as if they had seen a completely different movie! I saw the trailer for the film, which strangely reminded me of transformers (might have been the intention), before leaving to see the film and still had high hopes that the movie would be very good especially since the fact the it landed a spot at #2 at the box office, but all hopes were dashed after only twenty minutes of viewing the film! I had a really hard time at the beginning trying to determine whether or not this film was actually meant to be a comedy before finally realizing that no, the film is just terrible, the writing and dialogue is just terrible, but the special effects were great! In conclusion I sincerely believe this film was targeting a dumbed down audience of morons (very successful at finding that audience when I heard one man a few seats away start crying, or maybe it was tears of shame) and just like after watching Be Kind Rewind I felt not only insulted but that apart of my brain was taken away from me that I will never see again. If you want to see a Peter Jackson movie that has an excuse for being a terrible film just try watching Bad Taste."
"zachary-j-cook","10","1","6","20 August 2009"," It is the best film of the decade, maybe the best film of all time
","This movie is extremely hard for me to describe. But let's put it like this: District 9 is visually and fundamentally stunning. The first half of the movie is almost completely perfect in laying out the reasons why you should CARE about the characters in this movie. I especially enjoyed the setups in the first half which went into detail about how the conflict started; what I expected from this was a description about how terrible we were to the aliens and we alone are the bad guys; but it comes at you with ""both sides did something wrong"" and that was undoubtedly impressive.<br/><br/>However, it does show enough human to alien mistreatment once the MNU operations begin to devise who's in the wrong, and the way the mistreatment is performed on the aliens is also extremely effective. While the film has their own ""boogeyman"" in the MNU higher ups and the military, even the characters (IE Wikus) who are overall pretty decent guys, still take part in misstatements like the abortions as well as various racist(I guess specist) talk and stereotypes about the prawns. <br/><br/>I don't want to throw out anymore spoilers but let's put it this way: the entire movie builds up to create an emotional bond between Wikus, Christopher, and his son, and cashes in on that bond in the last 45 minutes of the film in what may be one of the most stunning final part of a movie i've ever seen, from action to emotion. The special effects were insanely realistic, the acting was spot on, and the plot was almost completely original. PLEASE go see this film."

"cultfilmfan","10","1","6","17 August 2009"," District 9
","District 9 is one of the most original, thought provoking and entertaining science fiction films to come out in years. It has some of your usual traits of the genre such as aliens, spaceships, a futuristic and apocalyptic setting and gadgets and futuristic weapons. Also what it does have that many recent films of the genre, or many in general do not have is a gripping story and a social commentary message that goes along with it. Never before have I seen a film with a story that shows us humans as racist and intolerant towards alien visitors to this planet of ours. The aliens are sectioned off into poor and rundown areas and are then planned to be forced out of their homes and live in a compound of small tents continually guarded and monitored by human government agents. The aliens in this film are not evil invaders come to destroy us, but instead are here to make homes and raise their families. Because the humans are so intolerant and violent toward them, they want to leave home, but do not have the capabilities of doing so. The story also focuses on the one government worker named Wikus Van De Merwe who is sent to reassign these aliens to their new homes, but is later found himself on the run from his co-workers and the government because of corrupt and evil minds working beside him. Wikus's life is completely changed upside down. The film starts off with him as a mild mannered and sweet man, but as he is forced to defend for his life we see him change radically and do what needs to be done in order to survive. The transformation by both actor Sharlto Copley and the job done by the director and screenwriter are amazing. It's true human psychology and character development at it's best and the performance by Copley is amazing and will be sure to bring him Hollywood's attention and more roles for him in the future. The first half of the film and some of the last half is also done in a documentary type of style which I found to be an interesting way to tell the story and the whole film is shot in a realistic cinema verite style which I think works perfectly here to make you feel as if you are there and to give the film a look of authenticity. You have probably read my complaints on many films that go overboard with special effects and have little to nothing of a concrete story. Here we have a brilliant screenplay and while the special effects don't play a large role on the story, they are still here and are actually well done and do not take away from the real source of interest which is the characters and the situations they are in. I never thought I would be saying this about a science fiction film, but some of it feels like a documentary on some sort of news program dealing with poverty and social issues (although this time using aliens) as well as intolerance and racism as well as having action and the futuristic aspects as well. What a genius way of getting a message across and entertaining the viewer and leaving a lot to talk about after the film. A completely engrossing, sometimes disturbing and altogether unique concept that hammers home a message that is relatable to our times and probably will be for years to come. A brilliant achievement of film-making all around and one of this year's must see films and also one of the best. If the Academy Awards went out of their usual type of selected materials for Best Picture, this one would definitely hold a strong chance of being nominated, or maybe even winning. We can at least dream."

","This is one of those films that make you reach for the door of cinema or the remote control of your DVD to turn it off in the first ten minutes, but hold off.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes of the film is slow and sets out the basic plot for the film even though you don't actually see the aliens arrive, they are just ""there"" from the word go. This in hand there are a lot of shots in the style of ""Cloverfield"" but instead of a group of amatures filming it's a TV reporter and his film crew creating what is basically going to set the scene for what is about to follow. There is some very Paul Verhoevenesque (Robocop) scenes, for instance at parts it feels like a news report on the BBC with Kate Adie somewhere in a war zone which in effect it is. It's basically Aliens lands, alien attacks (accidently) a human, humans respond by blaming aliens then so on. However I sat watching this with someone from SA and he pointed out that townships were like this, no law, gangs and lack of any form of a decent life.<br/><br/>As you get into the film the narrative changes from the aspect of the reporter to a full on film. As the story line unfolds you cannot disguise the fact there are parallels between a South Africa from the time of apartheid with the government forcing ""blacks"" out of townships. You just can't help not thinking there are some very disturbing political overtones of the story line. In fact the majority of the film is shot in townships that would not look out of place even in this day and age. It's also rare to see a film thats shot in Johannesburg yet alone anywhere in South Africa."
"zaenkney","10","1","7","8 November 2010"," The Proud Mary of SciFi
","""District 9"" is the 'Proud Mary' of Science Fiction. It starts out slow and measured, giving us a sensatory visual of the guy who is going to help us experience his worst nightmare. Wikus begins as a nerdy, inept guy chosen by a large corporation to evict aliens from their razor-wired stockade to relocate them to a location out of sight and out of mind. He is determined to get the job done and indifferent to the predicaments this will heap upon them. It appears that the government of Johannesburg, AF initially takes at least a small amount pity on the plight of the aliens, but soon simply ignores them for as long as possible. And, this is where we go from slow and deliberate to a steady surge in story and action. Copley basically does a one-man show and he does it brilliantly. He goes from being a geeky civilian, simply a part of 'the system' who is safe and secure existing within life's routine who then, through a gamut of mind-blowing, out-of-this-world, life and body altering events, suffers a forced conversion of mind, body and soul of which he must decide a direction.<br/><br/>The manner in which this film seems to, more accurately than most, reflect the human reaction to situations of so-called 'good vs. evil' is impressive. Wikus, like most of us, operates comfortably within the policies and procedures and rules and regulations of job and society, moving myopically within the herd, until he is virtually compelled to do otherwise. In fact, at that point, I felt abandoned right alongside him. Still, it takes in-the-face trauma and violence for Wikus to perceive both his world and that of the aliens in a more representative light. Ironically, he still maintains his agenda, attempting to recoup his own losses, until, well... Anyway, are we not most like him?<br/><br/>Finally, the alien child is a character study in itself. The child is the only creature in the entire movie who thinks as an individual, deciding who to like and who to distrust, and so the scripture, I would think, ""But Jesus said to them: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for the kingdom of heaven is for such."" Matt 19:14<br/><br/>Well, I hope I am still around in 2012 to experience the sequel."

","District 9, a Science Fiction with a message the movie depicts the social impact of prejudice on a people or in this case an Alien Society. The set in Johannesburg, South Africa them is a generalization, of the treatment of blacks in South Africa. The way the movie starts off with the running of the Aliens and the Army chasing them is somewhat documenting, Apartheid. The movies moves on into great action and very good acting by the main characters Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) who is the bureaucrat, that became infected by a virus created by the Aliens to power their ship home. The movie is somewhat a docudrama in that it's telling the story suffering in the shanty town, yet it is full of action and entertaining. My first thought upon seeing the movie, was here we go again an alien movie about them visiting or living Earth and Earth is no very friendly to them. After viewing the movie for a while I began to see that it was much more than that. The movie really carries a strong message about prejudices in our society and to what length some will go to the keep that prejudices alive and well. The movie's plot was well formed in that it leads you into the story and brings the themes of the movie to the forefront of the movie. You really don't have to guess at the plot, once van de Merwe becomes infected you know that he will see what it like to live in the shoes of another and the prejudices that goes alone with it. The movie was very entertaining and well directed by Neill Blomkamp, and the screenplay by Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell was well written. The movie leaves a lasting impression on you and even now I can see the helicopter and the landing. The movie was so full of action that you didn't want it to end and you were pulling for van de Merwe to get on the ship and make it out of the camp. In rating the movie I would give it about 3 stars, only because I thought some of the scenes were a little over done, like the interview scenes, they could have been shorter. Good movie one worth having in your DVD collection."

","Aliens. Eviction notices. Transformations. Romance. Cat food. These things, plus much more, made the Sci-Fi action film District 9 one of the best films I have seen. Definitely Oscar worthy, and in my opinion the true winner, this film took the audience on a journey into a parallel universe.<br/><br/>This film was done extremely well, sound, directing, acting and all. There was none of that mainstream acting either, all of the people were relatively or completely unknown individuals who did an amazing job capturing the story. The main character, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is in strife between his personal life and the government. His performance not only makes the story believable, but he forms a hero that you want to succeed. You are happy when he is, sad when he is, and scared when he is. His character progression in the story is some of the best I have ever seen in any movie. His transformation into a pompous nerdy jerk into a true hero and protagonist is extremely well done. Slowly you begin to like this character more and more as time goes on.<br/><br/>Aside from the acting, the directing and camera work was incredible, this new director definitely got it right in his vision and created a riveting story that my eyes were super-glued to. Even though the electric ray gun was, in my opinion, very fake looking, that didn't matter. The collective pieces of the film itself were so captivating I barely even noticed it. The progression from documentary to film was something great that I had never seen before. It gave the story believability that the life they lived was true and actually real. Every shot made the story more interesting, and amazingly, it never dragged for a moment.<br/><br/>The story was something of its own. I thought it was based on the WWII Asian-American camps, where the United states held these people and often relocated them out of their already terrible and crappy tents. Not only is there Sharlto whom we want to succeed, but there is also the alien father as well. The story allows for two protagonists, one of whom is human and one of which is prawn, but there is never a confusing or conflicting moment. And, when they get together to defeat the bad guys, its all the more satisfying. *SPOILER* At the end of the film, when all the action is done and sadly our hero does not make it. We still get the sense of his care and love for his wife when he makes the flower out of metal for her. This was the most beautiful moment in the film for me and left me with an unremarkable feeling. The last shot is him as a Prawn (which even though I knew it was coming, still was very emotional) and even though he is in that state, he still shows the love for his wife. Action packed, beautiful, out of this world. District 9 is one of the best films I have seen in a long time."

Wikus is well aware of what's happening in the district and, at first, is part of a team that's making things a bit worse. ""Well, there are big scary evil aliens, right?"" Evil? No. Scary? Not really, ornery might be a better adjective. Aliens? Yes! I can really recommend this movie to everyone who like science fiction action movies. Original in concept and thoroughly intense, this alien encampment sci-fi thriller quickly devolves into a gritty slaughter chase that never bores but rarely surprises. there are aliens and a lot of things explode, and I think the movie was original anough. The graphics are quite good, but could be better. Rating 8/10"

","I've seen Sci-Fi films that try and fail miserable to get that emotional reaction from audience by telling a recycled story and a dried up plot. But I'm finally happy to report that there is such a Si-Fi film, and this film is called ""District 9."" District 9 tells the story of a lone man, who is infected by an alien biotechnology and him and him alone becomes the only hope for the salvation of the aliens. It's a powerful film that resonates with Science Fiction classics of the 50's, 60's, 70's and early to mid 80's. It's an extraordinary example of human and alien courage and the cruelty that can bestowed on both(figuratively speaking.) I haven't seen a movie in a long, long time that has had a really deep lasting and thought provoking effect on me quite like the one this film gave me, I was left speechless by the dark and foreboding sense of justice and the heart that this film put into one mans struggle to free an oppressed race. It was staggering. This is a film that will not only go down in history as one of the best of the best in Sci-Fi, but it will also be remembered for it's heroics it's deep emotional connection you form between the characters, it's one of the best films of the year and is top dog in my book.The cast is mostly unknowns but for the most part they do an absolutely fantastic job.<br/><br/>District 9 was a film when I first heard of it I wasn't too crazy to see it because of the documentary style of filming they showed in the trailer. But after finally seeing it I'm glad to say that it wasn't like hat at all.(well not completely.) The style and the feel of this film will capture you from the very first moment and won't let you go. It holds you in it's ingeniously woven and well thought out story web and the only way out is when the credits roll. But none the less District 9 is a film you will not forget until the day you die, it's a film not quite like anything you've ever seen or will ever see again, it's an ingenious little sleeper with a great heart and amazing emotional depth and character, it's technically brilliant and fantastically entertaining. All in all it delivers."
"Argemaluco","9","1","7","16 October 2009"," An excellent film of genuine Science Fiction
","I am accustomed to watch ""science fiction"" movies to discover they are really adventure stories set on a futuristic, extraterrestrial or high-tech context.The emphasis is always on the explosions and special effects, ignoring the authentic basis from the genre: provocative ideas, reflections on human condition and speculation about the future of the human beings.So, genuine Science Fiction (yes, with capital letters) movies (like the extraordinary Gattaca and Children of Men) do not appear very frequently.I am happy to say District 9 is one of those fascinating movies, and it offers a high level of satisfaction for two facets of spectators: the ones who look for action and special effects and the ones who want something more thought-provoking and which feeds the brain.<br/><br/>The main character from this movie is brilliant because he shows a very interesting ambiguous morality and an amazing emotional evolution during the movie.The story is also excellent for many elements.On the one hand, it shows us that the ""villians"" are not only those who have hate on their hearts and weapons on their hands, but also those who rationalize their behaviour in order to disguise (at least on their minds) even the worst elements from human condition.Another very interesting aspect from the screenplay is the culture crash it shows, because it points out the human prejudice against anything which is not traditional.All those allegories would have become dull if they were not endorsed by a simultaneously subtle and brilliant satire which makes us occasionally smile, and which proves director and screenwriter Neill Blomkamp takes his movie seriously, but not enough to deny the intrinsic humor from some scenes.In summary, a great combination of ideas, drama, humor and suspense.<br/><br/>But District 9 is not only political judgement and abstract concepts.The deep narrative is accompanied by extraordinary special effects and a perfect direction.The action sequences are brilliant, not only because of their manufacture, but also because they endorse the screenplay and they obey to the narrative flow from it.But let's go back to the special effects.The studio Weta deserves all kind of recognition for their monumental work, not only because of the extraterrestrial elements, but also because of the creation of authentic performances in the aliens.<br/><br/>The only fail I found on this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay feel a bit forced.But that is a minor fail, and it did not avoid me from liking this movie very much.District 9 is a fascinating movie, which does not only analyze about potent and controversial subjects, but which also made me have an exciting, full of suspense and hugely entertaining time.Pity this excellent movie went completely unnoticed in the North American box office, while the tedious Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will end up as the most economically successful film from 2009.I recommend District 9 with a lot of enthusiasm."
"chelano","8","1","8","26 November 2010"," Awww Baby Bug Alien
","When I first heard about this film I was interested. Later a bunch of people I knew saw it and some said it was too gory and the story was stupid. Well I finally decided to watch it for myself and I really liked it. First off I will mention the gore. Yes there is some, but not even close to over the top. I have seen war movies with more gore. The only reason they show gore is from the effect of the alien weapons which is great. It is meant to scare you. The story was not bad at all. An alien race is stuck by Earth and the people of Earth try to get the aliens their own area to live in, but after awhile treat them like a lower class. It takes one human to realize that the aliens have feeling like anyone else. The human is played by Sharlto Copley who did a fantastic job in his role. He was so into his character, I couldn't stop watching. The CG in the film was not too bad. For they were CGing aliens and not humans. When you CG humans, it looks to fake. Since these aliens were more original, it was easier to believe they were alive. The weird thing though is that the aliens were mostly like giant bugs. At first it seems a little strange, but you get use to it. Now if the movie needed something for the ladies, how about a baby alien. Yes that is right. A little alien that makes you go awwww. So overall this was a pretty entertaining movie with some suspense added in. I will admit that the ending was a little off, but it was not horrible. I guess you are looking for more of a intense ending. There is tons of intensity leading up to it though."

I was hot, the air was humid, full of food I retreated to the haven of the air conditioned cinema where a purchased a ticket to the next film.... District 9.<br/><br/>Having avoided the trailers & hype for this film i was a blank canvas & was surprised as a spoof documentary followed the promotion of an unlikely character (Wikus Van De Merwe) in a munitions corporation in South Africa. The humour & originality prove excellent from the very start.<br/><br/>Set in the third decade following alien (aka The Prawns) contact with earth, interspecies relations are tense - stranded aliens are seen to be a burden on humans their unusual habits force segregation.<br/><br/>'District 9' a Prawn containment shanty town in Johannesburg, is set to be evicted by a militarised team headed by the newly appointed lead Wikus. All is going well until Wikus comes into contact with a secret alien chemical... From here on in the story spirals through a whirlwind of love, comradeship, torture & self sacrifice set in an alien apartheid.<br/><br/>An excellent film, wonderfully put together it lifts you with comic highs & then drags you down with moments of terror. Entertaining & thought provoking I really do recommend a viewing.<br/><br/>Great film. If you don't like it your a fooken prawn!<br/><br/>(Apartheid echos of the alien plight can be seen during film production. District 9 was not a constructed set, it was a previously residential governmental eviction zone - the people moved on to better government housing.)"
"tmohrsy","8","1","8","25 May 2010"," Interesting
","This movie has a highly realistic take on a ""what if"" aliens were stranded on earth idea. Although you can certainly find flaws if your looking for them, overall the film is trying to look realistic as if it has already taken place ie: a documentary.<br/><br/>I'm usually drawn to alien phenomenon in films because I can experience something I wouldn't otherwise on earth, easily. In other words I watch a lot of action and sci fi movies, I still find these kind of movies realistic just more exciting. With that being said, I knew nothing of this movie before watching it except that it had aliens living on earth and was begging intense action seeing as Peter Jackson was involved.<br/><br/>After watching this interesting movie I felt pretty weird. The beginning does take quite awhile to get to the main plot, however the foreshadowing is brilliant. The characters emotion is very powerful and can really shift your feelings about them. The movie really makes you think and ask yourself questions. So why isn't this movie a 10/10? Well, it left me desiring one thing and given the plot and characters I was quite in awe with how very little action is in this movie. The most action you will see is around the climax and it felt very vague. The movie was practically begging a Sci Fi thriller but instead its a Sci Fi Drama, which is not a bad thing."
"eric262003","8","1","8","24 May 2010"," A Film That Will Have You Thinking
","My friends have thought ""District 9"" was a bit melancholy and and hard to hold back the tears. Although I respect their feelings about the movie, I like to depend on my point of view by drawing out the good qualities and the qualities the could have used a little more improvement. What made my friends sickened most about ""District 9"" wasn't really the film itself, but how low humanity in cinema and society have been depicted as of late. Not the characters per say, but how our prejudices and discrimination have grown. As a society, we continually fight against each other for unnecessary purposes other than just for the sake of empowerment; just like the way the human characters were portrayed in battling the aliens in this movie. In agreement to my friends, I think their theory was true. Sure there were some humans in the movie who were fighting for the cause of protecting the aliens, but they were just the bottom of the demographics and their voices of opinion were null and void. <br/><br/>Set in the centerfold of human destruction of other humans, it comes to no surprise that South Africa was the obvious choice for this movie to take place. After all, this movie summarizes the wars we had with each other in the past. In South Africa, the defunct Apartheid Act which lasted for almost 50 years saw the Caucasian minority try to bring down the black majority through acts like segregation and whatnot. It also reflects on the wars in North America between the European settlers against the Native people and the African-Americans, or in Europe when the Nazis condemned the Jews in the Holocaust. The war between the humans and the aliens demonstrate on how despicable and uncaring we as humans had become then as as are now.<br/><br/>I can see why a lot of critics lambasted the way humanity was painted here. But you have to understand that they weren't doing it vainly to insult us, but just to show us our behavior tactics we have when encountering someone (or in this case something) that is different from all of us. That's why it may not be suitable for the sensitive audience.<br/><br/>Granted this movie is uber-violent and the F bombs are aplenty, but unlike some of those mindless summer flicks like ""GI Joe"" among others, ""District 9"" has an actual story and delivers a powerful message to the human race and gives us a wake-up call as to how evil we really are when we're at war with another group that isn't like us. <br/><br/>Last year in the theaters, every patron stayed in their seats. No one got up for popcorn or candy. Everyone stayed in their chair and watched the movie almost like they were in a church ceremony. I could give the excuse that with troubled economic stages in our life, the patrons decide to go frugal, or the tickets purchased were too expensive it left a hole in their wallets. But no I think they really were hooked into this movie ceremoniously."
"criztu","6","1","8","16 May 2010"," Refreshing sci-fi film, although the first few minutes look bad.
","District 9 is a true Sci-fi movie, and a refreshing one. Human race making contact with an Alien race is a classic theme, but this movie explores it from new angle and brings new depth to it, and does that on a superior level.<br/><br/>Altho the beginning is discouraging and shaky - documentary style looking like a student exercise, and i have to say my first attempt to watching District 9 ended right there, soon it gets on its feet and takes you on a great ride.<br/><br/>The Aliens in District 9 do arrive, but remain stationed aboard their spaceship, suspended enigmatically above Johannesburg city, South Africa. They do not try to contact us or attack us, and don't seem to be enterprising anything at all. When we finally approach their ship and make contact, we find their society disintegrated into a horde of brutalized individuals only interested in eating and breeding. Their legacy is great - artifacts that our corporations would be happy to have, but it responds only to alien DNA. Cramped inside a camp called District 9 in the vicinity of their spaceship still up in the sky, the aliens go on with their despicable way of life for decades, multiplying into millions, finally becoming too much of a nuisance, so they are about to be relocated.<br/><br/>This is a refreshing premise. I have to really concentrate to remember a ""sci-fi"" whose aliens do not try to destroy us in any way they can, eat our brains, mate with our sexy lead actresses or vandalize our landmarks running them over with their spaceships, and what not.<br/><br/>In District 9, our (unintentional) hero is the average guy, Wikus, a civil servant, married with the daughter of his Boss, working for this corporation in charge with the aliens, and he is commissioned to relocate them. He has to descend amidst the filth and misery of the Alien camp, and get out of there with the job done, while he is filmed for the world to see the corporation is humane.<br/><br/>While so many movies out there - not only sci-fies - have the hero emotionally changed after experiencing the suffering of the weak, District 9 cleverly explores the possibilities a sci-fi offers: at the end of the day, acquitted of his duty, Wikus remains emotionally untouched by the realities of the camp, but he is changing physically, a process that will alienate him from his own, turning him into a prized artifact, hunted by the very corporation he worked for a day before.<br/><br/>All Wikus wants is to return to the comfort of his former life, happy in the arms of his wife, and complex depths of the relation ""individual vs society"" unfold, as his salvation can only come from an alien - Christopher, father of a son, who wants to save his own people, but whose only hope is Wikus, who has to deliver him a much needed artifact the humans hold.<br/><br/>Everything now accelerates into an action movie, shot almost as a first person shooter game, and this part does feel like Half-Life game put on film, which i consider an achievement. We experience the alien weaponry in action, and when they're unleashed against the corporation's military commandos, they look and behave otherworldly, devastating in both their effect and screen presence. The sci-fi inventory is completed with an awesome Bio-Mech, the interior of an alien shuttle cabin, and the corporation xeno labs facility, while all the intense fighting taking place stays hardcore, avoiding gratuitous explosions, and throwing a lot of blood and gibs at the camera.<br/><br/>By the last part of the film, the unending hunt for Wikus and Christopher the alien is becoming dreary, but the director saves it just in time, reaching a conclusion, documentary style again, disappointing, but the closing scene saves the last impression of the film, in a fresh new way. <br/><br/>PS. Director Neill Blomkamp seems very daring and promising technically, but what he does looks more like playing with winning recipes from other genres: I've recognized ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Half-Life"", they kept me entertained, but inbetween them there was little speaking of a style of his own."
"antoniotierno","7","1","8","19 October 2009"," original science fiction flick
","This science-fiction film takes us away from the usual European, or North American standards, showing settings and roots of the events in a different reality. ""District 9"" is the feature debut of Neill Blomkamp, who co-scripted with Terri Tatchell and was produced by Peter Jackson, the New Zealander who came into the spotlight with The Lord of the Rings. All these ideas and emotional come out of a fast-moving story that flashes up on the screen, just when the lead Wikus is along the journey of transformation. There is a strong poignancy in his situation and in that of the prawn scientist working to re-activate the mother ship and get away from. The film has an impressive surface due to the fine work of Kiwi Philip Ivey and is peculiar due to the absence of any familiar face. This documentary (mockumentary actually) prevents us from guessing who will live or die and ends on a touching sequence evoking Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. It's a good film, worth the ticket for sure."

","Ultimately, this is a buddy flick. The question of whether there's hope for humans to overcome our fear of people (or species) who are different is played out through the relationship between one of the smarter aliens (who responds to the name Christopher) and a protagonist human who starts out as a infanticidal antagonist with a dogmatic commitment to duty.

Two decades in its wake, this excellent film -- part action flick and part social commentary -- is critical of the we/they binary and profit-at-any-cost logics which underpinned apartheid and that obviously inform human/non-human relations in the corporate governance of District 9. Binary logics lose all common sense, though, with a critical turn of events as the telling of Wikus Van De Merwe's story unfolds. Political hope looms, it seems, from inside District 10."
"jake-law123","7","1","9","5 July 2010"," Explosive, creative, and entertaining alien film.
","Very creative alien film that isn't another hand-me-down from the original alien invasion story. Creative story, awesome action, great characters, and an all together fun ride.<br/><br/>Shot as a documentary, the film at first explains how 20 years ago from 2002 an alien aircraft came out of nowhere and hovered over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, where the military found aliens on board, more specifically named ""prawn"". It eventually leads to them creating a slum like location for them to stay on Earth called District 9. It then introduces the main character named Wikus Van De Merwe, who works for MNU to lead the aliens out of D9 and into a different location. During which, he becomes infected by a fluid that starts to turns him into a prawn. Eventually, he is pursued by MNU to obtain his organs to allow them to use the prawn weaponry that can only be used by prawn. He makes friends with a fellow prawn whose goal with the fluid over a period of 20 years was to use it to program a secret underground ship and use it to escape, which could also turn Wikus back into a human. They then team up to obtain the fluid.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, you feel more for the main character, and eventually, you even feel for the prawn, which is pretty impressive. Visuals are stunning as can be, with both the prawn, the explosions, and the ship. All put together is simply breathtaking. Though the action gets a tiny bit uncreative, there are definitely some very clever action moments, which just makes you get goosebumps.<br/><br/>Even though it would have been nice for Peter Jackson to do the Halo movie instead of this, this still turned out pretty decent.<br/><br/>Though I have to say, seeing it the first time is the best time. If you try to see it again, it may not be as good, but still, thats just for me. I saw it a bunch of other times, and it just wasn't as good. But for the movie in general, its a well balanced action film that knows what its doing."
"manicman84","10","1","9","22 March 2010"," perfectly conceived sci-fi cinema at its most daring and honest
","Part an elusive Apartheid allegory examining sprawling intolerance, part an enthralling transformation story, ""District 9"" is perfectly conceived sci-fi cinema at its most daring and honest. It's hard to believe this is Neill Blomkamp's first feature film as he utilizes mock documentary approach in such an instantly relatable fashion that we believe in every revelation he pulls off. By showing us what happens to a derelict spacecraft stranded above South Africa, and its extraterrestrial crew forced to live in squalid camps for the last two decades, the first time filmmaker offers the social commentary that just cannot be diminished. Granted. The film is high-on-concept, intelligent and full of hidden messages like cat food being an equivalent of legalized drugs, yet it doesn't shine away from being a thrilling ride abounding with credible, cringe-worthy twists, dazzling action sequences and inventive low-key special effects. When its tone oscillates between darkly comical to deadly serious, the movie never loses its steam remaining wildly kinetic. It's also to Blomkamp's credit that ""District 9"" is so emotionally resonant all the way through to its poignant finale showcasing both physical and moral transformation of the main character, social worker Wikus Van De Merwe. Newcomer Sharlto Copley provides amazingly complex performance here. Although Wikus tends to act like a complete jerk, he is surprisingly sympathetic when faced with almost unbearable circumstances. Clever and bombastic at the same time, ""District 9"" is a genuine masterpiece, one of the very best sci-fi movies ever made."
"stewartw9","10","1","10","9 July 2010"," The best movie I have ever seen!
","Though this film can be broadly classified as 'Science Fiction' it is the very fact that it is entertaining on so many levels that makes it so good.<br/><br/>District 9 is part sci fi movie, part social commentary and part action flick with a healthy dollop of satire thrown in. There really is something for everybody here.<br/><br/>When aliens arrive on Earth (in South Africa) and are quarantined in a slum, this makes for an interesting premise alone. Over time the humans begin to despise the critters (who are nicknamed Prawns), marginalising them more and more. But throw in a geeky bureaucrat-cum-closet alien hater called Wikus who has to evict the aliens, plus an alien called Christopher and the scene is set for a rollicking good movie. The first part sets up the 'world' of District 9 through shaky camera footage and news bites. The main act shows Wikus beginning his journey of redemption and the last part has the fast paced conclusion, involving Wikus helping Christopher and his son to escape.<br/><br/>OK so District 9 isn't a completely original concept (think Alien Nation) but unlike Alien Nation it manages to pull off all the themes of segregation, corporate hegemony and mankind's fear of other beings brilliantly. This film FEELS so real, as if this would actually happen if aliens landed here. There is isn't much to bad to say here I am afraid so for a feature debut, this is a massively impressive film.<br/><br/>But if you can really get in to the nitty gritty parts of the film and really THINK about what is happening, you will enjoy it as much as I have. Can't wait for the sequel/prequel."

An hour movie! That's all this needed to be. Who's going to go to the theater and watch an hour long movie back in 2009? So let's just add an hour of filler, thirty minutes of commentary in the beginning, and we'll stretch out the other half hour into long drawn out action sequences towards the end. I am just in utter shock that people don't want to say how they really feel. This is not a 10 star movie like some reviewers want you to think. It's not even a 9 or 8 star movie. If you really wanted my opinion, its barely even a movie from my way of looking at things. It sure doesn't behave like one. A movie has likable characters, at least a few here and there. The story is so paper thin, that if I told you what it was about, I would pretty much be telling you the whole damned movie. A spaceship gets stranded over South Africa, and the aliens that were in it are now on earth. Quarantined off in a section called District 9, they are free to live and have the same human rights as us. Even though they aren't human. Fast forward an approximate 20 years. Times have changed, and now the aliens are no longer welcome, and the military wants to take District 9 back. These aliens are actually pretty peaceful. That is, until you piss them off, and then they are quite ruthless. One of the guys can actually speak and understand the alien language, you know, because there's nothing you can't pull past an audience these days. If they're stupid enough to give this a 10 star review, then they'll be dumb enough to believe a man can speak the extraterrestrial tongue. In the meantime, his hand is developing like an aliens, because if he can speak the language, he may as well be just like them right? He's told it can take up to three years to develop a human hand back. Too bad a story cant be developed here. The action doesn't really start picking up until the last half hour, and by that time, its too late to reprise my respect or like for you POS film. District 9 is a bust, and I think people just don't want to admit it, so they praise it. That's all here. If you like science fiction movies, the best ones were made in the 50's.

After the alien matter accident is turning point. He is starting to change and his arm is a big obstacle between his old world. Towards the end of the film we see the the peak point as a catching a rocket in the air to save the person who once had the enemy. Now Wikus is a real hero or maybe not.

","Out of many films about extraterrestrial species that I've watched arguably District 9 is the best.
Out of many reasons as to why I would regard it as that ; the most important is the fact that the Aliens are depicted in a much wider scope and with a lot of personality in this film.
Specially, the lead Alien character Christopher along with the leading performance by Sharlto Copley as Wikus carries this wonderful story on their shoulders and executes the plot to perfection.
This film is also about how malignant human beings can be to our own species where they don't blink to betray our own at the face of financial benefits which are sunk deep in technological advancements.
Certain characters in this film almost make us feel how far our basic human values would deplete for the greed of power and money in this technologically advancing World.
Colonel Koobus and Piet Smit are those worst strains of humanity.
The film maintains an emotional grip throughout the film which would keep you totally invested in its plot unfolding.
Specially, Wikus whose wonderful character arch with his own insecurities make him feel compassionate about the Aliens which in turn would make us feel compassionate about him.
Anyone who is a fan of science fiction films wouldn't wanna miss this one equipped with fantastic visual effects, action sequences, and masterfully layered emotional grip which keeps you invested from start to finish."

","District 9 is about an alien space ship that starts to hover over Johannesburg. Its told as if its a documentary which makes the film feel very realistic. Almost all of the film is seen through security cameras or as if one of the character is holding a camera. it also often cuts to a person talking about the events in the film, sometimes hinting at the ending or talking about things to come in a very vague way which works very well and keeps you wandering about whats going to happen. Both the aliens and the look of the alien space ship are incredibly cool. A big part of the film is that it is actually about racism. The aliens, which people call prawns are treated badly just cause of how they look. All of the films characters are well performed and well written. i would say that most of the movie is absolutely perfect. The problem i have with District 9 is that the last thirty minuets are almost all action. The action its self wasn't done badly, it was well shot and you still felt for the characters during the action, but compared to the rest of the film were it was about how life would change and how people would react if something like this were to happen it wasn't as good and i started to get a little bored. I would still recommend it to pretty much anyone. District 9 has a great story with a great central lead and has a lot to say about race. The action near the end gets a bit repetitive but is still very enjoyable to watch."

","'District 9' is a not particularly subtle commentary on apartheid and refugee politics. A immense alien ship appears over Johannesburg, populated by what appear to be destitute aliens who are subsequently held in a squalid camp (District 9) where they are exploited by humans (governments, NGOs and the criminal element), all of whom are interested in their technology. Enter a bumbling bureaucrat who, after being exposed to an alien element, begins a painful and humiliating metamorphosis and who, in the end, brings hope to the off-worlders. The cinematography and special effects are outstanding, especially the crustaceanoid aliens (known by their specific pejorative: ""prawns"") and their technology. The film deftly ties satire, black comedy, and action together into an interesting, almost moving, story (admittedly the advancement of which requires a lot of off-screen luck for the characters as well as for a lot of bullets to miss their targets)."
"AnishMisra","9","0","1","16 April 2017"," District 9 review
","District 9 is a film co-written and directed by Neil Blomkamp base on his own short film Alive in Joburg. I saw this film just because I have an interest in the sci-fi genre. But mind you this is not your normal sci-fi film that has special effects and larger than life action. It is something different. That is why I loved the film.<br/><br/>Plot: Wikus van der Werwe is an Employee of the MNU. While serving an eviction notice to an alien colony (District 9), he accidentally exposes himself to some fluid to drastic consequences.<br/><br/>Story and direction: The film is shot in a semi-documentary style. Which is somewhat different for a sci-fi genre film. I liked that move. And you would be expecting a lot of guns blazing, violence, etc.. That is there. But it is quite secondary in the film. This film basically deals with loneliness (that the protagonist faces after a tragedy). Wikus's pain and anguish is very nicely written in the film. Also aliens are mostly shown as some supreme beings with a lot of super powers and stuff. But here they are shown as oppressed individuals. Which too is something different.<br/><br/>Acting: Sharlto Copley as Wikus actually killed it. We see 2 different sides of his character: one as the employee of MNU, who is indifferent towards the aliens and other as a saddened individual who is forced to ally with the aliens. David James as the sadistic Koobus Vanter is also a bad-ass villain. The rest of the supporting cast is also good.<br/><br/>VFX: This is the department where I felt the film lacked finesse. Sometimes the VFX was looking very superficial. Motion capture was already quite developed by this time. But yes the budget would not allow that.<br/><br/>Favorite scene: I guess it would be the scene where Wikus puts on the alien suit and kills the MNU soldiers. The suit reminded me of the climax of Aliens where Ripley finds some kind of armor and fights off the alien queen.<br/><br/>Verdict: I enjoyed the film a lot. It was kind of different than your normal sci-fi films. But yes as I said the VFX wasn't great.<br/><br/>I would give it a 9/10."

We live in a harsh reality where human although, still caught up in blind beliefs, illogical rituals and not being able to take care of their own planet in fact own species for that matter, have established that they are the superior most species and they think they are the most important creature, organism, or living beings for the planet.well I think aliens in this movie can easily, represent all of our own planet's other species and how we humans want to dominate them all for our own selfish purposes irrespective of what their part is in the entire living cycle. I would just say one thing that although there are always good people and bad people, but trust me we collectively as humans, don't deserve the mother earth"
"Chiller7","10","0","4","6 November 2016"," Not just great sci-fi action, but also dark comedy
","I just watched this movie again for the second time - the first having been when it was first released in theaters. It's been long enough that my second viewing felt fresh.<br/><br/>I remembered an exhilarating sci-fi action movie, but what I'd forgotten and stood out to me this time was that this movie is loaded with hilarious dark comedy. I found myself laughing throughout at the movie's twisting of what are supposed to be horrific events into funny situations - for example, the main character's casual indifference to the cruelty of his job, from evictions to abortions(!), and his nonchalant reactions to horrors happening in front of him, such as an alien chopping off someone's arm, or all the people who explode upon being shot by alien weaponry. Oh, and the scene when the main guy is trying to order a burger and sees himself on the news and sees what the media has been saying about him - hilarious!<br/><br/>There's even a certain dark sense of humor in the movie's overall themes, and its portrayal of everyone on all sides as horrible people, from the anti-alien (racist) citizenry, to the corrupt and evil government officials, to the violence-addicted soldiers, to the ignorant and clueless family members and co-workers, to the aliens themselves as mostly inept slum-dwellers, too incapable to do anything to get themselves out of their predicament, and of course the obscenely ridiculous Nigerians. Some people found some of these portrayals offensive, but I'd say it's all so exaggerated that it's funny. <br/><br/>It's been a few years since Sharlto Copley's career took off, thanks to this movie, but this guy has yet to disappoint in his acting choices. I've liked everything I've seen him in, so it's great to rewatch the movie that launched his international stardom. This guy deserves all the praise for bringing this role to life, one that doesn't actually portray him simply as some cool hero, more typical of a sci-fi action movie, but instead thanklessly starts him of as a sort of a useless bumbling doofus, who then changes all the way from desperate and pitiful to badass all within the span of the movie. This is the kind of performance that deserves awards.<br/><br/>I continue to look forward to whatever Sharlto and director Neill Blomkamp are up to in the future."

And the assessment is clear : the ugliness of the humanity is here pictured with violence, creating a gap between reality - in the movie - and the fiction the government is selling. And this is the great power of the film, by showing us our own vileness.<br/><br/>For those looking for a sci-fi movie with typical aliens, you may be disappointed somehow.

"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","20 September 2016"," A Solidly Crafted, Intricately Layered & Thought-Provoking Study Of Humanity.
","A masterwork of originality, creativity & imagination, District 9 is a solidly crafted, intricately layered & thought-provoking study of humanity that's rich in themes, dense in emotions & accomplished in all storytelling aspects, and remains one of the most riveting & refreshing works of sci-fi filmmaking to surface on the silver screen in recent years.<br/><br/>The title refers to the government camp where inhabitants of the alien ship that's been hovering over Johannesburg for the past three decades are confined to. The plot follows a bureaucrat who's tasked with the operation of relocating the extraterrestrials to another location, after conflicts between the aliens & locals worsens, but finds himself in a wholly different scenario when he gets exposed to their biotechnology.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Neill Blomkamp in what is his feature film debut, District 9 is an outstanding start to his directional career and finds the up-n-coming filmmaker in total control as he utilizes all the available resources in an efficient manner to bring his tale to life. It's a sensational debut, not because Blomkamp has a clear idea of the story he wants to tell but also because he knows how to create just the right kind of curiosity to get the viewers on board.<br/><br/>The screenplay features a relatively simple plot on the surface but is brimming with multitudes of themes on the inside. The story is compelling & character-driven, the character arcs are well-defined & exhibit welcome depth, the journey that our protagonist undergoes is emotionally stimulating and allows the audience to invest in it, for which they are handsomely rewarded in the end, and its commentary on xenophobia & segregation is only getting more relevant with time.<br/><br/>Within its opening moments, the film is able to establish an aura of tension & conflict by concisely going through the events of the past to pave the groundwork for what's about to unfold in the present. The animosity between the two species isn't far from the xenophobic attitudes that's still rampant around the world. The ghetto & forced eviction elements are a glimpse into South Africa's own history. But not everything is depressing here, for there is a hint of hope to be found in our protagonist's transitional journey.<br/><br/>The technical aspects work in tandem to highly enrich the overall experience. Cinematography employs the quasi-documentary shooting style and its grainy, hand-held camera-work & degrading color palette further amplify its bleak tone & desolate setting. Despite its seemingly high-concept sci-fi premise, the story has a very grounded feel to it, for it is more concerned with the human condition even when dealing with the extraterrestrials, whose repulsive, insect- like design doesn't hold the audience back from empathizing with their situation.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, David James & more relatively unknown actors who add a layer of authenticity to the film's documentary-like format. Copley plays his part with stunning flair & professionalism and paints a compelling & gut-wrenching portrait of a man who faces overwhelming odds when he's forced to confront his identity and eventually learns what it means to be human, and his performance only gets better as the plot progresses. The supporting actors are no slouch in their given roles and play their part accordingly.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, District 9 has all the hallmarks of an instant classic and it launches the careers of both Blomkamp & Copley on a very promising note. It does run into few genre tropes, turns into an action bonanza in its final act, and lacks a proper closure but it still is endlessly fascinating, thoroughly engaging & highly entertaining, and packs more flesh than the majority of sci-fi extravaganzas that surface on the big screen every year. One of the best films of its year, one of the strongest debuts around, and definitely a worthy addition to its genre, District 9 is a stellar work of science-fiction. Strongly recommended."

","Sci-fi has been in a bit of a rut in Hollywood so it's refreshing to see this South African take on the genre. Here, aliens are subject to apartheid and the film's ""hero"" is a guy committed to driving them away from mankind. The lead character is one of my biggest problems with the film. He's a jerk, and his redemption comes way too late in the proceedings. It should have come after his first escape, but even at the climax he's still acting like a jerk. The actor's fine, it's just the horrible character we're saddled with that rankles me.<br/><br/>Still, the film's look and polish is spot on. It's done up to look low budget, with hand cameras and the like, and this makes the presence of the aliens all the more remarkable. Truly, these are the best CGI creations I've ever seen. They live and breath on the screen in a way that surpasses even Gollum and the lead alien guy is my favourite character in the film.<br/><br/>Things begin quite slowly but pick up once the main character is exposed to some alien fluid. From there on in there are references to Cronenberg's THE FLY and other films but DISTRICT 9 retains its own individuality and flavour. There are some big, brutal battle scenes which are a lot of fun and an impressive military climax in which all manner of robots and weapons are used to destroy humans, vehicles and buildings. By the end, I was thoroughly entertained by the film – especially as it was the first blu-ray disc I watched on my new player."

The way the aliens were depicted in district 9 were very interesting in the way that it is showing the problems with drugs, crime and slums. These problems are very real and are definitely not just fiction. It's like lots of modern day cases where a high population of immigrants move to a country and all of the problems that they face, the struggles in their lives.<br/><br/>The film discusses racism and discrimination, in terms of the lack of respect the humans had towards the aliens but also the racist name 'prawn'. In many ways it shows the inhumane ways of humans and the certain darker sides to the government where they do certain things to achieve their goals at any cost.<br/><br/>I really liked the relationship between the two leads, Wikus and Christopher. It shows that despite the differences there are ones among us who could learn to embrace lose differences. And all that it takes is time, to be willing to put in time to understand each other and the differences that are held between us and we can find the good in each other.<br/><br/>Finally I also would like to mention that I really enjoyed how the movie was depicted, the way is was made in a sort of documentary like way. It makes the whole thing seem like an actual current world crisis. The thing is by doing this I think that it is indeed pointing out that these cases are very real, slums, drugs and crime but also immigration, racism and discrimination. By making the movie's event very real world and seem like it is based on actual happenings it reflects the very real everyday cases that are just like the case with the prawns of this movie."

","""District 9"" is one of those movies that you can watch again and again, as it does prove to be every bit as entertaining every time. And it is a combination of many things which adds up here; the storyline, the characters, the acting talents, the pace and the special effects.<br/><br/>Yes, all in all then I will say that ""District 9"" is a MUST watch movie if you enjoy action-packed Sci-Fi movies. Especially since it is loaded with actions, character evolution (literally) and some very good special effects and interesting creature designs.<br/><br/>The story in ""District 9"" is about a derelict spaceship that comes to hang over Johannesburg. The government eventually herds the visiting alien creatures down to live in an area known as District 9, which quickly turns into a bad slum neighborhood. When the government has to enforce eviction notices to the extraterrestrial residents and relocate them to a camp outside out town, things take a bad turn for the head of the operation Wikus Van De Merwe (played Sharlto Copley).<br/><br/>The audience is thrown right into a very interesting storyline right from the very beginning, and the story just picks up pace at an early start and never slows down. And a big thumbs up to director Neill Blomkamp for the accomplishment with this movie.<br/><br/>However, it should also be said that the cast were doing good jobs in ""District 9"". Especially Neill Blomkamp, whom was almost singlehandedly carrying the entire movie. He was just phenomenal in the role of Wikus Van De Merwe. And his performance alone makes it well-worth watching the movie.<br/><br/>And also the special effects in ""District 9"" were quite good and added a lot to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The special effects team really pulled it off quite well, and the spaceships, weapons and alien creatures were realistic and believable. And while we are on the creature design, then I really loved the way that they made the extraterrestrial creatures, or prawns as they were called, look. It was really impressive.<br/><br/>The alien language was also quite interesting, although it does raise some issue about how some people could understand the aliens and vice versa. But I guess with having been on Earth for 20 years, that some communication between the species should have been established. But we are not given any clues to this throughout the movie.<br/><br/>""District 9"" also briefly touch some more heavier topics under the surface, such as racial differences, intolerance and how people treat things which they don't understand. They are there, laying under the surface, but are not the core of the movie. They just add an extra spice to the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""District 9"" already it is well in its place that you get around to doing so, because it really is a good movie. I am rating it a solid eight out of ten stars."
"Floated2","9","0","1","10 January 2016"," More dimensional and suspenseful than given
","District 9 plays out like a different take on suspenseful sci-fi films, but given a serious shot of originality by Blomkamp, whose techniques in particular provide a sense of gritty, grubby realism. Certainly, there's allegorical commentary on apartheid in particular, and segregation and racism in general, but as the film progresses it drifts into more straightforward action movie territory, and culminates with a huge shoot-out.<br/><br/>However having passing through several times, there are echoes of what Blomkamp might have done with a Halo movie here as alien weapons spit plasma, exo-armour blasts its way through massed foes, and drop-ships take to the skies. It's pretty cool, actually. But alongside the wham- bang, Blomkamp doesn't lose sight of a human, or human-prawn, story as the Wikus, affectingly played by Copley, undergoes a transformation, and forms an emotive bond with Christopher. As a rewatch 03/18/20' and four years after the initial viewing, much memory of the film was forgotten but remembered that District 9 was a great watch. Having paying closer attention to detail on this rewatch, and possibly discovering more details than had not previously noticed, this film is quite a rare sci-if film and a masterpiece.

"Screen_Blitz","10","0","1","14 December 2015"," District 9 is modern science-fiction masterpiece
","In his directorial debut, Neill Bloomkamp grips audiences with pure realism, and themes of racism, poverty, and dystopianism; and takes it in a whole another direction with this gritty and powerful science-fiction masterpiece. Partially shot in documentary style (not in a found-footage kinda way), this movie takes a place in a world where aliens have inhabited Earth, and are living in poverty as refugees in a shoddy village in an rural South African area enclosed by the military. Society has shown disapproval for the aliens' residence, and have ignited genocide and brutality against the aliens. Sharlto Copley plays government agent Wikus Van De Merew, who is exposed a hazardous alien chemical that causes him to transform into half- human, half-alien. With the military out to kill him, and his family distant from him; Wikus takes shelter at the village populated by the aliens, where he must defend himself and the aliens from the military. <br/><br/>Neill Bloomkamp has a great visionary for storytelling and visual effects, and this film succeeds greatly at demonstrating it. This film mixes themes of racism and poverty, common issues that third- world countries face today, and adds a science-fiction touch to it. With the plot revolving around aliens growing up in a dystopian society and living in a slum-like villages where humans show hostility against the alien race, the film tackles many topics that would have viewers raising questions about society today. The first twenty minutes or so are quite distressing to watch as viewers are demonstrated how the aliens are harshly mistreated, and these scenes really set the tone of the film. Xenophobia also plays a major role in the plot as well. The military shows brutality against the aliens because they found them to be a threat to society, and do not feel safe in their residence. From there on, the film progresses through a fantastically written storyline. There is never a dull moment left here. The director just masters the film with an extraordinary script and expresses something original and thought-provoking. He handles the subject matter in such a dark and gritty manner, and knows how the keep the story alive for the entire time.<br/><br/>The visual effects add greatly to the realism of the film. Prized with stellar visual effects and stunning cinematography, the battle scenes taking place during the final half-hour are eye-popping and entertaining to watch. The excessive violence, dismemberment and the gory-heavy results of the battles are enough to sicken some viewers; but those are tough enough to stomach the graphic aftermath of the scenes are in for a wild ride. Sharlto Copley shows off amazing acting in these scenes that, and feels so natural as his character. The overall quality of these scenes should very little, if any, sort of disappointment.<br/><br/>District 9 shines as a modern science-fiction masterpiece of its decade, and is a pure demonstration of what director Neill Bloomkamp is capable of. This film is very powerful, realistic, and raises a lot of question for viewers to ask. District 9 is simply a must- watch film."

","I thought District 9 was pretty good the first time I watched it. Slowly, I increased it's rating until I realized that it was time to re-watch it. It did not disappoint. <br/><br/>The plot is extremely well-done. It's engaging and very interesting. The movie is presented like a documentary at the beginning, and seamlessly transforms into a fictional film later on. It's very interesting and adds to the realism of the film, despite the fact that it's clearly fictional. It feels real, which is quite an achievement. <br/><br/>The characters are well-developed. Thanks to the documentary-style filming at the beginning, they all feel real right off the bat, and continue to develop and change throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Overall District 9 is nothing short of fantastic. The plot is fantastically well-executed, and the characters feel real. The movie is very entertaining as well, especially towards the end. It doesn't ever feel forced, and everything fits into the universe very well. If you've even heard of District 9 then watch it. It's fantastic. I can see why some people may not like it, but for those people I feel sorry for you, because your missing out on something amazing. If it isn't obvious already, I cannot recommend District 9 enough. If you've got the time, turn off your device right now and go pick it up. If you don't have time, then make it. You won't regret it."
"valadas","6","0","1","18 October 2015"," Interesting enough
","An unusual fiction movie story. A star ship from another planet comes above earth and stands above Johannesburg. Aboard there are hundreds (or thousands) of aliens not on a very good physical shape who are taken off and installed on a closed camp on the outskirts called District 9. These aliens' figures are conceived as half human half insects but their images are extremely well conceived in visual terms and with great and good fancy imagination. And they have an almost human behaviour. However after more than 20 years their relationship with the local inhabitants begins to degrade itself and the supervising department of the alien population decides that they must be evicted to a camp a few hundreds of miles away from the city. It's when the situation becomes complicated first because of the aliens' resistance to eviction and then because the man appointed as the operation chief becomes contaminated with a fluid that begins to transform him into an alien which leads to make him almost as a danger for the human community being treated and chased as so. This could be a good movie of this kind if it weren't for some not well explained images and sequences even in terms of fiction that we could then take for granted. Anyway it's a movie interesting enough to be seen."
"wemme","7","0","1","5 October 2015"," Refreshing take on sci-fi, with a disappointing third act.
","District 9 has today been out for 6 years, yet when I finally saw it, it was nothing like what I had thought it was all these years. I am so pleased to see that the alien sub-genre within science fiction has not completely stagnated (I'm guessing the Transformers-movies give this genre a bad name).<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about District 9 was its style of narrative. It starts in a mockumentary-like narrative, which Blomkamp slowly abandons through the movie's progression, for better or worse. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that he stands by the hand-held camera-work, which is a personal pet peeve of mine. Either way, I can't remember the last time I saw science fiction try something new when it comes to form. This is very refreshing, it's neatly done and it draws you in closer to the story.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was MINDBLOWING! I especially loved the not-too-subtle critique on racism and the treatment of refugees. What Blomkamp does here is what sci-fi is ought to always do; reflect our problems in society by mirroring it in different creatures or worlds. Also, everything that Wikus went through kept me in complete awe, despite the clichés. Copley's acting was on point and his scenes were gut-wrenching like nothing other, to the point where I had to hold someone's hand to continue watching.<br/><br/>Sadly, however, the second half of the movie, especially the third act, results in rather epic, grand, macho-pumping action. It's not necessarily dull or badly orchestrated, but I felt like it was too simple for such a grand opening.<br/><br/>District 9 is definitely worth a view, and I wouldn't mind it becoming a sci-fi classic. In its genre, it truly stands out. If I could give it 7,5 stars, that would be my vote."
"canozer123","8","0","1","19 August 2015"," Originally cliché
","The first 20-30 minutes of the movie seemed very original. The documentary-like style, non-traditional hero, aliens living in slums, the social settings of the Johannesburg and District 9, etc. However, after the protagonist escaped from MNU building, all the details that could make the film original lost their effect. It turned into another cliché film: good, innocent people and the hero that changes sides vs. bad, corporates. The movie from that point onwards is an action movie with a predictable plot full of Hollywood action movie clichés.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a good one though. My complaint is actually more directed at Hollywood than this movie in particular. Despite being another product of the same meta that has been ruling in Hollywood for so long, District 9 manages to be original in many aspect. The aliens don't come to USA for a change; the protagonist isn't a instinctively virtuous muscle-tank; everything about cat-food; weapons using biotechnology etc.<br/><br/>The first 25 minutes: 9/10. The rest: 6/10 PS: Somehow the extraterrestrial creatures AGAIN have almost the same body and intelligence as humans do. Shocking!"

Two espresso in that movie. I just stick to the one. Don not want to ruin my stomach and sleep with too much caffeine.<br/><br/>So what about District 9?<br/><br/>We did not get the time to talk about it back when we saw it. And we never took the time after.<br/><br/>Okay. I would that it is an unusual movie.<br/><br/>It certainly is. I liked it.. the story of this guy who is assigned to move those aliens from the slums to another territory. Of course it is also a comment on real happenings in the world. About people being put in a refugee camp and nobody wants them. So they think of a pretense to get rid of them. Move them to someplace far away, not for their good, but because people don't want them. Out of the eye out of the heart.<br/><br/>And there is more. For instance, the similarity with wikileaks. At the end the guy who exposes the company gets arrested and jailed for doing so. It is brought in a certain tongue-in-cheek way. <br/><br/>The filming style is also interesting. Sometimes it is done in a newsreel style and then it moves to a movie style and back again to a newsreel. Mixing these two. Nicely done. At least, it did not annoy me.<br/><br/>And the story was also shifting between styles. At one end it was funny, but at the other also very serious. As in deadly serious. Very deadly.<br/><br/>Also I liked it because it sort of introduced a new kind of science fiction style. We have had good aliens and bad aliens, but these are just aliens. And they don't make them cuddly but also not very creepy. <br/><br/>Yet they still the reminded me a bit of alien. <br/><br/>So, overall a good movie?<br/><br/>I agree with you. A good movie that keeps you entertained. Not a deep psychological thriller, of course. But entertaining with a serious lining. <br/><br/>Seems we haven't got anything more to add.<br/><br/>Well, then you can finish your espresso, and if you're quick about it, I give you another.. <br/><br/>Uhm, well..<br/><br/>Come on..

","Nope, this is not my kind of movie at all. And I would watch it again in a heartbeat. It was action packed, with a lot of drama, and I really disliked the main character, Wikus van der Merwe. More than disliked, actually. I absolutely detested him. But the transformation he goes through is unlike anything I have seen in other movies. Prepare to do a complete 180, because you will be rooting for him in the end. The CGI was extremely well done, and I kind of forgot that Christopher Johnson was a Prawn. (And my hat off to the person who came up with the creatures, because they were perfect for this movie.) Normally the documentarystyle movies are too put on, too dull. Not this one. The documentary style moves the plot forward, contributes insights and angles you don't expect. Some of the revelations are creepy as hell. There were many, many things that really aren't ""My bag"", but they worked really well for this movie. Also, considering that the actor who played Wikus van der Merwe had never acted, and only accidentally ended up with the role, I am extremely impressed with the job he did. Would I recommend District 9? Absolutely. Would I like to see a sequel? Hell yes!"
"bowmanblue","10","0","1","16 June 2014"," Avatar for grown-ups
","Every now and again, two films with similar themes will come along within a short space of time completely by coincidence - District 9 and Avatar are a prime example of this. Both tell the stories about how a (reasonably) ordinary man ends up getting his life entwined with an alien race and - kind of inadvertently - becoming their saviour.<br/><br/>Avatar still stands as the highest-grossing film of all time, but then it had pretty jungles, cute aliens and gave birth to the 3D culture. I don't begrudge it its success, nor do I hate it - it's just that I LOVE District 9. Here, instead of being set on a far-flung planet, an alien space ship arrives over Johannesburg and its alien crew given 'refugee status' on in the city itself. However, after twenty years, the aliens haven't shifted and people are getting pretty mistrustful of them. So, when a camera crew follows in an office pen-pusher to help evict them, he quickly discovers more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>If you're into sci-fi or action then there's no reason you won't enjoy this. The acting is top notch. The direction is superb. You'll care for all the characters and it even manages to make you look upon the (computer-generated) aliens as real people and feel for their plight, too. Then of course it has action, much destruction and incredibly cool weapons. What more does the average sci-fi nut want? More? Okay, how about the face that the story also - not so subtly - plays on existing 'racial tensions' around the world - how about that... a little bit of politics and satire thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>Like I say, if you like sci-fi or action then this is for you. Oh, it also has big cool endoskeleton robots which shoot lasers and pigs (seriously), what more can you ask for? Roll on 'District 10.'<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

"inspectors71","6","0","1","12 March 2014"," Hard-Core Thingies
","Seeing District 9 on broadcast TV is a lot like watching the idiotic porn-lite flicks on a movie channel that rhymes with Sinemax. It's embarrassing, but you don't have to see this doodad going into that whatsits, which is the black heart and sick soul of hard-core. <br/><br/>The TV version of this science fiction morality play is a blessing because, if you read about all the stuff the Fox Movie Channel cut out for broadcast, you may thank your lucky starships that you didn't see the hard-core original.<br/><br/>Yet, unlike the spewtacular Starship Troopers--the first movie that comes to mind that has a nausea-factor off the charts--District 9 has a soul. Read between the lines and you see a thinly-veiled criticism of the disastrous effects of shelving unwanted people into refugee camps. Although the moralistic treatment of the subject of where to put more than a million sick and starved extra-terrestrials who have come to Earth is heavy-handed, it is refreshing to see some thought, some cleverness used in what is essentially a ""bug-hunt"" movie. <br/><br/>Twelve hours after seeing District 9, my passion for it has cooled. I was impressed by the documentarian treatment of the story of a corporate bureaucrat who is given the task of over-seeing the eviction of the ""Prawns"" from their wretched ghetto. Director Neill Blomkamp carefully reveals a multi-leveled story of the bureaucrat, the corporate baddies who would just love to see what makes the aliens' weaponry tick, the hostility of the humans toward these invaders, and the (pardon me) humanity of the Prawns.<br/><br/>What cooled my passion is what so often happens to heavily-laden CGI flicks and other bug-hunts--as the story works its way into the third reel, we are forced to watch a horror story turn into a gory rescue-mission shootemup. Even with the editing for television, the bodies start stacking up, the blood and brain chunks start coating the lenses, and the viewer (me) begins, once again, that shutting-down sequence that means my emotional bond with the movie is unraveling.<br/><br/>Even though this isn't a Hollywood movie--it's an indie from South Africa--District 9 collapses into just another pool of red and black blood because, I guess, it's expected. Why force the audience to keep thinking all the way through a movie when you can cut to the bullet and ray-gun ridden chase? <br/><br/>We all knew it was coming. Why complain?<br/><br/>Blomkamp even throws in some Spielbergish tugging of heartstrings by showing the lead alien grieving over his loss of hope, his son, and the discovery of medical experiments being performed on the Prawns. It's a bad sign when a bit of computer flimflammery can show more emotion than most of the humans running around. I swear, if I saw this in a theatre, I would have bet that there would have been somebody--or somebodies-- mewling ""aahhh's"" when the camera captures the grief on ""Christopher's"" face.<br/><br/>In District 9, an attempt to turn the monster-movie on its head by making the aliens very, very human would have worked if the humans making the movie hadn't lowered their bar by saying, ""Sorry folks, you're too dumb to get the social commentary here. Have some brain chunks with your popcorn.""<br/><br/>Mmm, tastes like cat food!"

","My method for rating this movie will be a statistical-mathematical one. I give District 9 the number of stars equivalent to the number of times the word 'fuck' is said, divided by 500. That should make approximately three stars.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, using this same method on any of the movies in the Fellowship of the Ring trilogy - also directed by Peter Jackson - will yield three stars as well, if it is the word 'Frodo' that is counted and that number is divided by some 500.)<br/><br/>That said, I find Peter Jackson, along with his movies, to be the most over-rated of the 20th and 21st centuries."

","District 9 is a modern E.T. with guns and computer rendered aliens. The story is deceptively simple, a growing friendship between a human and the alien ends up with the human sacrificing much to save the alien and send E.T. home. The genre is more Action than E.T.'s Drama as the main escape plot encounters some pretty interesting obstacle and the gory nature of these E.T.s and the human's transformation into an E.T. provides enough tension and intrigue to keep the tight story very engaging.<br/><br/>Pretty awesome.<br/><br/>The filmmaking is very interesting too, with some documentary style scenes to move the plot along. Very different and engaging. The choice of locale (South Africa) and a weird accent with an unknown lead actor make the story easier to believe (like how some foreign films can get away with really cheesy lines and be very impactful because our social filters don't detect the foreign language cheese: like a lot of Anime (Naruto) or some South Korean romcoms (My Sassy Girl)).

District 9, admittedly, had some potential. I never thought it would breakthrough with new ideas and then some, but guess what? It did... The film's style is what interested me. The film begins like a mockumentary, progresses into a found footage, and the rest is an action- packed ride. The film first surprised me with (your not going to believe this, but...) a STORY. The film progresses at a steady pace, and your never going to be bored. The characters are set up steadily, and the aliens are actually easy to sympathize with, making you grow angry with the humans overtime. The acting was very good for the main lead, and the aliens, although subtitled, were great to see instead of the usual humans. What surprised me the most about the film is how you grow weary of the past movies we have seen. District 9 is new and clever, and story-wise genius. We've seen some great sci-fi films, but what they do is entertain, likewise with District 9 EXCEPT this one has much more power beyond others.

If your easily entertained by movies like Transformers, but also enjoy a movie with an actual good story, this will surprise you with the highest rank.

The slums in which the Prawns live is so realistic it perfectly conveys the message being conveyed. As I later discovered this realism is due to the fact that these slums are real. I feel this uses mise en scene in a very powerful way, since it not only recreates the environment in which the film is set, but is the actual setting. This lends extra power to the film, since the viewer gets to see that the horrible conditions that inspired this film are real. In fact, this movie doesn't stray too far from reality at all.

","Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>""District 9"" is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.<br/><br/>The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their money's worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also non-stop) action sequences in the film's second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docu-drama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, it's an excellent science fiction action film, but not without it's intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichés (these happen near the end of the film) but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel, I'll be first in line to see it."

It made the aliens more relatable to humans and in the end the aliens were the only interesting characters I wish they would have followed the aliens more not the government agent.<br/><br/>And I would like to have seen more of why there was racism."
"robotbling","8","0","1","12 December 2011"," Great Original Sci-fi mockumentary
","(www.plasticpals.com) Shot in mockumentary-style for added realism, the film is set in an alternate history where aliens came to Earth 20 years ago and settled in Johannesburg. Director Neill Blomkamp hails from South Africa, and while the film can be viewed as an allegory of events that took place in the real District 6, it's actually more of an action film than a provocative satire.<br/><br/>I'm also quite glad to say it managed to beat out G.I. Joe at the box office. I haven't seen G.I. Joe, nor do I plan to. The point is, it reaffirms my faith in humanity when a good movie beats out one that is so obviously bad.<br/><br/>The main character is Wikus, an unlikable stooge for MNU, a large private military contractor that has been hired to police the alien slum. Despite showing a lack of compassion for the Prawns (the nickname given to the aliens due to their physical appearance), and actively committing horrible crimes against them, the audience is asked to sympathize with Wikus when he accidentally becomes exposed to an alien chemical. Interestingly, the liquid has unfortunate effects on his appearance which causes his inner humanity to be revealed when the money-hungry MNU decides to harvest his organs for future research. It seems Wikus' altered state allows him to operate the alien weaponry which has, up until now, been a highly coveted but useless technology.<br/><br/>The Prawns are bipedal and semi-crustacean in appearance with an insatiable appetite for cat food. Why cat food is so addictive to them is never fully explained, made all the more confusing given it is nothing more than assorted animal bits deemed unsuitable for human consumption. In any case, the Prawns are a mix of hot-tempered soldiers and mild-mannered engineers, crafting tools and weapons out of recycled stuff salvaged from a neighboring landfill. They're convincingly composited into the shaky-cam footage and interact well with their human counterparts, which suggests that either match-moving software has come a long way in the past few years or the VFX artists were very committed workers indeed."
"Sharkwave93","6","0","1","1 December 2011"," The story is spoiled by using the wrong type of characters and a badly written script.
","I watched this movie with high expectations because of the good reviews here on IMDb. I expected this to be a brilliant movie which would blow my mind, sadly it did not. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie starts out with a TV-crew giving a interview to the people of MNU, an organization which is in charge of communications with the aliens who have stranded on earth, the camera- crew follows the main person around and gives a unique insight to the event. This twist with the interview is something I liked very much, it gives the viewer good information about the event which has taken place. In short terms, it's very good. It also keeps things interesting, until they decide to drop it and go back to the original camera setup.<br/><br/>What disappointed me the most was not the story itself. The story is actually pretty good, and I believe with a few changes I would have enjoyed it. No, what turned me off was the horrible script and the characters which doesn't fit in a movie setting like this. Not one time did I feel any sympathy for any of the characters. They simply does not belong in this kind of setting. With different actors and a new script this movie would be close to a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The visual effects are good. The explosions look real enough and the aliens movements are very believable. I really liked it when the movie showed me the story from the aliens point of view. But sadly, this only happened a few, short times. Wespend most of the time watching the main character. The aliens are well created and and more time from their point of view would have given a boost to this story. <br/><br/>In short terms, I liked some parts of the movie. Especially the beginning where the camera-crew took a very nice twist. But when they got back to original camera setup they failed. Continuing with the same camera setup would have given the story a nice twist all through it. The visual effects are nicely made, and the designers deserve some credits for it, sure I've seen better, but they are not bad at all. The story itself is actually quite good. But using the wrong types of characters and the badly written script destroyed the whole movie experience for me. <br/><br/>All in all I'll give it a 6/10."

","I can't really name much bad about this movie. It's got a clever theme and keeps viewers watching to see what'll happen next. This movie had gotten a lot of mixed reviews from people I personally know. I thought it was great. I could almost imagine this thing being a popular video game. It's got a lot of ""in-your-face"" action and almost seems to bring the fiction to life. There were a few downsides, but very small ones. I would've liked to have seen more description. ""Why did this happen?"" I was wondering at a single point about an aspect in the movie. Let's not forget to mention that they used the word f**k well over a hundred times. It kinda gets old as it goes on. But it doesn't entirely ruin the movie. It could be well seen as a classic in the next fifteen years. Whether you like sci-fi or despise it, there's always something in this movie that most people will find interesting. I recommend it."
"MovieGuy109","9","0","4","19 November 2011"," Fascinating and interesting original.
","Neil Blomkamp's first feature is an incredible work of filmmaking filmed in documentary style. The special effects are absolutely convincing in building us a parallel universe. Blomkamp uses visuals to tell his story and does not get carried away with the effects. His storytelling is effective and powerful, if a bit crude at times. The sheer power of the execution is shattering and has no mainstream stars to bear, which makes the fact of how popular this movie is directly due to how strong the storytelling is and how powerful the images of the aliens are. A real gem of special effects storytelling and off-beat Hollywood mockumentaries."

"TheLittleSongbird","6","0","5","17 June 2011"," Visually startling and interesting, but I wasn't entirely involved
","For me District 9 is neither a masterpiece or a bad movie, instead it is an interesting but not entirely successful kind of movie.<br/><br/>For a low budget movie, District 9 does look excellent. The cinematography, editing and effects are very, very good, and I did accept the aliens appearance wise. The soundtrack and sound also create a sense of foreboding and genuine atmosphere, the concept is amazing and the film does start off brilliantly. The acting overall by a largely unknown cast is good, as is the direction, and the lead characters are likable.<br/><br/>What didn't impress me so much, is that while District 9 does have heart, that I could see from how it was made and the enthusiasm of the actors and director, I wasn't entirely involved. As I've said, the film starts off with no problem, but the final third with plot points that were either rushed and underdeveloped or silly or clichéd wasn't so good. The story doesn't quite live up to the concept for me, it was intriguing and thoughtfully handled but thin, the support characters aren't as well-thought out or as likable as the leads, the dialogue has some sketchiness that is particularly evident in the slower parts and final third and the pace does get sluggish sometimes.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like it and was intrigued by it, but sorry it isn't a movie I would see again in a hurry. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"mixpix33","7","0","1","8 May 2011"," Looking from another's point of view
","There were some funny moments in the film. I thought it well produced but the directing left the imagination of the viewer to reason why a human would have developed a strong bond with an alien; 1st name basis? It is from a view of a documentary that the main character is taking the viewer through, to show how aliens are to be evicted from 'District 9'.<br/><br/>It shows the vindictive side of oppression & from the view of an oppressor that the table turns.<br/><br/>From a development, the protagonist of the film must ally with the sub character. Sort of like the Huck Finn adventures.<br/><br/>In the sense of the overall plot, there is a real message to be taken from the film; not so far from what South Africa has had to keen themselves to in recent history."
"magicsinglez","8","0","4","17 October 2010"," This movie does nothing but aggrandize the main character
","I got a little bit motion sick during the movie. I was pretty disappointed it didn't seem to be about anything. It was a standard, shoot-em up buddy movie. One partner just happens to be an alien. It wasn't till the very end, when you wonder if aliens from the home world are coming back, that it hints at being a Sci Fi movie, or a movie that has implications for all of us or one examining changes in society. Well there was the main character, Wikus, burning all the alien eggs. . .<br/><br/>There is a theme to District 9, tho. It is about one thing, and one thing only. Building up and exalting the main character, Wikus. It 'pimps' him. I even wonder if that was the insider name for the movie during production. Critic Roger Ebert wrote that the Wikus character, ""isn't the brightest bulb on the tree"". He's a follower. He's an every-man, perhaps. He's not concerned with petty or personal politics. It might even be physical, he's a thin man. The counter-argument (and it's an easy one to make) might be that he grows or changes, during the movie. The movie goes pretty fast. I think it merely reveals his character. Even when he finally goes against type, is finally pushed too far, and he blindly lashes out at his alien partner, I think even this sells him. Even he can be pushed too far.<br/><br/>It was absolutely an incredibly well-made movie, it accomplishes it's task very well. Sadly, it has to descend into a shoot-em up to accomplish this goal? Wikus must become a master of arms - really cool ones - to become acceptable? Yes, a very sad commentary on our times. Does he even have to become an alien, in the end, before he is really 'real'? It's possible that instead this movie was targeted toward folks like the main character in the movie (and folks like me). The movie isn't about selling Wikus, it's about selling a might-is-right, tattoo crazed world to folks like Wikus. Well, it never hurts to admire strength. It's working out so well for us.<br/><br/>I'm going to say I agree with those who note the racism examined in District 9. I don't really care. . . not at all. I'm a white racist, I guess. Or perhaps I just think there are already enough folks concerned about 'racism' as it is. But I do 'agree' with the idea - if you accept the notion that the alien prawns are stand-ins for another race. The movie presents them as pretty base and even animal-like, both on the ship and then in the camps. Roger Ebert called them and their behavior 'disgusting', except for the hero's eventual partner and his son. Perhaps I missed something in the movie, the process where the prawns or refugees are 'dehumanized' against their better wishes. Also, when I say the movie isn't about anything, perhaps I was looking at the wrong thing. Maybe it was really about the alien and his mission to escape Earth and the camps. Almost forgot the scene where African girls prostitute themselves to aliens, and does it help that the Black Africans in the movie are portrayed as cannibals and even worse? Should I repeat that again. . ? Perhaps the movie makers feel racism can only be counteracted by further racism? Well of course they do. We all know liberals are the ones who make movies. This isn't discrimination against conservatives, it's just a coincidence. Although one it would seem in need of celebration. <br/><br/>One of the paradoxes of the movie, is that a lot of reviewers comment about how Wikus is evil or kind of shady. He's Still a bad guy! The brainwashing can't be overridden. Perhaps it simply can't be. This movie tries really hard. At the risk of an even larger number of negative votes, for the older readers, I'm going to quote someone else who is a lot more articulate than I am,<br/><br/>""Apparently many uber Liberals do well on the IQ tests which means they can assimilate and process bad information faster than the average. But if they encounter conflicting good information can they deprocess the bad and replace it with the good faster than the average? Doesn't seem so. In fact it appears that they cannot deal with conflicting information at all. Is there a test that can attach a useful number to this mental defect""?<br/><br/>This movie doesn't do anything but exalt the main character of the movie (it does it well). The problem is I'm not sure this movie can really convince us that Wikus' district has 9."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","7","6 August 2010"," Creative and involving film unfolding within this dystopian world full of aggression and hatred as an individual with a set task and existence is put through a wringer.
","District 9 is an exciting, raw and unflinching South African science fiction film; a piece that you feel is the result of years of studious work and hard graft finally come-good, work that has consequently broken into the world stage. If there was a reason to feel as if one was beginning to trawl through the latter stages of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy, whilst at the mercy of New Zealand born director Peter Jackson, then it might very well have been so that one might be able to observe District 9 some years later. The reason for the mentioning of Jackson and his trilogy of yester-year is that, by way of a South African film maker named Neill Blomkamp, whom himself with District 9 has revisited a 2005 short entitled Alive in Joburg, is that Jackson green-lit the bigger, broader project; consequently turning it into a smart; intelligent; engrossing sci-fi which is only mainstream entertainment in appearance but is also something far more interesting. With District 9; Blomkamp has shown himself to be a filmmaker able to run on ideas and creativity born out of his own mind, but apparently to be able to execute these ideas with an ability to draw in a mass audience; when linking him to other directors born out of the former British Empire, one might very much mention him in the same breath as his apparent mentor here in Peter Jackson or, and time will tell, even someone like James Cameron.<br/><br/>But how does the film differ to any other space invaders-come-aliens landing from outer space piece? In the past, where intergalactic species have sought to destroy without mercy nor apparent reason; District 9 offers an eerily similar premise to proceedings but with an eye on developing this as a subplot around which their basing on planet Earth for twenty five odd years has already happened. A key scene from 1996's spectacle favouring, flag waving science fiction film Independence Day had a scene in which the incoming beasties inadvertently revealed their plan to us; one that revolved around going from planet to planet wiping out all traces of life, after which the rightful reaction ought to be: ""that just sounds a little bit......rubbish"". If ever there was a revisionist incoming beasties sci-fi action film in which said creatures felt, hurt and had personalities then District 9 is it. Although that statement itself raises a paradox some have brought about through 1990's Dances With Wolves, that while the Native Americans are deconstructed as the lead spends more time with them, the blood thirsty Apaches draw the short straw and stay as such. Most of the other aliens in this are these apparent dead brained, bug like creatures with an apparent ability for inter-galactic travel but remain quite primitive in attitudes and ideologies.<br/><br/>The film sees a huge ship hover above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982; a mission to board it revealing a near-dying breed of tall bug-like creatures whom are brought back to Earth and just placed out of the way in a slum. The script has fun with a more American infused attitude to this material, faux interviewees telling us it didn't happen to land over a large American city and that expecting ""bright, flashing lights"" wasn't out of the question in what it a reference to Spielberg's Close Encounters film; itself a piece about aliens arriving without initial intent to annihilate. Cut to September 2010, and the extraction of the now proclaimed 'prawns' from this ghetto is to be headed up by a certain Wikus Van De Merwe (Copley), nothing more then a desk jobber at the MNU organisation charged with infiltrating the slum with weapons wielding law enforcers and clearing them out to a new zone, of which is later referred to by Wikus as resembling a concentration camp. In Wikus, and later his cohort in a prawn named Christopher Johnson, is a thoroughly nourishing character study. The po-faced pacifist Wikus talks goofily into the camera the faux-documentary crew film him with as they follow him around extraditing the Prawns, as more battle hardened; trigger happy law enforcers seem content to shoot first, ask questions later. After years of Apartheid rule, blacks and whites-alike are now seemingly aligned with one another in battering and turfing out a new breed of organism in the most merciless possible fashion. Didn't anybody learn anything?<br/><br/>The joy is in following Wikus' plight as he finds himself away from a previously well protected, bubbled existence, and accidentally sprays himself with a fluid Johnson had been storing in his shack, something that brings about the 'Prawnification' for that of whom it sprays, and the consequential falling apart of his life and alienation from his loving wife. Wikus' po-faced appearance gradually gives way as his body mutates and a visual sense of weary, bearded dishevelment settles in as he stands up to arms dealers and sheds his previous office laden image; a literal suiting up into this metallic, one man army suit nearer the end signalling the ultimate in this transition. Suddenly, solace can only be found in the Prawns and those he worked with, in the MNU, are after him for all sorts of sordid testing; the places of the respective characters' dwelling a routine but effective item used to highlight the distinction between the two: a plated shack and a large detached house. The film's premise and plot ideas revolving around chase and epiphanies are pretty standard, but are given leases of life and fresh interest through this lens of creativity. The film's antagonist is corruption: the enemies its lying media and conniving government with whom it operates; a skin headed, sadism revelling fascist mercenary taking the reigns as a physical villain towards the end; culminating in an unflinching look at a world full of hatred and rejection, in which the joy is watching people finding their psychological state torn and their physical identity in a disturbing process of transition."

"domino1003","9","0","5","23 July 2010"," Sci-Fi as Social Commentary
","""District 9"" is more than a sci-fi film with aliens, good guys/bad guys, and lots and lots of guns and violence. It's a film that deals with the issue of race and illegal aliens and how they are treated.<br/><br/>In this case, the illegal aliens traveled a LONG way to get here.<br/><br/>As the film opens (which has a documentary/reality show feel to it), a spaceship is floating over South Africa (Johannesburg to be more specific)and has been in that position for over 20 years. The aliens that arrive are forced to live in inhumane (pardon the pun, but you get the point) conditions in an area called ""District 9."" No one particularly wants them there and they treat the aliens with contempt and horrific violence. Gangsters take over the area and use the aliens' love of cat food to make life even worse for them.<br/><br/>Into the picture arrives Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a geeky official that pretty much got the job because his Father-in-Law is head of the corporation known as Multi-National United (MNU). Wikus is in charge of relocating the aliens to District 10 (Another ""settlement"" area)and is doing his best to look macho and give a presence of strong authority (and is not doing a good job of it, from the looks of things). As he's trying to do his job, he gets a dose of some funky looking liquid. Once the liquid hits his skin, life as he knows it changes. He slowly starts to change into an alien and he soon goes on the run after MNU decides to use him to unlock the secrets of the alien weaponry (humans can't use it, only the aliens).<br/><br/>""District 9"" is Sci-Fi as Social Commentary. A corporation that will do anything (including sacrificing their own)to dominate and control. Aliens forced to live in shantytowns (references to South Africa's history with apartheid)and subjected to intolerance. Wikus sees this through (literally) new eyes, and he changes. He becomes stronger for it, and it makes for an interesting ride toward the conclusion of the film.<br/><br/>I loved the film, and the film takes a misstep or 2 (the alien gun issue is my sticking point). It's worth a look."
"info-11400","7","0","8","8 July 2010"," Different approach
","Dstrict 9 is quite a political movie. Too much politics for a truly great movie and still not enough of it.<br/><br/>D9 starts almost completely political correct. Poor refugees (albeit aliens) are somewhat stranded in Johannesburg. Unemployed and foreign they cause the usual social difficulties, especially growing racism. An ignorant government and a multinational and of course evil company threaten the poor existence of the aliens. So far so boring and predictable.<br/><br/>Fortunately the plot takes a turn. The rather stupid company executive, who is in charge for the relocation of the aliens, gets infected and slowly turns into an alien himself. Due to great acting and fine storytelling this kept me very interested and entertained.<br/><br/>In the end this executive defends an alien from the military. The alien escapes (with his son) and promises to return to save his kind. The executive survives and finishes his metamorphosis.<br/><br/>This all is filmed very well, with a fine balance of intellectual input and sufficient blood and gore.<br/><br/>But D9 is a political movie and has to be measured by its intentions and messages. Clearly it is a movie against racism. Fine. However it is extremely racist itself. South Africa has a multi-tier society. White people, black people from South Africa and black people from abroad. Who do you think is living in the worst slums? Right, people from Kenia, Nigeria, simply from the rest of Africa! And what kind of people are the most violent and superstitious ones in the movie? Nigerians! No racism here?! To me this ruins much of the credibility of the film.<br/><br/>And in order not to get too serious the movie has a neat little happy ending. Our hero (the mutating executive) meets an alien. The alien's son is some kind of technological whiz-kid, repairing all alien devices. Swell. So the movie lets father and son escape. Naturally they act not only to save themselves, but mainly to free their people. Seen a thousand times, you know. And nobody would take any precautions to blast the mother ship into oblivion in case anything like this might happen? <br/><br/>D9 is a nice entertaining movie, taking a different approach to tell all of us how bad racism is. But it's political correctness is predictable and the results are sugar-sweet. And it is inherently racist in itself. That makes it worth roughly 7 points."
"dromasca","8","0","7","28 June 2010"," better than 'Avatar'
","If there ever will be an Oscar for the best science-fiction idea to be turned into a political film 'District 9' is a certain candidate. It takes the theme of the third degree encounter, but reverses the relation between the human and the alien races into a very unexpected manner. The aliens arrive indeed in their gigantic ships, but their place of levitation is neither a coned mountain nor the lawn of the White House, but the slums of Johannesburg. Neither do the Aliens look like ethereal blue-men, nor like naughty gremlins, but they are rather a frightened and disoriented crowd which looks in shape as disgusting prawns, who do not seem to enjoy often showers either. Placing them in the slums that South Africa is very familiar with looks like the right thing to do, and nobody is surprised when racial riots break up between the 'superior' humans and the new 'inferior' race visitors. True, the 'prawns' as they are called do have the military technology you would guess, but it's only some kind of teenager nerd of theirs that holds the secret of saving the oppressed race.<br/><br/>Released in the same year as 'Avatar', 'District 9' carries a similar message of intergalactic tolerance pleading for the need for dialog between cultures, for mutual respect despite differences in language and behavior. It probably cost only a few percents of the hundreds of millions Cameron could invest in his blockbuster. However, after putting aside the outstanding visuals of 'Avatar', 'District 9' is a much better film.<br/><br/>Talking about visuals, I liked the atmosphere that first time director Neill Blomkamp created for the slums. The pseudo-documentary style fits well the story logic, and the use of TV news allows for action to be re-created with an air of authenticity, enhanced by the propagandist media speak coming from the comments. Actor Sharlto Copley is perfect in the role of the inept bureaucrat Van De Merwe put in charge with moving the aliens to a new relocation camp. He acts well the coming back towards humanity of his spirit in parallel with the metamorphosis to alien his body is going through. Overall this film is a good surprise in the genre coming from an unexpected cinematographic territory."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","6","27 June 2010"," DISTRICT 9 (Neill Blomkamp, 2009) ***
","Despite my general aversion to contemporary movie fare, I usually try to keep abreast of my favorite genre (Fantasy i.e. Horror and Sci-Fi) and, in fact, have been looking forward to catching this acclaimed recent example. Apart from its mixed origins (this is an American-Canadian-Kiwi and South African production that includes Peter Jackson as one of its producers), the film's major claim to fame is the fact that it garnered 4 Academy Award nominations including an unprecedented one for Best Picture! For what it is worth, it is also currently at No. 122 on the IMDb's all-time Top 250!! <br/><br/>In hindsight, I do feel that DISTRICT 9 is somewhat overrated: what we have here is, basically, a combination of Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) and James Cameron's ALIENS (1986) and, therefore, despite the obvious intelligence on display, also with a clear eye towards hitting the box office jackpot. With this in mind, one is expected to forgive (and, indeed, embrace) the presence of a 'cute' alien kid who, unexpectedly, bonds (as does his ambitious father) with the hunted (and highly unlikely) human hero. As portrayed by virtual unknown Sharlto Copley, it was a nice touch to make him a nerdy, soft-spoken and nervous type and I was disappointed to hear him burst into a constant array of expletives in the second half of the movie where he has to contend with macho South African arms dealers and his former colleagues now bent on destroying him.<br/><br/>Actually, the unusual South African background against which this action-packed morality play takes place adds much to the mix and perhaps even invites the film-makers' tendency towards gore and tastlessness – not least in their decision to make the prawn-like alien design such a disgusting one! Incidentally, the following day after watching this one I also caught several of director Blomkamp's previous short films, namely: ADIDAS ADICOLOR – YELLOW (**1/2), ALIVE IN JOBURG (**1/2; something of a precursor to DISTRICT 9 itself, with Copley in much the same role), CITROEN C4 – ALIVE WITH TECHNOLOGY (**), HALO – LANDFALL (**1/2), NIKE – CRAB (**), NIKE – EVOLUTION (**1/2), TEMPBOT (**1/2) and TETRA VAAL (**1/2)."
"lewiskendell","7","0","7","17 June 2010"," A thought-provoking sci-fi tale.
","District 9 is a unique experience. I'd describe it as political sci-fi action faux-documentary thriller. If that doesn't qualify as unique, I don't know what does. <br/><br/>Another simpler way to describe it is that it's a good sci-fi movie. District 9 poses the question of what would happen if some relatively unimpressive aliens were forced to find refuge in South Africa. There's lots of exploration of themes like xenophobia, exploitation, bioengineering and weapons ethics, among others. The best science fiction movies always seem to find a way to tackle a complex subject or two, without beating the audience over the head with it. District 9 (along with Moon) is a good recent example of that.<br/><br/>Don't fall under the impression that this is some cerebral think-piece, though. There's lots of action. In nearly every scene, there's some small (or huge) bit of interesting visuals going on. From the design and animation of the aliens, to their technology and various explosions and gun battle set-pieces, the special effects are universally impressive. Especially for the relatively small budget that the picture was made with.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend this to almost anyone. District 9 is a very entertaining movie that can offer you more, if you choose to ponder the topics it raises. And if you just want to see stuff get blown up, it'll still have you covered."

","5.0 out of 5 stars Very Disturbing - Thought-Provoking - Some of the BEST Science Fiction I Have Ever Seen!!, June 9, 2010 <br/><br/>District 9, science-fiction at its absolute BEST, revolves around the attempts to relocate aliens, currently living in slum conditions in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a more suitable place - living alongside humans has obviously deteriorated. A bureaucrat,Wikus, appointed by his father-in-law, is tapped to lead the relocation efforts. Unfortunately, in the process, he becomes infected with the DNA of the aliens. (oh you KNOW the South African government has been performing ""tests"" to study the aliens!) Of course, Wikus will eventually turn into one of the aliens and the government wants/needs to ""harvest"" his body parts all, of course, for the sake of science.<br/><br/>The movie is intense, gritty, and disgusting. It pretty much evokes the same emotions in the viewer which is where the power of the movie lies. It takes the viewer on a VERY uncomfortable review of one's own biases/prejudices/apprehensions. In the beginning I was horrified watching the amount of firepower humans enlisted to implement the relocation policy thus making me dislike Wikus almost immediately - especially since he benefited (for lack of a better word) solely because of nepotism. I was immediately moved to support the aliens but, GEEZ, they're so ugly!!! Then Wikus becomes infected, becoming of intense interest to the South African scientific community, and becomes the hunted rather than the hunter. Now Wikus is as sympathetic as the aliens and thank god, not NEARLY so ugly.<br/><br/>It was INDEED startling to be reduced to making assumptions about someone SOLELY on the basis of how they looked. The aliens here are quite intelligent. Moreover, they only want to get back to their own planet and have no ill-will toward humans, unless, of course, provoked. So in most cases they do NOT deserve the inhuman (no pun intended) treatment they are often subjected to.<br/><br/>Their just god-awful ugly!! And it is disconcerting to have to admit AND deal with this. Compound this with a language barrier and we find ourselves looking at some very similar situations we find ourselves in in our everyday lives.<br/><br/>The special effects are mind-boggling and the interactions between aliens and humans recalls social conditions we are all entirely too familiar with. Yes, it uncomfortably evokes the reasonings behind immigration, integration, segregation, minorities, cultures/situations we are unfamiliar with, and forces us to take an historical perspective of just how well (or how badly) we have dealt with similar situations.<br/><br/>The movie is fast-paced, action-packed, gross, poignant, revolting, and THOROUGHLY entertaining. It is reminiscent of the best that the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits had to offer and quite frankly, trying to categorize the movie not only is difficult but ultimately unfair.<br/><br/>Hands down - one of the BEST movies of ANY genre I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Oooooooh yeah.....I INDEED recommend!"

","could be another title for this movie. District 9 is the name of the camps that millions of aliens have been sent to in Johanasburg, South Africa. It seems aliens arrived about 20 years ago and the humans put them in camps and control them. The aliens are called prawns because that means they are the lowest of the low.<br/><br/>The movie is shot like a documentary. Government worker Wikus has been sent to get aliens to sign eviction notices. He picks up an alien cylinder that sprays him with black fluid. It begins to transform him. So, he's captured and this company wants to do experiments on him. He escapes and meets up with an alien whom may be able to help him. So the latter part of the movie is just year average chase film with explosions and such.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, the aliens were good special effects and the story made sense. It's also got some nice kill shots for gore fans."
"HuskyEnzo","7","0","2","24 April 2010"," ""The name is Plissken ... 'P R A W N' Plissken!""
","This (in ""Blairwitch""-tradition) documentary-alike motion picture tells a story, loosely reminding of the James Caan-movie ""Alien Nation"" but set in the townships of Johannesburg/South Africa.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that a couple of years ago above the city an alien flying saucer came to halt and the crew stranded here. They couldn't get the wrecked rig afloat anymore so they were deported into a slum at the edge of town, in the following the ""regular alienation"" gets replaced by ""average apartheid"" (insert irony here). The status of the colored southafricans in the film apparently switched with the arrival of the aliens and they also fall in in the racistic patterns which they themselves suffered through for centuries. This may be basically a realistically portrayed mechanism: for instance if you enter a train-compartment were already 3 other passengers sit for a while, you are the ""disturbing newbie"" and it's something you can even feel. When the next one comes in, your status gets passed on automatically.<br/><br/>The viewer accompanies a bureaucrat from the Joha-municipal authorities and some soldiers and police-squads into the ghetto to hand over and execute an eviction for the mockingly called ""Prawns"". The aliens already work in hide over a plot to escape and/or set their sails again, a suspicious reagent is the stuff to go. The bureaucrat –actually a harmless guy on the edge to marriage- is the poor guy to get sip of it; after that his well-sorted life turns into a kafkaesque metamorphosis, where he is forced to change sides, gets hunted by his own authorities and his own father-in-law who administrates the martial show and who anyway didn't like him too much in the first place.<br/><br/>Actually it would have been the more revolutionary movie, if it was shot 20 years earlier but fascistic ideologies even after being removed have a long fallout among many people so maybe it's even today enough up on current events (I live in Germany so I guess I can tell).<br/><br/>Regardless, this is an excellent and highly entertaining movie with a nice b-picture-appeal, good actors and FX and an inventive premise – no revolution but very well!<br/><br/>Facutally it's the kind of movie John Carpenter would have been doing in the 80s. There's a strong connection to ""They Live"" and the dystopic, satirical aspects of ""Escape from NY"", also regarding the apparently relatively low budget and the dramatical consequence, this flick plays very much in the same league. After watching this, it's once more unclear, why Carpenter couldn't continue to fulfill the standards he himself had set 'til then. Obviously others can do excellent."

","I was gripped by the film right from the start. It was clearly satire of the highest order and the eager to please, out of his depth anti-hero Wikus was, for me at least, despite his flaws a likable character. The complacency of the MNU and the obvious guile and menace of the ""prawns"" let you know that there was inevitably trouble brewing. It was throughout very entertaining. However, for me it was flawed by Jackson's perceived need to leave open the possibility of a sequel. I hate it when films are made this way. The best films never have sequels ( Usual Suspects, Trains, Planes, Automobiles ) or are made perfect in the first place and the sequels are inevitably appalling ( An American Werewolf In London ).

"hall895","8","0","3","10 April 2010"," Science fiction with smarts
","In so many ways District 9 is not your typical science fiction film. For starters, a South African slum is certainly not your typical sci-fi setting. It's a unique location for a unique story. And that story is presented in an unusual fashion, initially a mockumentary of sorts with more straightforward storytelling as we move along. It may take a little while for the viewer to become comfortable with the rhythm of the piece, things are a little disjointed at the start. But eventually the story kind of settles itself down and the viewer can then settle in and enjoy the ride. And a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking ride it is. You won't see many movies quite like this one and in this case that uniqueness makes it rather special. A first-time feature film director, Neill Blomkamp, with a limited budget, takes a cast of unknowns and creates a near-masterpiece. There are some things here and there to quibble with but overall the film works wonderfully. And Blomkamp deserves so much credit for that as this is a film which for so many reasons could easily have gone off the rails entirely. The potential was definitely there for this to be a complete mess. Instead it is a rousing success. That a first-time director pulled this off is somewhat mind-boggling.<br/><br/>As our quasi-documentary tells us at the film's start, in 1982 a large alien mothership became apparently stranded, hovering motionless over Johannesburg, South Africa. And there it sat for three months until a team is sent up to break into the ship, where they discover over one million starving aliens. But these are not your typical movie aliens, these things look like some kind of giant seven-foot tall shrimp. These creatures, which will come to be referred to rather derogatorily as prawns, are for humanitarian reasons relocated to the ground where they end up living in the world's strangest slum, District 9. Nearly three decades pass and human-prawn relations are, to put it mildly, not going particularly well. So as the film's story begins to play out in its 2010 time frame the prawns are to be evicted from District 9 and forcibly moved to a new internment camp away from Johannesburg. Placed in charge of this forced relocation is the rather hapless office worker Wikus Van De Merwe. Poor Wikus is not quite up to the task.<br/><br/>When we first meet Wikus it is obvious almost immediately that this guy is not the brightest bulb. In fact he seems to be such a bumbling, oblivious idiot that it is hard to identify with him or take him seriously at all. Which is a bit of a problem as Wikus is the central character in the movie. But as the story plays out Wikus evolves in innumerable ways. And when his story arc is complete than you can really appreciate how far this annoying little office twerp has come. Sharlto Copley is the actor entrusted with this vital role and he does wonderfully with it. At first things with Wikus did seem a bit off and you couldn't help but wonder if maybe it was because this unknown actor was in over his head. But as the story plays out you can't help but appreciate Copley's work and in retrospect you realize his performance in the film's opening wasn't off at all. It was exactly what it had to be for the character of Wikus. For long stretches of the film Copley has to carry the proceedings pretty much entirely on his shoulders and he proves more than capable.<br/><br/>District 9 will prove to be mostly about the journey of Wikus but the prawns certainly have their part to play as well. Most of these creatures, impressive-looking though they may be thanks to some wondrous special effects, are rather disposable in the film. They're nameless, essentially faceless, with no real story to them. But one prawn, named Christopher Johnson (no I don't know how these things got names), has his own story and inevitably Christopher's tale will be intertwined with that of Wikus. And their story keeps you glued to the edge of your seat all the way to the film's rousing finale. OK, maybe the finale is a little too rousing as the emotional, thought-provoking story gets somewhat shunted aside for a standard movie shootout with all kinds of fancy CGI explosions. You get the sense this unique story deserved a little better in the end. But it's by no means a total letdown, the film as a whole ends up being more than satisfying. The story is terrific and it's told in a rather ingenious way. And, somewhat remarkably considering the small budget, the film looks terrific. The prawns, the spaceship, the weaponry, everything looks top-notch. It makes you wonder what the filmmakers could have done with a lot more money at their disposal. With as successful as this film was we may yet find out. District 10 anyone?"

","This is another movie that didn't quite live up to the hype, but that's not saying much.<br/><br/>First thing, the good stuff: It is so nicely made, the cinematography is perfect. The aliens are like E.T., hideous, but also cute, you want them to get back home. It mixes steady and shaky cam. The plot is, for the most part, original. And it's just so entertaining, mixing drama and comedy.<br/><br/>Next, the bad stuff, really, the bad stuff happens in the last act of the movie. Our main character, who we want to succeed suddenlly turns into a murderer. Brutally killing innocent soilders up when he could have easily have pushed them out of the way. And the ending wasn't exactly the happiest ending was it. Other than that, it's perfect, a wonderful, entertaining movie."

","This movie is well worth watching (I grade on scale where the midpoint between 5 and 6). D9 includes some of the most haunting images of any movie, especially that huge and creepy spaceship looming over Johannesburg, obviously symbolizing the legacy of apartheid. I also liked the gritty realism of the prawn ghetto and the Nigerian gangsters. For the first 90 minutes, D9 is amazingly inventive, featuring surprising but believable plot twists. I loved the idea of serving the prawns eviction notices that they are asked to sign to give a threadbare legitimacy to ethnic cleansing. Unfortunately the ending gets bogged down in an interminable Transformers-type scene. Sharlto Copley as Wikus gives a witty and kinetic lead performance, but I did not find him very emotionally involving, perhaps because his character commits an appalling act early on that makes it hard to sympathize with him."

Remember the same silver bottle with the special rocket fluid, was also what got sprayed in his face which causes the mutation?? I thought that was weird, was it fuel for the ship? Or intentional to contaminate the rest of the humans who came in contact??

","Didn't catch it on it's first run. Didn't even think to catch it when it came out, or ever for that matter. The trailer sucked, let's be real about that. It was like lame to the max. But I heard all this hype about it from everybody I know, so now it's one of those things you have to see, just to see what you missed. Usually, when I hear a lot of hype and good things about a movie I don't like the movie as much because my expectations are too high. This was an exception. Totally original. Or as far as I know it was totally original. At first I thought it was going to be another lame sci-fi movie but it was just awesome and originaldid I say it was original already? But seriously, I can't wait for the next one to come out. The possibilities are endless on how to open up the next one. There was only one thing I would have done differently. The wife. She just didn't read sincere to me. It wasn't consistent. I felt like they should have made the audience feel like she was unaware that they were tracing the call and that she lead her father right to him. I asked my friends about this and their general consensus was she was a bitch. But I don't think that was the intention. I think they just edited it incorrectly or left out a scene. The director dropped the ball on this. Because everyone that I knew that saw the movie didn't care for her character because they felt like she set him up. I mean, at the beginning of the movie she seems really cool and missing him and all that, but then there's a moment on the phone it comes off like she set him up. A simple fix would have been just to show the father and company in a way that it was crystal clear she was unaware they were tracing the call. That's the only thing in the entire movie that bugged me. Otherwise, it was perfect."

","I saw this movie having heard virtually none of the hype, and also having no idea that there was any huge social commentary intended. Great action, great acting, very suspenseful and clever plot, great choreography and special effects. Excellent sci-fi action thriller. Some of the reviews I've looked at claim that there was either great or awful (depending on the reviewer) social commentary to be had here. I say, if that's what was intended, it falls flat. You could say that there's some match-up with the plot and US immigration policy but it's hugely oversimplified. If the directors mission was to make some sorta statement: fail, if not, it was a reasonable plot device: win. Definitely worth watching if you're into sci-fi in general and probably even if you're not."
"seaview1","9","0","4","5 March 2010"," DISTRICT 9: Science Fiction as Allegory
","This film is an experiment in relatively low budget film-making based on an interesting concept. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings trilogy) acts as producer for newbie director Neill Blomkamp and a script by Blomkamp and Terri Tacthell to create an imaginative, powerful film whose DNA is civil strife in South Africa. Much as High Noon was about the Communist 'witch hunts' of the late 1940's and The Sand Pebbles was a corollary to the Vietnam War, District 9 smacks of Apartheid commentary in its home setting of Johannesburg, South Africa. The results are a well made science fiction film that integrates an important message.<br/><br/>A government civil servant worker named Wikus Van De Merwe leads a relocation of an alien race dubbed 'The Prawns' from their current home in District 9 to a camp in a different part of South Africa. The military also wants to make use of the sophisticated alien weaponry that can only be operated by the aliens DNA. <br/><br/>Wikus leads a group of soldiers into an alien camp and during the confrontation, he finds a mysterious vile that explodes when opened and splashes his face with an unknown substance. And quicker than you can say, The Fly, he starts to notice some startling changes as his body becomes nauseous and altered. A reunion at home with his wife and friends becomes a tragic start of something ominous and, when the military realizes the unlimited value of Wikus' genetic ability to operate the alien weaponry, he becomes a hunted fugitive. <br/><br/>Trying to find refuge in the alien camp, he locates one of the aliens who concocted the substance. And the two devise a plan to steal the liquid now in military custody. The alien needs the material for his ship and, in exchange, he will help Wikus. Can he be trusted? How fast before Wikus changes completely? Back in District 9, the alien attempts to liftoff in his ship with his son, and Wikus has similar plans to escape. Soon the military catches up to them for an explosive climax. At that moment, Wikus makes a momentous decision that will change his life and the fate of his alien companion. <br/><br/>The mostly unknown cast is uniformly excellent and capably led by Sharlto Copley as Wikus. Technical credits are superior particularly makeup and visual effects. Good use is made of a periodic timeline to show the passage of time and development of the events. Lots of hand-held cameras and lack of a musical score lend a feeling of immediacy and reality. Told in a quasi-documentary style through flashbacks and interviews, the film takes on a realistic aura grounded in truth. Rarely has a science fiction film (Cloverfield) ever been presented in this convincing manner. This is narrative driven and doesn't let up. Once it begins, you have to hang on for dear life. <br/><br/>A number of topics are ever present throughout the film including segregation and racism, military dominance, and ultimately love. Do aliens have rights? Do they have a soul? It's a great premise for a film that the filmmakers take and expand upon. There is the use of private military contractors, and instead of oil, the resource the military seeks is superior technology in weaponry. <br/><br/>The film has elements of other films like Alien Nation, Black Hawk Down and Starship Troopers. It's not for all tastes but for those who appreciate this genre with a moral twist, it is a rewarding experience. The action is graphic and unrelenting as the stakes get higher. As violent and startling as some of the scenes are-no punches pulled here, there is a noble theme that is never lost. What comes through in District 9 is its humanity amid the aliens and hardware, and the final shot cannot help but be affecting. Wow, an independent science fiction film with state of the art technical effects and a compelling, intimate story. Where do I sign up?"
"alexcuetodo","8","0","3","3 March 2010"," A Different and Honest Scifi
","The only idea of having to deal with unwanted visitors from other planet and having to share our limited resources as long as public opinion is involved is a starting original peak for an underestimated movie which thankfully transcends as some of the most outstanding works in its genre. <br/><br/>The initial documentary treatment and smooth –almost unperceptive- transition to movie language is another helping element for the director's realization. Other highlights include the convincing realistic visual work resulted from the camera operation, costumes and extraordinary make-up along with the creatures. <br/><br/>The film's message and characters profiles can be measured as noteworthy though they could have been better defined, or maybe not, since the director appears to confront the corporation's evil against the human and alien's behaviors of solidarity, loyalty and family love -this is also evident with the intervention of the District Nine's gangsters desperately looking for the essence of power by eating the alien arm.<br/><br/>The acting could have been better weighted if known actors had been cast, but in general, the main performances were convincing enough to keep us interested in watching the development of the story until a possible sequel concludes the unfinished events presented. I consider District 9 a good and different competitor for the Oscar night."

","Okay, I admit, I followed the hype concerning this flick. And yes, it indeed delivered what the hype suggested. The main actor, Sharlto Copley, does deliver real good acting. And this is his second or third movie. Wow. As you see in my summary there is more than just the story itself, for me, maybe because it's played in South Africa, it's all about the apartheid. But the black people are now the aliens. Or am I wrong? Who knows, maybe I have seen to much. Anyhow, the movie delivers in all directions. It sure did on the storyline. No romantic stuff like in so many Hollywood productions, remember 2012. It's great to see the decaying of the main actor, no heroes around. Maybe the alien is. Watch it for yourself. The beginning is a bit like a documentary, then it all starts and CGI comes in. Never been a fan of CGI but here it's used in a perfect way. And the language used by the aliens.

Normally the typical sign of a snore-fest. However, District 9 is a pretty fun ride. The thriller is presented in a mockumentary style from the opening and that gives it a little more charm. You get to identify with Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the main character who we follow right through to the bitter end.<br/><br/>District 9 sees a world or at least a part of the world, where aliens living on the same planet as humans is seen as the norm. Wikus, working with the government, polices their activity and stumbles upon an unknown alien object which starts to have strange effects on him. If you're not interested now, you probably close this page and go rent Steel Magnolias or something.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a rather quick pace so much so that the opening scenes feel too rushed. It does keep you hooked all the way though to the epic final scene though. The visuals are stunning. The CGI is flawlessly realistic, the aliens (or 'prawns') didn't look as computer- generated as I'd initially anticipated and the various explosions, bloody battles and shoot-outs are brilliantly entertaining.<br/><br/>The $30million budget is surprising considering the film looks like the budget was considerably higher, I was simply amazed with the special effects and would probably go as far as to say that this is one of the best science fiction films of the decade.

The story is very plausible and well portrayed. Everybody knows the plot and has seen the trailer but that does not compare to actually watching it.

Yes, there is a spaceship and funny-looking aliens but above all, this is a significant film with strong elements of excitement, humour and pathos.

Even so, it actually exceeded my hopes (a rare pleasure).and both myself and my partner agreed that it was better then we expected. I genuinely believe that it will very soon be regarded as something of a classic. If you enjoy well made, quality cinema, I'd be very surprised if you are disappointed.

That would have been a pretty catchy way to introduce the extra-terrestrial race in ""District 9"", but it was used way back in 1988 for ""Alien Nation"". I think the film's premise would have gotten a lot more mileage out of fashioning the aliens after something a little more human-like instead of the skeletal creatures reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's creations in 1963's ""Jason and the Argonauts"". But that's just me.<br/><br/>What I did like about the film was some of the more original concepts in sci-fi since 1979's ""Alien"". Like the biologically designed weapons dependent on Prawn DNA, and van de Merwe's perfect transition between a human and alien species. Well maybe not totally original for the latter idea, there was Vincent Price's 1958 flick ""The Fly"" and 1959's ""The Wasp Woman"". But the idea still seemed fresh here, maybe I haven't seen enough present day movies to be more critical.<br/><br/>I know it probably wasn't intentional, but the film's comic moment for me was when the cat food of choice for the Prawns was revealed to be Puddi brand. Automatically I connected to those old Warner Brothers cartoons with Sylvester and Tweety when the canary protagonist 'taut he taw a puddi tat'. My mind works in strange ways sometimes.<br/><br/>There's certainly a political and racially motivated component to the story, but I won't get into that here. I would have preferred if the picture explored those elements more effectively than in pursuing a high tech action adventure format in the latter part of the picture. But since it wasn't my call, I can still offer a reasonable recommendation for the flick on it's own merits, with a look that manages to instill a naturalness along side the ubiquitous CGI."

","Okay, here goes... This movie was made with a relatively small budget of about 40 million (thats about 10 million more than what Dragon Ball Evolution was made from) but, in my opinion, is the second best movie this year (first place goes to Inglorious Basterds and third to Star Trek), with amazing acting, the best editing I've seen in a while, an inspiring, enchanting tale and very,very,very good direction. The story goes like this; aliens have been made a temporary colony in Jo'burg after they had been stranded on Earth. These aliens, the Prawns, are to be evicted from District 9 (hence the title) and relocated to District 10, in the outskirts of the city. MNU, the organization in charge of the eviction, hires Wikus Vande Merwe (fantastically played by debutant Sharlto Copey) to do the job. However, an accident occurs and Wikus finds out that he is turning into an alien. Sharlto Copey as Wikus, is amazing. He starts out as a total moron, who finds his humanity at the end of the movie, although he is inhumane. Well, this movie shows how inhumane man can be in his quest for power and the acting strongly helps in conveying this message to the audience. The movie starts out as a documentary (like the Blair Witch Project) but ends up as a full fledged action movie, and you don't even feel the transition (brilliant editing, should win the Oscar!) The special effects are pretty amazing and makes the special effects of 250 million dollar budgeted Transformers 2 look bad. The Prawns are completely inhuman, but as the movie proceeds, they gain your sympathy, they gain your heart. As you leave the theatre, you'll hate humanity, you'll hate yourself and fall in love with the humans. This movie's greatest triumph is making us hate ourselves, and in that feeling we tend to try to change. Yes, that's D9's greatest triumph. Its a great movie for action fans too. You get some amazing action in between the unstoppable barrage of cuss words which makes this movie worthwhile. So, instead of spending your money on 250,000,000 $ crap (TRANSFORMERS REVENGE OF THE FALLEN) watch this 40 mn marvel. Well, I can't wait to watch it for the 16th time. ****1/2 out of 5"
"callanvass","7","0","4","21 February 2010"," Mixed feelings on this overrated, yet undeniably thought provoking sci-fi satire.
","District 9 was a movie that I might have had too much expectations for. It's certainly interesting, and the final 20 minutes really do deliver, but I had plenty a problems with it. It tries so hard to look intelligent, and be intelligent, and while it is to a certain extent, it's not as smart as it likes to think it is. I disliked the cruelty in it. They were offing a lot of the prawns for no apparent reason, only showing us what the documentary style did at the start, which was kinda weird itself. Sharlto Copley comes off as a low rent Dainel Craig sorta, only he's German, and his character is awfully hard to feel sympathy for a lot of times, because he himself, ordered the prawns around, and acted like a coward on many occasions. The relationship between The main alien and his son, with Wikus is actually the best thing about this movie. His compassion for them was quite cute. The special effects for the modest budget it had, were quite impressive too. District 9 definitely made me think, and had it's fair share of good moments, but it's not the masterpiece everyone says it is.<br/><br/>Bottom line. District 9 is a good movie, very thought provoking, and unique, but as I said it's cruelty started to get on my nerves, and it's hard to relate to many of the people. Well worth a look for it's originality, but don't get yourself all worked up in the hype of it all.<br/><br/>7/10"

","District 9 is a truly original science fiction action flick that has been missing from modern film for a long time. It is such an original drama, even those not into the science fiction genre will find it believable .

There is just something really freaking cool about seeing aliens and monsters shot on hand held cameras! Speaking of aliens, the aliens in this movie have a real bad attitude, and are much more intimating then Avatars. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, take the academy's best picture nod as a reason to.

","It is difficult to mock this film and not to enjoy it given its high commendation on this website and its Oscar nomination for best picture. I am no fan of science fiction over drama or thrillers or romance but this is an entertaining and original film which should undoubtedly be seen.<br/><br/>It is the last of the Oscar best picture nominations for 2010 for me to see and I think the one with the least chance. It clearly will have a cult following with people of all sectors of society.<br/><br/>I wonder whether Peter Jackson was called upon for his experience in character creation with Lord of the Rings series, that is a semblance of connection for me.<br/><br/>overall it is a harsh story line and I feel the aliens are not treated sympathetically, given they are a unique species. Fencing them in and letting them live in slum conditions was surely a throwback to Soweto and Apartheid, but who am I to be correct about that? The film is more of a documentary than a conventional movie but don't be put off by that. I agree with earlier comments that this is a very realistic storyline and we can all apply our intelligence to think that something like this COULD happen but surely the rest of the world would not stand by idle and allow a country like South Africa.<br/><br/>The MNU were clearly integral to the story and their quest for weapon control than alien-welfare was an underlying factor.<br/><br/>sorry folks, I was much more comfortable with NINE and STAR TREK, does Blomkamp really want us to think the aliens are coming? It is World Cup year of course!"
"RJBurke1942","7","0","4","17 February 2010"," A fantastic allegory – and an allegorical fantasy.
","Imagine an alien inter-galactic space ship arriving above one of the major cities of the world. Wait – that was already done in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). There's nothing like sticking to a good formula, though...<br/><br/>In this story, however, the world doesn't stand still; instead, the space ship does, hovering, blocking out the sun over a major portion of the city (in this case, Johannesburg) and, no doubt, interrupting the tanning efforts of many would-be sun worshippers. No matter, because the poor aliens' ship is broken, and its crew descends to earth for help – only to be corralled into alien ghettos by downright unfriendly humans who just treat them like, well, sub-humans. Now, just why the aliens – called prawns by the alienist humans – allow themselves to be so imprisoned is poorly explained. But, that's part of the delicious allegory, however.<br/><br/>Essentially, the movie opens with a private company – MRU – beginning the process of getting all those no good aliens off their butts, outta those slum dwellings and outta sight into to some other corral 250 kilometers away from the city, and – let's face it – outta the way of the humans too...<br/><br/>From that point, the satire is poured on, thick and fast, as the hero – some would say jerk – in charge, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) sees the eviction and transportation scheme going to pieces when other factions muscle in with more permanent ideas – like, death for the aliens, for instance. By the end of a bad day for Wikus, a worse one for the bad guys, and a cornucopia of crunching collisions between machines, men, and aliens, the viewer might be left drenched in the sweat of excitement – but, thankfully, not in the gory blood, body parts and guts that are liberally thrown about and which often spatter the camera lenses. All good fun, hey...<br/><br/>For me, the best part about the film is the comedy supplied by Wikus as he tries to save the day – for himself, largely – and the unintended (?) hilarity of the fight sequences between the bad humans and the good aliens. Talk about over the top gore mixed with humour: Nightmare on Elm Street is kid's stuff by comparison. Hang on, Nightmare is kid's stuff...<br/><br/>Oh, well, while on the topic of other movies, you should know that District 9 slavishly copies species metamorphosis from The Thing (1984) and The Fly (1986), powerful weaponry similar to that in the latest Terminator offering, and gallons of gore from the Predator series. So, all in all, Distruct 9 – sorry, District 9 is a pretty darned good action flick. Technically, it's very good too: doing for $30 million what cost Cameron's backers $300 million for his Avatar adventure, but without the 3D, of course. And, while on Avatar, you'll note distinct motivational similarities between Wikus in District 9 and the marine hero Jake in Cameron's epic; and you'll also see the organic/machine merge – as in Avatar – to let rip the ultimate intelligent killing machine. The cinematography, CGI and editing all meld to great effect for a frenetic, and often funny, 112 minutes.<br/><br/>In sum, as pure escapist entertainment it's an interesting film, with an even more interesting semi-documentary structure to it at the beginning and the end. Hence, overall, I'd recommended it to those who like to see something different in sci-fi – and combining a not-so-subtle message about intolerance, which, as some would know, has been the subject of cinema ever since D. W. Griffith made Intolerance in 1916.<br/><br/>Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose, as the French say."

","First I'm not here to bash this film in any way. It has an intelligent socially relevant story line with exciting screen imagery...it has a cast of believable actors and great CGI integration, good directing and the format (told as a documentary) are all carried off well with few flaws. I liked this film and I'm not a sci-fi fan boy. With all this film has, it also has some logic gaps in the story line.<br/><br/>First, we are not let in on exactly why the aliens became too wretched to fly their craft any longer.<br/><br/>Second, we are not told how a civilization capable of the technology the 'prawns' are found with, appear to have so many individuals who function on such a low social or technological level (were the ""prawns"" a race of slaves)? <br/><br/>Third, why are the two aliens the human protagonist is in contact apparently the only intellectually evolved aliens we see?<br/><br/>Fourth, after the bonding between the human and the Aliens he sacrifices himself to help escape, the Alien 'promises' to return and 'fix' the alien mutation experienced by the human protagonist.<br/><br/>Seems to me these gaps were installed to open an opportunity to answer them in a sequel - ""District 10""??"
"ptodegaard","9","0","3","15 February 2010"," Not without holes, but still good
","This movie seems to have a devoted base of reviewers split into two equal groups, one of which rate it as the best movie of the year and the other of which rates at the level of the garbage dump therein. <br/><br/>To start, yes, there are plot holes. Yes, more than a few. 1) A species of aliens in control of superior technology seem to be helpless against the government with projectile weapons, despite the aliens possession of projectile weapons, energy weapons, and robots. 2) Alien ""fuel"" somehow transforms a man into a prawn genetically. 3) In the very end, Wikus is in an alien robot with energy weapons for arms. He's fighting a bunch of mercenaries with AK's and other projectile weapons. Hey! FIRE BACK! It would be easy! Kill them first, then run! Wikus instead uses this robot as a shield while talking to Christopher. Where does this sudden empathy come from, so much that he's willing to sacrifice himself to save an alien he knocked unconscious ten minutes earlier, because the alien wanted to save his race from being ""medical experiments"" before helping Wikus? 4) How many villains die at the last second because they wasted time talking about how much they were going to enjoy killing the hero in question? <br/><br/>People continue to complain about character development, which I think the movie did just fine. What would you like more of, Wikus's family history? More would have gotten in the way of the movie. What about the history of the aliens, or Christopher and Oliver? We know all we need to know by the conditions they're forced to live in.<br/><br/>I think it's good that the story of district 9 is not completely cliché. The main character isn't the only person who sees the problems with human / alien society. In fact, the main character is mostly an asshole right up until the end. This is realistic.<br/><br/>This movie is not by all means perfect. District 9 has it's share of plot holes, and things that don't make sense, and clichés, but it is still very original, and the story is well presented. The characters all make sense, and there isn't a single bad acting role throughout. Not to mention some of the best CGI effects I've seen. Unlike other movies, *coughAVATARcough* District 9 doesn't depend entirely on it's visual effects to be a good movie."
"david-phillips-4","8","0","3","15 February 2010"," The Prawn Identity
","Neill Blomkamp gets his first shot as a major feature director, thanks to Peter Jackson, with a sci-fi movie based upon a short film he had previously made. Imagine aliens have landed on earth and they happen to hit Johannesburg. Only these aliens aren't here to invade or teach us the errors of our waysthey are essentially refugees. Interned in a camp (the eponymous District 9), the aliens become a huge welfare headache for the government. Seemingly unfit for any integration with the human race, the camp quickly becomes a shanty town for exploitation and crime. The aliens, dubbed ""prawns"" by humans, do have advanced technology, especially weapons, so private companies do have an interest in District 9. In particular, confiscating and attempting to use the weapons, as this holds massive potential revenue. One hitch to that plan is that the weapons only work when connected to an alien. Wikus Van De Merwe is your archetypal office guy. He's the boss's son-in-law and he finds himself suddenly promoted to a new initiative to evict all of the aliens in District 9 and move them to the new District 10. This involves much door to door calling, as each resident must sign their approval to the move. It is here where Wikus Van De Merwe's adventure begins Blomkamp deals with what could be a complex set up by providing the back story to the aliens' arrival using various news reports from the time. This is then interspersed with interviews with people who know/knew Wikus. Not only does this serve to inform us of what has happened so far, it also sows the seeds for what is to come. The movie continues very much in the same vein, using a good mix of documentary, CCTV and faux news reports to help push the narrative along with regular movie footage, i.e. not presented as another medium. Initially, this gave me the impression of watching a particularly bizarre version of Touching the Void or a futuristic episode of 999. But, as the film progresses, the gimmicks become less obvious and the story takes over. Apparently, Blomkamp intended the movie to be an analogy on his own experiences during the reign of apartheid in South Africa. Because the movie is such a good sci-fi action movie, a lot of the inherent racism towards the aliens could get lost. But, the interviews and the interaction with the aliens does provide excellent illustrations of how a race that perceives themselves to be the top of the food chain could be so dismissive of another race: forming stereotypes, nicknames, exploiting and confining to particular areas for their own kind. And, let us remember, these times were not so long ago, and in some places still exist, were you to replace the aliens with another human race. The movie works well as a reflection upon a period of time and attitudes that we all hope are long behind us. And it also works well as an action movie. In a twist of fate, born of so many action/buddy movies, Wikus finds himself in need of the help of an alien and his son and they form an unlikely alliance to both help Wikus out of his predicament and of the aliens and there's. As Wikus, Sharlto Copley, is a revelation. He brings the right balance of humour, awkwardness and eventual determination so that, despite reservation about him to begin with, we root for him. This is Copley's first movie, aside from featuring in the original short, and he effortlessly provides us with a character that is real. A massive achievement when you consider he was acting with CGI much of the time. Time will tell if this is his one defining moment, see him soon as ""Howling Mad"" Murdoch in the upcoming A-Team movie. And of Blomkamp? he has proved with the support and budget offered by Peter Jackson, that he can not only write and direct a fine movie; he can create a vision in which to tell the story. As yet, there is no word on what Blomkamp's next step will be. But, like Copley, expectation will be high based upon this movie. www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com"
"CountZero313","8","0","2","12 February 2010"," the humanity of prawns
","A blend of wry comedy, social critique and sci-fi, District 9 is a genre hybrid that works on every level. A deceptively simple script weaves in its references to apartheid specifically and prejudice generally in a subtle but recognizable manner. However, that is more a motif than central concern in this character-driven tale of one man's journey to discover his own humanity through forging a connection with... well, a large prawn.<br/><br/>Containing acceptable and unobtrusive CGI, and decent action sequences, the film's stand-out element is the performance by Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van De Merwe. A low-level official catapulted through nepotism to a status he is ill-equipped to handle, Wikus finds himself infected by alien technology to the point where his very existence is threatened.<br/><br/>And that is as much as you need to know, because like many viewers, I came to District 9 with certain expectations induced by the hype, but found it refreshingly different. A judicious splash of humour is threaded through, mostly regarding sex with ugly aliens (and the aliens are protected by ""human rights"" groups), and humane feeling is with the aliens, of course. In the longer term, this film may just cause a seismic genre shift. After District 9, it may be difficult to take seriously yet another film that has a spaceship settle on Manhattan as its final destination. Expect the likes of Bogota, Tripoli, Kobe and Glasgow to be the future dropping-off points.<br/><br/>Fresh, entertaining, moving and socially relevant, District 9 is a multi-layered film that even gets away with an ending mostly designed to set up a sequel. Down and dirty sci-fi at its best."

"laursene","8","0","3","10 February 2010"," Not about apartheid
","Some people who've seen District 9 conclude that it's an allegory of sorts about apartheid. I certainly haven't had the opportunity to ask the writer or director, but I suspect it's about something else.<br/><br/>For quite a few years now, South Africa has had an influx or economic refugees from Zimbabwe, Congo, and other nearby states. Blacks, almost more than whites, have become very upset, accusing these people of taking away jobs, boosting the crime rate (which is already bad enough), and generally being too culturally ""different."" There have been calls to isolate them, remove them, etc.<br/><br/>This is the predicament the movie takes off from, I think. People in South Africa must get a real shock of recognition during the scenes where locals attack the aliens, kill them, burn their shanties, etc. It's also interesting to see the portrayal of MNU: the arms makers and dealers and gaggle of mercenaries left over from the apartheid days, coming back in mega-corporate form to haunt the successor, black-majority regime, perhaps even dominate it.<br/><br/>So this isn't an ""allegory"" about a bygone time. It's a very contemporary, ""what kind of a country are we becoming?"" film, full of disillusionment at what's happened to the hopefulness of the early post-apartheid days."
"bournefootball","8","0","2","5 February 2010"," The surprise hit of the summer is 'District 9'...
","Hype can be a dangerous thing for a film, and in the case of 'District 9' it's the sort of thing that both helps and hurts it. Hype is what got the film to reach the status of being an ""event"" picture, but hype is what keeps it from being as good in my mind as it can be. The movie works far better as an under the radar film (which partially explains how the hype began) since it's got a decidedly independent flavor to it. Putting all that aside, it's a damn good movie, one that combines ideas with action, a rare mix in this day and age.<br/><br/>The movie takes the ""aliens visiting Earth"" plot and spins it on its ear a bit. Instead of them going to a big city, they end up in Johannesburg, stranded and without leadership. Humans soon make contact and despite some good intentions early on, end up locking them away in a slum. Tensions rise and when it is decided for their home to be relocated (from District 9 to the concentration camp like District 10), things don't go well and quite a bit goes down. The film works best as a surprise, so I'll abandon description here, but suffice to say, it won't be pretty.<br/><br/>The film is best during its opening act, when it is a fake documentary providing history to the event and setting up the situation that feeds the movie. It gives you all you need to know about what the world of the film is like, and you almost feel like you are there. It's still good when it transfers over to a more conventional narrative (shot very much like the Paul Greengrass directed Jason Bourne movies), but it falls off from its high perch until the very good ending, which leaves things very much open ended, surely to inspire debate.<br/><br/>First time director Neil Blomkamp shows why Peter Jackson wanted him to make the Halo movie. His direction and writing is strong and assured. The special effects are terrific, and the movie keeps a very good pace despite a longer running time than probably is necessary. The action is extremely kinetic and gory, but never too frantic to follow.<br/><br/>There is only one real human character of any note in the film, and it's protagonist Wilkus Van De Merwe (first time actor Sharlto Copely), a bureaucrat entrusted with the removal of the aliens (known as prawns) from District 9. He starts out as a bit of a douche and not the type of guy you'd probably like, but by the end of the filmwell, let's just say things end up very different than they start.<br/><br/>If you're expecting the next great science fiction film, you're not going to get that (it's not even the best one this year, that honor goes to Moon). What it is, however, is a very strong sci-fi film mixed with some very good action and ideas. Blomkamp hurts the film by making the segregation allegory far too strong and prominent (a little would have gone a long way, and it's good stuff for the movie, just that it ends up like a hammer to the head after a while), though his ability to make you identify with aliens as opposed to humans is done quite well. If you mildly temper your expectations, there is a lot to like about 'District 9'. Even with the hype, it's a very good film, just one I wish would have not been sold to us quite as hard as this one has. Even so, you're not likely to forget your visit to District 9 anytime soon."
"meeza","9","0","3","3 February 2010"," District Fine!
","There is a cohesive adjudication by many that Writer-Director's Neil Blomkamp's ""District 9"" is the most original film of the year. I think I will also reside in that judgment district. I could ""yada yada"" about how much I enjoyed this film, but there is no experience like visiting ""District 9"" yourself to get the real zest of the movie. Many of you have inhabited the plot of ""District 9""= Twenty years ago, an Extraterrestrial race made their way to Johannesburg, and consequently are forced to live in a slum area in the city called District 9; all while their massive standstill spaceship occupies the Johannesburg sky above. Twenty years later, a munitions corporation called Multi National United (MNU) is contracted to forcibly evict the aliens (which they call Spawns) of District 9 and use them for weaponry experimental purposes. They delegate the clumsy operative Wilkus Van De Merwe to head the mission. Even though at first, Van De Merwe is doing a ""gran de mierda"" job with the mission, he turns out to be a very engaging hero whose broad personality & antics does wonders to the film's success. Sharlto Copley's dynamic starring performance as the resilient Wilkus was definitely not one of charlatan material. I can't cope with the fact that Copley was not nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award. The aliens (spawns) of ""District 9"" were also (how can I put this?) Far Out!!! Christopher Johnson is the premier spawn character in the film which might or might not have the long searching fluid for the aliens to be able to disembark the slums and return home. In other words, Chris Johnson wants to be the main Spawn Titan to get them out of there. Oops! Wrong Chris Johnson! Blomkamp's outlandish direction and imaginative scribe of ""District 9"" were one of the elites of the year. I think many Hollywood studios will be ""kamping"" out for Blomkamp's services for some time to come. Some other film-making experts of ""District 9"" also contributed to its highly-legal grand cinematic residency: Emilia Roux's art direction, Julian Clarke's editing, Clinton Shorter's score, Trent Opaloch's cinematography, and the entire makeup & special effects crews. So make your way to ""District 9"" and see Wilkus & the Slumprawn Alienaires duke it out with the nasty (it's not all about) the MNU. ***** Excellent"

It hovers for about 4 months before humans travel up to the ship, cut their way in and bring down the 1 million starving aliens.<br/><br/>What happens after that parallels what happens down here on earth when one group no longer wants the other around. It is horrific.<br/><br/>With intense scenes, good acting, good cgi and a good idea brought to the screen I think most people will find this very interesting."

","All eyes on Neill Bloekamp from now on for his film is an unmitigated triumph and a freshening breath of air in a world of Transformers and Terminators.I found myself actually caring, yes,caring for the CGI creations on display which is no mean feat considering the permanent scar of Jar Jar Binks on my movie loving brain.So,District 9 is an alien film set very firmly in a sense of reality well supported by a bookended documentary style. The film is accessible to the action genre with some outstanding set pieces but is also a film that will work on a higher intellectual level with its subtext being firmly placed on the wrongs of racial discrimination.What would be a shame is if the film spawns sequels and becomes a franchise as the thing it does very well is to say to the Michael Bays and McGs of this world , you can have great effects but you can also make a good film."

","It happens all too often where aliens invade the Earth violently, with vastly superior technology and intents to harvest, destroy or both. There's very few that humanize these invaders in a non-cliché way. And here's one that humanizes the aliens as blue-collar workers entering our xenophobic lifestyle. By paralleling human discrimination, District 9 is actually one of the best sci-fi movies to come out in a long time.<br/><br/>The plot of District 9 purposely mirrors the Apartheid rule of South Africa. A bunch of aliens crash in Johannesburg, discovered to be blue-collar workers and moved out of their mothership in what initially seems to be a humanitarian move. The settlement they are given, however, quickly becomes a slum known as district 9. A private interest group known as MNU oversees district 9, but appears to have other interests, namely in the advanced weaponary aboard the ship. Nigerian gangsters take advantage of the ""prawns"", trading cat food (which the aliens love) for weapons, although they are unable to use them. Their solution is to, of course, eat the prawns to gain their power.<br/><br/>Due to the conditions of district 9 (ie being so close to the regular people), MNU decides to move the aliens to district 10, further out of the city. The task is left to Wikus van der Merwe (Copley), a mild-mannered office worker who just happens to be connected through his father-in-law. While serving notices, he finds a suspicious canister in the house of the alien ""Christopher Johnson"", and is sprayed by it.<br/><br/>What happens next really shouldn't be spoiled, but suffice to say things don't go well for Wikus after this. The exact effect of the spray is almost laughable at first (a fine case of applied phlebotnium, a magical substance that does whatever the plot requires it to do), but it services the plot quite excellently. But really, alien fluid? C'mon.<br/><br/>Wikus himself is a truly excellent character. While never as nasty or fully aware as his superiors, he is far from completely sympathetic. He threatens poor Christopher in an extremely evil way involving his son. He views the aliens as a pest. He aborts a group of alien children by fire without a second thought. He is the definition of asshole protagonist. It is a tribute to Copley's excellent performance that we are completely aware of this yet still sympathize with him at the end.<br/><br/>The true hero of the story is Christopher Johnson, the prawn with the plan. His reaction to discovering the experimentation of MNU is one of justified rage, but usually he is logical and mild-mannered. The same cannot be said of the other prawns. They earn they're reputation often, although not usually unprovoked. I'm glad the aliens weren't glorified as ""pure beings"", but perhaps they could've standed to have more than two sympathetic characters. Christopher's son CJ is also a little too Hollywood-cute for a shrimp-looking alien.<br/><br/>There are three distinct acts to the movie. The introduction, which has a very well done mockumentary feel to it. The change to traditional narrative by the second act is impressively subtle. The conspiracy of the second act lets way to traditional sci-fi blow-stuff-up by the third act. Its a little intellectually disappointing that this route was chosen, but at the same time, I'll be damned if it isn't awesome on so many levels. Let's just say more heads explode than in any more ever before, and a man is killed by a flying pig carcass. And all on a relatively small budget. Bravo indeed. Unfortunately, the trailer steals away a lot of the suspense from these sequences.<br/><br/>Now for some random thoughts too small for their own paragraph: The bad guys are maybe a little too two-dimensional, showing no real moral dilemma. This is acceptable for badass Colonel Koobus, one of the slimiest sci-fi bad guys ever, but a little more humanity would have been nice. The soldiers also suffer from the stormtrooper effect to a ridiculous degree, getting wasted like candy. The alien weaponary seemed far too advanced for a ship of worker bees, and I feel it should have been more comparable in power to human weaponary. But it was still really cool.<br/><br/>Even though it loses some respect in the last act, that last act IS ridiculously cool. The extremely original and refreshingly low-budget feel of the entire movie warrants a must-see status among sci-fi lovers, and film lovers in general. More exciting than most blockbusters out there right now and more thought-provoking than most dramas, District 9 is highly recommended."

"John_Truby","Null","0","1","8 January 2010"," A great story strategy
","District 9 is a perfect example of the primary story strategy on which the worldwide entertainment business is based: use a popular genre as a vehicle to carry a larger theme.<br/><br/>A genre is a story model, but to understand the supreme power of genre in international cinema you have to break down both of those words.<br/><br/>""Model"" involves the meaning package, like love, action, detective and science fiction. Why are there different story models? Because each expresses a different theme, each gives the audience a different strategy for how to live a good life.<br/><br/>""Story"" means narrative drive, by far the single biggest element in a movie's popularity worldwide. District 9 is more proof that movie stars don't cause blockbusters, narrative does. For years I've been crying in the wilderness that the movie star strategy is the second biggest fallacy in movie history, right after the French auteur theory that says that the director, not the writer, is the author of the film.<br/><br/>If you want to see why a movie succeeds or fails with audiences worldwide, you'll find 90% of your answer in the success or failure of its narrative drive. Besides expressing a unique thematic package to the audience, each genre presents a highly streamlined form of narrative drive. Genres remove the padding that kills most scripts, which is why you need to master the story beats of your genre, along with its thematic package, if you want to win the international screenplay sweepstakes.<br/><br/>So what is the narrative strategy and thematic package of the surprise blockbuster, District 9? District 9 is a combination of science fiction and horror, with strong action elements thrown in. Putting science fiction and horror together is quite common because their thematic packages have a number of important similarities. Horror is about defeating the monster, the outsider, the inhuman trying to enter the human community, especially when that community is on the small scale of the family or the hero's own mind.<br/><br/>Science fiction often deals with encountering the alien, the outsider on the social or universal scale. Here the opposition is not between the hero and the intimate, but terrifying other, it is between mankind and some other life form, or mankind and robot, or machine man.<br/><br/>When you look at how similar these two genres are in their deeper thematic package, the surprise of District 9 is not that it is a futuristic apartheid story set in Johannesburg, South Africa, but that it took so long for a writer to do it. South Africa, of course, was the site of the worst apartheid since the Nazis.<br/><br/>Those of us who like to think we aren't racist tend to associate racism with demeaning and hurtful words, and that's so passé now that we have a black President. But racism is really about how people live, or don't live, and that is far from passé in the world today. It's officially sanctioned slavery, resulting in such poverty that the oppressed race literally lives like animals, beasts of burden living in pens. And racism is always justified by the dominant race thinking of the ""other"" as less than human.<br/><br/>Writers Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell could have expressed this worldwide systemic nightmare using the drama form, which explores psychological and social issues with depth and complexity. But where's the entertainment in that? And where's the audience? So Blomkamp and Tatchell sacrificed complexity for narrative drive, and chose the perfect genres, horror and science fiction, to drive the story home with a worldwide audience.<br/><br/>The great trick to the narrative drive of District 9 is that the writers didn't just hit the standard science fiction-horror story beats. They knew their genres so well they were able to transcend them, something I emphasize a lot in the Horror, Fantasy, and Science Fiction Class. They used the classic structural twist found in the best horror, going back to the first and still greatest horror story of all time, Frankenstein: at some point in the story, the hero becomes the monster and the monster becomes the hero.<br/><br/>The main character, Wikus, starts off as an extremely likable but somewhat dense man who is put in charge of moving the aliens from their ghetto in Johannesburg to a new ghetto many miles away. These aliens are monstrous, terrifying creatures to us – both characters and audience -- forced to live like animals and referred to as ""prawns."" The structural flip occurs when Wikus and his men attempt to force these aliens out of the shacks they call home. And a strange thing begins to happen to the audience. At first we side with our sympathetic but dim main character as he tries to evict these disgusting creatures. I certainly wouldn't want them living near my house. But when our hero and the other humans are ""forced"" to escalate their methods to move the creatures, the audience starts to root for the non-humans and sees the humans as the real monsters.<br/><br/>The writers realized that the horror story is an extremely small-scale form that would run out of narrative fuel fairly quickly. After all, how many times can you hit the same story beat of humans persecuting aliens. So, about half way in, they turned the script into an action picture, which they accomplished by changing the hero's desire line. Instead of persecuting the aliens, now he wants to get the cylinder, and he will use whatever firepower he can find to blow the bad guys away.<br/><br/>To finish reading this review please visit http://www.truby.com/im_district9.php"

When the two aliens were fighting over the tire, I thought there was going to be a human fire necklace kind of reference.<br/><br/>Anyway, my only real problem with the movie, was the importance of finding the minute amount of material to process, that was used to create fuel needed to power a ship nearly the size of downtown Johannsburg SA. My question is, if this is the only thing that was stopping them from returning home, why could they have not carried an extra case or two of these 10"" cylinders of fuel?

My only hang up with it, is that even after the great CGI, or the compelling and immersing story, This is a movie that you won't watch more than a few times a year. Unless you don't mind watching the movie over and over knowing the same points, there no underlying truth or hidden mystery left within. Sure, we don't really find out what happens to our government agent we love so much, nor do we find out what becomes of our favorite prawn, but I don't care and I don't think many viewers did either. Which leads me to my point. There was no intellectual backbone,We got no insight on how the prawn tech worked other than it required their DNA structure to work. I am more interested on how the blast from their weapon kills a person rather than how the technology is used. No movie is without it's flaws, and neither was this one, but the movie was so well done that my problems that I have are subtle at best. This is a must see if your an avid watcher of movies."

","I was tempted to give this a 9 only because I was a bit tired when I watched it so I'm not sure if I fully appreciated it, but 8 is a good, safe score since I did enjoy the film.<br/><br/>I'm a huge sci-fi buff (books, movies, you name it) and these days good movies in this genre are few and far between. Luckily this one was pretty good and was original enough that it felt fresh in comparison to what's already been done. <br/><br/>This movie is yet another example of how, in my opinion, if you want the audience to buy in to what's going on on the screen then lesser known actors is the way to go. Most movies don't abide by this because well, they want to make as much money as possible. Too bad most movie-goers feed this theory because most of the time is just distracts from the story. District 9 doesn't have this problem though. The acting is solid all around and the focus is where it should be.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about the effects. They're about as close as you can get to having real aliens walking around (whatever that looks like, but you get the point). So many movies that have been released before AND after this one had distracting, disappointing CGI. Thankfully this isn't the case here. The graphics themselves have unbelievable textures and reflect light sources as accurately as possible.<br/><br/>There's not a whole lot wrong with this movie. There's certainly some valid nitpicks as other as have pointed out, but nothing you're not willing to let go in my opinion. That speaks a lot to how effective everything else is. Sure you can quibble about details surrounding the aliens' technology and whatnot, but come on. The smallest bit of suspension of disbelief goes a long way. If you want to see a sci-fi movie that really has issues go rent Terminator: Salvation. You'll probably appreciate this movie a lot more.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't care for was that I thought the ending kind of lost the focus of the movie somewhat. It's basically a big long action sequence with less emotion than I had hoped for. I think if they let the story carry the ending and inject action only where necessary it would have been tighter. <br/><br/>Overall, I'll still take my Blade Runner, Star Wars, Terminator 2, etc. over this movie any day, but it's still very good and probably worth more than one viewing if you're into science fiction."

CONCENTRATION CAMP situation.<br/><br/>And of course, there are a few of these ""Prawns"" that really do not want to go to the new Concentration Camp- And it is Wikus, interacting with these few Prawns - That starts the Ruckus in this Film.<br/><br/>Now - In direct relation to films like the original Star Wars Trilogy - The Second SW Trilogy - ALIEN - We have these observations:<br/><br/>If you listen to the Director Commentary for District 9, he talks about how the Digital Effects were deliberately de-emphasised... For instance in the beginning of the film, the first time we see the gigantic space-ship, it is not like it was shown in Independence Day, ""V"", or any other film where a huge mothership LOOMS over a city- The first view of the ship is in DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE, what looks like a hand held cam.<br/><br/>Same thing with shots of the aliens, they are shown in groups of rioting people and in slums.<br/><br/>However, in Avatar, it was almost like ""See how much money we paid for Digital Effects"" - Every shot with digital characters is totally over-emphasized. But that is just Jim Cameron- Like in Titanic, he had to use that footage of the real titanic on the bottom of the ocean- Which is confirmed in ""Ghosts of the Titanic"" when he went down there agin in 2001, right around the time of 9/11 - He went down to the Titanic again and you can see where he got most of the footage for Titanic...<br/><br/>Avatar however, I give the guy respect for BLENDING the digital world and characters he created with the live action people and set pieces - He moved it a step beyond Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>But between Avatar and District 9 - Avatar is basically EYE candy, I like what it looks like, but District 9 is the most gritty, realistic film I have ever seen- and IF a spaceship went to South Africa, it would be treated similarly.<br/><br/>The ironic thing is that while District 9 was filming, there was a real situation with Zimbabwe - riots and fighting.<br/><br/>Also, the use of those troop transport trucks with the ""V"" shape - I never knew that was an anti-mine design - and it is strictly used in South Africa by the paramilitary."

Most sci-fi films look very slick and really show off, but its docu-drama, handicam look is very different, and lends a certain sense of realism to the aliens and the technology. The aliens themselves are really impressive creations.<br/><br/>The story is a variation on the everyman-caught-up-in-extraordinary-circumstances trope. Its most interesting aspect is that while everymen in movies tend to be a little better than the average man, District 9's protagonist is neither especially nice nor especially smart, and is a rather pathetic specimen. The story itself isn't especially surprising or original, but it's done well and keeps moving.<br/><br/>The allegory is anything but subtle, but the movie certainly makes its point, and does so fairly quickly to leave lots of room for blowing up stuff.<br/><br/>I feel there are a few plot holes that I would like filled, but all-in-all this is a very entertaining, well-filmed movie."

","Decades ago aliens came to Earth. The mother ship hovered over Johannesburg, South Africa, and an attack never came. The aliens became refugees and were sent to District 9. The aliens were docile but their living areas had become slums and they were becoming more aggressive, and the government needed to relocate them far away from the cities. By accident, Wikus (Copley) gets infected with alien DNA and the story starts.<br/><br/>When the government tries to relocate the aliens and needs them to sign eviction papers it's a sight to see. I can only liken it to trying to get hundreds of monkeys to understand English and what is happening and putting eviction papers in their faces for them to sign. Get the picture? Not a pretty sight. <br/><br/>The aliens are called Prawns because they look like shrimp with legs and they speak what sounds like insect utterances. Not sure how I know that. Both humans and aliens understand each other. The story didn't go into explaining how that came about unless I missed it. Actually, I really don't want to know.<br/><br/>This is quite a story and I didn't think there would be one considering how the movie opened with the eviction notices, and all the confusion. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The Alien leader of the mother ship never allowed himself to be identified. That would have been too easy and we wouldn't have a story. Why he never did that is not explained either. <br/><br/>But, the story focuses on Wikus and his troubles and the story is quite good.

","Alien creatures come to earth and there are thousands of them which they have had to contain all of them into a location called District 9. Of all locations they came to Johanesburg, South Africa and the whole world was watching what happened next. They are to move what they call the Prawns out of Johannesburg to help all the people feel safer and so they won't contaminate the city anymore. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) an alien's affair worker is promoted to evict the 1.8 million Prawns and give them the order that they will be moving soon. One of MNU's main focus is the Prawns weapons and to be able to use them, but only their DNA allows them access to use the weapons. Wikus becomes contaminated with an alien slim and starts to transform into on of the Prawns starting with his hand becoming one of the Prawns hands. He somehow escapes a test facility and tries to find a way to help the head Prawn in order to hopefully become a human again.<br/><br/>This movie is strange, but kind of interesting at the same time. To find a normal guy turning into an alien who then helps them is really creative and fun to watch. This movie is one of a kind and I have never seen a movie like this before.

In my opinion the movie was a success and if you haven't viewed it you should do that instead of reading about it.<br/><br/>For those of you who have viewed the movie; I do like the fact that a UFO appears over Johannesburg, South Africa instead of a popular city in the US or UK. However, I felt like the movie failed to explain, how the South African government kept those others out of their way. The other aspects of the movie that seemed a bit off was the locals could understand the alien language so well, but never spoke it, as well the prawn understood English, but never once utters a word in English. The fact that alien weapons were even allowed to get off the ship is remarkable.

The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9 as the world's nations argued over what to do with them.<br/><br/>Now, patience over the alien situation has run out. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare. MNU will receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliens' powerful weaponry work. So far, they have failed; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA.<br/><br/>The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when MNU begins evicting the non-humans from District 9, with MNU field agents responsible for moving them to a new camp. One of the MNU field operatives, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), contracts an alien virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable—he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology.

","This quite violent science fiction film from South Africa is about seemingly slow witted aliens (who look like giant insects or crustaceans) who arrived in a giant spaceship over Johannesburg some decades ago, and were forcibly put by the government into a camp (actually one big slum) inside the city called District 9, where they live in despairing conditions. When the government decides to relocate them to concentration camps far from Johannesburg, Wikus, a nerdy public servant involved in the relocation, is sprayed with a liquid (which the aliens plan to use in a ploy to return to their planet) and slowly starts to mutate into an alien. Considered now to be a threat to the state, Wikus decides to become a fugitive and help the aliens in their plans (more things happen, but I leave the plot there). While not totally successful, it is nevertheless entertaining, and gives quite food for thought, in ways different than most critics thought. Many critics and commentators lazily called this an apartheid allegory, but if anything the film is much more politically incorrect than that: it's really about the despair white South Africans feel when they realize they are now a tiny minority in a country flooded in crime, driven in part by immigration from other African countries (the portrayal of Nigerians as brutal criminals living alongside the aliens in the slums is particularly heavy handed – it's surprising the film wasn't more denounced for this). The constant use of hand-held camera is a bit tiresome – and may make you feel dizzy as well."

","In Metamorphosis, Kafka explores social reaction to a man being transformed into a giant insect. In Blood Diamond, bounty hunter Leonardo DiCaprio shows the best and worst of humanity as he races through strife-torn Africa to liberate a family. District 9 has a Blair Witch Project style reality TV format buildup – aliens land up in Johannesburg with little to offer and nowhere else to go. They are stigmatized (""prawns"" as epithet), victimized (""humans only""), and isolated and forced to live in a giant slum on the city outskirts. Their only hope of returning to their planet finds an unlikely hero in the form of Wikus Van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), who, largely motivated by his own desire to return to normal, brings hope of deliverance in a disturbing milieu. District 9 manages to showcase the best and worst of man – persecution and sheer human cruelty, the arms race, and the profiteering from vice, in sharp contrast to the coming of age of Van De Merwe and his last gasp effort that gives the ""prawns"" their only last vestige of hope for escaping from the cruelty of man.

I applaud the director Neill Blomkamp for a very unique movie, i was also impressed by the cast.

This looks at a different view of what a alien or a ""prawn"" (as known as) it gave another option that they could in some way be similar to the human race(no by looks though!) That's what i liked about this movie so much, it was far from typical. It started of well with a few minutes explaining the plot about the aliens and use of interviews which makes you wanting more. Even though the action was limited it was really cool and nicely panned out when it was used, (so for all you sci-fi alien action fans, that ones for you!)

"max-vernon","9","0","1","4 October 2009"," Classic satire. Sci-fi as the conscience of the world. Great stuff!
","I only saw this film because of a friend. I'm glad I did. Having read much classic sci-fi as a youngster(Clarke, Heinlein, Asimov, Vance, Dick etc.), I've had 40 years to become rather disenchanted with the whole genre. Shoot-em up, CGI schlock becomes rather tedious. Well-made schlock is still schlock. I blame George Lucas – Hollywood has been following his successfully banal formula ever since. Intelligent parodies or comedies like Ice Pirates and Red Dwarf gave some relief but sci-fi films became increasingly shallow, tiresome and predictable. District 9 has restored my faith.<br/><br/>Classic sci-fi always held up a mirror to the human condition, projecting our deepest fears and fantasies into fantastical worlds of the imagination. But always grounded in human culture and history. Inevitably and inescapably. District 9 is a satire in the classic tradition, like 'Starship Troopers' (book and film), and I congratulate its intelligence.<br/><br/>District 9 should not really work at all because it plays all too obviously on contemporary issues such as racism, apartheid and dislike of immigrants and stereotypes such as brutal South African police, Nigerian criminal gangs and evil arms corporations who are completely without scruple. Yet the film works very well indeed, mainly because the writing is so good, the underlying black humour (characteristic of many Japanese films but too subtle for many Westerners) is so apposite and the acting of the lead character Van De Merwe is Oscar-winning.<br/><br/>The shoot-em up CGI is, arguably, part of the parody on which the film rests. It pokes fun at what our popular culture has come to expect. It entertains but does so in an implicitly self-critical way. One feels regret for the violence, a major achievement in a film containing a fair amount of violence.<br/><br/>I suppose the spiritual forebears of District 9 would include Heinlein's 'Stranger in a Strange Land' and the 1985 film 'Enemy Mine'. Developing human empathy for aliens has a long and honourable history – easy when they are cute like E.T. but only made possible with the less attractive aliens of this film by giving them human personas. Anthropomorphism still rules OK! They may look revolting but under the skin, sorry carapace, they are just like us. Sci-fi has always had a problem in this area because we cannot imagine values, thinking and language beyond the human. Star Trek delegated the job to Spock and his mind meld technique. Vulcans can but humans cannot. The necessary cop-out, as in this film, is to make the aliens human under the skin. Hell, they even pay for sex with our women!<br/><br/>This is my only criticism of an otherwise excellent film which does illuminate aspects of the human condition at this moment in time. It should resonate with European audiences fending off Africans coming up from the South, South African audiences beset by Zimbabweans descending from the North, Americans facing imminent hispanicisation and many other cultures 'under threat' by 'tides' of 'illegals'. There is an amazing parallel between the aliens being evicted from their garbage dump existence and the recent action carried out by the French police near Calais.<br/><br/>District 9 does raise uncomfortable questions for our 'Human Rights Age'. Is our 'humane' response to the alien-human tide escaping poverty and oppression really as humane as we would like to believe? MNU is a state within a state - are multinationals too powerful for politicians to control? Does war generate more profit than peace? Hard questions. No easy answers.<br/><br/>This is a film about humans, not aliens. They simply act as a foil to our deepest anxieties and prejudices. The film could provide valuable source material for future historians of our time. Just like the film 'The Shape of Things to Come' (1936) highlighted the widespread fear of mass bombing by poison gas against which it was thought there was no defence. It's easy to forget that all British civilians were issued with gas masks before World War 2. Never used but a real factor in understanding the mentality of the time. <br/><br/>District 9 provides us with a useful mirror to view our own anxieties generated by the globalising age we live in. Few of us really want to look into this mirror. Sci-fi as the conscience of the world. Welcome rain after a long drought. Great stuff!"

The film gathers momentum and the action becomes intense. Some may find the accent annoying, but it does add to the realism of the film. The technical effects are excellent. Another minor annoyance was the jerky camera work.

","So many films are formulaic or derivative, if not plain remakes or sequels, that it's a real pleasure to find one with some originality as well as pace and verve. This is a science fiction work that is located entirely on Earth in the present day but the clever twist is that the scene is Johannesburg in post-apartheid South Africa where the ugly alien refugees - known for their lobster-like appearance as ""prawns"" - act as a metaphor for the blacks in the apartheid era or the Zimbabweans of present-day South Africa. There's plenty of tension and action, with a documentary style, excellent sound and atmospheric music, but this is also an intelligent allegory about how we treat 'the other'.<br/><br/>The success of the movie is down especially to three men. Neill Blomkamp is from Johannesburg but now lives in Canada and, as the co-writer and first-time feature director, he has scored a triumph; New Zealander and ""Lord Of The Rings"" maestro Peter Jackson was Blomkamp's mentor and producer and his special effects house was responsible for the extraordinary creatures; while Sharlto Copley - a first-time actor improvising most of his lines - is a revelation as corporation operative Wikus Van De Merwe charged with relocating the aliens who grows to be close to them in more than one respect.<br/><br/>The style of the film is somewhat inconsistent and the bad guys - the security company Multi-National United and the Nigerian bootleggers - are presented stereotypically, but this is still a fine premiere by Blomkamp which leaves itself open to a sequel."

Sure, he is being altruistic in helping a young director aiming for the big league, after having co-directed 2008's short Crossing The Line. More likely though, he just wanted to be in on this. Because Neil Blomkamp delivers intelligent, multi-layered science-fiction rivaled only by the likes of Alien(s) and Blade Runner. Only this time, the future is now.<br/><br/>In 1989, a city-sized alien ship has entered our atmosphere and hangs suspended in the skies over Johannesburg, South Africa, with the world awaiting first contact. After several months of interspecies silence, a government agency called Multi-National United (MNU) successfully drills through the exterior of the ship, only to find the extraterrestrials aboard malnourished, sick and in need of help. First reports indicate these prawn-like aliens are working class members of their population only, with all leadership wiped out, possibly on account of a hypothetical virus. With the eyes of the world focused on the South African capital, MNU has no choice but to set up a relief camp for our interstellar guests, bearing resemblance to refugee camps in all but name: District 9.<br/><br/>Fast forward twenty years, when a documentary-style set-up introduces us to protagonist Wikus van de Merwe (a brilliantly neurotic Sharlto Copley), an MNU agent who this day has been promoted to task leader for the oncoming relocation program. District 9 has become a crime and poverty stricken slum, with its alien population imprisoned by MNU, now sturdily in control of research, development and law enforcement rights. One of the many messages of the writer/director's layered script seeps through all but subtly here, when footage of D9 and the riots that closed it off from the human world is nearly indistinguishable from real world outbursts of discrimination and consequently ensuing apartheid and segregation throughout humanity's history. Another (albeit comical) message appears to be 'the Nigerians did it', when we are introduced to the newest racket of our warmonger friends: pushing cans of cat food, the drug of choice in prawn circles, in exchange for alien weaponry, which is of the biological kind and can only be used by aliens themselves. Leave it to the Nigerians to stock up regardless.<br/><br/>Mankind's next solution in this surprisingly could-be-real situation is to move the entire prawn population of 1.8 million to another closed perimeter, some two hundred miles outside the city, where we can pretend the third kind never interfered with our way of life. During the preparatory handing out of eviction notices, Van de Merwe comes in contact with sweet, sweet irony as well as an alien substance manufactured by one of the smarter prawns (to fuel the command pod he hides under his shack; the same pod that came down from the mother ship two decades earlier, but was never found by MNU). The exposure subsequently causes him to gradually transform into a fishy alien himself, instantly making him the most sought after commercial object in twenty years, as his newly grown prawny appendage enables him to use alien weaponry (the kind best compared to MIB's laser guns and Noisy Crickets). Van de Merwe becomes an outcast overnight, as we discover MNU is of course one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers and promptly sets out the entire military force to find him, lead by the fiercely adequate colonel Koobus Venter (David James, another successfully employed unknown). The search party evidently leaves him no choice but to hide in District 9, where he eventually teams up with the pod-hiding prawn (the aptly named Christopher Johnson) to rethink their predicament. It's basically Shrimper's List from here on out, just in case viewers have missed thát analogy.<br/><br/>On account of spoilers however, I will leave the fast-paced second part of the movie to the viewers. Blomkamp has set the scene, brought us his reflections on humanity (not too subtle, but never too in-your-face) and, more-over, pushed the science fiction envelope. After all, the ridiculously restricted budget of thirty million dollars employed for the extremely crafty special effects is the exact amount Jackson went over budget for his latest one-man show. (yes, the two hundred million dollar one-man show. With the monkey). He can now safely go out with a bang (which, believe me, he will). At any rate, he marked a new and extremely original standard in cinematic sci-fi history, enabling him to be thankful for the added weight of his behind-the-scene producer, but will have him confidently flying solo on his next project (which might very well be District 10)."
"jamie-542-869705","6","0","1","29 September 2009"," District 9 - The Review
","So here we are, yet another film about aliens visiting Earth. Big, vaguely-threatening, city-size flying saucers? Check. Ray guns? Check. Funny-looking, insect-like fellas? They're there too. And it's fair to say that if you've any experience with science fiction, you'll be able to guess most of the early plot twists – what the goo does, what's up with his fingernails, and so on.<br/><br/>But the promos were right, this is different. There's no all-American, wise-cracking, chisel-jawed hero; instead we have a bureaucrat whose accent I believe is called 'Afrikaans,' who isn't actually all that nice, despite his disconcertingly chirpy introduction. I mean, he's okay, but he also threatens people, swears like a docker, and mainly acts in his own best interests – sometimes at the cost of a smooth and early plot resolution.<br/><br/>And yet...it works. If we were in that situation, we'd probably do the same. I'm fairly surely I would. He's the kind of dysfunctional anti-hero that the writers of 'Hancock' could only dream of. This angle, along with the general feeling of dread and depravity throughout, had me believing we were headed for an unhappy ending, something I very rarely suspect. The kind of ending that says: 'See how crap you all are? Here's what you get.' I won't tell you if I was right, but the conclusion was another thing I liked about 'District 9'...it wasn't a clear-cut thing, there were definitely shades of grey. Though the very last scene was a little bit corny for my tastes, especially considering the intense emotional roller-coaster that preceded it.<br/><br/>Have I mentioned the ending, without discussing the actual plot? Whoops! The main plot hook, and the idea behind it, is definitely a smart one – you can see how Peter Jackson (the producer) was brought on board. Aliens become stranded on Earth, possibly in the late eighties (the film states they have been here twenty years), and end up hovering over Johannesburg. Once 'rescued' from the ship, they find themselves living in a slum, sleeping under bits of cardboard, harassed by stereotypical African crime lords, and generally having a lousy time. There are moments when the aliens/immigration issues combination feels a bit forced, and there are significant chunks of the film where the humans seem so evil it's just ridiculous; but these weren't serious problems. For the most part, my disbelief was suspended.<br/><br/>One of the ways they achieved this (or tried to) was through use of classic 'cinema verité' techniques, such as shaky cameras, and fake interviews. To be honest though, that aspect didn't really work for me. Some reviewers liked the 'sparing' use of the technique, but you could also call it inconsistent – they were heavy on the 'fake documentary' stuff at the beginning, then forgot about it completely, before picking up again...then dropping it. And it came back at the end. For some reason this ticked me off. Maybe the style is just getting old, they've been doing this sort of thing in science fiction since 'Firefly' (and by the way, they totally stole the ship design, for the smaller alien ship, from that show. You'll see.) The fake interviews made for some good foreshadowing of the main character's fate, but were only very tenuously linked to the rest of the footage. Those parts just seemed like leftovers from a bad TV movie.<br/><br/>The special effects, however, were extremely satisfactory. The lead alien ('played' by Jason Cope) was brilliantly realised, surprisingly full of expression, one of the most convincing CG-character-in-a live-action-film's that I've seen. This made his interactions with the human lead the high point of the movie, turning into a very realistic (and actually, quite touching) friendship. The mothership looks fantastic, and having it floating there in almost every outdoors shot works really well as a 'motif,' a reminder of the issues and problems that metaphorically hover over the city.<br/><br/>The only bad special effects come as a ridiculous one-two punch...a man in a sentry tower explodes like a balloon full of jam, and suddenly a pig is fired out of a cannon. Seriously. I laughed. I'm not a gore lover, and there is a fair bit in the film, but I'm pleased to report I didn't have to look away once – not like when I didn't see the entire second hour of 'Sweeney Todd.' The gore wasn't just there for the sake of it, and it was done with a bit of taste. The sets were fantastic, though apparently they saved a lot of time by shooting most of it in a recently-abandoned existing slum – so perhaps they shouldn't get too much credit for that.<br/><br/>So, to wrap things up. If you've remained unspoiled, I can definitely recommend a trip to see 'District 9', there is a great deal of tension and excitement all the way through. I went in expecting it to be a bit preachy, but it actually wasn't – though there are a couple of problems with the narrative style, particularly the unusual and contradictory mish-mash of techniques. They may make more sense on a second viewing, but for me they came close to spoiling my 'immersion' in the world of the film, which is particularly irritating as it was meant to have the opposite effect! All in all, I give this film a prawn-tastic three out of five."

","20 Years ago, an enormous alien spacecraft drifted to rest over the South African city of Johannesburg. Within are discovered a race of insectoid aliens derogatorily known as 'Prawns'. They are in a seemingly broken vessel that has come to rest on Earth, whilst having lost their leadership. Due to a hive-like societal structure, the worker populace are somewhat aimless and not exactly of superior intelligence. Wikus Van Der Mere (First time actor Sharlto Copley) is the hapless human tasked with evicting the aliens from their makeshift shanty town of District 9 below the giant craft, in order to relocate them for the benefit of the resentful Human populace. He works for the MNU (Multi National United) who are also one of the largest arms dealers in the world, and currently in the process of trying to master the miscellaneous weapons brought by the aliens. It's not long before Wikus finds himself embroiled in a situation that will have him fighting for his life and re-assessing his priorities and beliefs.<br/><br/>District 9 is that rare thing. A science fiction movie with an allegorical message that is not preachy, and does not compromise it's science fiction elements in the process. On it's most obvious level, it is an allegory for the former apartheid situation in South Africa, but it can be read on many other levels, including but not limited to the potential in all of humanity to act vindictively or dismissively to another they feel as being inferior.<br/><br/>Wikus is presented to us as neither a particularly sympathetic nor loathsome character. He is a perfectly constructed balancing act who is a product of his environment and upbringing. We see him doing things that are (Unwittingly to him) repulsive. Yet likewise, he will make an effort when he sees action being taken that goes against his innate morality. Wikus is without a doubt the greatest strength of District 9. Watching his character grow and change with the story, is the element that keeps us riveted to the screen. Wikus can be humorously inept at times, right through occasionally amoral, flawed, yet ultimately sympathetic, courageous and touching.<br/><br/>The story has been used many times in the past (e.g. Alien Nation). Where District 9 succeeds as something new, is by making its alien species less immediately sympathetic. We are not presented with an easy side to take. The aliens are sometimes stupid and often repugnant in their behaviour, making it all too simple to feel sympathy with the humans who detest them. This is yet another strength of District 9, avoiding the simple and often over-used contrast of 'Good aliens, bad humans' though perhaps as the film continues this is weakened a little with somewhat stereotyped villains. <br/><br/>On a more basic cinematic level, the film is again a careful balancing act. We have all seen the hand-held 'documentary' style of film-making (Blair Witch, Cloverfield). Where District 9 succeeds is in using such techniques for much of its beginning, yet gradually segueing more and more into traditional 3rd person style. As such we do not get tired of the technique, as we can do with the other examples, and because much of that footage in District 9 is shown as either news or security camera feeds, it does not have the nausea-inducing tendencies of the above.<br/><br/>One of the most jaw dropping visual aspects of District 9, are its special effects. Amazingly, almost all of the alien creatures were CGI. On the whole, District 9's digital effects are flawless and stunningly photo-real, created using a combination of cutting edge effects from WETA digital (Owned by Peter Jackson and created initially for the Lord of the Rings films) and creature designs that do not require fur or a great deal of moving flesh. This means that even with the film's limited budget, they have been able to use the most positive aspects of the technology without too many of its flaws.<br/><br/>The action in District 9 is also brutal and tough. This isn't your average glamorised blockbuster with wire-stunt kung fu experts doing the impossible with nary a bruise or scratch. Bodies are ripped apart, exploded, shot, electrified and generally dismembered in a variety of ways. When the film kicks into its action scenes, they are pulse- poundingly raw and visceral.<br/><br/>District 9 is director Neill Blomkamp's first feature film. Originally recommended by Peter Jackson to direct the feature adaptation of the computer game 'Halo', but when the deal fell through, Jackson reportedly gave Blomkamp thirty million to make a film of his choice. Blomkamp then went on to make the full length version of his short film 'Alive in Joburg'. In my view, we are lucky that events unfolded in this way, because I am much happier to see an original piece of work, than yet another miscellaneous video game adaptation.<br/><br/>This is an adult film that has not been watered down to stay safe for the kids. The characters swear repeatedly, and everyone has a tough time of it. It is by no means an 'easy' film to watch, but it will leave a lasting impression and keep you thinking. Is it perfect? No, there are some things that happen too easily for the sake of plot convenience, occasionally unanswered questions that are more frustrating than mysterious, and the story ideas are often far from original. Yet on the whole this is a genuinely impressive, often gruelling and hard-hitting film. I also have it on good authority that the accents and cultural references are dead on the nose. It is neither a video game or comic adaptation, or a remake of an older film. As such it is a real treat amongst all of the other genre offerings of recent years. Just be warned, if you eat out and see a prawn dish, you may find yourself inadvertently uttering an appropriate expletive often used in the film. Trust me, you'll see what I mean..."

","I agree, by far one of the years best films. Put sci-fi movies on the map. I feel there will be a lot more serious sci-fis to come, but District 9 was by far the best that I have seen. And the acting was surprisingly very good and the lead role kept you engaged in the movie, not to mention amazing effects. Its earned its place as one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>The ending was very good, no need for a sequel if you ask me, that would probably take away from the movie itself.

"StupidHumanSuit","10","0","3","28 September 2009"," ""Here she is, my angel.""
","District 9 is perfect. There is absolutely no doubt about this statement. Director Neill Blomkamp creates the single best science fiction film since Star Wars, but is truly on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is depressing, truthful, brutal, painful, hopeful and the very definition of cathartic. Yet, there is humor that will make you laugh out loud, moments before you cry. The film, as every truly great sci-fi film does, has a true-life undertone, and you could see it very clearly and subtly. This film creates such a connection, from the people to the Prawns. It is the ultimate struggle in life: keeping your humanity. The struggle of life and death is the ultimate string that ties this film together. It transcends from an immensely well-made, well executed 30$M indie sci-fi action film to a glorious epic picture that will have you crying and struggling with each character every scene.<br/><br/>These are some of the truest words I have ever said: Sharlto Copley deserves the best actor Oscar for the 2009 Academy Awards. His portrayal of Wikus Van De Merwe is sublime to say the least. And making this even more amazing, this is actually his first real acting role, aside from his 10 seconds on the short this was developed from, ""Alive In Joburg"". He doesn't make him out to be absolutely innocent or just a regular action hero. He is human. And that is how you see him. He is a truly normal man with as many flaws as us, put through a hell-on-Earth situation, doing noble things. He doesn't just go from quiet, funny, normal guy to a life-saving defender in a matter of seconds. You see him develop from this kind, considerate, compassionate, simple man with a modest life turn into a noble, caring and vulnerably tough protagonist. He still keeps his modest character and blends it with his noble human nature. You empathize and relate to Wikus and Christopher Johnson and hope for them. This film shows the primal nature of the human essence; we can all die for each other or kill each other. In the end, Wikus gives his human life to Christopher to save himself, his son and his race. For the first time in years, after all of the films about how humanity is a bad thing and how all of us are violent in nature, this film makes us remember that we are also caring, forgiving and heartfelt creatures. It proves that humanity is hopeful."
"johnmax71","10","0","2","27 September 2009"," Great Movie
","Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.<br/><br/>Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.<br/><br/>There is, thankfully not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it's all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place."

For those who haven't seen it, over a million aliens have ""crashed landed"" on earth in South Africa and are being ""isolated"" in an area known as District 9.

"james_norman1981","Null","0","1","24 September 2009"," It's amazing what $30 million will get you these days
","Transformers 2, The Dark Knight and Avatar. Just three action films from 2009 yet each with budgets believed to be in excess of $200 million dollars.<br/><br/>It's got to be pretty frustrating to the producers of those movies, if not their directors, that Neill Blomkamp has managed to create something that is, visually at least, every bit the CGI equal of those blockbusters (I admit Avatar isn't out yet but could it EVER be worth ten times as much as Distric 9?). Not only that but Blomkamp manages it with his first feature length film. It's an extraordinary achievement and one that shows that Peter Jackson, the producer and father figure to this experiment, is as good a pick of directorial talent as he is of actors.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the fact that Jackson went from The Frighteners and Beautiful Creatures to Lord of the Rings that gave him the belief that Blomkamp was similarly talented and could handle the enormous transition he faced? Regardless, Jackson gave his protégé the keys to the sweetshop, not once but twice: signing Blomkamp to create the video game adaptation of Halo, which fell through through no fault of the director, after which Jackson gave his new friend $30 million and told him to make whatever he wanted! And hasn't the boy done good? It leaves me thinking that his Halo would've been the first ever computer game adaptation worth seeing. But I digress.<br/><br/>What is undoubted is the fact that Blomkamp has incredible vision as well as a brilliant realisation of the strengths and weaknesses of CGI. His entire film is saturated with effects shots - every single one of the aliens is computer generated, but there is hardly a moment when you're left thinking how fake it all looks, which is so unlike most modern action blockbusters, particularly Wolverine, shot earlier this summer for a vastly bigger budget yet with numerous eye jarring moments of hideously obvious CG. In District 9 the other worldly stuff is done by computer, everything else is real, especially the slums. That natural look underpins the story of the film, forcing us to notice how a movie about aliens in Joburg is actually a thinly veiled expose on the system of Apartheid in South Africa. A scene were the lead character goes into a Burger King equivalent sums this up perfectly - he marches to the empty, white only till while the numerous black people queue up.<br/><br/>Blomkamp also realises that the plot is the essential aspect of any film and his is a simple but well crafted thing. His everyman Wikus Van De Merwe is a petty bureaucrat, albeit one with a lovely wife, working for the company that is tasked with regulating the aliens that have landed, of all places, in South Africa. I believe Wikus isn't racist, or species-ist, as such, he just doesn't think of the aliens, or prawns as they look and are nicknamed, as the equal of human beings. He therefore feels no compassion for them in the slightest, a fact best demonstrated by his happy narration of a prawn 'abortion' - the burning by fire of several dozen alien eggs. He even laughs when we start to hear a popping sound. 'That's the eggs exploding' he explains with a broad smile.<br/><br/>In this he represents the typical white South African during Apartheid, or white and ethnically 'pure' German during the 1930's, or anyone else who's sat back and done nothing as extremists declaring their inherent superiority over other forms of life, including human life, rise into positions of absolute power. He doesn't necessarily condone the sub-human way the aliens are forced to live, but he would do absolutely nothing to change it, ignoring the things that he witnesses being done to the prawns and which he knows, in his heart, are being done far from where he can see. It's not a big jump to imagine the experiments he eventually discovers being done being translated to Nazi scientists performing their obscene tests on the Jews and other guests of their concentration camps.<br/><br/>This dichotomy in Wikus is crudely interrupted when he becomes exposed to an alien substance. It occurs during the serving, en mass, of 1.8 million eviction notices to the entire population of prawns, but that is not Wikus' big concern at the end of the day. No, it's his fast developing illness that worries him, especially when he begins to realise he is changing into one of the aliens! Throughout most of the film he is desperate only to be cured of what he views as an affliction. It is only in the latter stages, when he finally realises that his problem is his attitude rather than his mutating DNA, that he becomes a hero, as a pose to a villain.<br/><br/>This immense transition is handled unbelievably well by first time actor Sharlto Copley, a South African native who plays Wikus perfectly. Such a first time performance hasn't been seen since a young Edward Norton burst on the scene in Primal Fear and Copley deserves every plaudit going for his incredible job, though it's doubtful that a first timer helming a science fiction action movie starring an unknown, who is also a first timer, will win many awards come March.<br/><br/>That would be a shame and a missed opportunity. Distric 9 shows us what a good story, excellent direction, fantastic acting (from the lead at least) and a budget of just $30 million can actually get you. It is worth seeing just for that alone, Senors Bay, Cameron, Silver and Weinstein. It is also worth seeing because it's a brilliant film."

","Peter Jackson and Neill Blomkamp raise the science-fiction genre to a new level this year.<br/><br/>District 9 has nothing in common with milestones like Alien or The Thing or Dark City; but this necessarily isn't a bad thing. Blomkamp's project is rather a socio-political, ethical approach to the question ""what if?"", presented in documentary filming style, of which it lets go in the right moment: when the personal story and struggle of the protagonist against his former company (the MNU, which seeks to commercially utilize the Prawns' weaponry) takes over.<br/><br/>District 9 is presented by very fast-paced, fascinating story-telling. It aims at invoking strong emotions like sympathy, empathy, loathing and horror among the audience by showing us scenes of men who act extraordinarily inhuman. These scenes feature, as one can easily imagine, a lot of gore, which is meant to be disturbing. Further, District 9 offers excellent CGI effects that have been nicely implemented into the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, a very realistic - and thus all the more disturbing - scenario is created by Blomkamp and Jackson, peering at the questionable conditions of the real South African slums in the vicinity of Johannesburg."

Then, instead of exploring the moral and ethical implications (which could have been done either with or without the specifically mutagenic fuel) we get a version of Robocop, with guns everywhere. Sure, in this type of science fiction, there should be some fancy technology, including a bit of weapons-play, but I would have liked to have seen something more thoughtful. There is no explanation of why the entire starship has not been explored and investigated down to the smallest detail - the scientists seemed only to be interested in small-arms! And why were the occupants of this starship not involved in humanity's first look at extra-terrestrial technology? OK, there are several possible answers, but none are explored in the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall it is good - great acting from Sharlto Copley, and great SFX. Well worth the money to see it."

","This movie was not at all what I expected, and that was a good thing. Great original story, excellent acting, good action. I too liken this movie to Blade Runner or the first Terminator. I really liked not knowing a single actor in this movie, made it seem more believable. This fit my personal tastes perfectly. 9 instead of 10 because I agree with some comments that the documentary style was carried on just a little long. I didn't get motion sickness or anything, it just got a little tedious.<br/><br/>I can understand reviewers who didn't like this movie. I've had similar experiences with other movies where I thought I was being clubbed over the head with the morality of the story, but I didn't feel that way. Sure the main character was shown as very flawed as were the humans, but I didn't think it was out of proportion.<br/><br/>I really love the comment ""Not the classic many reviewers say it is"". That is really funny. Of course not everyone is going to agree on what movies are classics. But if ""many"" people are rating this movie as perfect or near perfect, its obviously going to be a classic."

","It is a great story to combine the history and recent events happened and happening in South Africa. It is more than human killing aliens.

It bravely tells how disgusting white Afrikaners were and are; the ugly truth of how township black people treat their fleeing Zimbabwe sisters and brothers. The major actor is a white Afrikaner. His play is magnificent. He deeply portrays the personalities of most Afrikaners shared: very rude, pride, very selfish, super prejudice, low moral value..."
"omerta217","8","0","1","23 September 2009"," Great movie, but not a masterpiece.
","Initially I felt this movie was great. It had a very strong sense of realism and most of the things the character did were what most people would do. There was none of that cliché stereotypical hero stuff. The CGI were well done, and the story was believable to an extent.<br/><br/>But it left me feeling like something was amiss. As I watched it a second time, I was able to pinpoint some of the problems.<br/><br/>FLAWS: The main problems of this movie were some improbable (though not impossible) parts. For example, for an alien race capable of such technology and having a civilization possibly thousands to millions of years ahead of mankind, they were extremely gullible and unintelligent. This seemed highly unlikely.<br/><br/>Secondly, the strange reactions of the antagonists around the main character. How they did illogical things in order to find out about his mutation, was not very likely. (I'm referring to the government and Nigerian gangs, of course)<br/><br/>Third, the main character was not particularly relatable. Though it was realistic in its depiction of the human psyche, a movie should always make its audience care for the protagonist. This movie made me root for the alien (Christopher) rather than the main protagonist (Wikus).<br/><br/>I won't list out the rest as I don't want to spoil it. But there are certainly many points which make you wonder ""why didn't they..."". Remember, these are government agencies and supposedly highly advanced aliens. Their actions and decisions should be infallible. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Overall, with all its illogic, it did have great graphics and sound, as well as bringing us some food for thought (which not many films are able to deliver)."
"Stampsfightclub","9","0","1","23 September 2009"," The reawakening of science fiction
","In a plan to transport aliens to a safer environment in Johannesburg, Wikus Van Der Merwe (Copley) sees what life for the aliens is really like.<br/><br/>James Cameron's return later this year with Avatar is the most anticipated release of the year as we see science fiction fantasy taken to a breath taken new level in HD 3D. Undoubtedly it will sell the tickets and be a smash and many said it would be unchallenged as sci-fi of the year. After seeing District 9, I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's production is a smart blend of the extra terrestrial with real life. It is a refreshing spark of life in the face of a film genre that has been lost somewhat since the 80s. Since the emphatic Star Wars, Blade Runner and Aliens we have seen loose gimmicks and poorly shot releases. Now the tables have turned and once more the science fiction concept of the other world has revitalized its sleeping audience.<br/><br/>We open with interviews recalling events of the transportation and discussing the motives of the government agent Van Der Merwe. This is all shot on your low quality cameras, which establish a feel of realism for the mood of the build up. We are then moved right to the centre of controversy as we see the agent going about his business, discussing with the camera his intentions. All of this has a fantastic new edge. A documentary style presentation that has I'm pretty sure never been attempted for a film with aliens. It is a complete fish out of the water, a revitalising revelation that should happen more frequently in cinema. My words do this an injustice because unless you see District 9, you won't believe how brilliant it really is.<br/><br/>As the film moves up a notch with its intention of transporting the aliens to a safer environment the emotional core of this screenplay starts to bubble. We see the heavy-handed approach by the government demanding a signature by each individual alien as an act of cooperation and the disgusting nature of the language the way we humans are treating the non human residents. The sad conclusion is that this film is about inhumane humans. The script is so convincing at portraying the aliens as kind emotional creatures and likewise portraying humans as uncaring animals. The dramatic incident involving the central character changes the whole perception of the relationship between humans and aliens, and therein we have our core. A powerful government building break in, a gasping chase to survive and some sharp action come the end provides the ultimate knockout for the eventuality.<br/><br/>There are a few minor complexions with this picture in that the alien scripting and sounds are perhaps too other worldly. Not to forget the ultimate climax between Van Der Merwe and the main alien is sadly conventional film making.<br/><br/>Nevertheless these factors are forgotten in the grand scheme as Blomkamp will shock us all with his astonishing new adaptation of a new feel to sci-fi"

A great premise , it could have really gone somewhere, but that was sadly let down by gaping great flaws in the plot/continuity...massive gaps that needed to be explained which were not...My immediate thoughts were back to Peter Jackson's initial ventures into filming, and somehow he was trying to relive his youth with lack the believability factor, how much power he had as a producer in this venture I know not.

There is also a lot of Slum symbolics which kind of weakened the story in my opinion, but i guess its a part of South African reality.

No betrayal, love or any strong personal feelings, nothing. Just some pointless phone calls. You can't call that a masterpiece.<br/><br/>4.

","I didn't know quite what to expect from District 9, but it's a diverting film and the South African setting and characters sets it apart from Hollywood films (where a happy ending is usually guaranteed) and makes it a more unpredictable experience. The performances are very good for the genre with Wikus a great flawed hero. The SFX are also great with the CGI work much more realistic than has been the norm in recent times. The only thing that kept it off a 9/10 for me was that it did descend into a bit of a chase movie in the last half hour or so. The ending is neatly done though and a sequel can surely not be far off."

I just don't like feeling cheated, and that's how I felt after the ending.<br/><br/>Having said that, this movie does stand out from the sci-fi crowd, it's unusual, it does not have famous actors, and it does not follow typical Hollywood plot.

Yet, it is a thrilling watch, and if it wasn't for the ending, I'd give it a 9/10."
"Jimm1190","6","0","1","16 September 2009"," Surreal Story Redeemed By Interesting Qualities
","In the tradition of experimental film making which has been promoted by major studios in recent years comes this film. A sometimes incoherent but overall odd story line that follows the lives of a discriminated alien race, stranded on Earth and forced to live in slum like conditions. In the idea of ""What if this actually happened""? kind of theory the producers of the film antagonize humans especially with the MNU and the Nigerian Gangs as vulgar, selfish, capitalist pigs, and power mongers that are more focused on self-gain than peace relations.<br/><br/>Because of this kind of take on the film I notice that this film is somewhat politically motivated and biased. It is related to human rights the alien equivalent of that. The film is told through interview reels, candid camera scenes, and then some traditional performance scenes. How the film shifts makes the film even more surreal through the odd story arc. Its an interesting take on genre and very original in its own way for science fiction. Still the film is overly focused on visuals and political innuendo than trying to make an innovative science fiction movie which this film had the potential to do.<br/><br/>I still recommend this film it has an interesting quality to it that is hard to come by in other science fiction films."

One of the Worst moves I've ever made. She hated the style of filming and got super creeped/weirded/grossed out by everything.

The story was somewhat interesting-a play on the racism still present in South Africa, but it seemed to have some holes. Like how did they understand what the aliens said? Why did they have to have all these legal eviction notices for the Prawns? It was different from most Alien movies, not really in a good way.

","I gave the movie an 8/10, but my wife only thinks it was a 3. She did not like it at all, it was too gross apparently. To me that's an added touch of realism that made it worth while. I tried to explain to her also that the movie was real, that it had actually all happened here on earth during the 20th century, and much of it there in S. Africa oddly enough. Interesting choice of locations for the story.<br/><br/>Of course, the scenario didn't actually happen with aliens, but what happened was called ""Apartheid."" In Hitler's Germany we called it the Holocaust. I make the argument that all of these things really did happen between one group of humans and another, so in that light the story is completely believable. Thus, the writers didn't need to look too far or have too much imagination to come up with the idea for this story.<br/><br/>I argued with my wife for the point that this made the film better than a ""B"" movie, but she wouldn't be convinced. So, there you have it. It's interesting that she has seen Schindler's List and The Hiding Place and other film versions about the Holocaust and agrees those are both great films and great stories. Putting it in terms of an alien race and adding all the glitzy special effects (even though they were good, and probably deserving of an Oscar) just didn't make it for her.<br/><br/>It's a decent movie, and I did notice the change over in mid film from pure documentary style to an action film, where it became essential to have extended knowledge of the main character and his soon to be allies. It's a memorable film, one that took a bit of an unexpected turn, I liked that aspect of the movie. Still, I find it hard to believe that an alien race that was so advanced could have found themselves ""out of gas"" and stranded on a place like earth.

"tfun28","4","0","4","7 September 2009"," Moralistic, boring story without any irony!
","I gave that film only four points for two reasons: First it is totally overrated. And i am wondering: if it comes down to recently released, successful movies, the rating is often too good, whereas classic, older movies are rated adequately.<br/><br/>So why is the film bad? It's easy to understand, as it has the typical problem, many action films have: it lacks originality. And therefore: the action parts are of no interest at all, for the viewer. They are just the bitter pill, the viewer has to swallow, if he wants to see the unsurprising ending of the film.<br/><br/>The clichés - which unfortunately undergo no variations - are the following: The main character: a naive, stupid man becomes the world saving hero.<br/><br/>The story line: the hero is in need of a substance, which will save his health, and return him to his beloved, family home (his wife is only sobbing and crying at home - what a character !!!). And: he befriends himself with an alien, who is - after all - not a bad creature. So: we've got an moral issue here: not only human have human rights! Then the antagonists: a bad weapon corporation, which is only interested in profit (seen thousands of times!), a racist military squad, which hunts the protagonist throughout 45 minutes of the movie (this last bit appallingly boring; the main dialogue line: f* and the toting of a machine gun), and a group of colored people, who engage in voodoo (!) and criminal business and which is also after the protagonist. (This part is from an ethical point of view especially bad, as it is - in my opinion - an obviously racist stereotype, which lacks even the slightest bit of irony).<br/><br/>So while the first third of the film is still alright - it is a comedy or satire, reminding a bit on Starship Troopers - it becomes towards the end sickeningly moralistic. The problem with that is from my point of view: the film leaves nothing to the viewer; rather the parts between good and bad are traditionally divided, and the viewer can reassure himself after the movie, that there are some bad guys (corporations, criminals, racist) and some good guys (the everyday guy, the John Doe or whatever you wanna call him), and that he himself - as a viewer - surely would choose the good side."

","This is a superior sci-fi movie, which comes across as a documentary feature, with 'talking heads' interviews, and some hand-held video taping. However, some of the point of view shots make any notion that some scenes were actually part of the documentary ridiculous.<br/><br/>Pointedly set in South Africa, the 'documentary' tells of a massive alien 'mother ship' hovering over the capital of South Africa, Johannesburg. This movie could easily have been set during the 1960s in the US, as far as political commentary goes. However, ""apartheid"" ended more recently in South Africa than it did in the US. Anyway, we get to see the aliens which live in slums in Johannesburg, as well as their technology, and the talking heads speculate about what is going on why a certain corporation from their country is involved with the aliens. It's this kind of speculation which lifts this above the ""B movie"" realm.<br/><br/>The central character in this 'documentary' is Wikus Van De Merwe (played by Sharlto Copley). Wikus looks and acts like a South African version of Murray Hewitt (played by Rhys Darby) in the TV sit-com ""The flight of the conchords"". So, to that extent, this movie does have some light-relief as well as some poignant drama. Wikus is a bureaucrat charged with relocating the unwelcome aliens, so he has direct contact with the funny odd looking aliens from space.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie.
