","Few critics, few including Rediff ones whom I look for some good writing, have rated low to BMB. The reason they give is that movie lacks coherence and clarity. Really? I think they should only rate Hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what Hindi cinema is. Farhan has done an awesome job, and if I say awesome then it is not for his physique and dialogue delivery but for the transformation, he has gone to become Milkha Singh. We as an audience witness the physical stress and labor that an athlete as likes of Milkha Singh undergo to become a 'flying Sikh'. Hindi cinema celebrates the life of this living legend with songs and drama and music. Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra has done a decent job, still; I fell he could have done a lot better especially in the scenes of Milkha's childhood memories. His attempt of giving the movie an epic convention seriously affected the narrative portion. However, all this can be sided by the grandeur of Farhan's effort. I would like to mention a statement of one of the rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining the effect of this movie: ""note that 400mtrs is a very difficult race to run. it is at the border of quick races and long jogs. after partition India did not have either the experience nor the infra to produce runners for 400mtrs. So Milkha was a true champion in every sense. If critics pull films like these down for abstract reasonsÂ…we will forever have 20 goons flying in the air with one punch from one man. Grow up critics.""<br/><br/>So true."
"sankalpgarg17","10","66","80","12 July 2013"," ""Bollywood needs a better class of directors, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is gonna give you that""
","I know this film is criticized for being overlong, but there is not a moment where you will get bored. Based on the real life story of an awesome athlete ""The Flying Sikh"" Milkha Singh, the story solely revolves around the hardships and horrors of his life. The whole film in a sense, is perfect.<br/><br/>Director: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Now, i don't think i have to tell you about his past achievements. After delivering one of the greatest blockbuster of bollywood ""Rang De Basanti"", Mehra is back with a bang!!!!! Direction is superb with almost no loopholes left to be noticed.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter: Prasoon Joshi This National Awardee (Taare Zameen Par) needs no introduction. Script of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has been beautifully transcribed and and more beautifully presented on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Actor: Farhan Akhtar yes, this is solely a Farhan Akhtar movie. This multi talented person has put his heart and sole in the movie. His talent can only be judged by his dedication. Farhan Akhtar's talent has been put to justice. And Pavan Malhotra's role as Coach Gurudev Singh also fits.<br/><br/>All in all, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a must watch for all movie lovers, sports lovers and Indian History lovers!!!!!"
"vaishvik93","10","81","101","12 July 2013"," Farhan Akhtar, an epitome of extreme dedication towards the character
","I would certainly be disappointed if this movie doesn't get nominated for the best foreign language film in the academy awards. Farhan Akhtar is like the epitome of dedication towards Milkha Singh's character. He was running like a pro. Cinematography was just amazing. Many shots were just breathtaking. Direction was just perfect and the casting was sensibly done. Parallel storytelling kept the movie balanced between Milkha Singh's life and his sports career. The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did their job as always. <br/><br/>But one of all, Farhan Akhtar rocked. He has always given his best in every field he has ever stepped in to. Respect for Farhan Akhtar, respect for Milkha Singh, the true hero."
"graiker01","9","45","56","12 July 2013"," A commendable film on Milkha Singh's inspiring tale!
","The sheer joy of watching someones hard-work come to life on the screen is inspiring indeed. To portray Milkha Singh's struggle and achievements and his zeal to succeed at the world stage, required an equally earnest and dedicated effort by the filmmakers. This effort is reflected in Bhag Milkha Bhag, and is what makes the film commendable.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar's tough physical training for this role pays great dividends on screen. The races look pretty convincing because of Farhan's effort and soon you find yourself cheering for Milkha, if not loudly in the movie-hall then at-least in your head.<br/><br/>The non-linear narrative of the film keeps the movie engrossing, so although you know the basic outline of the story, you can't really guess what would happen next. The story is narrated by Milkha's coach Gurudev Singh played brilliantly Pavan Malhotra by who first recognizes the Milkha Singh's talent.<br/><br/>The women in Milkha Singh's life play a very important role, be it his elder sister (played by Divya Dutta)who single handedly brings Milkha up, or the love of his life (Sonam Kapoor) who is the reason why he changes his unruly ways. Although one must add, that the part where Milkha goes on a romp after a party with Stella(Rebecca Brooks) during the 1956 Melbourne Games does look a bit forced.<br/><br/>Some people may have qualms with the dance sequences but personally they were quite enjoyable and didn't jar the narrative. Keep an eye out for the song with Sonam Kapoor who plays Milkha Singh's love interest in the film. The shot with them both on top of a bridge with green, swiftly flowing water below was captured beautifully.<br/><br/>The director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has a signature style which is apparent like from his previous films- Rang De Basanti and Delhi-6. He can merge music and visuals to great effect. Although in some scenes a little bit of restraint in the stylistic details and drama could have certainly helped.<br/><br/>To emerge as a world leading athlete from India just after independence, when I suppose sports facilities weren't great, with the scars of the partition deep in his mind is some achievement. We salute you Milkha Singh! One must commend the efforts of the filmmakers to bring the story to us."

","BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic directed by Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra, starring Farhan Akthar and Sonam Kapoor.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the life story of Milkha Singh.<br/><br/>Everyone who is associated with this film has done a GREAT job. The directors... the writers... the actors... EVERYONE. When the first look of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag came, we were shocked how similar Farhan Akthar looked like Milkha Singh, and his acting has showed us that not only is he a GREAT actor, but he can mostly do any role by now. His portrayal of Milkha Singh was outstanding.<br/><br/>The film starts off a BIT slow, but you manage to keep with its pace. Inspite of the film being 3h10m, you never feel bored; instead, you find yourself stuck in the world of Milkhaji- poverty, love and speed.<br/><br/>The replay value of this film is very high. Its very entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting, as said above, is very good. Other than Farhan Akthar delivering an award-winning performance, every other actor did a great job. Sonam Kapoor didn't have much to do in the screenplay, but she did it quite well.<br/><br/>The film does depend on each person's likes and tastes. A person who enjoys watching the so-called 'masala' flicks, may not enjoy this film due to its different type of story compared to other films. Also, people who can't sit in cinemas for a VERY long time may get annoyed at the fact that its a 3h10m film.<br/><br/>But Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an award-winning film. It shows us the life of Milkha Singh through his very own eyes and deserves a standing ovation for its performances, writing and direction. Truly Inspiring...<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!- 10/10"
"abhishas_bhan-64-896825","10","12","13","16 July 2013"," Farhan Akhter deserves a National award for this!!!
","Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's best work till date also. YOU DARE TO MISS THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN RISK !!!"

","If Milkha Singh is a ""Hero"" this movie is Heroic! This Biopic have been excellently crafted by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, nicely scripted by Prasoon Joshi, storytelling is nice and sequence of events have been placed aptly. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you feel empathetic for Milkha, his partition affected fellows and communities. Right from the word 'go' till finish this flick will keep you glued to your seats. <br/><br/>Brilliantly performed by Farhan Akhtar along with other co-stars, with a special mention for Pavan Malhotra (Gurudev Singh, Milkha's initial trainer & coach). Full marks to Farhan for his efforts, acting, dedication for the role, for getting completely into the skin of Milkha Singh and for being an authentic Milkha! To me, it would be no surprise if he fetches a National Award for this role! <br/><br/>Milkha Singh runs against turbulent times of his life and establishes world records; conquers not just medals for India, but Indian hearts too! A big salute and cheers for this national hero!<br/><br/>This is a true tribute to this Indian, Flying Sikh! <br/><br/>And, if you want to be inspired, motivated and get a going in your personal life then go for it!"
"saytosandeep","8","44","57","12 July 2013"," MY REVIEW: Run Farhan Run!!
","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Raj's performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkha's achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru looks like a missed stroke. At the end, you can safely say, you had a great time running with Farhan Akhtar for more than 3 hours. Run to your nearest theater now to watch this powerful biopic."

","In less than ten minutes into the film, you get goosebumps all over your body. You get into high-spirits and then the story of The Flying Sikh begins...<br/><br/>It talks more about perseverance and how man can excel even in the worst conditions than the actual atheltic history. Milkha Singh, wonderfully portrayed by the talented Farhan Akhtar is one character that induces inspiration. Akhtar now has totally proved himself as a successful actor. His demeanor is appreciable and the film does showcase his hard-work. Supporting cast is very good as well. But, the actresses were sidelined which is very apt for a bio-film.<br/><br/>Most of the story is told in flashbacks and there is where the screenplay works. It grabs your attention. The childhood story MAY bore you a little, but every other biopic has to be honest. Much like last year's Paan Singh Tomar, BMB does have lots of surprises in store. The relation of every detail is astronomical and very well adapted. Fresh writing, inventive editing & below-average SFX/CGI makes me wanna give it a humble 8.0/10.<br/><br/>The songs & score are energetic which do cause an urge that we run with the athletes on-screen. That is the power of Rakeysh O Mehra and his crew. I was blown away by Akhtar's bod and his expressions. Humor touches the script at times, as well.<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining biography which is well-written and well- executed. Only, the running time of 190 minutes COULD'VE... could've been shortened. Otherwise, everybody rise for this cinema of massive potential.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: A very good entertainer with mentoring prowess. It feels good that the team has brought an epitome into reel. Kudos!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES<br/><br/>Profanity: No | Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence/Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Smoking/Drugs: No"
"shaankhan-u","8","36","49","12 July 2013"," Milkha bann gaya India - A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT!!
","I watched a Paid-Preview of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag last night and I was star-strucked by its fame watching the house-full crowd in the theater (as if it is the first day of the release). When I first watched its teaser in October last year and first trailer in January..it had me going since then, and now I am happy that my expectation was worth it.<br/><br/>BRIEF STORY & REVIEW SKETCH. <br/><br/>The film is about Milkha Singh and introspects his being through the eyes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. There are no twists or turns in the movie but its just a tale told on a clean slate. Film starts with a defeat in Olympics, carried on when Milkha refuses to visit Pakistan (has his valid reasons for doing so) but Pt. Nehru sends Milkha's latter and former coach to Chandigarh so that they can convince him for the tour. During the train-journey, Pavan Malhotra (former coach) reveals the story of Milkha Singh and his reason to not visit Pakistan to the other two gentlemen which unleashes an assiduous, interesting and penultimate story about the legend. This Sikh has been running his whole life, starting his first race for a glass of milk to the Olympics..and never ending. It reminds me of the great metaphor ' The race of Life'. Milkha Singh ran to save his life, to eat, to dream, for love, for country, for passion and to overcome his own personal fears, ''and what a run it was!''. BMB traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's partition ; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds the purpose of life when he falls for Beeru (Sonam). Joins the Indian Army and since then his passion, eagerness and situations along with the efforts (negative & positive both) made by different people led him to become an athlete, a runner who remained uncased even by his own daemons. He keeps on breaking records but witnesses a heartbreaking defeat in Rome Olympics (1960) but thats not it, he takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past which was the cause of Olympic defeat and emerges out to be a clear winner.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>ROPM delivers yet again a tale in his own style (fond of changing tones in his films), where the length is bit of a disappointment otherwise the content heals the flaw with a superb execution and sticky pace, that tops with Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance (the actor gave his blood n sweat into the character) and he emerges out to be the soul of the movie physically and mentally. The story by Prasoon Joshi is admirable and the track 'Zinda' is well written by him, beautifully composed by Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy and descriptively choreographed by Shaimak Davar. The background score by the trio adds on to the whole movie. The performances from the other cast is noticeable where Divya Dutta deserves a special mention (Hats off to the lady for creating a great impact in spite of having such a small role) The film truly deserves to be one of the best that Bollywood has offered this year so far and I hope to see some more in-depth biopics like this in coming future.<br/><br/>I'd rate this dig-till-hell marvel biopic as 8/10."

"siddharthu2003","10","8","10","19 July 2013"," Review of negative reviews
","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a great movie according to me. Unfortunately, it has received reviews from both extremes. The people who have disliked the movie because of its pace are very impatient souls. The movie's depth is only understood when the mind is tuned to the perfectly timed pace of events of the movie. I read a review that said 'for a fast runner movie, it is extremely slow paced'. There is no damn connection between between a life story of a runner and the pace of the movie. I think such reviewers are so used to reviewing commercial non-sensical masala films that they have forgotten what real movies are like.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a movie that is crafted for excellence by the very second."

"shafiq-siddiqui81","9","6","7","19 July 2013"," Bhaag Milkha Bhaag â€“ A Flying Tale of A Flying Sikh
","A great movie experience is a combination of many things. It includes a convincing plot, high voltage drama, light moments that stay with viewers even when they leave the theatre, good music, inspirational elements and a few emotional scenes. ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is among those movies which offer all the above mentioned ingredients at par. For those who keep a track of innovative, interesting and path breaking Indian Cinema the name of Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra is the symbol of excellence. Whenever he unfolded his sleeves, movies like ""Aks"", ""Rang de Basanti"" and ""Delhi-6"" were witnessed by cine-goers. All these movies are distinctive in one way or the other. BMB is nothing different than them. It is a master stroke â€“ without a doubt. <br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar secretes immense talent but no one has, up till Rakeysh Om Prakash, utilized that talent. Farhan's directorial ventures ""Dil Chahta Hai"" and ""Lakshya"" made people realize his credibility as one of the finest directors. As an actor, BMB is his landmark. The way he has carried out his role and portrayed his emotions definitely demand standing ovation.<br/><br/>BMB is based on the journey of great Indian athlete Milkha Singh (also known as Flying Sikh). It is a movie about a boy whose entire family excluding his elder sister was murdered in the riots of Indo-Pak partition and he became a national and international rage back in 1960's. It is also about the bond between a brother and sister â€“ executed with exceptional detailing. Moreover, the movie is about a blooming romance, some promises with loved ones, emotional fits, flying high yet not leaving the ground by any means and a lot more. In short it's about the life of Milkha Singh and what he went through.<br/><br/>Performance wise, Farhan Akhtar deserves to be nominated for this movie especially by critics. He is a revelation in BMB. He tackles the most difficult parts with complete ease and effortlessness. His transitions can be easily witnessed and felt by the audience from first scene to the last. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's sister is vibrant, emotional, lovable and above all highly expressive. In 2 of the scenes particularly, she involved the audience to a level by her performance that no one could resist moistening their eyes. This is a performance she will always be reminded of. Sonam Kapoor (as Biro), Meesha Shafi (as Perizaad) and Rebecca Breeds (as Stella) had limited roles but they all performed well in their respective characters. <br/><br/>Pavan Malhotra (as Milkha Singh's senior) is inspirational and at his peak. This actor is unfortunately most underrated, he needs to be casted in more movies to show-case his vast talent. Yograj Singh as (Milkha Singh's coach) is just perfect. Dalip Tahil is strictly passable and ditto for Dev Gill (Abdul Khaliq). Art Malik (as Milkha Singh's father) and Jabtej Singh (as young Milkha Singh) are credible and treat to watch.<br/><br/>Music of this movie is amazing. Arif Lohar's ""Bhaag Milkha"", Sukhwinder Singh's ""Slow Motion Angrezza"", Suhas Sawant's ""Zinda"" and Divya Kumar's ""Maston Ka Jhund"" are totally different from one another yet are really awesome tracks in all respects. Shankar-Ehsan-Loy's music is simply amazing for this venture.<br/><br/>Some sequences to lookout for â€“ performance wise:<br/><br/>When Farhan asks from where can he buy the Indian Team's blazer!<br/><br/>When Divya Dutta meets young Milkha Singh in the camp.<br/><br/>When Farhan insists Divya to wear his blazer â€“ the scene would definitely bring tears to many viewers' eyes<br/><br/>When Farhan slaps himself repeatedly in the washroom<br/><br/>and a lot moreÂ…<br/><br/>On the basis of performance, direction, execution and story-telling I would easily rate this movie 9/10. It's a must watch for those who celebrates quality and inspirational cinema. A must watch!"

So much respect for Sardar Milkha Singh ji for all his hard work and for all those people who endured what they endured during the partition of India and Pakistan 1947. Milkha Singh..Nobody could have played this role better than Farhan Akhtar...an absolute legend. His work in the movie is absolutely Mind blowing.

","As I lifted my aching bums from the seat after watching this film the uppermost thought in my mind was a silent thank you to the guardian angels of cinema.After all if this is how we approach biopics I am so happy that Gandhi was made by a foreigner 30 years ago.If Bollywood had a shot at it, they would have made the Mahatma do garba and dandiya with Kasturba and his brave experiments with celibacy would have turned to sleaze.There would have been Zulu dancers during his South Africa phase, soulful ghazals when he visits Amritsar in the aftermath of Jalianwala Baag massacre and sufi songs when Hindu Muslim riots break out.There would also have been some Englishman raping a Indian girl and a sexy mujra in the court of a debauched Maharaja.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to tell the story of India's greatest athlete in the only language that Bollywood understands â€“ the musical.Indeed a sporty musical can be done very well as Lagaan demonstrated but this film simply does not have the material to carry off a handful of songs.It all begins at the Rome Olympics in 1960 where Milkha Singh comes fourth in a photo-finish despite being the world record holder and a favorite to win the race.The reason for his poor showing is a backward glance which according to the film is the massacre of his family during the partition coming back to haunt him.Nothing is further from the truth. Milkha Singh lost because he made a strategic blunder in running too fast during the first 250 meters and tried to slow down which cost him the race.That and his being in lane 5 which creates a blind spot and a disadvantage for a sprinter.So much for a biopic!<br/><br/>The film ends with a cricket match final.Now how can that be since this film is about athletics? I am lying of course, the director wisely reduces his race in Pakistan to a India Pakistan war as it happens in every Indo-Pak cricket match and ends the film on a jingoistic note! And yes we take a full three hours to reach this convoluted climax.<br/><br/>The story of Milkha Singh is a great story, his lost childhood, his parents murder during the partition, his rise to running glory, his infamous loss at the Rome Olympics which led to him hitting the bottle, his win in Pakistan and him turning down the Arjuna Award.But Mr Mehra finds it more important to dwell on his romance while growing up and his one night stand with a hot Australian girl during the Melbourne Olympics.A chiseled Farhan doing push ups at the beach with a buxum bikini clad blond lying on his back should be paisa wasool!<br/><br/>To the films credit the races are filmed with great finesse, the training sequences are epic, Farhan Akthar has a body to die for or to kill for and some of the incidents of his early life are very engrossing. Undoubtedly Farhan as Milkha is a casting coup and the effort he puts into becoming Milkha Singh translates into a superlative performance.The big budget is up on the screen, the attention to period detail is exquisite and Binod Pradhan's camera-work top notch. Pawan Malhotra is downright brilliant as his coach.There is this shot when Milkha Singh get taken over by the coach of the national team and Pawan Malhotra looks at him with an expression that is a mixture of pride and sadness, he is loosing his most talented protÃ©gÃ©e and is happy for him.That shot alone redeems this film.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhag is a stellar example of a wasted opportunity, this could have been a good film if 70 minutes had been chopped and it could have been a great film if it had focused on Milkha Singh the man and athlete and not on Farhan Akhtar the alpha male with the body of a Greek God.Even after three hours of watching this film we are none the wiser about the profession of running or what it must have been like to be Milkha Singh in the first decade of India's independence or what the legacy of this great athlete is.<br/><br/>Bhaag Audience Bhaag!"
"deepchatterjee2007","9","5","6","21 July 2013"," The True Story of The Flying Sikh"" which became A Masterpiece of Indian Cinema
","Bhag Milkha Bhag, the original story of ""The Flying Sikh"", Milkha Singh is inspiring, fascinating, gripping, emotional, personal yet universal. The way Farhan Akhtar played the character is outstanding. But, not only Farhan Akhtar, but also Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (Director), Prasoon Joshi (Script-writer and Lyricist) and everybody has done a great job. The way, it pictured every detail of The Legend's Life is unprecedented. And each important episode has given birth to a historical subplot. From featuring India-Pakistan partition to capturing the erase of the political borders, it is not mere a biopic of an Indian Athlete, who wins medals for India, but it became an epic and witnessed a turmoiled time-span through the eyes of Milkha Singh aesthetically and sensitively. The best part of the storyline is it showed beautifully that Milkha Singh never runs for medals. Instead, he runs for something else, something more personal, something beyond the competition titles. Sometimes he runs for a mug of milk, sometimes for the Indian Blazer, sometimes to forget his failure and overcome his weaknesses, sometimes to overcome his traumatized childhood. It showed how a sportsman can become an icon of a nation and how a legendary sportsman fights and wins his inner-battle simultaneously. It shows, how a Legend uses his nightmares, haunted memories, troubled grown-up times, failures, wounds and scars to make him more strong, more hard-working, more determined, more confident, more focused, more disciplined and more patriotic. It also showed that greatness is another name of politeness, humbleness, modesty and giving proper respect to all those seniors and gurus, who helped the man to become what he is today. The film interpreted Milkha Singh's life and achievements such a way, that it proved again the famous universal truth, ""It doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you go"".

"m-padmakarm","9","12","19","12 July 2013"," A biopic gets the Bollywood treatment in ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"", which dramatizes the life of record-breaking Indian sprinter Milkha Singh, played by the talented Farhan Akhtar.
","A handful of films sprint that extra mile beyond providing meager entertainment to its spectators. BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is one such cinematic experience. However, director Mehra and writer Prasoon Joshi encompass pertinent episodes/chapters from the icon's life and create a film that makes you salute the sports-person, besides evoking the spirit of nationalism in the spectator. On the whole, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is sure to win accolades, admiration, respect and esteem, besides emerging as a champ. In Bollywood movies, there's often an emphasis on more than the story, and filmmakers develop a keen sense for atmospherics. Along with some splendid music, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra takes care with his shots, zooming in and using slow-motion to make a body traveling through a finish line, for example, look like art."
"akshay_sup","10","4","5","23 July 2013"," Can be watched again and again and again and will inspire every time
","The movie might be over 3 hours long but there is never a dull moment. The first half of the movie starts on a light note but you can feel the simmered excitement lying beneath. Picks up pace after the intermission. It shows the transformation of Milkha Singh the underdog to Milkha Singh the champion. The background music fits superbly with the mood of the film. Can only say I was thoroughly spell-bounded. This movie is going to give running in India a boost. Hope more such movies are made in India which have some content, a emotional connect and give some life lessons but at the end you leave the hall on a high. Gem of a movie in a season of crappy mindless comedies."
"vickysri1990","9","4","5","18 July 2013"," Strong story and motivational movie...
","The movie starts with the Rome olympics. The movie switches between present and his childhood age for better continuation of story. Prakash Raj has done a good job though the time he appears in the screen is less he made his role get stitched to the audience's mind. Punjabi slang of Farhan is good. Director has tried to narrate the complete story of Milka singh in brief way. The scenes in the Indo-Pak games and Asian Championship deserves standing ovation. Cinematography is good. Sonam Kapoor has done pretty well. Behind the success of every man there might be a desire or a determination to prove a point. The way Milka Singh overcomes his hurdles in a positive way is motivational. Casting was done the best way. No unwanted roles . And all of them did their best of their roles.<br/><br/>Always there will be some efforts put on by Farhan Akthar in his movies. He will be try to attract audience' attention in the screen. This movie too is not exception to that. His hardwork in playing such a critical role gets rewarded when people give standing applause at the end. <br/><br/>On the whole it is INCARNATION OF Farhan Akhtar as ""Flying Sikh"". ."
"abhisheldarkar","10","4","5","16 July 2013"," Excellent(a bit too long)
","I don't really do this but I'd like to make an exception in this case. The movie is excellent. Great way of story telling. The story is about one man but he is not the only one who plays the role exceedingly well. After watching this I don't think any one who acted in this film was remotely bad. They all acted amazingly well and gave true justice to their own characters. <br/><br/>Only drawback that i can mention here is the time. i think the movie is a bit too long. For the first 2 and half hours i didn't really feel the need to look at my watch.<br/><br/>Overall a refreshing film with excellent story and great acting."
"dineshprakash","9","11","19","12 July 2013"," An extra ordinary journey of an ordinary person
","Director Mr. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra deserves a standing ovation for selecting and justifying this biopic of Milkha Singh. This type of movie can inspire a generation. Director was so indulged in the film that rather making a film he was just living it. His approach towards every scene is very balanced. Movie length is 3.20 hours but you won't regret for spending this much of time. Even, you enter in film with biased opinion to hate it, slowly movie opens it arms to embrace you and eventually you have to fall in love with it. Screenplay and dialogues by Prasoon Joshi is too good. He has given minute details of the characters very well. When, Milkha Singh prior coaches come to convince him to go to Pakistan, that time he was a rich person, his servant comes with the tea tray but he prefers to make tea by himself and he knows well that how much sugar his coaches prefer. This scene reflects his modesty, honesty and respect without speaking a word. There are so many scenes of this caliber. Dialogues are very balanced, sweet and inspiring. Few of them are "" Unche Udne Wale Parindon Ko Chhote Chhote Darakhton Se Dil Nahi Lagana Chahiye......Main Aapki insult nahi kar raha hun ji, Bas Khud Se Lad Raha Hun...Wahan KI hawa Mein Mere Apno Ke Khoon Mile Hue Hain, main unme sans nahi le paunga"". There was least scope for humor but it is blended with right intensity at right place. Performance wise Farhan Akhter is mesmerizing. This is not acting; it is simply transforming yourself in to the character. Simply awesome. The boy who played, young Milka Singh is amazing. He looks so innocent and fierce. Sonam Kapoor looks adorable. Divya Datta is mind blowing. She can make your eyes moist so many times, with her expression only, without speaking words. Pawan Malhotra as his first coach is very good. Prakash Raji is fine. Music by Sankar Ehsan Loy is completely blended with mood of film. It gives proper pace to film when it requires. This type of films make me proud to be part of this industry. Hats off to complete team of this film."
"siddhant-shroti","10","9","15","12 July 2013"," Epic movie
","Wooow !!! A lifetime movie. Direction: Rakyesh did justice to his work and his crew. Three phases of a person life going simultaneously was just too good. He is master in his art. He did same in RANG DE BASANTI. Cast:Each and every character who might have been on screen for a time of 30-50 second also played such an important role. No one was left unnoticed . Every one made their presence to be felt on screen . Music: Heavy background music but that will not let you lose focus from movie. Just enough to pump the adrenalin. Script: A biopic only could not be enough for audience. The script had all the magic and Prasoon Joshi nailed it. Farhan Akhtar :HE JUST BLEW EVERYONE . Totally outstanding .<br/><br/>A must watch . Few things are to be experience not just to be known.<br/><br/>MILKHA SINGH : This man is SUPER HERO from India . TRIBUTE to the legend!!!"

","When I saw the trailer, I thought this biopic is going to be another Bollywood disaster. But when the positive reviews came from friends on social media, I decided to watch it. Before this I was neither fan of Farhan, nor Sonam's but Rakeysh OP Mehra, I consider as great film-maker so I went for the night show at 10:30 PM assuming that I will be almost empty hall but surprisingly it was houseful and I got seat in 3rd row. IN first 15 minutes, I was sure these 3 hours are going to be ride with goosebumps, excitements. <br/><br/>You can feel the pain of failure and happiness of each and every success of legendary Indian athlete Jeev Milkha Singh. Farhan is in so much of depth with this role that you will love it. It is a complete 3 hours treat which gives you a lot of lessons. That it is not easy to succeed. Just a moment can ruin all your efforts."

","According to me this is the best movie of Indian Film Industry. So well directed , screen play , cinematography are up to mark. Now I have become a big fan of Farhan Akhtar, the movie shows his hard work and dedication. He is something super perfect. All actors performed with full zeal. Specially Divya Dutta she played the role of sister of Milkha Singh, she is a real actor. Salute to bath Farhan Akhtar And Divya Dutta...... Movie was something more than i can write. It will make you cry, laugh and inspired at all moments. Its shows the fine work done by these great artist. More Farhan and Sonam Kapoor took nothing for this tribute work. A big salute to them. And finally some words for the legend Milkha Singh. What he did 50 years ago is never achieved till date and will not be achieved 1000 years ago. He is a example of pure hard work and sportsmen. He has suffered a lot in his life , a normal person suffering from same situations can not even lead a normal life but what he did is only and only his sincere efforts and diligence . Really he is a ""Flying Sikh"" . He bought laurels to the country and to our society too. I am a great fan of him. May he prosper in his life. I would love to watch this movie a million times."

"lalit_paryani_84","10","6","9","14 July 2013"," Rakesh Omprakash Mehra raises the bar for Indian films
","I will start off with the technicals first and what's better than to start off with the editing. PS Bharati has the most short yet one of the most impressive resumes ever. The editing was immaculate. A huge number of ""Bollywood"" films fail to edit simple linear stories in a way that the editing doesn't interfere with storytelling. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag's on-screen presentation was non-linear and at no point do you feel lost. The editing was so precise that you know exactly which era of the story you are being told.<br/><br/>Next, the sound-mixing and score. From the moment the film begins and you hear the background score for the first time, you automatically associate it to an epic saga which will unfold before you momentarily. And it does. The original score by SLE in association with the sound mixing department just blended together so well. SLE's score could have done well on its own, but I think the mixing department gave it the treatment it deserved.<br/><br/>Lets now divert the focus to Binod Pradhan (pun totally intended). This man has proved his genius before and he held no bars this time either. He knew exactly where to point the camera and at what angles. Often times I've noticed cinematographers simply point the camera lens to an impressive landscape to showcase their prowess as a cinematographer. Selecting the landscape and the equipment is just the start, what you do with that is a different ball game altogether. Binod Pradhan captured the subtle nuances of Farhan Akhtar with such detail, that you don't even need verbal verification of what's going on in the character's mind. And ROM did an excellent job of keeping it that way rather than dumbing it down and explaining everything that was running through (yes, another pun) Milkha's mind. Binod knew exactly what element had what importance in each scene and managed to capture them with utmost sincerity.<br/><br/>As a writer, Prasoon Joshi hasn't yet marked his territory until now. With just this one script, he has proved that he is capable of joining the big guns of the Indian film industry. I hope this isn't his one-hit- wonder. One thing's for sure, I will certainly be very excited for a movie which Prasoon Joshi pens.<br/><br/>The acting. It goes without saying that Farhan Akhtar wasn't Farhan Akhtar in the movie. He was Milkha Singh. I had my reservations about Farhan Akhtar, since I thought he might bring in that element into the character that would seem a little over fetched. Like his additional humor which might only prove to distract rather than entertain. But Farhan Akhtar showed such grace and resilience by overcoming his one minor (very minor) quip and embodied the character in a way which I believe no one else could. He deserves recognition for this movie far beyond what is already provided to him. He made us care about Milkha Singh and his family. He made us care about running. He made us care about our nation. What Milkha Singh actually went through in his real life was nothing short of a living and brooding hell. He not only fought his past, but he carved out a path for himself that would allow all Indians the fortune of raising their heads high. And we lived part of it through Farhan Akhtar.<br/><br/>From Dalip Tahil to Yograj Singh to Meesha Shafi; everyone did true justice to the roles they had to portray. None of the casting seemed out of place.<br/><br/>I think that provides me the perfect segue to talk about the man behind it all - Rakesh Omprakash Mehra. It was his job to gather everything I mentioned in my review above and present it to the viewer. He went above and beyond his duty to narrate a tale of romance, heartbreak, the will to achieve, and inspire. The storytelling was a stroke of genius. A movie that could just as well be another inspiring story about a man who led India to glory was not just that. It was an insight into the character that ROM crafted. I'm saying that because not all events depicted in the film were actual. This is exactly the reason I labeled the storytelling as genius. ROM took an already inspiring life-story, added a little filmmaking magic and presented something that only a genius filmmaker could present. ROM doesn't claim the story to be an exact re-telling of Milkha Singh's life and this is what the viewer should expect when ROM mentions that it's ""inspired by a true life-story"" and not ""based on true life-story"". He knew exactly how and when to trap into the viewer's emotional side and when to play the humour card, for instance. ROM successfully managed to convert the entire cinema hall into a roller-coaster that takes you through the tragic, and yet prominently successful story of Milkha Singh, one of the nation's truest heroes. ROM not only used the tools he was provided to tell a story, but he contributed an offering that would raise the bar of what is expected of a good film in the future. I can only hope that ROM receives all the appreciation he so rightfully deserves for the masterpiece that is Bhaag Milkha Bhaag."

"achyutaghosh","9","2","2","20 July 2013"," Epic. Inspirational. Patriotic
","2013 has been a good year for Bollywood with a number of movies finding the right balance between entertainment and art, such as Special 26, Kai Po Che, and Raanjhanaa. But nothing like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has happened to Bollywood in a long time, maybe not since Chak De India. At once inspirational and believable, there is no way one cannot identify with the pain and the joy of being Milkha Singh, the poster child for India's track and field achievements.<br/><br/>One is not born a world class athlete, and the story of Milkha is no different. Who is Milkha Singh? Kudos to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for making us care for this question by humanizing the character to the utmost. He tends to blow hot (Rang De Basanti) or cold (Delhi 6, Aks) but here he is red hot.<br/><br/>When it is a Farhan Akhtar movie there has to be flashbacks and non linearity, right (Dil Chahata Hai, Rock On, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara)? The story begins with defeat at Rome Olympics as Milkha repeatedly looks back, and immediately we jump into the reasons for the same in Multan, around partition, as young Milkha, played with exuberance by Japtej Singh is on the run for his life from his parents' killers. Scarred in mind he is brought up by his sister, (a now habitually great Divya Dutt) and straightened from his devious past by the love of his life Sonam Kapoor, and mentored by supportive coaches, Milkha has an arduous path to become the flying Sikh. He might have taken to running just for the extra rations, but his talent, dedication, hard work, and discipline ensures his legacy. <br/><br/>This is an out and out Farhan Akhtar movie- he is the heart and soul of it, he is there in every frame. This is a career defining role for him, how much has he grown as a method actor. The amount of effort he has taken to get into the character of Milkha is phenomenal. Right from the look and physique, to the mannerisms and the dressing sense- he is an absolute delight. When he does the bhangra, i bet there are few Sardars who can do it better. The supporting cast comprising of Pavan Malhotra, Dalip Tahil, KK Raina, and Prakash Raj is spot on. The script by Prasoon Joshi has beautifully woven blood, sweat, tears and true grit which makes it such a motivational tale. The music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is spot on, while the cinematography by Binod Pradhan is excellent.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert famously said- ""No good movie is too long and no bad movie short enough"". <br/><br/>At 3 hrs Bhaag Milkha Bhaag could have been 20 minutes shorter and still had the same impact, but the extra duration in a way just prolongs the involvement. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a stupendous achievement overall. It is a movie and there is over dramatization, but there is a tremendous amount of heart that has gone into it, and hence the indelible impact it leaves- 9/10"
"maneckk-414-209658","9","2","2","19 July 2013"," Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Â… there is no Finish Line!!!
","The most awaited movie of the year, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the story of one of the greatest athlete India has ever had. A story of achievement & disappointment, milestones & nightmares, passion & apathy. Most importantly a story of grit & determination and the struggle to achieve success besides all odds. To describe or write about a movie of this stature one cannot find enough words to express oneself. But, I will definitely try and summarize it from the heart on the different levels the movie worked for me.<br/><br/>I came out pretty impressed with the way Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra has managed to depict the life of ""Flying Sikh"" in a movie slightly over 3 hours and NO, I did not get bored at any time in the movie. The script demanded the detail and though some sequences definitely match upto speed of the man on whom the movie is made, the rest of the film jogs along just fine. The race sequences have been shot very well and the climax is enduring and keeps you on the edge though most of us already knew the outcome.<br/><br/>A true account of the life of Milkha Singh, the movie starts with him loosing the legendary 1960 Rome Olympic race and flashes back to his life tracing the journey from his child hood (born in the undivided India now Pakistan) to the great athlete he ultimately becomes making India proud. The various times in his life are brilliantly interwoven into the plot from the time he lands up in Delhi as a refugee from Pakistan to taking up the life of crime and then moving onto the Indian Army which ultimately changes his life. The sequences where the natural athlete in him is discovered by a Services coach and his ambition to wear the Indian sports contingent blazer are emotional yet inspiring. Full marks to Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra for using his signature style of inter-weaving flash backs with the present to tell a story which is not only inspiring but emotional to the core. He has been able to effectively depict how necessity drives a man to ambition and that ambition converts to passion. Mr. Mehra will make you fall in love with Milkha Singh and you'll end up wondering why you never read or heard about this awesome man.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar has been the best at whatever he does besides acting, including directing & singing, but I am sure he would also be contemplating that this is his best performance till date. There was no Farhan Akhtar in the movie, you could only see Milkha Singh in the movie. He became one with the character that one could not differentiate between the two. His rigorous training sessions to acquire the lean body of the athlete definitely shown in the movie and his dedication matched that of the original Milkha Singh. Some sequences have of course been dramatized for the movie effect but Farhan makes them look so believable, you end up disputing the fact that they actually happened. The part where he tells his coach that he will wear the Indian team blazer one day has makes you want to do the same. Farhan's look is as close to the real Milkha one could get. The original athlete's nuances, the running style and the inner turmoil which he went through has been picked up closest to the original and though it has already been said countless times, no one could have done a better job of portraying this character.<br/><br/>Only 2 actors that can be mentioned in the same breath as him are Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's elder sister, the one who looked after him after his parents were killed, gives a powerful emotional performance and ups the emotional quotient of the movie manifold. Every time she comes on screen you can't help but cry even when she doesn't say much. Pawan Malhotra who has proved himself time and again as an actor, once again proves as Milkha Singh's coach that there no a better actor than him when it comes to supporting roles. The large than life character and the actual influence this coach had on Milkha's life is portrayed by flawless ease and his comprehension of the character adds another dimension to Milkha's character. The young Milkha Singh portrayal by young Master Jabtej Singh is equally brilliant and the intensity the kid showed as the young Sikh makes him a deserving for future accolades. Yograj Singh (cricketer Yuvraj Singh's father) as Milkha's coach Ranvir Singh and Prakash Raj (finally he gets a break from playing baddie in Cop movies) as his unit's commanding officer support the lead character well. Sonam Kapoor as Milkha's love interest gets the best composed scenes, and though she does not have much to say in the movie, she delivers an effective understated performance. Rebecca Breeds from Australia in her first Indian movie gives a pleasant and light performance in the otherwise intense movie.<br/><br/>Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, forms an integral part of the movie. The title track ""Zinda"" is something you'd come humming out of the theatre. My favorites were the Army barrack song ""Havan Karnege"" and the ""Slow motion Angreza"" shot in an Australian pub. The music is easy on the ears and difficult to forget.<br/><br/>Milkha Singh ran for our country for long and has been remembered for time immemorial. A rare sports person and you can read about him all over the internet. This movie does complete justice to his biopic, both as a sportsman struggle and symbolically conveying that life's struggles don't have a finish line. <br/><br/>The movie takes Indian cinema to another level and though there will be many more to come this year, my nomination for the Oscars is definitely Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Irrespective of your preferences this is a must watch for all Indians."

","Biopics are gaining popularity in Indian Cinema as it is representing true incidents of a person portrayed on the silver screen. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag follows the trend and is thoroughly inspiring and motivating. <br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tells the real life story of former Indian track and field sprinter, Milkha Singh who is the only Indian male athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games.<br/><br/>From the director of thrilling AKS and rebellious RANG DE BASANTI , Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra gives you another solid-punching true story of Flying Sikh which is also based on the book The Race of My Life. The movie begins with Milkha loosing the gold medal and refusing to participate in Paksitan as he had a troubled childhood during Indo-Pak partition where his parents were murdered. The movie goes into flashback mode showing his transformation from a innocent kid to a trouble-maker youth. Chance to meet his girlfriend changes him completely and he joins Indian Army for good where his racing skills are recognized and from this point , the movie begins to roll out. Couple of scenes will steal the thunder - Farhan Aktar running the race despite the leg injury in National Championship , the practice session shot in Ladakh will chill the blood and finally the beautiful shot climax scene. The screenplay do looses the steam due to avoidable songs , the romantic track between foreign girl and Farhan Akhtar. Editing could have been trimmed for few minutes. Also , I felt apart from ""Zinda"" and "" Bhaag Milkha "" , none of the songs contributed much to the film. Despite these shortcomings , the film boast off some fantastic performances. Farhan Akhtar gives his best as he has trained hard to get into the shape and appreciable sculpted physique clearly reflects in the movie. He emotes so appropriately that it is difficult to think of any other actor in this role. Praveen Malhotra , Yograj Singh , Divya Dutta and Prakash Raj lends in good support.<br/><br/>Overall , Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a true tribute to real-life hero Milkha Singh and should be watched by every Indian.

","Milkha Singh , the name many youngsters don't give a damn about . A country with nearly 1.3 billion population where almost every other boy dreams to be playing cricket , how can they remember this legend. But Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has changed the scenario. With the actor Farhan Akhtar with his side, this movie truly triumphs.<br/><br/>The story of super-sprinter Milkha Singh unfolds in this exceptional biopic at its own volition. There's no effort here ""to tell a story"", to create an impression or to whip up a dramatic storm to captivate audiences. The synergy in the storytelling seems subliminal From the trailers we have seen that how much Farhan has given for his physique. He has done excellent job , probably he may claim the National Award for his acting. The multi talented guy who has already shown his acting capabilities simply makes you say 'WOW' when you see him in this flick. And he gets tremendous support from other actors, specially Divya Dutta, who is incomparably sincere in her role. Pavan Malhotra as Milkha's coach is as usual, first-rate.<br/><br/>With immense help from Prasoon Joshi, Mehra harnesses Milkha's life-story into an experience that is pure cinema and yet undiluted and uncompromised by the mandatory, often silly, illogical and idiotic semantics of mainstream commercial cinema.<br/><br/>In Prasoon Joshi's interpretation of Milkha's amazing success-story, yearning is the cornerstone to achievement. In 1947, when India became two nations, we see little Milkha (Jabtej Singh) run for his life to escape the savage butchery that snatches away almost his entire family. Only his dear sister, played wonderfully by Divya Dutta, remains. As we see it, Milkha never stopped running since the partition trauma.<br/><br/>The 'run' as a metaphor of life's expedient circumstances, runs through the narrative.<br/><br/>Happily, the screen time is as much taken up with Milkha's record-breaking achievements on the field, as it is with vignettes from his personal life. There is a robust heartwarming romance between Milkha and the vessel-friendly 'kudi' Biro (Sonam Kapoor, looking prettier than ever). The writer and director invest inexpressible warmth in the protagonist's courtship scenes. We've seen this kind of love blossom on Punjab's soil before. But it still feels special and unique.<br/><br/>I have never seen Milkha Singh running but when you see Farhan on the screen you can easily say that he is not faking. He has immersed himself deep down in the athletic spirit. When he runs, he really runs. When he stumbles and takes a fall, we flinch and wince in our seats. Farhan's body language and emotions and expression as Milkha is pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>I have never thought that a biographical movie can be such interesting till I saw this and Paan Singh Tomar. While you are on-the-run, pause to watch this one. Go run and see this epic!"

"chandan0026","6","11","21","15 July 2013"," Bhag Milkha Bhag-3 hrs package of lesser biopic, more commercial and extra ordinary Farhan
","Last week two films watched with a very late decision, first one Pacific Rim and second one Bhag Milkha Bhag. Love the former more than BMB. Anyways, starting with BMB-Biopic of Legendary Sprinter Padma Shri Milkha Singh. <br/><br/>In first impression, it looks like more commercial than a biopic for me and that's hurt a lot. Some unnecessary scenes and avoidable songs stretch the film more than 3 hrs. And you may feel bore, searching for the interval. Film turns little faster after the Sydney Olympics. But it looks ugly for a legendary, how it shows about the reason of his failure; though I don't know what was happened in his real life. It's a shame O P Mehra and screenwriter Prasoon Joshi adopts a manipulative, melodramatic approach to highlight Milkha's achievements and justify his failures.<br/><br/>But everything is very well managed by the genius Farhaan. It looks merely original in a scene where he slaps himself. The actor in fact, and his committed performance, is the film's biggest strength. From his convincing accent and his dialogue delivery to the sheer beast of his physical presence, Farhan is riveting as Milkha. Don't know about others, but like the appearance of Dilip Tahil as Pandit Neheru and Milkha's earliest coach, Gurudev Singh. However panoramic in scope, usually boil down to a greatest-hits collection, and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, for all its sepia-toned flashbacks and terrific training sequences is no exception. Though, hard to believe Mikha trained in Ladak by the National Coach; but nevertheless the background looks more than awesome. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra able to recreate the same impression in a scene when two Milkha (Young & Child) run together; just the way he did in Rang De Basanti with Bhagat Singh. <br/><br/>Few silly slip-ups that you never expect from a movie like BMB. Divya Dutta, as Milkha's doting sister is the only character in the film, who appears to have never aged. Mikha rides in a Royal Enfield Battle Field with wearing a Titan Edge, looks more than modern. And even Air India (not Indian) flight with a Kingfisher like Air Hostess; force you to feel about the year. May be I missed the recruitment part as it was not the first show. But, if there was any scene like this, should not be edited where you have many less important than that. Feel unfortunate having a single scene for Rome Olympics. But every Indian will love the Mikha's last run in Pakistan and becomes Flying Sikh.<br/><br/>Overall BMB is a 3 hrs package of lesser biopic, more commercial and extra ordinary Farhan. It may not impress an average moviegoer, for it comes across as a very slow film. But it will certainly leave you with a sense of pride for having the legendary athlete as a fellow countryman. However, you can't compare it with its counterpart ""Paan Sing Tomar"" or ""Chakde India""."
"roshnimsubhash","6","7","12","15 July 2013"," Really?
","It's a confused film at its very best. Scratching only the surface of the many themes and characters that are part of it. What grants it grace is its music Zinda and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag have an absolutely uplifting effect. Each 'Aho' uttered by Farhan was hurting my ears and hisPunjabi was generally painful almost as much as the juvenile ""Relax Singh"" joke. Milkha's angst with his past could have provided the requisite tension to the film. But what is a true blue Hindi film without a villain, so we have Pakistan and its menacing athlete with a twirled mustache and nasty prick for a coach. Milkha Singh and his coach on the other hand are simple loving creatures. You can sit through the film (3 hours), enjoy it even and still come out at the end to realize the only characters that are etched out well are those played by Divya Dutta (Milkha's sister), Pavan Malhotra (First Coach), Art Mallik (Milkha's father). Jabtej Singh Singh as young Milkha was heartbreakingly good and streets ahead of the fumbling mumbling performance of the senior. The credibility of bringing depth here too lies with the performers; it is not as though the film makers went the extra length for any of the characters. Why was Sonam Kappor in the film at all? <br/><br/>Unwittingly, one is drawn towards making a comparison between this and Pan Singh Tomar. While being poles apart in terms of the larger treatment and of course the story line, there are common threads. The track, the army and humble beginnings being a few, but this film definitely lost its way somewhere. Me thinks Farhan wanted to run and flaunt what many might consider a gorgeous body. Om Prakash Mehra wanted to make a film about athletics. And they've dealt with the film with just about as much depth. We are none wiser about the kind of man Milkha Singh was nor is it clear where his motivation stems from.<br/><br/>Shankar Ehsaan Loy were part of the graces and the title track made me wish that it was made during the time that Milkha Singh was active on the track. The sheer power of hearing such a track would have got him a couple of more golds!"
"dsa_ca","3","13","27","13 July 2013"," Living in its moments and surrendering in its narration
","The Indian film industry's most loud and noisy version Bollywood has survived most of the last three decades without telling any story to its audience. The only creative aspect of Bollywood has been its lilting music which is created by those not so good looking talented singers and musicians who are left to watch beautiful( fare skinned) actresses and actors with chiseled body(Steroids) dance and lip sync over their hard work. So whenever a story does drop by in front of them they stumble and fail to narrate it in front of their audience.<br/><br/>'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is one those important true stories that needed to be told by someone other than Bollywood. With its very prejudice and narrow minded thinking it fails to liberate an inspirational personal life story beyond their myopic views. <br/><br/>Milkha Singh, the Indian athlete who was one of the few bright spots during the early years of independent India was like his nation lived its childhood in bloody tragedy of partition. Born in a Sikh community in pre-partition Multan, Milkha survived the partition with his elder sister along with her abusive husband. <br/><br/>Milkha goes on to survive the hard ships in the refugee camp in new born India by hook or crook. His persona comes off as lively and mischievous. In a very prolonged flashback we are shown his small town love affair and his tryst with the law. The director uses these sequences to insert the usual Bollywood machismo with girls shying from kisses & hugs along with tons of humorous sequences that are inconsequential to the storyline. <br/><br/>All these flashbacks are narrated to the secretary of Prime Minister Nehru during his journey by train to Chandigarh to meet Milkha Singh personally at the behest of Mr. Nehru. He is meeting Milkha to convince him to go to Pakistan for the Indo-Pak friendship games to be held in Lahore. He is accompanied by Milkha's athletic Coach in the Army and his current Indian national team coach who are trying to narrate Milkha's reason for not visiting Pakistan.<br/><br/>His refusal is due to his childhood traumas based in Multan i.e. now in Pakistan. He watched his father's head being chopped by Islamic fanatics after his father forced him to run away from the massacre. He does not feel any strain of friendship towards the neighboring state.<br/><br/>While the narration is about his refusal to go to Pakistan, there is no reference to it for over two hours into the movie until the Secretary himself stops the coaches in between to make them aware of his and audiences dilemma that what has been narrated has very little to do with Mr. Milkha Singh's refusal to head to Pakistan. <br/><br/>Throughout the narration we see Milkha join the Indian Army and dance with his colleagues in the dormitory, he grows up being a small time burglar and falls in love with the village beauty and sing and dream and then when he goes to Melbourne Olympics, he falls for a Blonde Australian and they sing and dance. By this time the murmurs and the desperation inside the movie theater is palpable as it is already over two hours. When the movie finally reaches its climax after over 180 minutes we witness a fleeting moment of a real historical sports movie with a race in Lahore that include Asian Champion Abdul Khaliq. The interjecting images of the race watched by Pakistani dictator Ayub Khan (who confers Milkha with the title 'Flying Sikh') and listened around India through Radio it is an easy win for Milkha but an important personal win. And the moment passes away as all the side characters begin to do Bhangra dance for the 100th times as they did for many other inconsequential sequences and occasions.<br/><br/>But nothing less is expected from Bollywood makers who are diagnosed with narrative mood swings that could be compared to a bi-polar person. They never stay in the moment of a storyline and try to squeeze out every existing emotion one way or the other.<br/><br/>Apart from the sharply written character of Milkha i.e. comparable to his sharply chiseled body none of the characters hold together for more than few minutes. They are either left praising Milkha or being jealous or falling head over heels to fall in love with him. Pakistani athletes are characterized as they way Indians feel they would behave with flaring nostrils and deep disdain for anything Indian (may be Abdul Khaliq did act arrogantly in front of Milkha). <br/><br/>But it has to do with some deep rooted feeling for white blonde among the film makers, for the way they portrayed Milkha's two love stories. While his village love is shown in a very asexual manner, where when the couple goes away for privacy they make childish gestures of love towards each other alone, but with the Australian it is filled with sex and booze from first night. May be they do go far off from village to make out, but for Bollywood to show intimacy it is easy way round to hook up with a blonde white woman. <br/><br/>Such views and forced dramatization of a very personal story discourages the narrative of the film to go along coherently. Unfortunately Bollywood manages to bring down the story of a national hero to its knees and successfully fares well where every other forgettable Bollywood movies fare; in its moments. In moments during Milkha racing from the pains of running bare feet to running for life, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' finds its footing that are rare and too few in myriad of drama and Bhangra."
"sshogben","10","5","8","15 July 2013"," Do not walk ... RUN to ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag""!
","An extraordinary film.<br/><br/>In one sense a biopic of a real historical person â€“ Milkha Singh, 'The Flying Sikh', the orphaned emigrÃ© (from the terrible Partition riots that followed the creation of independent Pakistan and India in 1947) who rose to become India's first world-record setting athlete â€“ this movie gives its audience so MUCH more, in so many ways.<br/><br/>On an individual level, the Hindi film ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" (2013) takes over from the Stallone classic ""Rocky"" (1976) as a great sport-based 'triumph of the human spirit' story. Yet at a global level this film also succeeds as one of the best movies yet made about the Partition, which inspires much-needed emotional healing for both nations. Many countries, actually, could benefit from this film's message.<br/><br/>(The title â€“ 'Run Milkha Run', in English â€“ were Milkha's father's final words.)<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar Â… phenomenal!<br/><br/>Mr Akhtar's mindblowing performance here as the title character will make you forget, for a time, that he is also one of India's best directors. (And a producer. And writer. And lyricist. And singer. None of which hats he wears here.) ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" proves that Farhan Akhtar, at 39, has matured into one of the world's finest living ACTORS.<br/><br/>He has brought the same honesty, subtlety, and power to this role, as an actor, which audiences have come to expect as a trademark of the films he directs or produces. Mr Akhtar engages you completely, from the opening frame to the last. You will laugh. You will cry. You will think. You will feel inspired to fly.<br/><br/>""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" soars on the wings of Farhan Akhtar's performance.<br/><br/>The sheer Â… physicality Â… deserves special appreciation. It is no easy thing, for any mere actor to physically embody a career athlete. Mr Akhtar reportedly conditioned and trained for 18 months, to transform his body and his whole manner of movement. The result is on the screen: you will believe you are watching a world champion runner.<br/><br/>It's an extra plus that Mr Akhtar, the actor, does so strongly resemble the real Milkha Singh â€“ in build, body type, and the bones of the face â€“ as the historic photographs shown over the end credits clearly reveal.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, but I single out these four for special notice.<br/><br/>Veteran character actor Pavan Malhotra gives a career-breakthrough performance as Gurudev Singh, the army coach who first introduced young Milkha Singh to competitive running. He becomes the audience point-of-access to Milkha's whole backstory.<br/><br/>UK-based Pakistani-born actor Art Malik receives â€“ and earns â€“ third star billing, despite limited minutes. As Milkha Singh's father, his character is long dead and only appears in the 1947 flashback sequences. But Mr Malik so deftly projects an intriguing multi-dimensional character that his image, his presence, linger in the mind long after he has faded from the screen.<br/><br/>Divya Dutta as Ishri Kaur, Milkha's sole surviving sister. Brilliant! Emotional touchpoint for the whole audience, on both the individual and societal levels.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least: newcomer Japtej Singh, who plays Milkha as a child. Merges perfectly with Mr Akhtar as the adult Milkha; you believe one would grow into the other. Most natural and 'genuine' performance by any child actor that I had seen in years. (May this be the beginning of a long and great career for young Mr Singh!)<br/><br/>Chief among technical departments, the strong story structure of ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is a huge plus. The filmmakers chose an unusual starting point to begin telling their story: what might be thought the greatest failure of Milkha Singh's career. (Breaking his own world record, but only finishing 4th â€“ out of the medals â€“ in the 400 meter run at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome.) But through deft intercutting between the then-present and selected flashbacks to Milkha's backstory, the film builds to an unexpectedly powerful climax that emotionally satisfies while inspiring on both personal and global levels.<br/><br/>Special credit: without diluting the emotional horror of Milkha's childhood experiences during the Partition, visual horror is kept to a minimum. A very difficult balance to keep, but successfully achieved here. (Note to Parents: film does contain one disturbing image of an athletics injury.)<br/><br/>The taut script by Prasoon Joshi and crisp editing by P. S. Bharathi elevate ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" by an order of magnitude above director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's earlier movies (such as ""Rang De Basanti"" (2006) which, though fresh and original, was comparatively unfocused and sprawling in its storytelling technique). ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"", by comparison, is so tightly written and well paced that I never even noticed the three-hour length, the film runs so fast and so smoothly.<br/><br/>The music â€“ by Shankar Ehsaan Loy â€“ is so good, so inspiring, that I rushed straight out to buy the soundtrack music CD immediately after leaving the movie!<br/><br/>Pretty easily, ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is THE BEST film I've seen from anywhere in the world thus far in 2013. (This statement includes the Oscar holdovers from year 2012.) Will prove to be a landmark film in world cinema."

"ankishraj","6","3","4","13 January 2014"," A dedicated biopic which often meanders and gets boring....needs some serious editing..!!
","BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is riveting to the core and inspiring. No doubts about that. But the disappointment comes to spoil the thrill.<br/><br/>BMB has a runtime of almost 3 hours 15 minutes that is too much. The film's biggest flaw is the editing. The film needs dome serious editing not because its 3 hours but because it gets boring at many places. The training sequence mainly needs trimming. The film is otherwise a good watch because it's brimming with inspiration that young India needs.<br/><br/>The direction is good and RAKYESH creates the retro look well. The music by SHANKAR-EHSAAN-LOY is amazing, especially ZINDA and MERA YAAR.<br/><br/>FARHAN AKHTAR is the soul of the film. He's not actually acting- he's being Milkha, he's living Milkha. SONAM KAPOOR was paid 11 rupees for this film. I say she's over-paid. She is a joke amidst all the stunning performers. The rest of the cast does really well.<br/><br/>Altogether, watch BMB if slow-paced biopics and inspirational pieces suit your taste. I'll go for a 5 for the film and an extra star for Farhan. So 6/10 for this flick that is dedicated but often falls short and bores you."
"aashutosh-vyas","9","3","4","28 July 2013"," new by standards of Indian sports movies but falls short of a classic
","BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic based on the life of most celebrated athlete of India. It is directed by RAKEYSH OMAPRAKSH MEHRA who is looking to make a good film after failure of Delhi 6. MILKHA SINGH is played by talented and versatile FARHAN AKHTAR. In India, sports movie begin with a child seeing dream to be successful and in last scene he hits six or scores a goal but mind you, this is different. For that credit must go to wonderful editing. Movie is 3 hour long but does not look boring, even songs have been used quite brilliantly. FARHAN AKHTAR shows his acting skills and his hard work is noticeable in the movie. This may be considered exaggeration by some but I think he resembled Daniel day Lewis. Just like DDL you would think that this is MILKHA SINGH not FARHAN. This is really commendable. SONAM KAPOOR is really brilliant in the short role she got, she may not have pr of other actress so she might not get much appreciation but still she was brilliant in little role she has. Cast has done brilliant job, PAVAN MALHOTRA and YOGRAJ SINGH have given strong performance. And yes YOGRAJ SINGH is father of YUVRAJ SINGH just for info. In technical departments movie is good. Cinematography is good suitable for a period film. Music is really good. Every song is suitable for respective situations. SHANKAR EHSAAN LOY shows that they are still one of the best music director around in industry. Editing as mentioned is excellent. Talking about weak points of the movie, which stops this movie at being good and not classic. Some parts are fictional and take the seriousness out. Like the sequence of him drinking 2 kg of Desi ghee however entertaining, but does not look good. Second thing is I have good knowledge of sports and I knew history of his life. So after interval, it becomes predictable. But this may not be a problem as most in India do not know him that well. Third and biggest flaw is MILKHA SINGH never held the world record but this thing is given much importance in movie and it shows he breaks the world record. Other than these technical faults, this movie is really wonderful and must watch. Do not miss it. No wonder why athlete great Carl Lewis called him to congratulate him for a wonderful career."
"kunalkhandwala","10","3","4","26 July 2013"," A laudable achievement in inspirational cinema
","Sprinting through the 400m track, Milkha Singh flies with a dream to win glory, with purpose to shine for his country and reason, to overcome his weakness. Honed by expert coaches and disciplined by the Army, Milkha Singh achieves what no athlete could with his background. The finest visionary filmmaker, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (R.O.M) introduces Milkha's childhood to delineate the events and circumstances that made the orphaned refugee a world class athlete. The inspiring real life story is nothing short of epic on the cinema screen with Farhan Akhtar, embodying a soulful portrayal of R.O.M's envisioned protagonist. The parallel storytelling smoothly transitions between the humble beginnings of young Milkha, the events of partition that led to him taking refuge in Delhi's camps and his rebellion against his circumstances that made his coal-blackened hands hold the Indian Army's guns.It wasn't until he went through rigorous training and transformation to fight his inner demons to overcome his horrifying past, that we see Milkha's ultimate success and recognition as the Flying Sikh. <br/><br/>It all begins with the race at the Roman Olympics when Milkha Singh failed to clench victory. A distraught Milkha has the opportunity for reclaiming glory in Pakistan, where his original home and memories remain. Partition drove Milkha to the refugee camp in Delhi where he reunited with his sister, only to run away from his circumstances to liberation. Love takes over Milkha's life with the innocent Biro charming her way into his heart. But Milkha's inability to find a respectable livelihood separates him from his love with a newfound ambition. The Indian Army is where he learns about respect and a cross-country trial was where his talent was recognized. While being completely dedicated to running, his affair with an Aussie girl prior to the Melbourne Olympics distracted him from the cause and he failed to qualify. Disappointed with himself, Farhan portrays the raw emotion with punishment in front of the mirror. His next goal is to break the 400m world record and when the aims are that high, so are the training grounds. R.O.M has showcased Ladakh in all its desolate beauty. Farhan's painstakingly developed brawn is that of an athlete and one has to applaud his genuine effort. Over time, Milkha Singh achieves success on the track and unimaginable glory for the nation. With renewed focus and nothing to distract him from running to the finish line, Milkha attains the title of the Flying Sikh with his epic victory.<br/><br/>Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has brilliantly visualized an inspiring story of the legend, of course adding his own dramatic elements, and given us a masterpiece to live by. In familiar styling of setting distinct color tones for flashbacks and using ultra-slow motion photography, he greatly enhances the visual feel of several important scenes. <br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar had spent days with the living legend, understanding his character while transforming his physique to appear athletic. His dedication to the character and his own contribution to its depiction are truly remarkable feats because you do see him as Milkha Singh and not Farhan Akhtar. Such a performance is to be cherished and must hail accolades at ceremonies. Sonam Kapoor in a brief role as Biro is charming and vital to the story's evolution. Japtej Singh as young Milkha is versatile with his emotions and has a good understanding of the character's circumstances. Divya Dutta is a great talent and has been used wisely by Mehra to bring an emotional balance in Milkha's life. Yograj Singh as National team Coach Ranvir Singh is simply outstanding as Milkha's progressive mentor. Perhaps the most heartfelt and genuine performance is of Pawan Malhotra as coach Gurudev Singh. His emotions are keenly felt and as exemplary an actor as he is, one must appreciate Mehra's casting that brought the best out of him. <br/><br/>Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's return after a lull period justifies the time spent in creating the score for this film. From the uplifting background score to the petulant theme of Gurbaani that is enhanced by Daler Mehendi's passionate vocals, the trio have variety and pertinence for the film's subject. While Mera Yaar, Rangrez, Slow-motion angreza are tracks that could be edited to make the film tighter, they are still melodious tracks to listen to. Arif Lohar's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a subtle anthem for his training in Ladakh but its effect is definitely uplifting. The rock version by Siddharth Mahadevan is inspiring and suited to the end credits. Maston ka jhund is catchy, fun and similar to Khalbalee in its effect. But the film's best track is the powerful Zinda that catches the spirit of Milkha Singh. It's the song that works while passing cars on the highway, in the gym, bathroom, while running or even jumping over train compartments. <br/><br/>Rakeysh Mehra has adroitly used technologies to enhance the film's emotional feel. Milkha's feet running over sands, him running over train compartments and crossing the finish line in slow motion are visuals that one cannot erase from the mind. He captures the essence of the dedicated athlete for whom running meant more than just a sport. It gave purpose to his life. Prasoon Joshi's writing is yet again commendable and has more impact when visualized by Rakeysh Mehra. <br/><br/>The hard work put in by everyone in the film is apparent in its realistic depiction. The sincerity is keenly felt and the passionate portrayal of Milkha Singh is warmly embraced. There might be a song too many and a sequence or two prolonged, but Milkha Singh's story is an important one nevertheless because it reminds us that there are no shortcuts to success. It comes at the cost of sacrifices, buckets of sweat and ounces of blood in its journey. <br/><br/><ul><li>9.488 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

If you're thinking that the length of the movie is too long, it's certainly isn't. The movie never, ever ceases to bore you and becomes the point of interest for the whole damn three freaking hours. The movie revolves around the hard work, horrors and happiness of Milkha Singh which is totally inspiring with it's bliss of charm.

The movie GIVES you what you exactly want. It entertains as much as a inspiring movie can and takes the level of touching to a stupendous different level. Portraying Milkha Singh's troubles, struggles, achievements and his sheer desire and zeal to break the world record and become the top athlete, has been brilliantly done by the director. Farhan's physical training and his hard work are beautifully and remarkable displayed which absorbs you and lets you feel the deep and intense emotions. Some of the scenes are thoroughly moving and give you goosebumps which make you feel like you're watching one of the best Bollywood movies ever. The desire of Milkha Singh to eat, to run, to love, to win, for his country, family and his love has been portrayed excellently. <br/><br/>Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is one of the best movies ever made in Bollywood and if you're missing on this one, you'll regret your whole life.

"siva_sanjeev-798-161832","10","4","6","15 July 2013"," A true inspiration from a fantabulous biopic
","The first time I learnt about 'Milkha Singh' was when I was ten years old. Preparing for a GK quiz, I had to remember the sobriquet 'Flying Sikh' by heart. Little did I know then the value of the greatest sporting sobriquet in Indian sport at least.<br/><br/>So, what's great about Milkha Singh that we call him legendary or one of the greatest athletes India has ever produced? Neither did I know the answer prior to watching 'Bhaag Milkha..'. But when I decided to learn, answers were aplenty.<br/><br/>Milkha Singh had lost only 3 races out of the 80, he participated. Though Milkha finished fourth at the 1960 Rome Olympics, it was still a track record bettering the previous records. So much that five decades after Milkha Singh, with the aid of foreign coaches and training and nutrition, the best 400m time is a silly 0.12 seconds better than that of Milkha (set by K M Binu at Athens Olympics but this wasn't even enough to take Binu past the heats). Shockingly Surprising. There are more but out of the purview of my review.<br/><br/>Back to the reviews, the movie is as grand as the above fact. Bollywood's finest answer to 'chariots of fire', the fabula is the actual story of Milkha Singh, but what pushes this biopic to the next level is the syuzhet â€“ the way the story unfolds on the big screen; in a series of analepsis.<br/><br/>From enthralling race sequences to a terrifying partition tell-tale to some breath-taking romantic moments, Binod Pradhan captures the subtle nuances that you even forget to wink your eye. Background score by trio, Shanker Ehsaan Loy is adequately top notch.<br/><br/>'Agar Milkha bangaya India, Farhan bangaya Milkha!!' No actor, living or dead, Indian or foreign could have suited to Milkha's role or acted like Farhan Akhtar did. An epitome of elegance and dedication, Farhan infused soul into the movie. Each and every scene is a mark of his versatility and he delivers with an intricate charm, impeccably. There are scenes ranging from boyish romance to scenes where he fights with the ghosts of his past, to scenes that show his perseverance after he loses the 1956 Olympics and are an absolute delight to watch, particularly the way he trains himself after the 1956 loss. It just makes you feel that you are watching the legend himself on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Don't expect a regular 'coke and pop-corn' style story. Though many people complained that the movie is lengthy, I was never bored, but also felt that each and every frame was well thought, penned and screen-played.<br/><br/>A magnificent tale woven around a childhood trauma and a tantalizing agony of not winning an Olympic medal in athletics, a story of will and hope, a celebration of athletic spirit, a truly inspiring and motivating biopic, coupled with a fantabulous movie-making by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag makes an exhilarating watch, without any second thought.<br/><br/>Arguably, one of the finest sporting movies, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag will go into the annals of Bollywood filmmaking just like the legend. And a film worthy of winning an Oscar for India, this year.<br/><br/>And yes, don't miss the beginning."

","I would like to share my views after watching this movie.I watched movie ""PAN SINGH TOMAR "".In this movie i feel some of the moments are similar to that movie.I was wondering how can such type of movies on athlete would catch our glimpse.But thanks to every member who are connected to this movie,specially to Farhan Akhtar.I am blown away by this movie.if i compare the work between 'PST' with 'BMB' i only to say to the director of that movie should learn something from this movie.This type of movie should be made as it will help the students,children get attach with GK.I am a bit disappointed with songs.I loved the song 'Zinda' except this no other songs are comparable this.i would love to go to hall to watch this type of movie till this type of member work on.I love you Farhan. you are a great talented actor.There are some person are there who surpass their parents.I think you are one of them.Finally say if u made this movie for 5 hrs instead of 3 hrs,i would sit in seat and watch."

","This one is a complete winner. An epitome biopic in Indian Cinema. Farhan is outstanding. Sonam passes off as above average. Rest of the cast are above average. Divya Dutta shines in her small but intense and significant role. After a really long time, we come across a movie which moves you. It continues to move you long after you have left the cinema hall. I would regard this one as a must watch. Specially for children and people who are struggling to make their mark in any sport.<br/><br/>Music is outstanding too but for the song of Muston Ka Jhund which did not look like to me as well written piece or well choreographed and was kind of out of context and place in the movie.<br/><br/>Kudos Rakesh Omprakash Mehra & Farhan."

","Kudos to Farhan Akhtar for delivering Milkha Singh to us! His is an absolutely brilliant performance. He has clearly put in massive effort to get it right. From the physical development, to the running style, the look, the accent, the Punjabi language, the dancing.. everything. And he delivers well on all of these. Clearly, he seems to be the perfect fit for this role.<br/><br/>Milkha Singh's story is told very well, in interspersed flashbacks, in almost a similar way that Mehra had mixed the characters and story of India's pre-independence revolution with modern day characters in Rang De Basanti.<br/><br/>Everyone giving stars to Bhaag Milkha Bhaag when it actually deserves a moon. Once in a lifetime kinda stuff. Epic is the word"

","A Very good movie to watch. Surely Farhan deserves a standing ovation and surely all awards for this year just waiting to be handed over to him. His extreme dedication to be in Milkha's shape is an old story now, but his acting talent is even more impressing. Hats Off to the director for the courage to make a movie which is not about cricket!! This movie will surely inspire the young souls who dream big in the area of athletics. However the movie is little too long, it can be shorten by sacrificing 1/2 songs. There are few moments which really touch your heart - like when Milkha is asking his sister to wear the National team's blazer."

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has got a long way to go in the history of Indian Cinema. There are not many movies made on real heroes and Milkha Singh is one of our real national hero. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a real tribute to Flying Sikh of India. Right from the first frame till the last frame I as a viewer thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I am not a big fan of Farhan's acting but he has absolutely done wonders to this role. The kind of preparations he has done can be seen in every frame in which he was present. After Rang De Basanti Rakyesh Om Prakash Mehra has struck another gold and this time it is going to be remembered for a long long time. Sir Milkha Singh has said it correctly that Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has made him immortal. Must watch !!!!"
"sweetypavi","10","4","6","13 July 2013"," Bhag Milka Bhag - Finally our Chariots of Fire. You shall get a chance to celebrate true nationalism with self triumph!!!
","Bhag Milka Bhag - Finally our Chariots of Fire<br/><br/>""Are you relaxing? No, I am Mikha Singh!"" â€“ This the famous joke and that is unfortunately how we have been introduced to the Flying Sikh Milkha Singh all our lives. <br/><br/>While the legend has been living all his life while we grew up to become just mediocre metro-sexual youth, never ever, there has been a sustained attempt by our society to bring out these legends to lead us, or to enthuse our kidsÂ…Â… and then we had to learn about Pan Singh Tomar, Mir Ranjan Negi and now Milkha Singh through our filmmakersÂ…. And hats off to these directors who chose these guys over much hyped guys that are littered in our so- called Indian Sports scenario.<br/><br/>Bhag Milkha Bhag is an homage to that undying spirit so universal but somehow so unsung in this country. And the decay all around is not unnoticeable. <br/><br/>Again this movie proves that at least in cinema , India has matured. As the scene after scene transcendent, it allays my (and others) anxiety over the doubtful feasibility of this biopic. Some three to four years back when Rakesh OP Mehra declared his intention, it seemed a subject of a documentary. And here we are, with a movie, that actually gets deep down your throat and alleviates the inner conscience. Few, very few movies have that effect, where long after you have left the screen, the scenes ghostly hover in your subconscious selfÂ…. May be the universal value system re-instates itself once again, may be that is the deep rooted ethos-system that we imbibe. Bhag Milka Bhag, brings about those elements in you to the surface which make you promise once again to self that you shall surely rise above your own self pettiness day after day, everyday.<br/><br/>So then, this movie joins the elite, it is as powerfully stimulating and real as Chariots of Fire, as perfect and inspiring as Chuck De India, as craftily and more as Pran Singh Tomar and as heart wrenching as Million Dollar BabyÂ…. Its one of the few near perfect movies made in BollywoodÂ….. thoroughly researched, thoroughly perfected. <br/><br/>Biopics are not thrillers, they can't be. To infuse energy and purpose while staying true takes a lot. Here, a lot of credit goes to Farhaan Akhtar. Amazingly dedicatedÂ… unlike any other actor till now in Bollywood, he has metamorphosed himself to get into the character. Look at his fitness, his toned energy level, struggle and which shows because he went through itÂ… it convinces you that yes, Milkha lived those days and we had an Indian athlete doing that. <br/><br/>Technology and paying around with camera and light and music while living the story is a strong forte of Rakesh Mehra, and not one bit, he lets you down. Divya Dutta and Pavan Malhotra (remember, back in 1980s he was part of Nukkad) are amazing.<br/><br/>Finally, its one helluva inspiring story that shouldn't be missed because these stories do repeat everyday around us but we have lost the eye to notice them and heart to celebrate them. Do yourselves a favor now, RUN to get acquainted with Milkha because he ran and did his bit! You shall get a chance to celebrate true nationalism with self triumph!!!"
"blkmgcbhl","5","10","21","13 July 2013"," Overly ambitious and paced to compete with a sloth
","The fact that the film's name contains the name of the ace Indian athlete Milkha Singh entitles it to have brought on screen a faithful representation of Milkha's life. However, this extremely long film only tries to bring the audience to tears or cheer for Milkha as he nears the finish line. A couple of such close finishes on the field would have been justified but I don't understand the point of including a dozen of such scenes. Farhan Akhtar's dedication towards this role is awe-inspiring and is deserving of accolades. Jabtej Singh's riveting performance as kid Milkha was just as good. Sadly, even several good performances fail to save this over-the-top and melodramatic film. The romance tracks needn't have been in the film at all. Waste of time."
"bajaj-sahil","1","11","25","22 July 2013"," Confused Screenplay and a Drag for 3 Hrs
","The screenplay was completely confused and a lot of sequences where added just keep in a certain audience in mind and completely diluted the gravity and seriousness that the movie such as this should have tried to aim for.<br/><br/>When you try to cater to all the segments of an audience you end up with a very average to a below average piece of ****. That is what BMB is. Even I find it surprising that how MS approved of this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe FA did a good job but one actor doing a good job does not make a good movie and that counts for only 5-10% of the overall product.<br/><br/>The sequencing of the movie was completely mixed up and resulted in confusion. The movie drags for 3 hrs and they do not have any good content to show. The characters have not been developed properly and unnecessary sex scenes have been put. Had they put in one more scene I would have not hesitated it calling it a soft core porn movie.<br/><br/>Cannot help but compare it with Paan Sign Tomar which has a very similar story. It was a much much better than MBM on all counts and although FA may have worked very hard IK did much better job as Paan Singh. While I will not blame FA for it, the character of MS was not at all developed in the movie as the director had set out to create a typical spicy Bollywood sex flick rather than anything worthwhile."

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a biopic film on Milkha Singh an Indian renowned athlete. The movie was much anticipated and, it touch that expectation mark many time but not in overall terms. It has lot of drawbacks, especially the overlong screen play & not so good story-telling. But even than it would leave with us some marks, some impression that belongs to wide range of incidents from India-Pakistan partition to straw man life conditions. And other things that really worth to see is the character of Milkha Sing played by Farhan Akhtar. This man deserve a lot of applause not just because of stunning physicality that he has acquired, but for almost everything from his body language to the way he deliver his Dialogue, he look like a complete package in himself & I have no doubt to say that this is his carrier-best delivery.Other actors also have done justice with their characters like his trainer (Pawan Malhotra). Ladylove (Sonam Kapoor) doesn't have that much role to play, but she fits perfectly to her character."

","A friend of a friend of mine had implored him to watch this movie . The friend had claimed that missing it would be ""criminal"" . Being Law Abiding Citizens(no pun intended) me and my friend went to the theatre for the Nine P.M. show after booking the last two remaining seats of the hall, at the nick of time. The hall would be full, and this was a promising sign . Or was it? In the recent past full halls have hardly had anything to do with good cinema . Brushing aside such pessimistic hopes we reached the theatre on time and accommodated ourselves on fairly comfortable seats , all set to watch the movie. <br/><br/>To be honest, the film did not put us off in the early minutes . In fact, interspersed were some genuinely entertaining scenes , if not entirely due to their quality then at least due to the imbecile reactions they exacted from the audience . <br/><br/>The Director had evidently succumbed to the temptation of underplaying the script and dialogue , which to be sure in in vogue in Bollywood these days. <br/><br/>Small town settings . Attention to meaningless details and a deliberately instilled contempt for much needed cinematic propriety. <br/><br/>Apparently , the film had all the elements which constitute a contemporary Bollywood Flick. And this is precisely why the movie may turn out to be a runaway flick and may even inspire a few individuals to nurse galloping aspirations , taking after the name sake. <br/><br/>The cinematic reality of this pretentious and poorly directed flick is however quite different.<br/><br/>The Plot is sound (being the story of a living person) . But the screenplay writer lost it somewhere . The story jumps abruptly and the narrative doesn't exactly sympathize or compliment the flashbacks and flashforths. <br/><br/>Vague transitions . Unattended subplots . Shallow characterisation and many more defects make the film less than imperfect .<br/><br/>The actors , however , haven't done that badly . I would rather blame the Director, Mr. Mehra for unsatisfactorily using them in his movie. Despite the length of the movie , no one, not even the protagonist gets the chance to actually define his on screen persona. He is prevented from leaving any impression whatsoever on the audience .<br/><br/>Many scenes have been shot with appalling mediocrity and bear testimony to the fact that Bollywood hasn't changed one bit. <br/><br/>A sports movie , especially one based on a living legend's life, ought to leave some kind of impact on the viewer's psyche. This film did no such thing. <br/><br/>By the end of the movie , it became unbearably predictable and intolerably mundane .Everyone knew how it would end , but the way this movie journeyed to it's conclusion left us disappointing and discouraged to ever take the risk of watching Mr. Mehra's movies again . <br/><br/>And yes, Prasoon Joshi 's lyrics border on the line of being called grocery store squabbles . He should seriously seek help . If you ever see him, (I know I won't) please inform him that disjointed words , signifying nothing cannot be passed for song lyrics ."

","A wonderful cinematic recreation of history!<br/><br/>Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra knows just how much to add of each ingredient - drama, comedy, and of course the true story of the legendary Flying Sikh - to keep this within the realms of a film and yet transcend the boundaries of movie-making. He makes you realize the struggles and the horror Milkha Singh had to overcome in his journey to become what he is today. He makes you feel for Milkha Singh like a fellow human being, a man with feelings and flaws of his own. He makes you root for the man to succeed and celebrate with him when he does.<br/><br/>And of course, Mehra's portrayal of Milkha Singh probably wouldn't have been half as believable if it weren't for Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance. Maybe his character was in reel, but his perspiration was definitely real. 10/10!"

"Blogger66","10","1","1","28 August 2015"," Hardwork, Willpower, and Dedication at its Finest!
","I say Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is one of most underrated films out there. <br/><br/>Don't worry if you're not a fan of sports films, it's given a perfect example of what turns your big dream into reality. Nothing comes by easy. To overcome all the obstacles including people's doubts (""crab theory""), fears, or anything that distracts you from pursing your big dream. It's all up to you and yourself, that's it. <br/><br/>Milkha Singh didn't have a happy childhood. He already went into rock bottom right after he came out of his mommy's tummy. He witnessed all the hatreds toward his family and peers. Right there, he felt like he shouldn't be existed in this world. At one point, his father told him to run, run, run away from Pakistan and don't look back right a minute before it's turned into a bloodbath. It's the first time he actually felt that he deserved to live. To live for one of fewest people who literally love him. He ran away with his bloody and deadly feet. <br/><br/>As Milkha still obeyed his lovely father's word by not looking back, he grew up happily in India. He had a habit of pushing his physical beyond his limitation to keep him looking away from his past, as in order to obey his father's word. He joined military to help him going on from the past by turning himself into like a robot and listening to the orders, but then he realized that pushing himself physically during the day wasn't enough. He sneaked and ran at nighttime. At one moment when he's busted, he wasn't able to explain to his chiefs why he chose to continue working out at nighttime. He had a habit of running for long time to the point where he lost his conscious of his intention to run. From there, he's assigned to run everyday during the daytime. <br/><br/>As he continued to work beyond his physical ability, he was desperate to find a lover to tone him down. He thought that it would be his medicine. <br/><br/>At the time of 400m racing, he blew away his easy victory because he was self-doubted. (I'm talking about the scene in the beginning where he looked back and lost his leading in the race. That's fiction and I think it portrayed to give a clear message to the audience why he blew it away.) In fact, it's all about his uncertainty about his purpose to run. He ran to avoid his dreadful past, but in people's perspective, he had potential to be one of the greatest runners. <br/><br/>Thankfully, Milkha had a wonderful mentor, Gurudev, who helped him to recognize his potential to become one of the greatest runners. Grooved wasn't a wonderful mentor only because of how he trained Milkha. He guided Milkha slowly and let him to analyze himself whether he wants to be a great runner or not. He allowed Milkha to have his own journey with a female right before race day. When Milkha assured to be a runner, Gurudev determined him to be the one immediately.<br/><br/>Unconsciously, Milkha still worked beyond his physical limitation to distract him from his past. Only the difference was he replaced Gurudev as his lover. Someone who loved him and believed in him. That's all he really needed. <br/><br/>Milkha wasn't happy when he heard that he had to race in Pakistan. <br/><br/>One more reason to say Gurudev as a tremendous mentor. He convinced Milkha to come and wander lost in Pakistan. He allowed Milkha to explore there to decide whether he wants to win the race or not. In the end, of course, he won the race.

","Farhan Akhtar is one of the best 3 actors in Indian cinema today. And no Shah Rukh Khan does not feature in the top 3, he probably features in the top 50. Anyways, BMB is one of the best made biopics in Indian cinema and every actor/actress have given it their everything and beyond. Usually movies that have a heavyweight actors and actresses seldom do well. From the first scene till the last, the natural acting of Farhan, Pawan Malhotra, Prakash Raj, Divya Dutta Art Malik, Yograj Singh and Sonam Kapoor (who hardly has any role) will keep you glued to your seat. Hats off to the real Milkha Singh, for having endured life and for staying true to his passion. The direction, story, cinematography and screenplay are all brilliant. Shankar Ehsan Loy have delivered awesome music. Overall a brilliant movie, I think actors who act for the heck of it or just be in the news, should take a cue from this movie. 10/10 despite some factual errors in the movie."

"MartinHafer","8","1","1","11 February 2014"," Well worth seeing.
","""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is a film about the life of Milkha Singh--a man who is beloved in India but who I'd never heard about before I saw this movie. He is about the most famous Olympic non-winner you can find--and the film begins with him coming in 4th in the 400 at the Rome Olympics.<br/><br/>The film is non-liner in style, as it goes from this even in 1960 back a few years to when Singh enlisted in the Indian Army to his childhood. But, unusually, it bounces back and forth repeatedly--and might confuse some viewers.<br/><br/>The big reason for this film is not only because Singh was a three-time Olympian (only two times are mentioned in the film) or an Asian champion but because of his roots. He was born in a region that was India but became part of Pakistan after the partition in 1947. This was a serious problem for Singh and his family, as they were Sikhs--and non-Muslims were apparently not welcome there. This isn't surprising, as the partition resulted in the deaths of anywhere from 200,000 to a million according to some estimates--on both sides of the border (everybody seemed to be killing each other in the name of god!). So, that Singh's family was displaced and his father murdered isn't surprising. Years later, the Indians and Pakistanis were planning a joint competition--and Singh would be an important part of that team. However, because of his past, his participation was doubtful and the film chronicles this.<br/><br/>While this is a sports drama, I wasn't surprised that, yes, there were still several song and dance numbers. Not all Indian films have this but a huge percentage do--so expect a few nice musical interludes. Additionally, expect AMAZING cinematography, direction and special effects--making it equal in quality to the films of any nation. What really impressed me as well as Farhan Akhtar as Singh. Farhan really buffed himself up for the film and was a very impressive looking guy with his taut figure and muscles. He really LOOKED like a world-class athlete. Overall, an enjoyable film and one well worth your time."

","I loved how Farhan Akhter transformed himself into a Sikh, Military Soldier and a Trained Athlete. Loved the back story, his fear and how he overcame it.<br/><br/>He was haunted by his past his entire life so he didn't wanted to go to Pakistan. But finally he went there to face his fear, and he did it.<br/><br/>After we won the last race everyone was impressed and even the Pakistani General who gave him the title of Flying Sikh.<br/><br/>In short it was an epic biography of a true legend, Milkha Singh. Some people are saying that it was not entirely based on true events but at least it was not boring + we get to know a sports superstar from the 50-60s.<br/><br/>Everyone should watch this movie, learn that life can be hard but if you dedicate to something, you will rise."
"pvsavla","9","1","1","1 January 2014"," Every Indian must see this movie!
","Wonder why such a movie was not made earlier? looks like another film called 'Paan Singh Tomar' has set the ball rolling for something that vast majority of Indians did not know about the life of its famous sportsmen, circumstances and history associated with it, like the Friendship games between India & Pakistan in BMB, which leaves some hangover in the end, with vibrations that will be resonating for a long time. Besides sports, there is so much associated with this film, like the aftermath of partition between India and Pakistan and its effects, creating innumerable victims, whose lives got shaped for worse. Had it not been for the army and sports that embraces Milkha Singh, we would have seen another Paan Singh Tomar like personality that Milkha Singh could have turned into. Hats off to Rakeysh Mehra and its producers for bringing this real life story on a celluloid screen for everyone, especially India's citizens, who would have been deprived otherwise to see this historic episode, which would have remained hidden. The song and dance in the bar reminded one of a similar song from 'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'. One or two slow numbers could have been avoided to make the film bit shorter. Overall it was a good blend of history and main stream Bollywood movie. Farhan Akhtar definitely deserves 2013's best actor award."
"chipsbebo","8","1","1","10 October 2013"," A great story, albeit an overly long one
","I read reviews before viewing this movie, giving me a preconceived image of what to expect. An epic story of one man's struggle in a harsh environment which he will inevitably overcome and triumph against the odds. My predictions rang true. That being said, I was not disappointed with what was presented to me on the big screen. Far from it in fact. Although Run Milkha Run uses a familiar formula (see Rocky, When Saturday Comes, The Karate Kid, Cool Runnings, Hardball...), the screenplay is entrapping. Milkha (Farhan Akhtar) plays the charismatic no-hoper. The odds are stacked against him and nothing comes easy. The audience wills for him to succeed and he tends to capture your attention for every moment he is on screen. Akhtar brings life and a large chunk of likability to the character. The story is solid, regularly jumping back and forth between his troubled past and, somewhat, troubled present. The editing could have been sharper. A three hour movie it didn't need to be. Numerous scenes were overplayed and filled with unnecessarily long detail. As absorbed as I was in the story, at times I found myself glancing at my wrist. Farhan Akhtar was skillfully cast as Milkha and he brings his epic story to life. The sub-plot about Milkha's womanizing was flaccid and hard to believe. Undoubtedly, many found this entertaining but on a personal note I felt it was a road this story didn't need to take. Especially the scenes involving Stella (Australian girl). Here, I can't help but feel that western women are depicted as immoral and debauched souls. Was the audience hoodwinked into pointing the finger of blame at Stella for Milkha's Olympic short-comings? It certainly felt like that, but I'm not buying it.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave Run Milkha Run a solid 8/10. It more than satisfied my entertainment receptors which, after all, is why I go to the picture house. To those lacking in patience, the choice is yours. Watch an epic story of one man's triumph in a entertaining and fresh Bollywood fashion , or watch a rerun of Rocky IV. I'm glad I chose the former."
"ashammay27","10","1","1","6 October 2013"," A movie that touches your soul.
","A very inspiring and positive movie that touches your soul. The movie begins with the 1960 Rome Olympic 400m Race in which Milkha Singh was poised to win. Milkha gains the lead in the race and looks to win the first ever track Olympics gold for India. But as he approaches the second corner of the track, he hears certain set of words from his coach, and these words seem not to be just words for him - 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'.<br/><br/>As you watch the rest of the movie you discover what was in those words that they haunted Milkha. The movie also showcases the spirit and dedication of this man and how he overcame his fears. The movie has an excellent background score that completely compliments the emotional connect the director of the movie expects the audience to have with the pain and suffering this great man.<br/><br/>The story of the Flying Sikh would have had acted as a catalyst that it further motivated Farhan to display exceptional dedication and perseverance for the role."

","""This can be your last race of life."" ""I'll run like thatÂ…"" Words truly came from the deep of Milkha's heart. <br/><br/>How can you earn a blazer? It was not a simple blazer â€“ It was The most precious wearing of an Indian Sportsman â€“ the Indian team Blazer. He saw himself in the Blazer once in the mirror. Was it true Milkha? No of course not. It was only a mere reflection of his dream. But that was one of the most important step towards a dream â€“ Live the dream. The slap from his trainer made him come back to present. ""He is far better than you â€“ he is a champion. Can you beat him? CAN YOU BEAT HIM?"" ""Aho!"" His eyes does the rest of the talking. In a moment his life turned towards a single goal. His life just got a purpose â€“ a bigger aim far bigger than anyone around him dared to dream about.<br/><br/>He started his run behind his dream â€“ yes he ran hard. Too hard to be ignored by anyone around him. When his competitor beat him in the legs to make him not to participate in the coming race, was just an acceptance of his caliber. Milkha was for bigger purpose and these small barriers wouldn't stop him. He learned to cross the barrier. The same guy who could not cross a finishing line for a stone in his foot made a national record with 4-5 spikes holes in both of his legs. It was the first acceptance of his attitude. But who cares for acceptance? He was a hero of his own. He was a hero for his dear Didi and Biro. He can fight the world for them.<br/><br/>Milkha earned his Blazer for India. Though that was just a start, but of course a dream come true. A dream people around him dared to think about. His Didi was the happiest person in the world. Her every tear showed her proud â€“ her joy. When she found the earrings from the Blazer pocket, the shiny smile mixed with her tears made her the most content person in the world. Blazer was truly earned â€“ for Milkha, for his Didi.<br/><br/>After all this Milkha was a man. He was not freed from all the bonding God has created. He just floated on his feelings with Stella in Melbourne Olympics. But soon after he realized his life was for different purpose. This gives him more strength than ever. This freedom completes when he left the swimming pool refusing the ""mermaid"". That moment was a battle within where the brigadier Milkha won. And that was the start of his winning.<br/><br/>He trained as hard as possible â€“ beyond possible. This was the training of a saint â€“ a true champion. Did he achieve his ultimate goal? Heh does it matter? A medal â€“ an Olympic medal would surely be the brightest feather on his hat but weren't all the feathers on his hat are far brighter than the longed one? Wasn't the tears of joy of his Didi means hundreds of Olympic gold? Wasn't his coach Gurudev Singh's every hug equals to those medals? Yes truly they are.<br/><br/>Milkha's life got a completion when he visited Pakistan again and fought his childhood fear. The ultimate solution to relief from fear is not to run away but it's in crossing the line and winning the fear. He crossed the line when he visited his home in Pakistan only to find his bloody memory rejuvenated. But that was much needed and his soul gains true freedom. Every human life goes around all these stages from dream to run behind the dream to realizing the dream.<br/><br/>Every person gets chance in one or another form. It all depends on in which stage he leaves the track. Milkha shows how to stay on the track with all odds in the opposite side. Sheer dedication, willpower gave him the strength to do the inhumanly deed"

"Tanay_LKO","9","1","1","5 August 2013"," A shining tribute to The Flying Sikh
","""BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG"" is biopic inspired by the life of Indian Olympian Athlete and Padma Shri Milkha Singh is a tremendous work and does more than justice as a tribute and commemoration of his shining athletics career. As a young boy, I read about THE FLYING SIKH and heard several tales of his wins from elders. Thus, the sports-drama serves as a visual treat to all who know of him and as an essentially major history lesson who don't. The USPs of the film are the portrayal of the athlete by Farhan Akhtar who gave an enviable and ""flying"" performance inspiring awe followed by the exemplary direction by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, cinematography (Binod Pradhan) and production design. The film traverses through the life tale of Milkha Singh who came in as young orphaned refugee into India to live with his sister, shuffling through small time robbery and finally joining the Indian Army as a Jawaan where he polished his skill of sprinting and finally achieved international acclaim including breaking a world record. The film reaches its highest point when he races in a sports meet held in his birth country Pakistan, where he not only wins gloriously but also makes peace with his turbulent past and is given his famous title by the then Pakistani President. It gives goose- bumps by its culmination, such was the beauty of this scene. Screenwriter Prasoon Joshi outdid himself in adapting the auto-biography of the athlete and breaking it down in altering timeline to give a more vivid description of the events. The music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) does well. Divya Dutta was picture perfect as the elder sister along with Pavan Malhotra as the army coach and Sonam Kapoor had a decent guest appearance as the love interest. Rather, the ensemble cast was quite a hightlight (Art Malik, Yograj Singh, Rebeca Breeds, Japtej Singh, Meesha Shafi). To summarise, this may be one of those films that may inspire masses to think differently about a lot of things and may even be celebrated over time. Definitely, not a film to skip."

","Story Line-up: Story of the glorious journey of being Milkha Singh to Flying Sikh. Farhaan Akhtar, the one who puts energy in the movie played the role of Milkha Singh. He totally justified the character. Two story runs parallel one of the story is of his childhood to become an Army Commando and another one is of the winnings and his training of representing the India on the International platform in Olympics, National Games, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. Movie is not just a movie, you can just relive the era of patriotism and the tiff between India and Pakistan partition after the independence. Amazing story telling. Much inspirational thing is, Milkha Singh sold the rights to produce the movie, which is based on a book written by him, for one rupee but inserted a clause stating that a share of the profits would be given to a charitable trust set up in his name.<br/><br/>Performance: Milkha Singh's challenging character is played by Farhaan Akhtar, he totally justified the role. The hardwork he done can be seen in the movie. He done training for running throughout 18 months. Its tremendous performance as an actor. I became fan of him. Sonam Kapur played the role of his crush Biru, but I dint go to cinema hall to see her. I was pretty much interested in Milkha Singh's life story. Pawan Malhotra played role of Milkha's coach in the army regiment. He is a method actor and totally justified a character of Sardar and his dialogues are too motivating while he is giving training to Milkha Singh. Yograj Singh (Yuvraj Singh's father) played the role of on-field coach of Milkha, I never know he is also an actor and his lines are also inspiring. The story puts charm in the character's performance by actors. As far as I know, Farhan Akhtan dint charge his fees for the movie, while Sonam also dint charge for the movie, both have just charged the signing amount worth Rs. 11. Prakash Raj is also in the movie and he puts some comic events and alive the movie from its serious track to a comedy one, he proved him a percentile actor. Divya Dutta played role of Milkha's elder sister and shown the perfect era of male dominant victim in the movie.<br/><br/>Direction: Rakesh Omprakash Mehra came back with another patriotic movie after Rang De Basanti. The story telling is the essential of the movie. Story drafted by Prasoon Joshi in an amazing way, its hard to put all the cosines in one dish while one is directing a Bio-pic of a living legend. We can see Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in the movie in scene in the plane, he played a little role of pilot of a plane in which Milkha and team was going to Olympic.<br/><br/>Music: Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, trio did fantastic job by composing such background score as well as songs of the movie. Two songs are in the favourite list of mine, Zinda and Alfallah. One gives energy and another gives charm of love. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag also an energetic song. Ghul Mil remind me the era of Shammi Kapoor.<br/><br/>Verdict: Must watch movie. The movie set the benchmark in story telling of a bio- pic. Meanwhile, so many ""Whistle blowing"" and 'Woows' yelled in the cinema hall. So much energetic. I bow my hands to Farhaan Akhtar for playing such a challenging role and Prasoon Joshi-Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra for giving an amazing flick for utilizing our time in watching the movie in a productive way.<br/><br/>Rating: I cannot rate the movie because if I judge this movie on the basis of just a film its totally wrong, Milkha Singh is a true living legend. Standing ovation from my side to you and Salutes. If I have to just the give a rating to the movie on the basis of its performances and directions and music I would definitely give 10 out of 10 stars. Must watch movieÂ… Truly energetic."
"DareDevilKid","7","1","1","21 July 2013"," A Very Good Biopic That Could Have Been Way Better
","Rating: 3.6/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid<br/><br/>Raw, passionate, intense, emotional, and inspirational; ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is quite a competent retelling of Milkha Singh's journey, which just falls short of being a completely rousing epic. Director Rakesh Omprakash Mehra does a fine job of putting us right into the protagonist's shoes and he literally makes us feel the trials, tribulations, metamorphosis, and triumphs of our hero.<br/><br/>Now, if the Director only had done away with some unnecessary songs, tightened up the narrative a bit, trimmed some loose ends, and focused a bit more on certain important sporting accomplishments of the sprinter's career; the film could have been so much more memorable. The tone of this sports-drama could have also done with a more stirring background score.<br/><br/>Also, Farhan Akhtar's performance while dedicated and nuanced, is not that great like it is being made out. At times his accent does falter and his dialog delivery might make you forget occasionally that he's Milkha and not Farhan. The performances that really stand out in the movie are Yograj Singh's, Divya Dutta'a, Pavan Malhotra's, and surprisingly even Prakash Raj's (Director's please give this talented actor better roles).<br/><br/>Alas, we have to make do with a film about one of India's greatest sporting icons, that almost delivers on its promise. Perhaps, the most significant feat of the movie is that we feel like running and celebrating along with Milkha Singh."
"meghana-meggy","5","3","6","22 July 2013"," Well intentioned but Toooooooo Looooooooooonnnnnngggggggggg!!!!!
","The best thing about BMB is performance by one man, who gave his everything to it, quite literally. There is something really touching when an actor immensely transforms himself physically to fit a role and Farhan Akhtar does exactly that in this movie. And not only his physical transformation, but even his acting-wise performance is so sincere that I can not imagine what would have been the fate of this project if not handled in a manner that Farhan did. If you are not a Farhan-Akhtar-fan, which quite honestly I too wasn't before watching BMB, then this movie will surely make you one.<br/><br/>But a movie, even though it's a biopic, can not leave a lasting effect on you just because of a legendary performance by its lead actor. The movie is too slow, dipping into too much pointless information at various stages, while you will be left wondering- What was that scene for? Did this happen in real life with him too? What is the relevance of that character to the overall plot? After hearing Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's name, just as I did, you might expect a larger than life movie like RDB. But make no mistake, this does not even come close to that masterpiece. Neither plot wise nor in bringing out strong emotions out of a viewer like RDB did. And on a large part, this is to be blamed on a generously unfocused and clichÃ©d constantly-on-verge-of-becoming-preachy kind of script by Prasoon Joshi.<br/><br/>Divya Dutta's character is well played. Sonam Kapoor does not do much to the plot, which I don't even think was expected from her character as it's not featured longer than 15 minutes. But one character, other than Farhan, who won my heart was Pavan Malhotra's character Gurudev Singh, who is heart warming and funny at times.<br/><br/>Sound track by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is okay, since I didn't find any song memorable enough that I would remember even years later from now, except for one really good one- ""Zinda"".<br/><br/>I am not saying the movie is not entertaining though. It does have its moments- funny ones, heart touching ones and seldom even horrifying ones too. But with a script so loose, they lack their intended punch.<br/><br/>It's true that a biopic is supposed to detail the main character's epic journey through his life, but showing it in the form of flashbacks into flashbacks, making it more than 3 hours long, putting songs when they are not necessary and giving useless information? Now that's overdoing it.<br/><br/>So if you want to know, in too much detail, who Milkha Singh was, only then watch this movie. But then expecting that you won't get bored, well, you can't have everything."

"siddharthkan","4","4","10","4 August 2013"," Could have been a great Biopic
","A Lame excuse for a biopic. Its more of an attempt to justify many disappointments that Milkha had his fans go through because of his epic failures. Be it in Melbourne Olympics when his loss is attributed to his stormy affair with that firang with the a song justifying his actions in the background. Or at Rome where that defeat is attributed to the murder of his parents. My proposition gains credence by the manner in which his successes are reduced to a collage/montage lasting some 30 secs. Sad part is that the incompetence of the Director reflects badly on the living legend that Milkha Singh is. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has totally lost the plot of movie making after Rang De Basanti. Worst part of the whole proceeding was the ending which tries to drum up the usual jingoism that has come to be associated with the Indo-Pak Cricket Match.

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's(ROM) fourth venture into direction and for the first time he has not written the script and it show because for the first time the usually capable ROM has given us a movie which would be instantly forgettable if not for Farhan Akhtar's performance.<br/><br/>Now the blame mostly goes to Prasoon Joshi as this National award winning writer gives us a script which is high on research and melodrama (when Singh is hurt and runs the race irrespective his bandages come out in slow motion) while it falls painfully short in the department of subtlety, something which one has come to expect from this writer director duo. Some of the blame has to be given to P Bharthi, the editor of the movie as the blatant abuse of slow motion is very off putting and irritating.<br/><br/>Some of the sequences are well shot and conceived for which ROM does get the credit (especially when Milkha Singh trains in Ladakh), but some of the mistakes in the movie are glaring and hard to overlook (in the scene from Milkha's childhood when he is being punished by the teacher along with his friend the flag of Pakistan is visible even though the partition has still not taken place.)<br/><br/>Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music is very forgettable, the only memorable song being Zinda. There are just too many songs in the movie which adds unnecessary breaks into an already incoherent screenplay. Clocking in at 3 hours and 7 minutes this movie is too long by at least half an hour. Farhan Akhtar's performance is the only reason one might want to see this movie. Bhaag Viewer Bhaag away from this movie, if you still want to hold the cherished memory of ROM and Joshi's Rang De Basanti.<br/><br/>Pranit's Rating: 5/10"

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Review: Script Analysis The film is an intelligently disguised story of a man whom history cannot faze out easily. Milkha Singh's life story has the right ingredients for a clever biopic which Prasoon Joshi and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra have executed with delectable imagination. At no point does the film scatter in terms of story or intention, steering close to the relevant facts. Mehra rightfully reuses his Rang De Basanti style of narration which works to enhance the film's tempo by absorbing your attention into it even more.<br/><br/>The story's melodrama is restricted, keeping the dramatic bits plain. It is painful to see the Partition sequences of the story which have been carried out remarkably. In a particular sequence, where the young Milkha Singh slips on a puddle of blood after his entire 'pind' has been wiped off is the most fearsome portrayal of wretchedness! The story's tainted scenes weave the haunting air fantastically and yet the cherishable moments maintain the story's sheen. A couple of scenes are beyond the dimensions of cinematic marvel and ooze innocence wrapped in simplistic story telling!<br/><br/>From the glee of getting his first India blazer to when he loses the qualifying match in Melbourne to when he breaks down crying the pent up tears of years , the story's terrain is smartly packed with judicious amounts of highs and lows, making the film's recipe flawless.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Review: Star Performances Farhan Akhtar has immersed in himself the soul of Milkha Singh. Giving the best work of his career, he is resplendent as Milkha Singh. He brings out Milkha's vulnerability with charm and his passion with force. There is comfortable and effortless energy Farhan infuses in his role which makes me sure no one could have played it better than him. The actor will impress you with the work he has done in his physique. He has drawn a believable, grounded and exemplary picture of a man whose story people are less fluent with. With this unblemished portrayal, Farhan will astound you!<br/><br/>Sonam Kapoor has a lovely tinge in her little role in her limited screen time, she will flatter you enough that you actually feel bad that Milkha and Biro eventually part ways!<br/><br/>Divya Dutta plays Farhan's older sister spotlessly well. A pillar of support and maternal love, she plays helplessness with command. A victim of domestic violence and marital rape, she paints the hues of her character commendably.<br/><br/>Pavan Malhotra shines through every scene with a first rate work and amazes you with his easy confidence.<br/><br/>Watch it for Farhan Akhtar!"

","Biopics are never an easy subject to attempt a film. <br/><br/>In Hindi cinema it becomes all the more difficult because people have very few heroes whose life can be depicted on celluloid and have a national appeal, not that there is a dearth of heroes. <br/><br/>Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is a genuinely talented director but like I had discussed with some people, he is going to be the biggest liability on this project, besides Sonam Kapoor. Reason being, Mehra gets so involved in the details of research and wants to show so much on screen that he tends to lose out on the commercial aspect of cinema, the one cardinal rule â€“ people want to be entertained. Aks and Dilli-6 are prime examples of this.<br/><br/>Whilst announcing a biopic on The Flying Sikh, I always was sceptical as to how much information would Mehra get on the athlete, which would interest the audience ....and how would he make it interesting and entertaining. The first point he scored by getting his lead actor right â€“ Farhan Akhtar. one of the icons of today's generation of film directors who can multitask....and succeed."

","I never wrote any review for any movie but this is different<br/><br/>Movie starts on a high note , showing farhan in race and goes into flashback , so many flashback yet handled carefully by director and writer , and farhan akhtar . You can see on the screen dedication of farhan akhtar in role of milkha singh what a transformation from a normal 40 year man to an athlete , he runs like a professional runner and gives an excellent performance , not to forget he trained damn hard to get in the physique . he is show stealer. other characters r good as well this movie is 3 hour + long wish if they could shorten a bit but still a treat to watch run to watch"

","You should watch the movie because it tells the universal tale of man's strive for excellence , facing one's fears, giving one's best in a very complete wholesome manner. Inspired by true events, the movie feels very true. A long movie as it is, it touches various aspects and each of these have been splendidly perfectly made.It is like a huge pizza, but every little portion of it is well cooked and offers various flavors for a truly wholesome experience.<br/><br/>As an Indian, you should watch it to know more about Milkha Singh, you have the responsibility that you know what this man has gone through to represent your country and his life just unfolds in front of your eyes beautifully. Amazing content and perfect presentation.<br/><br/>Reminds you of 'Paan Singh Tomaar' due to similarity in theme. While 'Paan Singh Tomaar' was a very good movie, this is way way beyond. <br/><br/>I am a hard core 'Rang De Basanti' fan and have watched the movie at least six-seven times. And when I asked myself whether this movie beat 'Rang De Basanti' , made by the same director (Rakesh Omprakash Mehra), I am inclined to say 'Yes.It has'. The product has come out extremely well - the thoroughness is mindblowing. <br/><br/>While there are so many aspects of the movie that are extraordinary, while you watch the movie , what is most extraordinary is the movie itself. The excellent integrity of the movie is all that I could see while watching the movie.<br/><br/>Farhan has just become Milkha. I do not remember any Farhan movies recently - so Farhan was Milkha for me. Milkha is such a sincere true-heart loving person that you are with him all through the movie. Farhan has done great work. <br/><br/>Songs and music of the movie is great.<br/><br/>Characterisations are excellent. Relationship of Milkha with his sister is most endearing.<br/><br/>The little little incidents on life are beautifully chosen , beautifully picturised. Many heartwarming scenes.<br/><br/>The main thread of the perseverance of Milkha to be the best athlete is very well made. The national significance of sports and what it means to the common people , the excitement , the involvement, everything has been captured very well and true to it's times.<br/><br/>I am filled with admiration for Rakesh Omprakash Mehra and I feel more and more sure that he has surpassed 'Rang De Basanti' with this one."

","Bhag Milkha Bhag â€“ One of the best movies I ever watched. Little long - I remember my cousin saying 'At every point you realize, that there is still lot of movie left' that is true! However, the movie is truly inspiring. Milkha Singh's ordeal and his passion towards running was portrayed beautifully, you cannot resist feeling the victory, the pain and the joy. Now, that is called making a movie! Farhan Akhtar - truly a quality actor. Well it depends; I watch any movie for a message and then entertainment and quality work. People who watch movies for entertainment, I am not sure if you will like it, because it was long - 3 Hours 17 minutes, but yet I was not bored, so never know until you watch it. People, who fall in the first category, will certainly love it! <br/><br/>Good work BMB folks have done. But yes, I feel people need to watch it cause I walked out, inspired. Cheers! ;)"

","I am a big fan of Farhan, be it his direction, as an actor or anything he does. While watching this movie, I was so engrossed into the character that it never came to my conscious mind that it is Farhan on screen, you can always say he was chosen to make it look so, but he did make Milkha singh 60 years younger. Many people are complaining about the pace of the movie, I went for a night show and I only realized it until the end of the movie and I was like wtf!!.. how come it be so, I was sitting for more than three hours without even noticing. It never occurred to me, the pace is very well compensated by the narration. The scene where Milkha gave his blazer to his sister and she discovers her ear-rings in the pocket and when Milkha gave his medals to his army coach, Gurudev,are one of those moments of the film which takes it inches towards being an iconic movie. <br/><br/>I liked the movie, very much, one of the best character based true story.<br/><br/>Thumbs up!"

","Rakeysh Mehra, one of the few successful directors in Bollywood, successful because he knows how to please the classes and masses at the same time(Other name coming to mind is Raj Kumar Hirani)masters the art of touching the nationalistic side of the audience leaving no stone unturned in directing this biopic.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar has outdone himself, however his fluency in Punjabi was not as proficient than that of his Sikh compatriots/child character of milkha singh in the movie.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, one might say that Farhan Akhtar would be in the driving seat but however, it wouldn't have been possible without the following four wheels<br/><br/>Divya Dutta who makes sure the audience is connected with their emotional side<br/><br/>Prakash Raj providing the much needed comic relief <br/><br/>And, the rear wheels Pawan Malhotra & Yograj Singh who provide that extra push keeping you uplifted and motivated through out the journey.<br/><br/>Mehra who seldom changes his behind the camera people is known to use the best people in the country<br/><br/>Binod Pradhan - Cinematography<br/><br/>Nakul Kamte - Sound Recording<br/><br/>Prasoon Joshi - Writer<br/><br/>Shankar Ehsan Loy - Music<br/><br/>It was a bit surprising not to see Rahmans name as most of his movies are done by him however that does not change anything as the above people have done a stupendous job to say the least.<br/><br/>However, if there were any flaws it would be<br/><br/>Sonam Kapoor - Doesn't have a lot of screen time and how much ever she does, fails to create an impact<br/><br/>Editing as some scenes were unnecessary and the movie could have been shortened.

"kescool","Null","2","4","12 July 2013"," Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (Review)
","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (Review) â€“ The movie which released its trailer in November last year alongwith Reema Kagti's 'Talaash' has finally hit the screens. 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is a biopic on the life of the legendary Indian athlete Milkha Singh. Produced by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra himself under his banner ROMP, the movie had created huge expectations. <br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar plays the role of Milkha Singh accompanied by Sonam Kapoor. The movie begins with a race in the Rome Olympics of 1960 in which Milkha singh loses the gold medal within touching distance as he is reminded of the day when he lost his family during partition. The story begins later when Pakistan would have invited India for an Indo- Pak sports meet for which the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru nominates Milkha Singh as the leader of the Indian contingent. Milkha Singh played by Farhan Akhtar denies to go to Pakistan. Milkha's coach then narrates the whole story of Milkha Singh and the reason behind him denying to go to Pakistan. The story of Milkha and his life forms the remaining part of the movie. <br/><br/>'Bhaag Mlkha Bhaag' though assumed as a movie based on sports and athletics, it cannot be put under that genre, as sports though evident throughout the movie is only a part of it. This movie mainly revolves around the story of Milkha Singh, his childhood, growing up days and until he became a legend that he is today. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has depicted all the nuances quite well on screen, for example the scene where people would have come to India from Pakistan after partition. Even though the length of the movie is a massive 3hrs and 8 mins, it never makes you feel restless or bored even for a minute courtesy a tight and well written script and screenplay by Prasoon Joshi. The music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is worth appreciating as the songs Zinda and the rock version of the title track stand out. Maston ka Jhund is another track which will keep you humming after listening to it multiple times. The cinematography is neat. The races have been captured well. <br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag lacks the goosebump moments that sports movies usually comprise of. However, you never feel the absence of it as the performances by the actors keep you engrossed. Farhan Akhtar who plays Milkha Singh seems to have got into the skin of the character as his performance and efforts put in to build a chiseled physique like that of an athlete is clearly evident on screen. Sonam Kapoor does not get a lot of screen space but has done a decent job for whatever little time she is seen on screen. Prakash Rai plays his small role of a strict army officer quite well. Divya Dutta who plays Isri Kaur, the elder sister of Milkha has done a brilliant job. There are a couple of magical moments in the movie. Farhan's performance in a scene where Milkha runs a race with an injured leg to break the national record is brilliant. Another scene is in which Divya Dutta expresses her happiness upon receiving a pair of golden ear rings from Farhan is worth savouring. <br/><br/>Lastly, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has done a good job in depicting the life and times of Milkha Singh on screen. However, picturising a couple of songs could have been avoided to shorten the length of the movie. On the whole, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' as a movie is good and worth the money you spend. However, the overall experience of watching this inspired tale could have been a bit more inspiring. My verdict : 7/10"

","It is an undeniable truth that every life is an unfolding story with a fair share of twists and turns, highs and lows, delights & disappointments. Yet, not every life becomes a story that is told & more importantly listened to & passed on, for most are mired in the miasma of banality of daily living. It is in this key denominator, that the life stories of heroes and superheroes differ significantly.For these are the people who have confronted their crippling challenges and have managed to overcome them. In doing so, they remain a beacon of hope and inspiration to the millions of others who are confronted with challenges of their own.<br/><br/>In Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, noted filmmaker Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra (Aks, Rang De Basanti & Delhi - 6) brings to the silver screen, the life of independent India's earliest sporting hero, Milkha Singh aka the Flying Sikh.<br/><br/>Bio-pics are an uncommon genre among typical Bollywood fare, more so, when they involve sporting heroes. Bio-pics aren't easy to make either. It is one thing to identify the story to be told and quite another to bring a real life story to screen. Added to this, is the herculean challenge of presenting it in an entertaining package which would draw in the audience and keep them engrossed in these times of fleeting attention spans.<br/><br/>Perhaps, it was only fitting that the story of one of India's greatest sporting talents was to be helmed by a maker of the calibre of Mehra, who had earlier successfully brought to screen, the life of Bhagath Singh & his comrades, in a very contemporary take that had struck a chord among viewers across the country in his RDB.<br/><br/>Milkha Singh is that rare Indian sporting legend who rose to fame despite not being associated with cricket - the great opiate of the teeming masses of this least sporting of populace. Now, when Bollywood - the other & perhaps, greater opiate of the teeming masses - chronicles his lifestory, it is, in a way, a form of poetic justice.<br/><br/>For a nation of a billion plus individuals, it remains a travesty that we rarely ever produce athletes who shine in individual events internationally. Milkha Singh was one such rare talent who proved his mettle in the international arena and rose to great heights in an era when media coverage merely meant an occasional live relay over All India Radio or BBC and sports column of various dailies unlike these days of 24*7 media and instant stardom. It is, but a sad truth that, if not for this movie, his name would've remained unfamiliar with most citizenry of this nation.<br/><br/>Born in pre-independent India, in what is now Pakisthan, Milkha Singh is forced to witness the slaughter of almost his entire family in a carnage that followed the Partition and is forced to escape to Delhi as a refugee. He is deeply scarred and suffers the pain from these wounds which fester long after he becomes an international athlete of repute. He is supported by his doting elder sister and her abusive husband. After an initial fling as a petty thief to scrounge for a living, he enlists in the army where he is identified as a born athlete by his first coach who trains him and nurtures his ambition of representing India. The rest of the story narrates the several challenges, faced by him, enroute to acheiving sporting glory and how he overcomes them by his sheer hardwork and determination.<br/><br/>Farhan Akthar plays Milkha Singh with a rare dedication seen on Indian screen and appears to have undertaken this assignment with all the seriousness of a saintly penance seeking salvation. He is utterly convincing in every frame and brings in an effortless charm to the part. His well toned muscular physique and the manner in which he sprints like a man possessed, speak volumes on the meticulousness of his preparation for the part which one normally associates with a Daniel Day Lewis or to some extent, with Kamal Hassan. I sincerely hope such hard work receives all the credit/laurels/awards, it so richly deserves.<br/><br/>There is also an able supporting cast in the form of ever-dependable Divya Dutta, Pawan Malhotra and Prakash Raj. It is a sad travesty of our Indian cinema that such rich talents like Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra get a meaty role so rarely that one feels that such occasions need to be celebrated like some festival. The three leading ladies, if you can call them that, Sonam Kapoor, Rebecca Breeds and Meesha Shafi do not have much to do except adorn the screen for a few fleeting moments. Dalip Tahil plays, nay, hams the part of Nehru with a clunky accent.<br/><br/>The music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is pretty good, especially the energetic 'Zinda' and the romantic 'Mere Yaar'. Yet, being an ardent Rahman fan, I wonder why Mehra had to settle for someone other than Rahman for this film, especially given the fact that Rahman has given some of his best albums for Mehra's earlier movies (RDB & Delhi-6) which added a nuanced dimension to them and lifted them to another level.<br/><br/>Despite being earnest to a good measure, the film suffers in moments when it tries too hard to manipulate as in the sequence where a badly injured Milkha runs in a race with heavily bandaged barefeet with the bandages coming undone before the finish line. I felt such scenes belonged more in a eighties tear-jerker. The film could also have benifitted from some crisper editing which could've whittled the length by a good 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Overall, despite its flaws, this movie remains a good attempt and worth watching, principally for the outstanding performance by Farhan Akthar who has poured his heart and soul into his part, in bringing to life the inspiring story of one of India's greatest sporting legends - an unsung hero."

I found that it was not the best, but a great film, which unfolds in a captivating manner.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a complete Farhan Akhtar film. He gives no chance to complain. His performance is the best I had seen in years and he does every scene with perfection. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra needs to be praised for choosing Farhan Akhtar as Milkha. Other actors, like Prakash Raj, Divya Dutta, etc do their parts well. The film's narrative is very good. The music too suits the film's flavour. <br/><br/>But still, a few things needed to be taken care of. The film is quite lengthy, and a number of scenes and songs could have been easily chopped off. If not the scenes of narrative, then the violent scenes could have been trimmed. Although it's a biopic, still you doubt how the Censor Board gave the film a clean U certificate despite of immense blood and gore. However, that's not an issue.<br/><br/>Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a true biopic that raises high standards of the Indian Cinema to an even higher level.

A country of 120 Crores does not have 120 medals from last 120 years. Such is the state of the nation in sport, just very sad. <br/><br/>OK, now coming to the movie. I just loved it, and it was flawless for me. Yes, there are evident flaws, but all were surpassed by supreme performance of one man, Farhan Akhtar and his commitment to the role shall win him sublime acclaim. Though all other performances were good. Divya Dutta excelled as Milkha's sister and brought tears to my eyes. <br/><br/>The cinematography was superb, the color toning used, the way the races were shot, wow it was just exemplary for me. The songs, so apt to situations, I would have still been happy with couple of songs less, but it's okay. The editing would have been better considering this movie is 3 hours but never did I feel all along that this was so very long. In fact I cherished every moment of it. I cherished it because of the honesty of purpose, it's one of the most purposeful true story that has come out in a long time in our country. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and Prasoon Joshi have done an exemplary job in executing a story that's nothing short of an epic. <br/><br/>That take away is this this ""Hard Work, Will Power and Dedication, for a man with these qualities, sky is the limit' <br/><br/>It's a 5/5 for this, nothing less. I just loved it. <br/><br/>Mr Farhan Akhtar, I loved you as director, then as an actor, then as a singer and then as a TV host too. Now, I love you as Milkha. You are a prime example of a man who knows his strengths and his limitations. But when stop doing the stupid ads of Intex and Tata Motors, you will be fine. You are the man who gave us ""Lakshya"" and Dil Chahta Hai"" just don't desecrate by becoming less. I still see you as a sanctified being."

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013), Director : Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, Cast : Farhan Akhtar, Sonam Kapoor, Meesha Shafi, Divya Dutta, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh and Prakash Raj.<br/><br/>Reviews: This summer before the starting of our academic session i had seen one of the masterpiece of all time ever made by the Bollywood world ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"".I had known the title of the movie since it released but never had the chance to watch, but then i saw the number of awards that it had got during IIFA 2014. I got surprised, since every now and then the title song of the movie gets played because every award had been stolen by this movie only.<br/><br/>This movie gets its inspiration from a script written by Prasoon Joshi based on the life of Flying Sikh 'Milkha Singh', an Indian Athlete who was a national champion, runner and an Olympian.<br/><br/>The movie get started with the 1960 summer Olympics in Rome, where a coach keeps on saying ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"". Then the movie ships back and forth in time. It goes to the Milkha's childhood and his traumatic and confused life. Childhood days of 'Milkha' always haunted him its because of the partition of India during British India in 1947 that leads to the religious riots and chaos, which leads to his parents death. Milkha met his sister in a refugee camp later and started stealing with his newly made friends. Soon he joined the camp, his running skills got noticed by the Hawaldar there and he convinced him for a race for the milk and bread, and he won. And this became the starting point of World known Milkha Singh.<br/><br/>Milkha Singh then won several races and became the top most athlete of the nation. Inspite of being injured he breaks the national record. Later he participated in several international competition and hoisted the flag of India there too. Sometimes he got distracted by the materialistic world. The Then prime minister Jawahar Lal Nehru confronted him to represent India in a friendly sports meet between India and Pakistan. There he went to his village and it reminded him of his parents death and the last words by his father ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"".<br/><br/>In the field, initially the Pakistan favorite was leading but then Milkha gets the lead eventually overtaking opponents one by one and finally won the race. Impressed by his efforts, the president of Pakistan gave him the name of ""The Flying Sikh"", and declared one day national holiday on his name.<br/><br/>Farhan Khan has done a great job in the movie making. He has played the character of Mikha Singh with full honesty and with great perfection. He also worked hard to achieve an athlete physique. But sometimes i do feel a bit of his own creation there, in that respect i will go with THE PAAN SINGH TOMAR for the acting of Irrfan khan was superb, but overall the movie BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG was best scripted and attracted lot of people.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is worth watching, its a very engrossing and inspirational movie and tribute to what great heights a man can reach with determination and a fierce inner desire to excel. There is nothing much I can really tell you except to go and see this movie. It would make a great watch for kids and youth as well."

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the life story of Milkha Singh,""The flying Sikh"",Milkha Singh was a 400m running champion from India,his 4th place finish in the Rome Olympics is immortalized on the big screen in this motion picture. <br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar who portrays the role of Milkha does a fantastic job.Farhan Akhtar - a successful director before this - should be lauded for his excellent and superlative effort. From the physical aspect to the expressions and the nuances intrinsic to an athlete, every detail is bang on the money; also captured with Ã©lan from Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. Farhan Akhtar has done so well in getting the physical transformation right one cant help but wonder: was Milkha actually so muscled up in his hey-days? <br/><br/>One of the reasons why Milkha lost out on the gold was because he looked back for a instant of a second after leading three fourth of the way in Rome.Was this because of the tragic incident he had to go through when he was young ? the partition of India and Pakistan , and the atrocities people had to suffer then. This background is captured well. <br/><br/>""Slow motion Angreza"" is the song Milkha sings to his love in Melbourne, ironically we as audience do feel the movie is running in slow motion at times, nevertheless the movie is really really good. Milkha might have been high on Whiskey during this song , but the movie zooms home the point that Milkha was also high on his running.

","First things first, this sports movie will constantly give u a feel of deja-vu of a certain Pan Singh Tomar. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is back after Delhi-6 debacle but is not as thumping as his masterpiece RDB. Boasting of brilliant performances by mostly all characters, this biopic becomes myopic with unnecessary love angles, non-required songs and a certain sluggishness. Farhan gives an out of skin performance and virtually looks like the real Flying Sikh. Pavan Malhotra and Divya Dutta are as endearing as the child actor who played young Milkha. Cinematography is realistic. Music is a bit ill-placed with powerful song like 'Zinda' not used to its full potential. Sonam and Rebecca just come and go to add glam which wasn't required in an otherwise genuine story. In all, a bit less than my expectations but definitely a one-time watch; all for Akhtar's hardwork and as a salute to a great sportsperson!"

","One of the best Indian biopic and a movie to remember the Flying Sikh. Times in the movie felt like I'm seeing Hollywood stuff. A very motivational movie. Director who gave blockbuster RDB has done a good job again. Shankar Ehsaan's music was fine. Australian country song in Punjabi style and the inspirational score of ""Thu hai aag Milka"" are such a treat to the ears. Actors did a fine job. Farhan was superb and almost looked transformed himself into the character. Sonam had too little role to offer.In spite of all positives, the film contains a lot of fictional elements along with facts (e.g..., a guy breaking some record with wounded feet and other guy drinking 2 cans of ghee and doing 100 push-ups. which is typical bollywoodish and unreal). The bottom-line is: Apart from few fictional scenes ,a must watch for all Indians (PG for below 12 years) as it is motivational and reminds us of our country's greatest athlete."

","I absolutely love it when film directors decide to make a film on a living legend, and Milkha Singh is certainly a legend that we should all learn about. <br/><br/>I did not know much about Milkha Singh before this film, but watching it has inspired me massively to lead my own life with the level of dedication he put into his own. <br/><br/>There can only be one star in this show, and that is Farhan Akhtar. He totally looks the part as a young Sikh man, and has gone the extra mile (literally) to make his physique look flawless! Farhan, can now be mentioned in the same breath as the other method actors in current India such as Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan. <br/><br/>His brief chemistry with Sonam Kapoor was simple yet beautiful and it's good that the director didn't drag the romantic side of the story on, but concentrated on Milkha's more important phases of his life.<br/><br/>Other notable performances are Pawan Malhotra (Milkha's coach) and Divya Dutta (Milkha's sister) - both are flawless in their own performances and give fantastic support to Farhan throughout the film. <br/><br/>I would say that Farhan should win the Best Male actor award, but I saw Krrish3 before this, so I think Farhan should win the Critics awards for it instead. <br/><br/>Ov"

","There's always a phase in a viewer's life when the aftermath of an eventful yet simple experience like watching a movie triggers a million inspirational thoughts, creates a thousand stimulations by producing endless faith in any task you choose to take up, parts of the movie stay with you for life almost leaving an indelible mark!<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag just refuses to leave your thoughts and stays with you until the time either slumber takes its toll or you impulsively google the word 'Milkha Singh'. I did just that, read up all that I could about the real Milkha, trying to decipher facts from fictitious reformations in the movie. The film begins with Milkha running and ends with the same, but what is different is the way the music is woven into both the scenes and the way situational transformation is depicted with the help of the camera which is either revolving around our very own sprinting glory, or the track. What struck me the most was brilliance with which Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra manages to keep you on the edge of your seats during every race track scene.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti was a life changing experience and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag proves to be another one! Mehra makes sure that every lead that he chooses for his film fits to the T. In fact Farhan Akhtar has almost disappeared into the seriousness of his role. He is no more the fun loving yet simple lover boy, instead we don't see him anywhere in the film until he starts dancing with a 'white girl' (that's when Farhan pokes his head out but only to drown back into the deeply rooted character of a simpleton who struggled all his life- Milkha Singh). The character is so complex with its undergoing metamorphosis that it takes a while to understand the bottom line: A simple man who had ordinary dreams of falling in love, starting a family, with a stable job faces a tragedy unveiling the strength within himself and his dreams.<br/><br/>A strong historical and political point of view emerges when the Indian national leader Jawaharlal Nehru ingresses into the plot. And there Milkha is, chasing those dreams with a prudential view of what he wants to achieve, just once does he make the mistake of losing his focus or looking back and loses all that he always wanted.<br/><br/>Highlights: 1.Farhan Akhtar and his augmentation as an actor. He grows on you by the end of the film! 2.Hilarious moments where you learn a few Punjabi words like tunni and use them very often just to scandalize your parents. 3.Visual narratives depicted through flashbacks that Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra uses very efficiently. 4.Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy- Need I say more? Just two words- Mesmerizing as well as upbeat! 5.There is an unconscious genesis of inspiration, which is a rarity while watching a lot of films these days. 6.Divya Dutta was amazing in her own way, she has been one of my favorite actors in a supporting role especially after her performance in Veer Zaara.<br/><br/>Drawbacks: 1.The American athlete Charles Jenkins Sr inspired Milkha Singh but throughout this film the brief meet was an inconspicuous affair. 2.Sonam Kapoor looked as pretty as ever, but the pretty face could not conceal her futility as an actor. (By the end of the film you wonder why she was even there in the film?) Or land up assuming that maybe she has a role conveniently tailored in this way to avoid messing up the second half. 3.Building a nexus between reality and fiction was done successfully but when it comes to showing gratitude to the man( The real Milkha Singh) who cooperated very well when it came to making this film it was limited to a few pictures. Also note that the pictures of his achievements were screened but just a few of them were, that too at the very beginning on the film. 4.As I mentioned earlier the film is extended to a duration to which an ordinary film watcher would probably be too worked up to even wait until it ends and watch the original Milkha Singh pictures( Unfortunately the edited sketchy one's). 5.The secondary focus could have been shifted to the politics and power at play in the armed forces and the field of sports by eliminating the numerous flings that Milkha Singh 'almost' had. (Although those flings added some steamy element to the film but diluted the seriousness of it to a certain extent).<br/><br/>Conclusion: A one time watch unless you have the patience to sit through it again and need to pump yourself up for a very crucial day of your life. (Minus your wedding that is, I think even Milkha Singh can't help you on that day!) You realize how heavy the burden of stress on an athlete is when the hopes of 1.241 billion are pinned on him or her. It is a film which is wonderfully crafted by the director and I can bet my bottom dollar on the fact that this time Farhan Akhtar will win the best actor award!"

At the end, I was inspired from Milkha's story and struggles.<br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the underdog story simply put. But Mehra and Akthar make it an outstanding film. Akthar gets into the skin on the legendary character and transforms himself. In many scenes, he looks, breathes and talks like Milkha Singh and at times, I felt that it was the real Milkha on screen. There is not any moment in the film where Akthar fakes his pain or struggle. Award winning stuff.<br/><br/>The movie at times is slow and uneven. It jumps from past to present and linking the scenes might end up confusing some. But these are minor hiccups.<br/><br/>The movie also has a spectacular supporting cast who deliver awesome performances starting with Divya Dutta as Milkha's sister, Pawan Malhotra and Yograj Singh as Milkha's coaches and Prakash Raj as his senior officer. The only disappointing bit is Dalip Tahil who plays Pandit Nehru. He plays Nehru as if Nehru was some American returned man. <br/><br/>Overall, just watch it for Farhan Akthar if you need just a reason."

Kudos for Mehra's great effort and Prasoon Joshi's incredible writing, it urges every spectator to salute the sprinter and makes a mark on our hearts.<br/><br/>BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG depicts the life of Milka Singh from his childhood tragedy to the achievement and becoming an iconic figure in Indian History. The pain of religious riots during the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan is illustrated through Milkha's eye that we can feel the horror of the catastrophe, orphaned Milka and his elder sister struggling to meet the ends and Milkha doing odd jobs (Burglary, looting coal from trains etc.). After much of the struggle, impediments, apprehensions, he found his athletic calling in the army, eventually setting 400-meter world records and representing India at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. The best part is Milkha Singh helped the creators in weaving the story and writer justified it. The writing never goes over the top; not it has the clichÃ©d segments. It captures the every required detail and nuance. It never loses the focus from the credentials of Milkha's renowned career.<br/><br/>The razor sharp editing puts all the pieces together as if it has been shot like chronologically. Mehra sure has an ear for the perfect musical score and we can listen to the exhilarating background score situation by situation, moments by moments. Cinematography is a real pleasure to watch, it is shot beautifully and it soothes the eyes.<br/><br/>Farhan Khan as ""Milkha Singh"" is remarkable; the effort invested by him is praiseworthy as he morphed himself completely to the character of Milkha Singh. His chiseled athletic physique, the long hair, the body language and the dialog delivery. , Farhan has pushed himself beyond limits to illustrate the eminent and renowned character of Milkha Singh with precision. He leaves no stone unturned, we really admire the conviction, commitment and sincerity of the actor. This is an immaculate and unforgettable performance.<br/><br/>Pawan Malhotra is impeccable. Cricketer Yuvraj Singh's actor-father Yograj Singh shines as Farhan's coach.

"bobbysing","7","0","0","23 July 2013"," Though you may not find it as energetic as projected but that is how real cinema can revive in Hindi Film Industry.
","One of the most important responsibilities of cinema in a country is to bring forward few well researched and worth watching movies not only on its History, but also on its forgotten national heroes such as S. Milkha Singh, fondly known as ""The Flying Sikh"". And with BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, his writer Prasoon Joshi and their entire team has duly fulfilled their said responsibility competently. <br/><br/>Talking about the film itself, yes it rightly introduces the younger generation to a man who had the guts of steel, conviction of an achiever and the spirit to do the hard work beyond imagination. It perfectly portrays a few selected chapters (till his last race) of the tough life lived by S. Milkha Singh taking many cinematic liberties of its own and remains a worth experiencing film for more than one reason, unarguably. But at the same time BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG again showcases the similar mistakes made by the thoughtful director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra in his earlier films namely AKS (2001) and DELHI-6 released in 2009 like insertion of few over dramatized sequences, unnecessarily giving artistic touches to the horrifying days of independence, a less engaging second half full of predictability and few avoidable dull moments resulting in an over-lengthy film going beyond 3 hours. Here I am keeping RANG DE BASANTI (2006) out of the list as I do assume that the film surely had another thinking mind working behind the curtain, who was none other than Aamir Khan.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, beginning with its plus points first, BMB does remain a worth watching realistic saga for all, mainly due to its three strong merits mentioned below.<br/><br/>1. Firstly it needs to be applauded for the unbelievable kind of effort put in by writer-actor-singer and director Farhan Akhtar playing the lead role. The hard working creator not only looks exactly like the real Flying Sikh but he also plays his part with an utmost sincerity and conviction which is mostly missing in the present big names of the Industry. If truth be told, you don't witness such kind of willingness to perform your given role with such perfection in our Hindi Cinema more often.<br/><br/>2. As the second merit it has a commendable performance from a young Jabtej Singh, portraying the childhood days of S. Milkha Singh superbly. The boy is not only a perfect choice for the role but he also comes up with a performance which can equally stand tall along with the one presented by Farhan. <br/><br/>3. Thirdly the film truly deserves to be seen for two small cameos of the immensely talented Divya Dutta & one of the most underrated actors of Hindi films, Pawan Malhotra. Both the veterans bring back the emotional tears in their respective scenes and make you feel the hidden pain in the life story of S. Milkha Singh more than any other actor in the entire film. Personally I too had moist eyes hearing the way, Divya calmly says, ""Milkhu"" in a scene where she meets him after a long time. <br/><br/>In the supporting cast, Prakash Raj surprises you in a short positive appearance and thankfully Yograj Singh comes up with a quite controlled act as the national coach. In the female lead, Sonam impresses in a guest role and both Meesha (from Pakistan) and Rebecca Breeds (from Australia) are just fine. K.K. Raina delivers an OK act but DalipTahil is not able to make any kind of impact playing Pandit Nehru.<br/><br/>As a cinematic documentation of S. Milkha Singh's world famous career, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG does ample justification to all the suffering, struggle and triumph lived by the Flying Sikh to a large extent. The cinematography is of international standard, enhancing the overall result to many folds using the graphics in its various sequences magnificently. Yet the director forcibly uses his own artistic touches in the 1947 killing sequences which could have been avoided as I strongly felt. <br/><br/>The early part of the film reminds you of PAAN SINGH TOMAR but then you get to see a well directed and majestically acted first half which impresses you a lot being a realistic bio-pic and a visual treat, also providing the much needed entertainment factor constantly. Post intermission the pace drops considerably and everything starts heading towards a predictable race event taking too long with many overstretched sequences. The girls coming one after another become annoying after a while. And then it all comes down to the most awaited moment of the race where I really missed some energetic background music and the excitement which could bring me on to the edge of my seat as expected.<br/><br/>Hence, its actually not a Sports movie but a realistic and emotionally moving bio-pic which goes over-length towards the end, unfortunately. The film does move you a lot in its various brilliant sequences, but with a better edit and more exhilarating background score it could have reached that much desired cult status for sure. The musical score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy serves the purpose well as you are watching it and the songs are also intelligently used taking the narration forward (But I really couldn't appreciate its title song with such a weak composition).<br/><br/>On the whole, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG may not be as energetic as projected in its promotional campaign. It misses the fire and it misses the excitement. Yet it does remain a worth watching film and a significant step in Hindi Film Industry, showing them a way that we do need to make films on our historical figures and national heroes at regular intervals, along with catering to the commercial aspects of the business like BMB.<br/><br/>So do watch it in the theaters with all the young ones in your family, especially for Farhan, Divya and Jabtej respectfully saluting our national hero, The Flying Sikh, Sardar Milkha Singh."

The film on the whole is entertaining but has certain glitches that could have been avoided. Had the run time been a little shorter, perhaps it would have been a lot better. Prasoon Joshi weaves the story with various emotions. But the one that stands out is Milkha's love for his country- India. The music by Shankar-Ehasaan-Loy is like breathe of fresh air, but Mehra could have avoided lip-syncing songs.<br/><br/>A handful of films sprint that extra mile beyond providing meagre entertainment to its spectators. BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is one such cinematic experience. However, director Mehra and writer Prasoon Joshi encompass pertinent episodes/chapters from the icon's life and create a film that makes you salute the sports person, besides evoking the spirit of nationalism in the spectator."

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Kottayam Anaswara Genre: History, Drama, Sports Direction: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Cast: Farhan Akhthar, Sonam Kapoor, Prakash Raj, Divya Dutta, Master Jabtez, Yograj Singh, Rebecca Breeds IMDb: 8.1/10<br/><br/>A director who takes the best out of all, an actor who performs 101%, a dedicated scenarist (Prasoon Joshi), and other master technicians, the result is Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. In one word, awesome. The movie very beautifully portrays the life of Milkha Singh, commonly known as the Flying Sikh. There could be two negative aspects that you may hear about the movie. First one is that BMB is all about the life of an athlete. But, what's wrong with it? All movies tells us some stories. This particular movie shows us one of our own legends. How many of us know how his life was? If anyone tells you the film is too long with over 3 hours of running time, I could assure you that there is no single scene that is unnecessary. And, never would we feel bored though movie is on a slow pace at times. The direction by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is on an even higher level than where Rang De Basanti was. Though there was risk of repeated visuals of races boring viewers, he has handled all those beautifully. The cinematographer too is to be commended. Coming to our hero, Farhan Akhthar. There has never been such dedicated performance by a protagonist in recent years. Almost all scenes has Farhan in it. Master Jabtez, who shows Milkha's childhood, is also talented. Sonam Kapoor, Prakash Raj and Rebecca Breeds have small roles, and all have done a neat job. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan_Loy is another highlight of the movie. The title track as well as Zinda are chart busters, while RangrezÂ… is soothing. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is not a documentary. It is a class movie while it entertains as well. Viewers cheering the hero, something which is seen in the so-called mass movies, was seen here too. Milkha Singh was a bygone generation's hero. Some of us may think why we should watch that. But after a thirty years or so, if someone directs a movie on Sachin Tendulkar (maybe Bat Sacin Bat), would you not want your children to watch it?"
"indicontent","8","0","0","19 July 2013"," An Amazing Film
","I loved the movie, Milkha's character portrayed by Farhan deserves national award. Apart from the Milkha's personal life, the film is inspired by Pan Singh Tomar, Invincible, The Express. Farhan Akhtar is Milkha in the film, I was searching for Farhan but failed.<br/><br/>Sonam's character does not have length and she does not leave any impression; however, Divya Dutta amazed us again with her portrayal of Milkha's sister. <br/><br/>Best part part is that Director is able to tackle several issues at once e.g. Milkha's life in itself seems to see a lot in little time. The movie is also about the partition of India and the communal forces in Pakistan hell bent to kill the people of other religions e.g. Sikhs, Hindus. <br/><br/>The film is also a attribution to the sportsperson why single commitment for the sport brings them laurel. At various places in the film, it reminds me of other films; for instance, when Milkha goes for athletics for food, his dislike for spikes shoes,etc. reminds us of Pan Singh Tomar.<br/><br/>Farhan was on Milkha's skin no doubt; again I would recommend him for the National Best Actor award."

","Superb casting with an extraordinary screenplay. Amazing film by Rakesh with highly dramatic scenes and montages. Bollywood is rising up from some unwanted STYLE movies by this film.

But really missed the Background score of A R Rahman when we compare with Rang De Basanti. But music did well by SEL. In the negative phase of this film there shouldn't be the songs like slow motion angreze which showed up the artificiality. Almost every department did well.

However some strings were loose, Sonam Kapoor role was underutilized, the movie did not cover entire facet of Milkha Singhs life, ends rather abruptly.<br/><br/>However, kudos to FARHAN AKHTAR for his superb role. Even commendable job by DIVYA DUTTA. The Indian Army training is very well portrayed, really wonder if MILKHA SINGH went through all that trauma. Hats off to the athlete in him that despite such difficult conditions, he rose to be what he is today.

","This movie could have been good, but the Australia scenes and its length make it an embarrassment.<br/><br/>Firstly, Farhan Akhtar was indeed brilliant in his role, and he deserves all the kudos he gets.<br/><br/>However, the Australian scenes were so lazy it actually boggles my mind. The film's perception of what 1956 Australia looked like is so terrible that I wanted to leave the movie. The women have hairstyles that did not exist, they were clothing that did not exist, flags are proudly displayed that did not exist (Malaysia and Iran's current flag).<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>A father would not let his daughter go out on a night on the town, let alone with an Indian. Beer bottles that were displayed did not exist. The idea of an Indian athlete sleeping with his coach's daughter is absurd in 1956 Australia. I can go on, but I'll leave it at this, no historical accuracy was even attempted. <br/><br/>The length is far too long and shows lazy editing. <br/><br/>I am not sure when India will demand its filmmakers to make some attempt at an accurate historical depiction of a scene, but this movie fails for me, for that reason."
"paavanpshukla","6","5","17","11 July 2013"," one time watch. Paan Singh Tomar was Better. 6.5 on 10
","The movie begins in 1960 with Milkha's failed attempt at securing a medal during the Rome Olympics. Despondent, he tries to withdraw from a government-orchestrated race in Pakistan. One of the organizers can't comprehend why Milkha would quit, but the runner's coach explains (complete with sorrowful music) that the young man has personal reasons. Naturally, the government official asks for further explanation. And, boy, does he get an answer. Some of the stories offer a bit of comedy, a chance to stage a requisite Bollywood musical number or offer some insight into Milkha's personality. There is a sweet subplot involving the beloved sister that raised him and some lively comic relief from his early days in the military. The movie also spotlights the moment Milkha first discovered competitive running. The Movie is very very longÂ…3 hours 10 mins? I could have done a better editing job than PS Bharthi. Screenplay is amazingly done. Especially the track running part..the low cam going around the track looks stunning! The film could have been better if the love story part would have been skipped. I have read a ton of articles on Milkha Singh and not one of them has anything to say with reference to the Australian girl or Sonam kapoor part. Bollywood masala I guess.<br/><br/>What I didn't like is that the movie ended with Pakistan President honoring him with the name ""Flying Sikh""Â…It should have been Milhka's defeat at Olympics. Another silly attempt to end a Hindi movie on a high.I didn't like this movie as much as I liked Pan Singh Tomar. It was a low budget film but still was better than BMB. <br/><br/>BMB would have been a better movie if it was rounded off in 2 hours and the love story part was skipped. Shitty CGI at some places. There would be calls to send this to Oscars but if Pan Singh Tomar wasn't worth it,this sure in hell isn't either.<br/><br/>I would rate it no more than 6.5. If you haven't seen PST, watch that first!"
"sashank_kini-1","7","2","5","14 July 2013"," Each subplot has been stretched 400m when it could've ended in a 100m dash. That doesn't stop Bhaag Milkha Bhaag from being a thoroughly entertaining biopic, Bollywood style.
","It has been a while since Bollywood has brought out a three hour epic, and therefore I was apprehensive about the audience response towards Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which runs close to 189 minutes. Predictably, a couple of youngsters began texting on their cell-phones ten minutes after the movie began. This activity however stopped after a while, and the theater hall became unusually silent and more responsive towards the film than the PJs (poor jokes) messaged by their buddies on WhatsApp. The girl besides me too paid attention (reacting stupidly with a 'Eww!' every time Farhan bled or spat) as the movie paced towards its finisher. Just at the end, this same girl who spent the last two and three-fourth hours cackling at the most inappropriate moments (carrying all the symptoms of a 'Dumb Blonde', except she was brunette) said what can be the best way to summarize this film: Every subplot has been stretched too long. I too had the same thought running in my head, but to hear these words from her mouth made it easier for me to understand why this movie doesn't work the way it should.<br/><br/>Director Rakyesh Om Prakash Mehra has indeed stretched each subplot to a four hundred metre stretch when he could've ended it all in a hundred metre dash; this wasn't unexpected really, as his first and probably the best effort to date Rang De Basanti itself lumbered as it came to a tragic close. This is a thoroughly entertaining biopic Bollywood style, which looks back at itself, frets that it hasn't done enough to honor Milkha's glory (and enough to become commercial), and so adds more and more till it exacerbates its weaknesses and exhausts us patience. It's like watching a Life Time achievement honoree who just doesn't know when to end his speech; you either need a Professor Umbridge to 'Hem Hem' him or a Meira Kumar to cry 'Baith Jaiye!'.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen Orson Welles' Citizen Kane will remember how Kane's life was seen through the eyes of different narrators, each giving an insight of his or her experience with the publishing tycoon. No one says anything he or she cannot know, and that's what makes their stories fascinating and believable. Now what would be the chances of Milkha Singh telling his coach Gurudev that he had slept with the Australian girl on their Melbourne tour? Or that he had snubbed the reigning Indian female swimmer's advances? Writer Prasoon Joshi thinks nobody would notice this implausibility but it ain't that hard to figure out; the story's framing device could've had two narrators â€“ Gurudev, who would narrate about Milkha's training, and Milkha himself, who would take us to more personal memories using flashbacks. We shouldn't be blamed for going 'Huh?! But how does he know that?' often during the film.<br/><br/>There is a 'havan' song in the film which has stirred Hindu organizations, who demand that the part be removed. Yes, the song should be removed but not for the reason they're giving; the real reason is that it's an unnecessary number beginning abruptly and making little impact on the film's continuity. The romance between Milkha and Biro (played by Sonam Kapoor, who seems out of place in every film she has starred in, especially here where she sounds like a 'Mehemsaab' in a little village) is given too much screen time; far more interesting is the romance between Milkha and Australian Stella, which is dominated by music when words could've made their moments sweeter.<br/><br/>Scenes which could've been inspiring are made insipid with unrequired gags, and many points could've been subtler and more incisive. A cutting remark by a Pakistani coach, for example, didn't require to be highlighted with such emphasis (close up shot of Milkha's face losing color followed by another close up of the haughty Pakistani coach) and could've been replaced with subtle digs usually heard among rivals. The felicitation at the end takes too long to end, and I personally felt the film could've ended right after Milkha's personal journey reached its resolution.<br/><br/>Yet, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an enormously entertaining and sometimes engrossing biopic (Mehra's especially strong when it comes to transitions; the occasional shifts to Milkha's childhood is especially worth a watch); its lead Farhan Akhtar is a strong presence who is consistently watchable, faltering only towards the end when the emotions he needs to bring are too overwhelming for him. It's funny how whenever I heard 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!' I could also hear 'Run Forrest Run!' in my mind. That's a line from the Tom Hanks film 'Forrest Gump, an emotionally richer (much richer) movie. Try watching that film after Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and you'll see the difference.<br/><br/>Full review on http://sashankkini.wordpress.com/"

As for love-story, you'll know when you see it. There were huge chunks of the 3 hr 8 mins movie, that I could do without. In fact, the so called romantic parts could have been removed altogether, and no body would have missed them. The cinematic appearance too had different feel before and after intermission. After a promising start, the story moves between Milkha's army and running career and his past demons. Post intermission, the feel is of a badly edited yesteryear's Doordarshan serial.

I was really happy to see Farhan transform so closely into Milkha Singh. I was very happy with the Zinda song. Coming to the movie, its like a very very sweet dish, which you enjoy in the beginning, then its sweetness jars your mouth that you cant take it any more and yet wished and hoped that you could have eaten more of such an enjoyable dish but you cant. Its beautiful in every frame, the story highlights most of Milkha's triumphs and I was happy Rome Olympics was not the finale. It would have left a sour taste. The movie is over indulgent, no two ways about it. It drags and drags and at 188 mins, it becomes too slow to test the patience at times. It could and should have been a good 30 mins shorter. And come to think of, lip synced songs in a biopic?? Looked odd and wasted time as well. I was sad they didn't show his love story with his wife and wasted 20 odd mins on an one night stand. Rakesh Mehra's vision is fantastic, he chose the best parts of Milkha's life to highlight. Whats questionable is the screenplay and editing. Background score is very good, songs were average barring Zinda. Farhan breathes life into Milkha Singh's character. Its a near perfect role barring the inconsistencies of the beard.<br/><br/>Finally a movie that could have been so so much better had it been handled with a little more dexterity, a potential epic gone bust.

Though remarkable in its content and the numerous awards the film bagged last year, the film somehow lacks a coherent pacing and becomes overlong. The performance of Farhan Akhtar as Milkha Singh is remarkable. Sonam Kapoor's role gets wasted. Music is pretty nice though the songs feel a bit numerous in the film.

"advaitkamat","5","3","15","13 July 2013"," Significant but vastly disappointing.
","The first sequence, before the opening credits pour in, is of a 400 meter dash in the 1960 Rome Olympics. The camera slowly pans across the wildly jubilant crowd. Milkha Singh, India's finest athlete, leads the race for most of its runtime after the gunshot but hesitates when his coach yells something, distracting him, and ends the race in the fourth position. The whole country is at once abuzz about what made him look behind when his victory was conspicuous. The cry in question is the title of the film, a cry which connects him to a haunting childhood memory which triggered his emotions when he heard it. Soon after, Milkha Singh refuses an invitation to a friendly race in Pakistan, which, in the media, is interpreted as a symbol of his deplorable loss at the Olympics. The problem isn't why Mehra extensively employs the technique of flashbacks to tell us why Milkha Singh lost a place on the podium. The problem is why he took over three hours to tell it. <br/><br/>That is perhaps where ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" gets it wrong. In an industry where biopics are a rare commodity, I applaud the makers who brought to life a biopic on a significant and nearly-forgotten figure who gave us so much to cheer about. However, the makers can't seem to differentiate between a biopic and a documentary. What started out as the former ended as the latter.<br/><br/>After the gripping first sequence, the focus shifts years back to the recruitment of the Indian Army in Secunderabad. Milkha Singh (Farhan Akhtar), a freshly recruited soldier, naive and rebellious in his actions, runs his first race for a glass of milk. The sergeant Gurudev (Pavan Malhotra), who is in charge of picking the ones who will represent the unit in further races, notices the young soldier. As Singh begins training with Gurudev, he keeps earning accolades and cheers from the ones who come to watch him. His triumphs also lead to a few unwanted enemies, but he shows grit and determination in the face of hate, and breaks the national record on an injured foot.<br/><br/>The story shifts back again and we find ourselves in Punjab circa 1950. Singh falls for a girl in his neighborhood Biro (Sonam Kapoor), who, at first, spurns his attempts but later gives in. After finding out that he's no more than an idler, she dumps him but promises to wait for him after he vows to change as a person.<br/><br/>The story follows Singh over the course of the next few years, passing through his highs and lows. After failing to qualify for the !956 Olympics, the blame which points to a half-baked romance with his Australian trainer's granddaughter Stella (Rebecca Breeds), Singh begins training harder than ever, winning most of the races he participates in with aplomb. After his loss in the 1960 Rome Olympics, he finally decides to seek redemption in the friendly tournament organized in Pakistan.<br/><br/>Like numerous biopics attempted before, ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" starts with an affliction. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, the man behind the terrific ""Rang De Basanti"" and the awful ""Delhi-6"", churns out a highly-dramatized interpretation of Milkha Singh's attainments. But somewhere along the way, the definitions of biopic and documentary seem to merge and what eventually unfolds is a half-baked amalgam of both. As the story evolves through a series of lapses of details and emotions, the unnecessary scenes come with very little relevance to the plot. Like a scene in which Singh drinks two cans of ghee, Mehra lets the scene go on longer than you'd usually want it to before it begins to get on your nerves. The jocular representation of Singh's grit and determination is at times intended to warrant a few laughs but I perceived it as a rather callous and grave gaffe on the part of the makers. In a fantastically burlesque sequence, in which Singh runs a race which guarantees him a place in the national athletics team but on his injured feet and ultimately breaks the national record, the wrought and exploited use of slow-motion make it look so over-dramatized that it's parodied eventually. The several weakly-scripted scenes are a surprise from writer Prasoon Joshi, who knows how to extricate music from words, as he plods through the minutest details from the many episodes of Milkha Singh's life. Ultimately, the film's runtime of over three hours is too much mush of details to bear and the film traipses to its finish, something that shouldn't have been but finally is relieving.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is a dazzler. Binod Pradhan's mystical camera follows the events that shaped the life of Singh with a poetic eye. The film is shot masterfully, capturing the falling pellets of sweat with a cheeky verve that transports us back to the period. The emotive horrors of the Partition are animated credibly in a violent sequence that is intensely terrifying. The race sequences are enthralling and exhilarating, and the film has got scores of it. Also, the art direction is flawless, believably recreating the time before and after the Independence, the artistic detailing conveying a different story altogether.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar's brilliant rendition of Milkha Singh deserves the highest possible praise. Not only does he look the part, his torso undergoing a complete transformation, he plays Singh with such sincerity and vigor that the other characters look insipid next to him. Pavan Malhotra, an enormously underrated actor, skillfully backs Akhtar's dedicated performance. He is soulful, resolute and affecting. Sonam Kapoor and Divya Dutta, in extended roles, remain bungled, underused accessories, contributing only weakly to the lack of star-power in the film.<br/><br/>""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is a significant though misfired attempt to pay a befitting tribute to a remarkable man. And it's such a shame because, with finer editing and tighter scripting, it had the legs to go the distance. Sadly, it tumbles way before, much like our hopes."

","I would very much like to give this movie a high rating only because of the effort Farhan has put in. This wonderful movie has not been correctly edited leaving it extremely lengthy which will be its drawback.<br/><br/>If you make a biopic with songs, the music should at least leave you feeling happy. This was not the case. The music independent of the movie would be OK, eg if watching it on TV, however woven into the film as it was could leave some with a headache. Yes it was a commendable venture on part of the Indian Film Industry to even make such a film, so do watch it."

"vegetarulzagain","7","1","3","16 August 2013"," Mildly disappointing..
","Review of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!!! This is my first review. I regard movie-watching as a genuinely important experience. It is an opportunity to learn and expand my perspective rather than just 2 hours blandly watching things moving on the screen. <br/><br/>Having said that, I was very eager to see this movie after reading about all critical acclaim it had garnered and that this is a good 3 hrs long. <br/><br/>Maybe, because of such high expectations, I was mildly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad. It had its good moments too. <br/><br/>The Negatives: <br/><br/>The story: The base story is quite simple which in itself is not a bad thing, but having to watch it slowly unfold in a predictable manner for 3 hrs is. What did bother me was the fact that all, the movie offered to us was the story and nothing else. We get to see the ghosts of Milkha Singh's past coming to haunt him but the ghosts are never buried. There is no triumph. With such a complicated past, the character of Milkha Singh appears to be very simple. I feel there is lot that could have been done with the character.<br/><br/>The length: One of the biggest drawbacks. This movie is 3 hrs long but lacks the content of a 3 hr film. We do get to see the struggles faced during the path to success but it is all too short in a film that is 3 hrs long. In the end we are left with a lot of slow-motion shots of Farhan Akhtar runnig, jumping, etc. Therefore, I can not help but feel that this was more of a sponsorship of how Farhan Akhtar put in enormous effort (dont get me wrong, he did put an enormous effort) to prepare for this film rather than that of the Milkha Singh himself. <br/><br/>The Feel Good factor: Its truly not a sports film. There is a hero who has suffered a lot in childhood and has risen from mediocrity to become successful. But while the whole movie portrays his Olympic and Asian games effort and how hard he tried to break the records, the movie ends in a race between just two nations and against a competitor who he had already beaten when his leg was injured. Surely that's not a climax. <br/><br/>The soundtrack of the movie is not bad, but its not appropriate either. The triumph scenes of Milkha are accompanied by a rock sound which generates feeling of a rush but doesn't lead to generation of emotions. This combined with the above factor leads to a lack of feel good factor even in the climax. Maybe something more orchestral would have been good. Mediocre acting: Other than Farhan Akhtar, I found others to be mediocre and/or overly-dramatic<br/><br/>The positives <br/><br/>Great Entertainer: If you overlook all the above facts, its really not a bad film. You'd find it money well spent. <br/><br/>The biggest positive is that it celebrates the life of a true Indian athlete and a forgotten legend.<br/><br/>Very few people in Indian history can boast of the same level of athleticism as Milkha Singh in his prime. We have always been good at cricket and while cricket involves a lot of technique, athletics involves a lot of effort and preparation which is what I feel is lacking among young Indian sportsmen. We are good at chess, shooting and badminton, but when it comes to pure effort, we leave a lot to be desired. <br/><br/>Indian sports has been poor in track events at Olympics and other games. Hence, such athletes are extremely rare and this is all the more reason that they should be given all the recognition possible. They should be seen as an example by young athletes aspiring to become future champions. <br/><br/>Preparation by lead actor: I like few things like Farhan Akhtar bending forward near the finish line at the end of each race like real athletes. This shows the attention to detail and the commitment/preparation on the part of the actor to get in the shoes of the athlete. Then, there's the running style with and without shoes, and obviously the effort to get in shape would have been challenging as well. <br/><br/>My overall review: You should watch this once to get to know the story of Milkha Singh. Although it might not inspire you, you still can take away positives from this movie."

","I went to watch the Bhaag Milkha Bhaag the other day.I did not had high expectation from the movie.May be this was the reason I wasn't that disappointed with the movie.<br/><br/>I like the way director structure this movie by starting it on low point and ending it on high note.It was a good attempt to put Milkha Singh's life on the screen.But what this movie lacks was the Character development which is the most important factor of the Biography genre.There were few character for example, a Sikh friend of Mikha Singh while he was serving in the army.I did not get why that character was included or there should be a better use of that character(It keeps on reminding me ""Gomer Pyle"" from Full metal jacket).The movie does produce some exciting moments but it gets lost because of run-time of the movie. <br/><br/>Zinda is the only catchy song that comes on your lips.In the acting department Farhan Akhtar was gave best performance till date of his acting career.He tried to give total justice to the character and his hard work can be easily seen while you will be watching this movie.As far as the Director was concerned,I could not able to found something new,refreshing which Rakesh Omprakash Mehra always gives.<br/><br/>If it were a bit short movie in length I think this was the worth a watch for solid performance of Farhan Akhtar."
"miteshnair","8","1","3","15 July 2013"," An inspiring movie on one of India's greatest athletes
","I would like to sum up my biggest takeaways after watching this movie with these lines 'If today's youth take a leaf out of Milkha's life then India can not only produce a great Olympian athlete but in fact produce an assembly line of Olympian athletes'<br/><br/>This movie although a biopic is very larger than life and the scriptwriter Prasoon Joshi has made it clear in his interview that they didn't intend to make a verbatim documentary on Milkha's life; but instead use events in his life to show how a young boy who saw his family being massacred in front of his eyes transform himself to become a world-class athlete. In that respect, the movie scores highly according to me.<br/><br/>This movie belongs to Farhan Akhtar. The physical resemblance to the athlete is striking and the tremendous effort he has put to showcase Milkha's life is to be seen to be believed. Pawan Malhotra as Milkha's first coach has delivered a fabulous performance. Sonam Kapoor features in an extended cameo as Milkha's first love and has pretty much nothing to do in the film. The music is another plus for this film. It is racy, peppy and provides a good support to the film.<br/><br/>I think this movie could have been much better with some crisp editing and better direction in some parts. Rakesh Mehra has tried too hard to make this movie appeal to the critics as well as the masses. Also there is a heavy influence of Rang De Basanti. The juxtaposition of the past and present is something that he uses a bit too much and it looks forced to be honest. Also in his endeavor to make the movie larger than life he adds too many cinematic elements in some scenes; in other words makes it filmy rather than being realistic. A couple of examples 'The scene where Milkha cuts the TTE's hand with a knife; another is the all important Rome Olympics scene where it is shown that Milkha imagines a horseman running after him (this is the childhood scene when his family is massacred). All these could have been avoided.<br/><br/>One major glitch I feel in the movie is the physical frame of Farhan. He looks more like a body-builder with his six pack abs and well built pecs rather than an athlete. This is again an attempt to appease the masses. If you see Milkha Singh's photos, you can easily see that he had a lean frame. Also an athlete's built is completely different to a body builder. Alas the director has missed this point completely. Also I felt the love story of Farhan and Sonam was extended too much and drags on a bit.<br/><br/>Inspite of the all these shortcomings, I highly recommend watching this movie for two reasons firstly the story of Milkha Singh is by itself a truly inspirational one and secondly for the performance of Farhan. While this movie cannot be compared to Paan Singh Tomar, which I consider as the best biopic movie ever, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is definitely worth watching once...."

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag >> There are few stories that are made for the big screen ,are just waiting to be told...perhaps, those which become sweeter with time, ROMP's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is one such tale of pathos, and a dedicated patriotic runner living with shattered pieces of his ruined past. At the helm of affairs here is Rakesh Omprakash Mehra whose last genuine hit was RDB ,alongwith Prasoon Joshi, he gives us another remarkable movie which isn't flawless, has glitches and is clichÃƒÂ©d ,yet pretty much watchable. Pavan Malhotra and Prakash Raj as the inspiring coaches are one of the best of the lot...Rebecca Breeds as Singh's love interest is chirpy and bubbly (one can envy Farhan ,romanced a Spaniard inn ZNMD and an Aussie here ! :)), Sonam s hardly there. Divya Dutta is incredible ! What a lovely performance :) Daleep Tahil as Pandit Nehru is utterly laughable and miscast ! The star here is offcourse the all rounder, a personal idol ,the real 'Mard' - Farhan Akhtar who fits perfectly in the role and makes it his own. He not only lends the intensity but also a sense of vulnerabilty to the well written character by Joshi. Binod Pradhan 's Ladakh shots are exquisite and the production value is for everyone to have a look at. I would have gone with a 4* but at 187 minutes its just that 10-15 mins longer in the 1st half. Am going with a 3.5* for this period drama,it has all the recipe to be a mass entertainer...loads of claps and hoots in the climax as the journey came a full circle..<br/><br/>P.S. :: A couple of blink-and-you-miss Special appearances in the second half makes the 'run' sweeter."

Rakeysh has twisted facts, manipulated events and completely bastardized the real story of one of our eternal sports legends, all to bring you one more mass-movie for the frothing and mindless millions who will lap this movie up like Pani Puris on the Mumbai streets. It is also FAR too long, with great depth given to the utterly false tales and legends springing from the director's imagination which was highly unnecessary. The mood and tempo of the film swings like a pendulum from serious to jovial with barely any connection and decides to eschew a realistic slow pace for a grandiose and testosterone pumping roller coaster with steep banks, long lulls and sudden loop-de-loops<br/><br/>Technically it is sound, directed well, acted well, shot well and with a good soundtrack. Is it enjoyable? If you're one of those people who simply want their dose of adrenaline and mindless action, heck, go for it.

He is the core of this long 3 hours. Songs get A-. However, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's direction is a big okaay; but not as good as Rang de Basanti. It still fails to ignore the typical Indian approach; flawed by overdrama at several places, hilarious howdy romance!!!! Sonam Kapoor can not cope with her role.<br/><br/>Overall, an admirable attempt to portray such inspirational character like Milkha Singh."

","A chiseled body covered by a sweating vest, a coveted coat of a national hero worn with pride and honour,a rowdy youth, sweet little romantic tracks, and a scar from the post- partition tragedy deeply rooted in our lead character's mind - that's ample opportunity to show one's acting prowess and commitment .In fact its a role of a lifetime and Farhan owns it for sure but the same cannot be said about the makers who give us a film though entertaining and inspiring, doesn't quite hit the perfect notes. <br/><br/>Celebrating the life of India's national treasure Milkha Singh, this epic drama tries hard to influence the viewers with its melodramatic sequences of events but eventually falters due to this very obsession. In fact the movie had everything going for it right from a cast of good character actors, a riveting premise as a backdrop and the magic wand of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. What it needed was a little heed to what Milkha Singh's coach says - 'bus sone ko tarashna hai'.Here the efforts seemed to have gone a little haywire resulting in an unfocused storytelling of this important saga.Much effort has been put in making the audience feel each emotion that when it works you feel like clapping just like at the climax or feel a lump in your throat particularly in the sequences between Milkha Singh and his elder sister. But when it doesn't, say during the pre- interval sections, you might get a little edgy and restless at your seat.<br/><br/>The background score, the cinematography and camera work are top notch. The music is good and blends well with the narrative. But the movie could have done with some sharp editing. With more than 3 hours of running time, some scenes are dragged a tad too long without adding anything to the narrative. <br/><br/>There are some wonderful performances by Pavan Malhotra, Prakash Raj, Divya Dutta,young Jabtej Singh and others who enact their roles to perfection evoking tears and laughter at various stages. Sonam Kapoor as Milkha Singh's love interest looks good in a cameo.. But its Farhan as the flying Sikh who awestrucks you with his earnest performance and surpasses expectations.. The efforts invested in his looks, his carved body, the training sessions he undertook to run like he did speaks volumes about his commitment.<br/><br/>The movie may be a little exaggerated and overdrawn, but barring these hiccups the biopic is pleasing to the eyes and is inspirational in talking about the indomitable human spirit.. For me, it just falls short of Paan Singh Tomar,last year's offering from the same genre.<br/><br/>Not entirely a disappointment but certainly below expectations .A beautiful performance by Farhan and the spirit of Milkha Singh saves the day though for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag."

","Heartfelt and inspiring are the two words that comes to mind about this movie. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra does a stellar job of crafting a stellar biopic. Most of our generation barely knows anything about Milkha Singh barring the fact that he was known as the ""flying Sikh"", this movie outlines the first 30 years of his life and enlightens us about his history. What makes Milkha what he is articulated well seamlessly through multiple flashbacks. Farhan Akhtar does a fine job shifting between Milkha's anguish over his past, his naive dreams and most of all his will power. The pace of the movie drops in a few scenes but still keeps the viewer tuned in. Great watch!!! Easily one of the best Hindi films in 2013."

","There are two ways to look at Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.<br/><br/>1. Comparing it to the usual Bollywood flick. 2. Talking about the movie itself. Here's my review if I compare it to the rest of the Bollywood flicks (especially) biopics like Bose â€“ The Forgotten Hero. The movie is fantastic. Running at 3 hours and 20 minutes, it very precisely and beautifully shows what made Milkha, Milka! For the first time ever the painful partition of Indian into India and Pakistan was shown without Hindu-Muslim-Sikh chanting slogans. In fact not even faces of the people coming to vandalize Milkha's Sikh family are show. The director uses his cinematic intelligence to show it from the viewpoint of a 10-11 year old kid. Brilliantly shot and presented, that piece is. The screenplay is again brilliant and much like Rang De Basanti, the director has used different hues to show the different times. Scenes are interwoven nicely and the narration flows seamlessly. The research the director had done clearly shows on screen. Post partition, young Milkha is shown sitting on the boundary of the structure which hosts the refugee camp. This shot has taken inspiration from a real image wherein a Sikh kid is shown sitting on the boundary overlooking the tents. Shahdara is shown a part of UP (as it was) and Milkha's father is shown eating in a copper-alloy plate and is just a roti and ghee!<br/><br/>If I talk about the movie standalone? The best part about the movie is Farhan Akhtar as Milkha Singh. You can see his transformation on-screen and he's lived up the athlete more than convincingly. Pawan Malhotra and Yograj Singh walk shoulder to shoulder with Farhan Akhtar in terms of their acting.<br/><br/>I guess that's where the best things about movie end. The director (or probably the editor) has simply wasted Misha Shafi. The good looking girl from Pakistan ends up saying a line or two in 2 different scenes. That's about her! Divya Dutta was under-utilized. She is one of the brilliant actors we have in Indian Film Industry. However, she wasn't able to live up to her magnitude. Sonam Kapoor was simply a waste and I am glad she just charged director Rs. 11 for her role. Can you imagine a girl calling India, India in 50s? Can you imagine a guy holding his lover's face in public? And how can you tolerate to see mobile towers in background behind dancing heroine? In fact Rebecca Breeds was able to leave an impression! And a good one for that matter.<br/><br/>Furthermore, why does the hero has to sing and dance? Why can't we have songs playing over montage sequences? The movie is too long and saving 30-40 minutes would have made the movie much more interesting."
"amanand838","7","1","8","13 July 2013"," Overstretched, with fine moments of emotions, loss and victory.
","There are films where you would want to say ""Ahhhh!!! what a movie"" and in some you would say ""what a waste of time and money"", after watching them. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag doesn't belong to any of the categories. It's a film where you get awe-inspire with fine moments and emotions but feel for the exaggeration of writer, Prasoon Joshi and the director for the other parts. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a biopic of the legendary Indian athlete Milkha Singh who has had so many struggles in life but he still believes that one day there will be a national holiday for his works. He chose to be an athlete because he couldn't get any other job other than this after he lost his family in the partition of India and Pakistan. He knows how to fight and stand for himself even in matters of death and life. <br/><br/>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag starts with a feeling of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket but then delves into a world of its own. A world where Milkha Singh stood against all odds , fought for himself and became an inspiration for all of us. There is a sequence when a flashback of Milkha Singh returning to the place where he left off his family who were being butchered at that time, you can clearly see those bodies are artificial and don't look real and needed some more work. But otherwise Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra meticulously handled the details and his direction is top notch. He used the VFX part very efficiently. Who said special effects can only be in Sci-fi and Action based movies. Watch out for that sequence where the camera around Farhan Akhtar moves in full circle with a greater speed. Each and every video sequence which was played just before the start of each Olympics or Commonwealth games says it all that how much research he went through. It sets the real world feeling beautifully (the best part of the biography). <br/><br/>The world created by Rakeysh Mehra of Milkha Singh is a highlight of the movie, thanks to the cinematographer Binod Pradhan (the sepia tone was used in a great manner). But many many thanks to the multi talented Farhan Akhtar for his magical performance. It may be one of the best portrayal of a real life character in Indian cinema. His eyes, muscles, veins, facial movements and body language everything just stands out and makes BMB a treat to watch. An outstanding performance by Farhan Akhtar. The supporting cast led by Divya Dutta, Pawan Malhotra and Yograj Singh (Yuvraj Singh's father) adds another layer to the movie. Â Â  Just wonder why Rakeysh Mehra opted for Shankar Ehsaan Loy when A R Rahman did wonders when he was involved with Rakeysh Mehra in his two earlier films, Rang De Basanti and Delhi-6. If you remember their (SEL) previous works you would surely get to know that in BMB they are just average and they should have done a better job. The Background Score is noisy at times of emotions and barring Zinda and Havan Karenge no other song adds to the movie. In short I was missing A R Rahman's magic which he created in his two earlier projects with Rakeysh Mehra. <br/><br/>With 188 minutes of running time the editor P. S. Bharathi should have been somewhat serious or stricter on the editing table. BMB sometimes feels to be over stretched as Prasoon Joshi (writer, screenplay) wanted to depict each and every thing to which Milkha Singh went through, mostly in the second half. But as the climax progresses it gets better to some extent. I am going with 3.5 stars for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. I recommend you go see the struggle to which the legend went through to become Flying Sikh for once. It surely is one of the better movies of the year. 3.5/5"

","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a landmark film. It will go down in the history of Hindi Cinema with the unique distinction of having the longest slow-mo sequence. In Rajeev Masand's words (on the final scene): ""Never before has slow motion and background music been so abused in a film!"" Nothing works for the film. Absolutely NOTHING. It's an epic tale of epic exaggeration which sadly turns into an epic disappointment of epic proportions. Despite the repeated use of the word 'epic' in the last sentence, the contours and essence of the word fall short of the amplified excesses in the film. Overdose of melodrama, overwrought with jingoism and fabricated self-indulgences, trapped in a deeply flawed screenplay with out-of-sync songs and desperate attempts at emotional manipulation. Farhan's eye-gasmic photoshopped abs, bandages flying off and blood oozing out, coaches doing bhangra on an athletics ground, Divya Dutta's glycerine-soaked eyes. Yawn. Dilip Tahil is good. One of India's greatest character actors, Pawan Malhotra stands out, far above the rest. National Award winning Prakash Raj successfully sheds off his Bollywood stereotype tag of the garrulous villain. Prasoon Joshi may be one of the finest lyricists of our generation, but he fails miserably as a scriptwriter. Farhan Akhtar, however, deserves accolades for his sincerity. He sparkles in bits, but although he replicates Milkha's body, he fails to do the same with his soul. The Flying Sikh deserves a better homage. Much, much better."

The base of one's understanding of being, self-image and belief system is structured at large in the most formative years of life i.e. from 5 years to 15 years, most of the psychoanalysts agree.<br/><br/>It could be a little, why, a lot more short and crisp as far as the unnecessary stretch of some scenes is concerned and it surely could have done very well with getting rid of few songs. The 'comedy' and 'songs' are considered inevitable parts of a Hindi movie for some incomprehensible reasons which could be avoided for better with the evolving age of bollywood till the point in time when bollywood film-makers get to the depths of its intention and application. Particularly the mindless love songs and inappropriate hyperactive intense scenes (load of which breaks the back of most of the South-Indian movies with otherwise a good plot) could comfortably retire now from the silver screen unless they have a strong bond with the main thread or take the story to a new, high level. Even it is assumed that there is an emotional need of such scenes for 'sensitive' audience, the idiot box with its abundant dramatic reality shows and typecast 'nonsense' serials is providing for that stimuli much more than required(?).<br/><br/>It would be sensible and conscientious to check all the historical facts like Actual World Records, Authorized Documented Achievements and Chronology of the concerned events as the film claims to be inspired from and based on the true story of a living legend. With all the consideration for the cinematic liberty that the director has exploited to its extents, a thought about a less pseudo filmy and more rational authentic treatment could have taken the film long way in its credibility and not just the entertainment value. The sepia-toned fading flash-back style is quite effective and manages to engage the minds of the audience in a different world but it seems repetitive and clichÃ©d as compared to its innovative use for the first time in 'Rang De Basanti' by the same director. Film is a media of great potential and for huge assorted population, director's relentless innovation in telling a story to the contemporary audience in the most captivating way holds the key to the success of a movie. It could be more entertaining yet influential with a touch of little quirky imagination that would offer it as another entertaining movie with an insightful message and still keep it from turning into a documentary.<br/><br/>As far as the cinematography is concerned, it is not only international standard but has raised the bar for world cinema so high that every film-maker will have to strive hard to maintain it. Slow-motion photography being the essence of it, it simply overshadows every other department of this effort except all-rounder performance with almost spontaneous and contagious dancing of Farhan, he has evolved more as an intense actor than the most sensible director he used to be at times. Pavan Malhotra, Divya Datta and Japtej Singh (Childhood) have done full justice to their significant roles and other supporting cast except Milkha's Father (Art Malik) could be forgotten easily. Sonam Kapoor, as usual, couldn't do much of yet another golden opportunity and manages to look comfortable under the skin of 'Biro'- Milkha's first lover. All in all, you can go for it if you are a social person who is supposed to be updated and knows-it-all types and even enjoy it for some part, still it will be audacious to call it a classic or even a must-watch, unless you are the sentimental types relating everything in the cinema to your own life!"

","I was very excited to watch this movie as it has Farhan Akhtar. He has definitely worked hard and done really good acting. But after 15 - 30 min I felt that the movie is slow. It looses the grip and I was bit disappointed. If you compare it with Rang De Basanti ... you will understand what I am saying. Couple of unnecessary songs also make the movie slower. Overall its a good watch, its inspirational. Also everyone has play their rolls nicely. Farhan has picked up Sikh style of dancing very well. He has worked on his body to make look like athlete. But other two with whom Milkha competes are shown bulky (they don't look athletic to me)."
"catchluckie","7","0","1","24 July 2013"," A wonderfully acted good movie. Definitely not the great!
","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year 2013 in Indian Cinema. They had created huge roar around the movie by doing extremely strong online marketing. Milkha Singh is definitely a legend on the Indian Athletics canvas, while he's the only one I had been hearing about from my dad other than PT USHA in women. The Movie has been a delight to watch, much due to the character of Milkha brought alive by Farhan Akhtar. He must now be regarded as one of the best actors (and not a hero) Indian Film industry has produced who can very easily be put in the league of Naseerudin Shah, OM Puri and Nana Patekar. The pain and effort he has taken to showcase the true spirit of Milkha Singh must have made Milkha mesmerized. Movie is relatively a long one even by Bolywood standards, who now has time to watch a 188 mins long movie. Editing was the weakest link of the movie, second to which are the songs. From a movie that involves Prasoon Joshi, such songs were not expected. The character played by Junior Milkha was the second best performance to Farhan's.<br/><br/>At some points, the story line looked like being dragged whenever it was taken on the backdrop of Pakistan. While I understand, making base around to depict story of a legend is important, you may sometimes take way the essence by exaggerating it for too long. The goosebumps which were about to happen were taken away by such long portrayal of the elements connecting movie to the mainstream.<br/><br/>For other actors there wasn't much to do except for the characters played by India's coach of Farhan and team played by Yograj Singh (father of cricketer Yuvraaj Singh) and Divya Dutta (Elder Sister of Milkha) and both of them did justice to their roles. Yograj for once will make you think that was he the real coach during that period when Milkha was made.<br/><br/>Bhag Milkha Bhag is definitely an amazing movie but clearly not the greatest. Farhan did a job way above any actor for the character of Milkha Singh but the movie looked more like an excuse book on legend Milkha citing reasons for all those races he couldn't win. Rising from the ashes was very well shown by Rakeysh but getting to0 deep and to0 long took away the very essence of the biopic based on sportsman's achievement around track & field.<br/><br/>Yes, it didn't give the goosebumps, but movie was beautifully sculptured by the beautiful acts of junior Farhan and FARHAN THE AKHTAR"
"samiransen23","6","0","3","22 July 2013"," Farhan Akhtar too good but story needed polishing
","I am not trying to relate this to Milkha Singh's real life. However, this was an attempt to portray Singh and narrate his life through a motion picture. To preserve the elements of Bollywood and to maintain the ""larger than life"" aspect, a number of unnecessary scenes and characters have been added. The ghee-gulping scene was terrible and could not be accepted. By any stretch of imagination, I did not find it possible for a man to do anything even close to that. Sonam Kapoor came and disappeared. She was not required in the story but as I said, was necessary for the Bollywood ""chatak"". The foreign girl and the sex scene could just not have been a part of the story. Other absurd things keep happening and God knows why IMDb rates the movie so high. Also, the story wasn't very long, and yet, it was stretched to 3hrs and 10mins. I must say that Farhan Akhtar has done an immensely difficult job. He was brilliant from the first scene to the last and i can well imagine the hard work that has gone into each of these scenes. I must say that if you are concerned with the relevance of the film with reality, forget it...you will hardly find any."
"SohamChak","8","0","2","17 July 2013"," Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra just awes with his skills
","He does it again!! Debuting with a flop(Aks), he amazed his audience with the ingenious Rang de Basanti which went on to bag numerous awards. Though it was followed by a crushing disaster Delhi-6, he made up for his blunder with an awe-inspiring Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. What a movie!!<br/><br/>The movie depicts the life of Milkha Singh - how he became the famous ""Flying Sikh"". When the movie started, it reminded me of Paan Singh Tomar but with its progress I went on to a completely different world. A slight editing may not have caused any harm, but the 3 hour long movie with an elegantly simultaneous narrative of the present and past life of Milkha Singh was a pleasure to watch. <br/><br/>No doubt about Farhan Akhtar's credibility. His prodigious hard work was booming throughout the film. But the kid who portrayed Milkha Singh (past) was exceptionally brilliant. Divya Dutta too blossomed after a very long time...probably after Veer Zaara. <br/><br/>Though certain flaws existed in the movie - being an Indian guy of 1956, Milkha would not smooch an Australian woman whom he had just known for a couple of hours OR a person who could not even speak in a normal pitch suddenly starts singing. <br/><br/>But considering the movie as whole, it is worth watching. 7/10 and +1 for the kid's acting."
"rsabnis1","7","0","2","17 July 2013"," Creates a Long-Lasting Impression !!!! Amazing....
","Today's Hindi film industry observes that the movies related on lives of famous personalities, which are termed as biopic are attaining fast recognition and acclaim. Dhulia's Paan Singh Tomar, Luthria's Dirty Picture, Legend of Bhagat Singh and Chak De India are illustrations of such highly acclaimed projects. Considering this ongoing trend, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (Director of Rang De Basanti and Delhi 6) decided to encompass the real-life episodes of the athlete Milkha Singh in this film 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'. The film happens to be a sweeping and stirring biography of Milkha Singh entitled as 'The Flying Sikh' about his uphill struggle, apprehensions and his path towards glory. Three hours and 8 minutes of this Farhan Akhtar starrer keeps u hooked to your seat from commencement to conclusion.<br/><br/>The starting scene of the film is based in 1960 in Rome, Italy showing Olympic sports meet where a sprinter Milkha Singh starts the race being ahead of all but slowly loses speed and agility as the past memories of his childhood begin to haunt him amidst the race dropping him to the fourth position. The main reason for this loss happens to be a shout given by his coach saying 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' which triggers these past memories. This is the point where we know that this athlete has gone through some tough depressing days in his childhood. However, generation of past memories only by mere ushering by his coach for a highly experienced athlete seems very unrealistic.<br/><br/>After the unfortunate loss in Rome, Jawaharlal Nehru announces sports meet between India and Pakistan to be held on the Pakistani land and Milkha refuses to be the part of this meet. The movie goes back a few decades where a child Milkha is seen having his happy time in a village of Punjab until one day, due to India-Pakistan partition, war commences there leading to all his friends and relatives getting massacred with only few survivors. <br/><br/>Milkha comes to Delhi, India in search of his elder sister thereby leading a life of misery and unstoppable agony being a local goon stealing coals from passing-by trains with his local friends falls in love madly with a Punjabi girl (Sonam Kapoor) and decides to transform himself into a gentleman to win her hand for marriage. He joins Indian Army and ends up being an athlete due to his running capabilities and agility. A sprinter running for the Indian army, starts representing his own country India in Olympics, thus fulfilling his own ambition of doing so. The film shows some of his glorious and triumphant moments as a successful sprinter. Some of the episodes in film show his intimate moments with an Australian girl Stella as the film slowly starts unnecessarily deviating from its genre. The film happens to be respectful but unreasonably long. <br/><br/>Farhan gets the golden opportunity to portray one of the most iconic characters hence delivering his most phenomenal performance till today. Right from a sculpted physique, body language to his look, Farhan has extended his capability beyond his limits. Dilip Tahil also delivers a convincing performance as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru while Divya Dutta captures the viewers emotionally.<br/><br/>The music director trio Shankar-Ehsan-Loy captures every beat with mastery uplifting the background score of the film, making the soul of the film more beautiful. Along with some splendid music, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra takes care with his shots, zooming in and using slow-motion to make a body travelling through a finish line. <br/><br/>The film would have been totally flawless should the director have pruned some unnecessary scenes only to have made the film short and sweet. The story oscillates abruptly from Milkha's personal and professional life and also displaying the flashback memories again and again. The race scenes are too much in slow motion but there is sufficient dramatic control by the director and grace in Farhan's acting."
"vipulsshetty","5","0","11","17 July 2013"," A let down
","Milkha Singh had more of an epic life than what it was portrayed. Everything about the movie is Bollywood and the realist in me just couldn't accept a biopic being shown this way. <br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar's Milkha Singh is too innocent with no shades of Grey in him. Even during his fling with the Aussie chick he is shown as very innocent, like he didn't want to do it and did it innocently like he was in love which I an sure he wasn't. Scenes with bandage coming out or races where he would suddenly come from nowhere and win it. It's a 400m race not a 10km marathon. And thank god someone realized that Farhan's body is not of an athlete, his bulky arms would just be an hindrance in his speed.<br/><br/>Anyways I think people liked it because we have very few sporting idols to look up to and the movie tries generating a nationalistic(patriotic) feeling in our minds. Well it's obvious they wanted to generate patriotic feeling when the climax is about beating a third grade Pakistani athlete rather than an epic Olympic race. <br/><br/>Most of the actors are dull. Farhan is lively during his training regimens but he speaks in a Punjabi like a guy from Mumbai who has been sent to Amritsar and is trying to speak to locals. It just doesn't seem natural. His ""ahos"" lack the power which his character needed.<br/><br/>Oh before i forget, the number of unwanted and useless characters in the film just wanted me to get up from my seat and give a tight slap to romp productions, well yeah that was the most funny part of the movie for me, the production house named ROMP.The movie has good music and probably that's the most entertaining part except from the production house named ROMP.<br/><br/>And one last point, being a sports-person I have played under pain a lot of times. But the gruesome injuries which were inflicted on Farhan's Milkha and him breaking the national record and the bandages coming out made me think that I must gave been a pussy that I could barely give 50% forget beating my own best with not even half the injuries that Farhan's Milkha had.<br/><br/>I just wanted to take it off my heart, limbs, my head ache and every single rupee which the movie cost me. <br/><br/>See it if you want to see Bollywood's take on a larger than life sports-person rather than a supreme athlete who had his flaws like the rest of us."
"user-723-798524","7","0","8","17 July 2013"," Inspiring Journey of Milkha but little disappointing in terms of reel.
","I saw this movie yesterday and being biopic, I was expecting the movie to be little lengthy (from usual ones), which it was actually. But I must say there were few scenes and songs which I find no place in the actual plot, So they could have been deleted. Coming to direction, The movie was more of a drama piece than an actual biopic. Starts will loosing the Rome Olympics DRAMATICALLY and ends with sure shot win in Indo pak match. For me climax could have been done better or some other part of Milkha's life should have been made part of climax. The efforts of Farhan as Milkha is worth appreciating. He has done remarkable job. I really liked small Milkha. The small kid , for me, was the hero of the film. He has done great job. Sonam had a small role. She did nice work. I always have problem with her dialog delivery technique. But any ways work of all the actors is remarkable. The songs are well written and pictured, but they should have been cut short from the movie. Overall, movie is one time watch, a little lengthy, inspires for success and could have been a better tribute to the life of Flying Sikh."
"azfar-zaidi142","8","0","2","15 July 2013"," Quite a nice narrative of a legendary journey.
","R. O. Mehta has created an praiseworthy piece of cinema. ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is a wonderful piece of narration of the life of a self-made legend who rises to glory paving his way through tragedy and dismay. Active confrontations only lead to making him a tougher guy, who finally earns the title of ""The Flying Sikh"" from the head of what is called the rival nation, Pakistan. <br/><br/>The movie grabs attention with its quick switches from the past to the present, commenting upon the mental state of Milkha who has been shown to be a witness to a whole lot of eye-protruding sights. The title is derived from his father's last words asking him to run away from the hungry-for-lives murderers created at the time of partition. <br/><br/>Also incorporated in the movie is a traditional-Indian-cinema- requirement, an unrequited love story which thankfully does not overshadow the main theme, although love was responsible for pushing Milkha to quit being a thief. <br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar, a persona that induces inspiration has flaunted an enviable body and wonderful performance, well complemented by Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh, Divya Dutta and others. The technique has been apt to create an awe as well as induce goosebumps in the audience.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a journey of hard work, distractions, resentment, consequent abhorrence, focus and emotions. A medley of all this contributes to making him what he really was...<br/><br/>Well it had an effect on me too- I ran fast as I could to get home after the movie, because I knew my parents were restless to kick my butt off.... ;)"
"silvan-desouza","8","0","2","14 July 2013"," A superb biopic onlything could be shorter
","Rakesh Omprakash Mehra debutted with the flop AKS and redeemed himself with RDB(2006) and then again gave a flop Delhi 6(2009) and now again he comes back with Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. The film also marks the comeback of Farhan Akhtar who was last seen on screen in Zindagi na Milegi Dobara(2011). The film is more talked about being a biopic of Milkha Singh and in that respect it's commendable. The film starts off superbly, the initial scenes between Prakash Raj, Farhan Akhtar are superb, the scenes between Farhan and Pawan Malhotra are fantastic, Also the entire partition angle, Farhan- Divya's reunion is superbly handled. However some things seemed to have been left incomplete, like what happened to Divya's husband, but perhaps it was intentional to keep the focus on the story, however the film does wander in between The film also suffers due to unwarranted length(3 hours 7 minutes) but yet the film keeps you involved, the running scenes are superb while the romantic interludes do seem stretched in between, the songs too sometimes slow the pace but nothing seems out of place.<br/><br/>Direction by ROM is superb Music by SEL is superb, the title song is the best song, while Hawan Karenge is superb too, The songs mostly play in the background but sometimes they do slacken the pace. Camera-work is superb, lot of attention is given to detail and recreating the old 1940-1960 period.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar in a new look lives the part, he is superb he conveys a lot through expressions and portrays the part effectively and he is flawless. This is his most demanding character of the 4-5 film old and he lives up to it, from his hair, body and all he suits the character perfectly Sonam Kapoor in a small role is good in her part, Amongst rest Divya Dutta proves yet again her mettle, she is flawless Master Jabtej Singh as young Milkha is fabulous Yograj Singh(Father of Yuvraj Singh) is fabulous in his role, Pavan Malhotra is simply outstanding and is sure to win laurels Prakash Raj for once in a positive role in a Hindi film does a superb job,though the length of his role is small Rebecca Breeds and Meesha Shafi are okay in their roles Art Malik is adequate, Dalip Tahil as Jawaharlal Nehru isn't too convincing"
