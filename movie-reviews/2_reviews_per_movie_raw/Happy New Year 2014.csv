"shailshah2905","1","33","38","16 November 2014"," This movie is about 6 losers who are trying to loot a bank in Dubai
","I had expected a lot from this movie due to the cast it had and the publicity they did, but I had wasted my money, time and mind when I watched the movie. This movie has awful story. Comedy in the movie is nice. The vfx of the movie were nice, but the story could be made awesome, just due to story I gave the movie just one rating. I was not having a vehicle with me, I went with my family and I had to stay even after intermission. It is a hit just because of the cast and comedy ONLY. I actually had an headache after watching the movie. I don't know where is the old Sharukh who had made hits like Swades, Chak de India etc, where ever he is, I hope he comes back soon. I miss you SRK. :("
"user-72-423002","1","32","37","9 November 2014"," A Very Important Question
","I just have 1 question. In the movie, towards the end, Shah Rukh Khan and Boman Irani enter the Safe(or locker) where the diamonds are kept. The locker gets locked and they exit through the top. My question is why can't they enter through the top considering the fact that they already had the plans for the entire building?<br/><br/>I do not think that the writers envisaged the situation. It would have been pretty simple and slick. This goes on to show that enough thought was not put into the script.<br/><br/>A movie of this budget and the involving the slew of big names cannot overlook such a simple fact.<br/><br/>However, if anybody has any plausible explanation, please reach me at nishith4online@gmail.com."
"Rehan7","1","44","53","14 January 2015"," F***ing grow up already
","This movie depicts everything that is wrong with Indian cinema, in fact it overshadows some of the good work done elsewhere. When the likes of Farah Khan are given more spotlight than Hirwana or Mehra, you realize how far behind the general audience is.<br/><br/>I wonder why SRK does such movies. Is he that cheap now that he does such pieces of crap for money? then you see Irani in this movie, a brilliant actor and you wonder if Farah Khan touched their feet and begged them to do this movie for her.<br/><br/>Plus i think Mr. Bachan just died after watching the younger Bachan, Ashweriya must be thinking after watching this that she was better off marrying a clown. When you can do brilliant movies such as Guru why would you do such a pathetic movie.<br/><br/>All in all i will say, anyone who liked this movie probably has a lower IQ than a chimpanzee.<br/><br/>SO kindly don't watch this crap and please if you like this movie for heaven's sake get a life and grow up."
"chitreshgupta","1","13","14","17 December 2014"," Worst Movie EVER
","Worst Movie I've Ever Seen In my Life. Total Waste Of 3 Hours As well Money. Apart From Boman & SRK All are Do Nothing. It About some looser who become winner. This Movie Is Simply At Its Worst. What happen To Bollywood??? This is awful, Totally awful. No Logic,No Sense, Total carp Dialogues. Music Is Awful, At Some Point it feels like to quit this movie. Can say bad copy of Ocean 11 & Now You See Me. Overrated comedy with no Sense. Some Says its a Masala movie with a ITEM Number But Believe me its a waste.Story Line Is Simply RIPPED. Hats off to Farah Khan to make it more worst. Cant Write More. Do Not Watch it. Disappoint Movie. If You Still Wanna Try This then Go At Your Own Risk. I'm Not a SRK hater Or Salman's Lover. I just Giving My Opinion."
"sanjay-patole","1","33","40","1 January 2015"," Watching a blank wall for 3 hours would be more interesting
","I have given this movie a rating of 1 because there is no choice to rate it as 0. I cannot even waste time evaluating the story because there is none. The film has no class. Farah Khan is a business woman who dishes out sub-standard movies to suit the people who are hard-up for entertainment. This movie would be appealing to people who don't care for a plot, and who get mesmerized with lot of colors and loud music and exceptionally over-acting. Instead of a spoiler alert, I can give you a Farah alert. I would rather watch a B-Grade than this C-Grade movie. Please do not waste your time watching this mindless so-called comedy which would not even appeal to a 10 year old. Farah, please use your money for some better things and leave film making for people who treat this a work of art. Don't waste good actors like Boman, Deepika in your mind-numbingly stupid movies. I will never watch your movie again."
"dax-krishna","1","14","16","12 November 2014"," How? Why!?
","How? Why?! are some of the questions that come to mind when I watched Happy New Year (HNY from hereon). There is a plot, yes, a plot made out of pieces from a lot of Hollywood heist movies that I have watched and loved. And there's a lot of Shahrukh Khan; not his acting mind you, his acting part of the brain seems to have turned off the moment Farah Khan said, ""Action!"" in every scene he's in and he turns wooden.<br/><br/>Also, did you really have to have a throwback to every movie SRK was in before HNY to make this thing click? The premise was outrageous. The acting was bad and emulative of Hollywoood counterparts that you find in the movies this copied from. And contrary to everybody's opinion, the only thing I liked about this movie was Abhishek's acting (except for his snake dance!); for me, it was his facial expressions and his comedic timing actually worked!<br/><br/>All in all, a failed attempt which still made millions in spite of its flaws (a lot of them!), bad acting, and bad casting!!<br/><br/>One last thing - MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD - if Sonu Sood's character is capable of blasting a perfect, round hole on top of the vault, couldn't they have just gotten through there? As far as I know the ""laser wall"" only stops people from getting to the vault. Once you get to the vault, you need to know the exact ""turns"" (don't forget your stethoscopes!!) to get into it. But once you get in, it's all yours! So, why not just blast a hole on top of the vault and get the diamonds since nothing actually seems to be protecting the vault after all these hurdles!? Just my thought, although I may have missed something about this in my viewing because I had to turn my brains off after about five minutes into the film."
"smuhar","Null","23","30","28 December 2014"," Worst Movie Ever Made
","This is one of the worst movies ever to come out of Bollywood. Just because it made lots of money does not mean that it is a good movie. Most of the money was made due to huge sums of money spent on marketing and shows prior to the release of the movie. Farah Khan and Sajid Khan have the copyrights to make the worst movies in the industry. The story line of this movie is flawed. Why do they always have to characters which are bumbling, drunk, part deaf, have seizures and don't even speak properly. Jackie Shroff (Charan Grover) needed to be robbed, as he was so foolish that he couldn't even recognize Nandu as his son's double. The songs were too many, movie could easily have been cut short by at least 45 minutes. Poor direction and acting. Boman Irani otherwise such a good actor, lost on count of poor script. Vivan Shah was miscast in the movie. I don't think there is negative stars given for any movie, but to this one I give -10 stars. I am so glad did not watch this movie in the theaters."

","Honestly after watching this movie, one thing that struck my mind was - Since when Bollywood audience have become so dumb/stupid/senseless that they really want to watch any kind of crap these stupid film makers throw at them. <br/><br/>Illogical script mixed with senseless Farah's love towards the incapable Shahrukh coupled with 3 hr duration makes the experience too painful to handle.

"rikeshkamra97","1","25","36","9 November 2014"," Movie was boring
","Not even story, no punches, no acting and none dance except one (manwa laage) rest everything sucked in movie. SRK's eight pack is sure shot graphics and can't be done at all, it is either graphics or some implants. The Jodi of Farah khan and SRK is back but sadly nothing magical came out of it as to from their previous movies like Mai Hu Na. Unnecessary use of dialogues from older movies which were just not necessary. And did'nt understood how these bunch of non-dancers won the final, it was well understood that on humanitarian grounds they were let into finals then how did the emerged as winner at the end. SRK looks just older for the roles he is picking. But for now SEE THE MOVIE ON YOUR OWN RISK!!"
"chantuaurbantu","1","118","199","24 October 2014"," AWFUL!! what did i just watch?? (cringe)
","What kind of crap does bollywood make these days.. SRK being such a known actor, how does he do such movies.. <br/><br/>There is no flow to the movie. It's just random collections of scenes and dances put together. Story seems to be written by some baboon. More than the movie itself, I'm worried about Indian people who are actually running to the theatre for this crap. I don't know what they're thinking. Songs are okay as well. Acting is over the top. Entire movie is over the top. Heist is stupid. Comedy is slapstick. Edittors did a very bad job. 3 hours was pain. <br/><br/>In short, there was not a single thing that was good in this movie. Please donate your money to some poor chap. <br/><br/>One word to describe this movie: ""CRINGE"""
"karthikr2001","1","129","229","24 October 2014"," A poor attempt at creating entertainment
","Farah Khan lives up to to her abilities - which is non-existent. Her love for Sharukh Khan has again resulted in a movie that lacks a script at all, and something which she claims to be entertainment. Her love for melodrama and songs, has resulted in yet another disaster called Happy New Year. As she and her like minded directors always do - this movie is high on color and glamor, but has a poor script and dwells on low quality humor. Its the kind of humor which probably a low IQ person would only appreciate. Its a waste of money watching this movie. Please go and spend money on other movies. A consistent feature in such kind of movies is the minimal importance given to female actors. Deepika Padukone plays a dumb damsel in distress. I wonder why a female director would like to portray a female actor in such a light. Such stereotypical projections can only go against he case for women equality in the country. Farah please stick to choreography!"
"ejazz316","1","12","17","5 December 2014"," Strictly don't watch
","I recently watched Hollywood movies like Intersteller, Gravity and Dawn of the planet of the apes. The movies were awesome. Really, hats off to the special effects team. And I watched bollywood movies like Happy new year, Main tera hero, Humpty Sharma ki dulhania, Happy ending and to name a few. Those were totally bad. Nowadays, bollywood movies are losing their popularity because there is no story at all. There is no creativity, nothing. They are making movies just for time pass. If I have spent 100rs for a movie, then I expect a good story . Happy New Year is a muddled mess which has its own warm moments but as a package fails to work. Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline. Farah Khan has redeemed Tees Maar Khan but Happy New Year is her most mediocre work. I am going with 0.5/10."
"davoo94","1","39","68","26 October 2014"," horrible movie
","I have experienced pain in several forms. I have seen amateur attempts at movie making . I have watched fine art films like Gunda. I appreciate tongue in cheek humor. But this movie is just a bad movie. Period. It is not a movie that one would describe as 'so bad that it is good'. No this is terrible. This is a terrible movie. I did not find it to be humorous - At ALL. I honestly do not know why this movie was made. Notable issues include- The attempt to poke humor at Saroj Khan during one of the dance sequences is terrible. <br/><br/>God Save Bollywood!<br/><br/>Once again Farah khan have failed to entertain, Even Tees Maar Khan was better than this. Basically, the philosophy of the film is vague and in line of the escapist Bollywood cinema. And, we are not even talking about logic yet. A brainless comedy which fails to entertain. Don't go if you value your money and time, but once again i am giving advice to people who loves movies like kick, chennai express, jab tak hai jaan etc and many other craps released throughout the year.Happy New Year is a muddled mess which has its own warm moments but as a package fails to work.<br/><br/>Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline.

"hitman2986","3","12","18","17 November 2014"," Disappointing to the Core
","Frankly, I had no expectations from this movie. Considering the track record of Farah Khan movies , it is better not to keep any .Sometimes you might get surprised if the movie turns out good.<br/><br/>Well, this movie turns out to be damn squib. The plot hardly keeps you engaged. The antics of the cast just irritates you. Abhishek Bachchan is watchable though. Rest of them just bore you. A bad choice this one for Deepika Padukone.<br/><br/>The music is disappointing surprisingly from Vishal-Shekhar. The songs are below average.<br/><br/>Final verdict- Totally miss-able.Watch it only if you have lots of spare time."
"ayanpal1","7","63","122","25 October 2014"," Not Crappy, Will Make You Feel Happy!
","Happy New Year is a 'fultoo masala entertainer' that does not pretend to be anything else. The story is essentially about Charlie, played by Shah Rukh Khan and his 'angels' who plan to pull off the worlds biggest heist. But here's a catch - by participating in the world's biggest Dance Competition.<br/><br/>What makes the movie tick is Farah Khan and her constant references/ode to Bollywood films. Be it Shah Rukh repeating (albeit with a twist) dialogues of his blockbuster films, or Abhishek's vomit inducing yet rib tickling performance (a dauntless double role), she hits the nail on the head. Deepika Padukone as the Dance Instructor Mohini, whose heart beats for the English speaking Khan is splendid as is her dancing! Boman Irani as a middle aged Parsi chick magnet is funny, Sonu Sood as a slightly deaf bomb specialist lights up the screen with his style of muscular action, and Vivaan Shah as the Hacker shows promise. Jackie Shroff as the master villain and Anupam Kher in an emotional appearance bring in the seriousness that is required.<br/><br/>There are a host of special appearances that light up the screen as does the spectacular cinematography. My favorites being Prabhu Deva, Sajid Khan, Anurag Kashyap-Vishal, and the hilarious Kiku Sharda doing a Saroj Khan and the lookalike of Narendra Modi. Malaika Arora Khan, Dino Morea, and Geeta Kapoor playing themselves add to the recall value.<br/><br/>That the movie is thankfully not a copy paste and merely references other films, in the process charting its own unpredictable course, is sure to light up your face as it does the screen. This being a dance film, the choreography by Farah and Geeta is actually damn good! Especially the sequences that bring out the terrible dancing of the actors. The heist portions are in comparison slick and stylized, and thankfully explained in minute detail.<br/><br/>What transpires is more due to luck than planning, and sometimes highly improbable. But the lack of logic and reason is mostly overshadowed by the antics of the stars who try to utilize the situation to the fullest, and turn it to their advantage! At almost three hours, the movie could have been shorter, the music more melodious (save for 'Manwa Lage' - a soothing ditty and the hilarious 'Nonsense Ki Night'), and the explanations not as repetitive at times. But then no one said this movie was perfect! However what it is indeed, is a perfect entertainer for those seeking to have a good time and their money's worth at the theaters.<br/><br/>Recommended for the Manmohan Desai fans who like the zany Farah Khan brand of Bollywood that's more for the masses than the classes. It has stars oozing appeal (read SRK, Deepika, and Abhishek) and can truly turn a dull boring weekend into a fun theater experience.<br/><br/>In short - a movie that could have been crappy, but instead manages to make the viewers happy! A must watch for those who like their movies dished Bollywood style and of course for fans of Shah Rukh who with an 8 pack really does reinvent himself physically at this age while doing everything else as only he can.<br/><br/>P.S: Viewer discretion required. Be prepared to omit (some scenes) if you don't want to vomit (your popcorn)."
"famworkers9","1","10","15","9 November 2014"," A story of robbery.............
","A funny film.Commercial but completely meaningless film. Sort of ""Khichdi"" type film. More over the songs and SRK's fame saved the film. I just liked Boman's Acting. All the crew did their best. But I don't think making a script less film with big crew and cast with 1.5 crore can ever make change in Bollywood. But good come back of the crew. watching as an audience in theater would not be that bad. But the synchronization could be better. A masala khichdi. A spicy non-arranged film just for family fun. But is this 'Bikhra' film based on robbery is perfect as a family film?. The promo said that. However, I can't understand why the fire in SRK's shirt didn't burn him....He is not Johnny Storm right????? So some sequences could be arranged perfectly........................................."

","What has happened to Bollywood? Directors such as Farah Khan bank on the star power of SRK/Deepika and other stars to earn rs300cr+ at the BO and what they deliver in return is a shitty/crappy/non sense/unfunny movie filled with slapstick humor, gay jokes, mediocre acting, ABS, and no logic whatsoever. I love to watch movie and I am myself a great fan of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Manmohan Desai, their movies may not be completely logical but were entertaining and had emotions. But the joke is current directors are making high budget crappy movies with bland humor mentioning that its an inspiration to iconic directors of the past and making loads of money at the BO. <br/><br/>I am sure HNY will be the highest grossing movie ever and Farah Khan will be one of the best director in Bollywood history, but me as an audience is left completely disappointed and cheated. <br/><br/>HNY is the best heist movie ever since it is going the rob the Indian audience of their hard earned money in the name of entertainment."

","Even though the trailer was awful, I still went ahead and saw it on the first day thinking ""hey, after all it's Shah Rukh Khan. How disappointing can it be?"" Turns out it was worse than I thought! An absolute rubbish movie with ridiculous accents and age old ""famous"" dialogues of Mr. SRK. In the first 15 minutes I wanted to get up and leave, but thought just like you can't judge a book by it's cover, why should I judge a whole movie based on the beginning of it? After all, I've seen many Hindi movies which start badly. But within a few minutes get interesting. Like I said before, it was horrible. A thoroughly disappointing flick. Abhishek Bachchan is the only one who came remotely close to being funny. Other than him there's no one I can praise, least of all the story writer. Made on a budget of 150 crores, the movie keeps on showing sponsors as the brands keep on displaying. A 3 hour movie, that too a bad one, seemed like I was watching it forever! I had a headache when I left the theatre (Not exaggerating). <br/><br/>Bottom line:<br/><br/>A total waste of time and money. Give it a miss. You can thank me later."

","Indians films are quite similar and familiar.Happy new year is fine for Indian audiences who don't take films completely logically. Somewhat the plot is similar to the Hollywood films Oceans Eleven and Italian Job. Anyhow when it comes to rating, 6 or 7 out of 10 is an average rating. Casting was good and so were the locations of shooting. But nothing was so special about this film. Since its and bank robbery film it is entertaining. As for me this film was fine and some of the overrated scenes were predictable, such as the winning of the dance competition finals. Those who are reading this review it is complete fine for them to watch the film if they are fans of Shah Rukh Khan or like Indian type of common films. Well all the Shah Rukh Khan fans wont be disappointed after the film. Some scenes are very overly acted. The fight scenes broke all the laws of physics but was in a comedy sequence. But as for the robbery part everything was practical enough for me. Anyhow this family entertainer will make a blast at the box office."

","Main Hoona Na and Om Shanti Om (both the films directed by Farah Khan) are considered one of the most entertaining bollywood films. And after Farah's Tees Maar Khan's debacle, she is back with her new outing HAPPY NEW YEAR which was supposed to be made in 2005 but was later shelved! Will it be SRK's another Ra.one or will it be into the lists of the most entertaining films?<br/><br/>Charlie(ShahRukh Khan) is planning to rob some diamonds from Charan Grover(Jackie Shroff) for a specific reason(Watch the movie and you will get to know) with help of his 5 friends. But to rob him he has to take part in World Dance Championship! The plot looks so simple and you might be thinking such a simple plot but a very long film? Well apart from the plot the movie has many other things to offer!<br/><br/>Farah Khan has directed a heist film without any blood and gore or love making scene, which is in itself an achievement, because family audiences were looking for such a film with GREAT production values for a very long time! I guess last one was...Ah! Very few! And I should say a film doesn't need a kissing scene to make it impressive for the youth because I am 18 and I watch movies with my family! I didn't need to look down for any scene in the film! I didn't hear a single word of disgust from my parent like 'Is that what you surf or watch on Internet'. I applaud Farah for that.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, ShahRukh Khan rocks in the film! His dialogue delivery, especially during the emotional moments is fantastic! Deepika Padukone as Mohini has done a good job as a bar dancer cum dancer teacher cum a WINNER! Yes, a WINNER! Boman Irani, Sonu Sood and Abhishek Bachchan all of them are brilliant. Special mention to Vivaan Shah as Rohan, has done a cool job as a hacker but needs a bit grooming though a good talent found.<br/><br/>Music by Vishal-Shekhar will grow inside you and grows to max after watching the movie. India-Waale and Manwa-laage already topping the charts, I think Satakli will grow slowly within the people. My pick of the lot is Satakli and Manwa-Laage.<br/><br/>Despite usual clichés, HAPPY NEW YEAR excels as a film! With great production values, heart warming moments, good Music, good story, good direction, this is a film Audience(especially families) were looking for and Here it is. Happy New year is a fun watch! Recommended!<br/><br/>P.S- I don't care how the story was or whatever. After watching the depressing Haider(A great movie), I really needed a mind refreshing film with wholesome entertainment! And yes I got it. So if giving it 8 stars to 10 stars is a crime, then yes I am a Criminal!"

"retour747","1","38","78","24 October 2014"," An amateurish attempt by some of the veterans of Bollywood
","One of the most amateurishly made big budget movies from Bollywood. The film makers spent close to an hour or so on introducing various characters and building the story up. Even a sleek 90-120 minutes film would manage to have a few holes so imagine devoting an hour to this introduction and story build up exercise would have how many holes. Let's examine the first hour: <br/><br/>a) SRK is wrestling. May be Farah was inspired by how Sajid introduced Ajay Devgan in Himmatwala. SRK has been paid to lose the fight, however (surprise surprise) he wins the fight. Not to mention that the entire fight sequence induces a big yawn and it has nothing that you haven't seen before. In this sequence SRK looked like one of the martial arts teachers in old Jackie Chan films. Note the film has just started. <br/><br/>b) Sood is a bomb expert who now provides services to films. As you would expect, he messes up a shot and gets fired in another ""yawn"" inducing sequence. Sood has problems in listening to people just 2-3 feet away, however he can listen to SRK clearly even when SRK is several feet away. Some would call it cinematic convenience. You feel for Sood here as he is one of the actors who looks to give his best in the films he works in. <br/><br/>c) Boman speaks in a weird version of Parsi accent. He plays a 50 years old whose mother reminds him to keep clean and visit the washroom before going to bed. How many of us would find such sequences interesting? May be the 12 years old and younger crowd. Appears as if Boman played this role in this way to seek vendetta on the film makers. But what about the audience, Boman? <br/><br/>d) A hacker who has tons of Facebook friends but no real friends. In his intro, he hacks the DJ system to vent his frustrations and is thrown out of the club. And this paves way to another fight sequence with scenes that are supposed to make you laugh but instead forces your head to shake in disagreement at the poor attempt. Another great piece of entertainment? <br/><br/>e) In the interest of brevity, I am skipping the other intros. <br/><br/>And then there is babble about how to steal the diamonds to take revenge. The most interesting part in the first hour was when the classic ""Mera Pyar Shalimar"" song was played in the background. That took me back to some happy memories about some of the classic songs from that film including ""Hum Bewafa"", ""1-2-Cha-Cha-Cha"", etc. Re- visiting ""Shalimar"" would have been a better idea. Is there a point in describing the rest of the film?<br/><br/>There are better ways to rehash old Hollywood and Bollywood movies. Even the TV series which have much less budget devoted to them appear to be more intelligently and professionally made. For most parts, one would wonder what drove these people to make such a film. <br/><br/>Audience ke chakke chudade yeh Happy New Year wale! Farah and SRK probably believe that people like the jokes they make at various award shows. Award shows have songs and dances too. Let's mix those and people are going to jump to see the film like how hungry dolphins would jump out of water to grab food! <br/><br/>May be a film about revenge on Red Chilies Entertainment, along with Team Farah and Sajid, would have been a better idea. SRK hasn't had a truly magnificent film after 2007. He should sincerely thank his fans for keeping his boat floating since then. <br/><br/>In the recent past, Bollywood film lovers have flocked in to cinemas based on star appeal. And the result has been a constant bombardment of such films in the name of ""paise vasool"" entertainment. Whether people like the film or not, the money spent on tickets will count towards its revenues. The film-makers will happily claim an INR 100+ crores film. And the cycle continues. We have only ourselves to blame for encouraging such attempts and the stagnation of creativity and innovation in Bollywood. <br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>PS A rough guide to rating a film objectively:<br/><br/>1 to 2 stars: Only one-third or less of the film is watchable.

It is that simple. I obviously love the clichés so therefore, ten out of ten. Amazing songs and storyline wasn't so bad. Choppy at times and slow at points. The character build took a little long but was necessary. The jokes were hilarious. Each character had good jokes and then as a whole there were a lot more.

","Heist thriller in Hindi cinema? What it would be and how it would be? These questions will be prompted in our minds, when we're about to watch happy new year. Generally, Hindi cinema is not popular for its heist thriller films, however, the trend had started to take off from don 2, another srk film which was released in 2011 (nearly Christmas). Even i was stunned by the choreography of that heist in don 2. After the release of don 2, people have waiting for another heist treat and luckily they got it from the film, happy new year. Even though don 2 excelled in its brilliant heist execution, it's now exceeded by happy new year for its splendid and jaw dropping presentation of heist. Usually in heist movies expecting funny moments, romantic scenes, friendship celebrations, marvelous songs are very rare, or to be more precise those elements are labeled as impossible at all. In happy new year, as an audience we can expect every element and thus can enjoy a good masala film altogether. Honestly, happy new year excels at everything, even in some small scenes. OK lets' have a brief look under this film. Happy new year explains the story of how Charlie and his team try to loot priceless diamond pieces from a highly secured vault, which is only to take revenge from the bad guy. Story sounds too different and too impressive, right? That's the initial notable point in this film. Then songs; wow what a songs and music; hats off to he musical team as well as dance choreography team. I don't want to spoil the film by revealing everything of the characters and their sublime performances, so go and have a real original cinematic experience by watching it in cinemas. People, now a days, tend to watch two or two and half hour films. Perhaps they might be thinking that would be perfect and wouldn't let them boring. But happy new year may not stand up for the expectations of these kind of people. though it takes approximately three hour time length, it has all the ingredients to spice up the seat edginess of audience for that time period, and i assure that no one will get bored throughout the entire film. Guys Happy new year is like a tasteful recipe, which has mixed up with all necessary element needed to fulfill the satisfaction of audience at any cost. Go for it and have a ball. In conclusion i would like to say that, don't miss this jaw dropping and stunning film for any reason.<br/><br/>Have fun........<br/><br/>My rating - 9/10"

It is so awful if I am writing down all night how awful is Everything.The Shahruhk Team go to WDC world dance champion You have any idea how awesome the dancer are in the tournament and they have no chance to win the Tournament but you know bollywood Don,t waste your 3 hour to watch this crap spend this hour in something useful. I am Regret that I watch this awful film and waste my time you have chance don,t ever go near that film if you have little sense What happen to bollywood they making worse and worse.

"CandidPerspectives","10","27","54","25 October 2014"," Just the right touch
","If I'm being perfectly honest - I initially agreed to watch this movie mainly for the sake of making my parents happy. Having watched the trailer beforehand, this movie seemed like another Dhoom 3, another make of pure ""entertainment"" value. Might as well go along for the family movie outing and put my brain to sleep. Or so I thought. <br/><br/>Much to my surprise, I walked out of the cinema feeling absolutely delighted, as though I'd been taken on the journey with Charlie (Shah Rukh Khan) himself. There's no denying that this is a movie filled with the usual clichés, cheesy music, and somewhat anticipated triumph of good over evil. However, what distinguishes Happy New Year, in my mind, its heart warming execution. In the midst of the colourful songs and dramatic scenes, Farah Khan has created a movie that so innocuously captures the audience's emotions. Happy New Year is a film that subtly touches on the realities of Indian society - the perception we have of call girls who make a living by 'losing their respect' in society; the dismissive stance we take towards the low-class/nerdy/hopeless ""losers""; and the struggle of innocent individuals against the web of corruption and manipulation. All of this beautifully set against the backdrop of a dance competition. The fun-loving, relentlessly aspiring, truly Indian nature of the dance team just leaves you bursting with patriotism for Team India. <br/><br/>Without a doubt, Happy New Year is a film that will resonate well with the audience. A well-portrayed story of 6 'losers' who battle fate, and a must-watch for this Diwali season."

"jen-122-636160","10","29","61","25 October 2014"," Flawless
","Farah Khan made a flawless movie. Every single bit of this entertainer is perfect. It's an entertainer. Not a deep movie. And it entertains extremely well.<br/><br/>1st SRK - Farah directs him wonderfully. There are no cringe worthy moments in this film. She gives us the gratuitous shots of SRK early on and 1 ups herself from the Darr de Disco sequence in Om Shanti Om. And once again it was hysterically funny, provided for character development and was superb eye candy all at the same time. This was a wonderful role for SRK.<br/><br/>Abhishek - Farah uses his talents perfectly. And I mean perfectly! Wow! Double role! The guy is a chameleon and completely inhabits every role he plays. Put him in a new costume and he is that new person. He is a superb actor and was wonderful and watching him play off SRK was delightful.<br/><br/>Deepika - This is one of the best performances I've seen from her. She is a fabulous actress, but this role required a surprising emotional depth from her and Farah was able to get that and capture that wonderfully.<br/><br/>Boman Irani - I love the role she wrote for him. He played it perfectly and, again Farah nailed it both in terms of direction, actor choice and - well everything.<br/><br/>Sonu Sood - His job is action star eye candy. He gets type cast a lot. Still - he was wonderful in it. At some point I would like to see him given a meatier role as he is capable of so much more than just being eye candy. But again, hats off to Farah for exploiting the eye candy thing within the movie itself.<br/><br/>Jackie Shroff - he's perfect in his role. I love watching him act. He's great. <br/><br/>Vivaan Shah - youngest of our crew - I was not familiar with him before. He was good and delivered the performance he was supposed to (he's more of a supporting role and given the high octane actors who was playing with in ensemble, he got a bit lost - but I don't think that's Farah's fault. He had plenty of scenes where he was the scene and he played them extremely well.<br/><br/>Choreography. I love Farah's choreography. I love that she got Prabhudeva to do a cameo & the entire gotta dance montage was beautiful! The final dance sequence was amazing and left me wishing I had been rich enough to fly to one of the cities to see these people perform it live on stage during the slam tour. Realized I am going to go to my grave regretting that I didn't.<br/><br/>Action sequences - Sonu Sood's early battle is fabulous. I'm curious to know why steam was coming out of only one ear. But this scene took every Hindi battle sequence ever made where our hero is surrounded, and put it up a notch. It was funny, it was cool, it was sexy - I love Farah! How she got the shirt off Sonu was really really funny. I like that she is able to deliver everything we want in a movie with grace, humor and in a way that forwards character development - for the entire ensemble! <br/><br/>I can't believe she did used Kung Fu Fighting at one point (the song) but I loved the way she borrowed from the ending of Don (with SRK) for this sequence - especially since she had Boman in an onlooker role for the sequence. It was funny and scary and beautifully shot and the Jackie Chan sequence with the table that the borrowed was again, beautifully done.<br/><br/>They say the best artists know who to steal from. Farah does. And with movies, it's not what you steal, it's how you steal it and make it your own. Farah is a MASTER! She is even at the point where she can steal from herself (with the ballroom sequence from Om Shanti Om - which is nothing like that except that she steals the music and the rotation - and has Deepika and SRK in the center of everything).<br/><br/>This was a flawless movie. Everything about it was perfect. It was hysterically funny, well made, a fabulous ensemble and I left the movie positively giddy. I haven't felt this way coming out of a movie since I saw Streets of Fire when I was a teen. Well done Farah! Thank you for making this movie."

The team has misunderstood the phrase ""entertainment movie"" to be a sequence of outdated jokes bridged with dance sequences. <br/><br/>Though packed with quality actors, pathetic screenplay has ruined the movie. HNY is a typical evidence of poor screenplay and direction complimented with uninteresting jokes . Even Sharukh's ""signature"" dialogs could not help in the movie's rescue. The movie at one point becomes boring due to its predictability and lack of any degree of creativity.<br/><br/>I had taken my family with a hope of Sharukh in the lead role. We did witness few audiences exiting the screens in the middle of the movie. Please do pick the movie-to-watch based on directors and not actors. Or At least wait for the review before you book the tickets.<br/><br/>With marketing and international reach of movies like this, I am worried if the international audience would look down on Indian cinemas and build a wrong perception. Hope quality movies like Swades, Lagaan, Lunch Box. with original story and screenplay too has a good reach."

"jeanne-161-327035","9","20","41","26 October 2014"," Funny and light
","I've only written one other review on IMDb but with the negative reviews I felt compelled to write this in the hope to shed some light. <br/><br/>I have the feeling that for the negative reviewers, perhaps they were expecting something other than what was delivered. Although, the giveaway for me was that Boman Irani is in this movie. So, I did expect a comedic element. <br/><br/>But the confusion may be when you add Abhishek Bachchan and Sonu Sood to the mix. I've only seen Bachchan play ""take no prisoners"" macho roles and I suspect that those are the roles the Sood typically are in also. So if you are a fan of those two actors, then expect that for Happy New Year, they are in roles that are comedic and more of a slapstick nature. Although Sood still does has a ""take no prisoners"" role.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed this film. I discovered Shahrukh Khan and Aamir Khan a few years back and have seen every film of theirs that I could get my hands on. (I know, they would probably cringe if they knew someone had used both of their names in the same sentence.) Because of their films, I have come to really enjoy Bollywood flicks. Shahrukh Khan was the draw for me in this film. Although I was happy to see the above-mentioned actors in it too.<br/><br/>I had no expectations going into the movie other than to be entertained. If you are looking for a serious crime drama then change your expectations for this film. It does have a serious undertone but it is delivered in a lighthearted way. Yes, it is like Ocean's Eleven but with a lot of zaniness. But because of the 3 hour window, it takes time to spell out the motivation behind the caper. So I say, change your expectations and simply lighten up and enjoy a good laugh. Please don't expect a deep movie. And expect your favorite actor to be playing a part outside of their typical role. I went with two other ladies and we each enjoyed this movie thoroughly."

","This film is just awful... awful. What has happened to Bollywood? I struggled through just over 30 minutes of this. After which I just had to switch it off. What was so bad you're wondering?<br/><br/>The movie starts with an unrealistic firework display (Bollywood CGI at work), followed by an even more unrealistic fight scene where SRK was paid to take a dive but 'lost control' when the opposing fighter called his dad a thief. <br/><br/>This is followed by Jackie Sheroff with the most unconvincing accent giving a press statement. Apparently this press statement is the right time for SRK to start building his team and putting his 'plan' in to motion. <br/><br/>His team is a deaf guy who loves showing off his six pack and gets 'upset' when anyone says anything about his mother; a computer hacker who can't make it with the ladies and an old guy who has ladies falling over themselves but lives with his mum.<br/><br/>Boman Irani's comedy... if it can be called comedy... is cringe- worthy. I mean its really bad. And not forgetting the worst performance by far was Abhishek Buchchan. Let's just say the apple has fallen very far from the tree. <br/><br/>I don't know if Deepika was any good because I didn't get that far in. <br/><br/>I have to ask what was Shahrukh Khan thinking? What I find even more unbelievable is that this nonsense is the most expensive Bollywood movie to be made? <br/><br/>If IMDb would allow I would give this a minus rating.

","Happy New Year exists for one purpose — to entertain. And Farah Khan, inheritor of the Manmohan Desai mantle, has proved that she is more than capable of giving us a good time. But in Happy New Year, the desire to entertain overshadows everything else — script, characters, coherence, narrative logic. The result is a 179-minute film that simply beats you into submission. It is frantic, noisy, gaudy and, largely, joyless. Farah takes the framework of the traditional heist movie and bungs in revenge, melodrama, comedy, romance, countless dazzling dance sequences and, as a climactic flourish, a dose of patriotism.You should watch this movie at least once.

The good thing is that there is a plot in the movie....M not saying that the plot was good but the existence of the plot only makes this movie better then Tees Maar Khan and Chennai Express........But Farha Khan has concentrated on too much things...... It cant be said as revenge drama because the villain is never aware of what our hero want to do....Neither its a thief movie because the heist process was not intelligent.....And lastly its not a dance movie because up to the end of the movie our heroes are not good dancer and only god knows how they won the world dance competition that also when the movie is bring directed by a choreographer........ Cant explain all the illogical things because there are too many,,,,but then again i was not expecting logic in this movie.... Half of the movie is filled with the dialogs of old SRK movies ,, don't know for how many more years SRK and SaLMAAN will get tribute in there own movies.......M really tiered of this.... There are emotional melodrama in between the movie along with the emotional back stories and some patriotism also,,,,which doesn't suited the movie at all....If a movie from very start of it want it not to be taken seriously then why bother putting such serious scenes..... Apart from the bad things there are some good moments in the movies which will crack your funny bones....The best one was Abhishek Bachan undressing himself..... Among all the actors its Junior B who stills the show....every single time he was on the screen he will defiantly make u laugh....The only character in the movie who is not wasted.....He has brilliant comic timing..... Nothing i want to say for any other actor because neither of them gives lasting impression along with SRK who just did the same thing what he always does in comedy movies.....Haven't been given much scope...There are many scenes which could have easily been deleted like the action sequence with Korean captain and the Satakli song.....Movies could have been 20-25 min less if editors would have not been sleeping while editing......So beware of its 2hr 58min length....So if u r SRK fan i know u will definitely gonna watch this but this my MSG to all Junior Bachan fans(i know they are very few on number) u should definitely watch this.....<br/><br/>M going for 5.9/10......by ANuP APu KuMaR..."

","I was entertained throughout the film. Great acting by SRK, Deepika Padukone, Boman Irani, Sonu Sood, and Vivaan Shah. I never really liked Abhishek Bachan that much but he was good as Nandu in this movie. I loved the comedy in this movie and I was laughing for most of it. Jackie Shroff was decent as the villain. The songs were also great. Farah Khan has made another good film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.<br/><br/>Happy New Year is a stupid movie full of crude humor, but that doesn't mean it's bad. This is a very fun and enjoyable movie. If you are expecting a film as serious as Talaash, don't watch Happy New Year as you may find the humor terrible. There are scenes where the comedy doesn't work and nothing of interest is happening. And when the movie asks you to take it seriously, you just don't because the rest of the movie is full of jokes. But if you like funny family friendly movies, watch Happy New Year because it is solid entertainment.<br/><br/>From A+ to F, Happy New Year gets a B-."

"DareDevilKid","8","15","30","28 October 2014"," The Great Diwali Blast
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.8/5 stars<br/><br/>""Happy New Year"" is a typical Bollywood mass entertainer, the likes of which can only be made by Bollywood. It bears the term ""Indiawaale"" in its tagline and rightly so, because it's a film meant for Indians to enjoy and indulge in. Only someone who has grown up on a healthy dosage of Bollywood films, can appreciate and even be thoroughly entertained by ""Happy New Year"".<br/><br/>It's quintessential masala fare to its core, and proves that masala films can be entertaining without defying logic. In fact, the fact that the film has a decent plot and a narrative style that holds true for most parts of its 3-hour length, actually makes it way more entertaining that many other similar efforts that have bastardized the Bollywood-born masala genre in recent times – a la ""Kick"", ""Rowdy Rathore"", ""Singham"", ""Bodyguard"", ""Ek Tha Tiger"", and many more. So wholesome is ""Happy New Year's"" entertainment quotient that it actually evokes nostalgia of some of the best masala entertainers from a bygone era of Bollywood such as ""Amar Akbar Anthony"", ""Hum Kisise Kum Nahi"", ""Yaadon ki Baaraat"", and ""Namak Halal"" – the kind specialized by Directors like Nasir Hussain, Manmohan Desai, and Prakash Mehra, which says a lot of the improvement displayed by Farah Khan.<br/><br/>Though the film has its dull moments, logical loopholes, and narrative flaws – which was to be expected from a Farah Khan film – they are few and far between a script that's for the most part riddled with laugh-out-loud funny moments and a well-planned heist – the heist is surprisingly well-executed and is actually the highlight of the movie. Besides this, the script checks all the boxes that make for a good Bollywood masala movie: revenge, friendship, underdogs, romance, comedy, fights, dances, multiple costume changes, foreign locations, and a happy ending. The premise itself is a recipe for no-holds- barred fun. Charlie (Shah Rukh Khan) wants to avenge diamond baron Charan Grover (Jackie Shroff) who framed his father on a robbery charge some eight years ago. He plans to do this by robbing a safe that is placed many feet below the World Dance Championships stage in Dubai. In order to successfully pull off this heist, he enlists a Parsi safe cracker with an epilepsy condition (Boman Irani), a hearing-impaired bomb expert (Sonu Sood), a drunk with a vomiting problem (Abhishek Bachchan), and a geeky computer hacker (Vivaan Shah). All these men have two left feet. So in order to make their entry into the dance event plausible, he ropes in bar dancer (Deepika Padukone) to choreograph their moves.<br/><br/>The performances also blend seamlessly with the proceedings on screen with each other portraying their roles as required.Shahrukh as expected carries the film almost inconspicuously on his shoulders, but he's ably supported by Boman, Abhishek, and Deepika. Abhishek and Deepika literally walk away with some of the scenes, that too in the presence of the mighty Khan, which also speaks volumes of the camaraderie of the cast and in particular of the shrewdness of Khan as a producer, knowing full well that an ensemble cast only clicks when each actor is given prominence (wish some other superstars in the industry would also realize this). Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah also play their parts effectively.<br/><br/>But the biggest surprise package is Farah Khan, and the level of maturity she displays at handling a film of this magnitude. ""Happy New Year"" is that masala film with strong repeat value Bollywood fans have been waiting for ages – denied by myriad imposters out to deceive audiences. Go for it this Diwali, take your friends and family along, then go for it again, and have a gala time at the movies."

","Once again SRK-Farah duo proved that when they combine,a BLOCKBUSTER is produced. Rightly so! Though the movie may lack the script but the exotic locations and good acting make it a treat to watch. Despite the long duration, you never want to leave the film in between. Abishek Bachchan's comedy is hilarious. SRK's 8-pack abs make the audience go crazy. Deepika is charming in her own way. Be ready for claps and whistles in the hall. Another plus point is the U-rating which suggests its a complete family movie and can be enjoyed by kids too. A complete joy ride this festive season. Happy New Year is set to break all the records at the Box Office."

","Firstly, before you watch the movie, expect the worst; that's exactly when you'll enjoy the best.The plot isn't very interesting, but I must say it's new and pleasant. Has some fresh comedy and some great spoofs, quite unusual for Bollywood. It also brings about a sense of patriotism unexpectedly.The First half might be a bit lame, but give it some time.It gives you quite a tour of Dubai, even the Shooting Sets representing Dubai were great; though the set up of India could have been much better and more realistic. Additionally having a great cast suitable for the characters makes it lively.<br/><br/>In short - worth a watch."

However the makers of this film spend no time in thinking of something creative. The dialogues are very very cheap. The actors had nothing to do, The editing is bad,I will ignore the direction because in bollywood almost anybody can direct a film if they have money. Only the songs were okay.<br/><br/>I would recommend to avoid this movie even if you get a chance to see it for free.

It was always expected to be big but how big was the question. And team HNY has answered that question in their own style. To put it simply it is EASILY year's best film. Miles ahead of last year BB yes even CE. In fact I will go out the limb and say it is EASILY SRK's best since OSO!! Why? Well here is why:- 1. Unbelievable canvas! Film looks expensive in each n every frame. 2. Unbelievable chemistry b/w all star cast! 3. Amazing humor! Ah we so missed the good family comedy timings! 4. Action was of highest standard that you can see in an Bollywood Masala film. 5. Farah Khan is back in her elements. 6.Abhishek, Sonu Sood did commendable job. 7. Vivaan and Boman were both very efficient. 8. Deepika Padukone has again shown why is the most powerful lead actress going around! 9. And last but not the least Shah Rukh Khan! He is in unbelievable form! Looking like million bucks in each n every frame, impeccable comic timing, in ROCKING action avatar! He has carried the film on his shoulder and will take it to the BO glory as well!! PS:- Watch out for the super cutest AbRam Khan playing with his father for 30 secs and it will be worth your all ticket price Also any glimpse of Mrs Khan is worthy enough well here she has shown some of her never seen before moves as well!! And in the film they end up stealing Diamond worth 300m$ it looks well set to collect 300 crores in India alone Now as for stars do I really need to give it? See you in theaters fellas for I will be seeing it for at least 20 times more"

","Happy New Year, according to me, is not just the most entertaining but also the most well detailed heist and dance competition movie of the Bollywood...<br/><br/>Of course, there are loopholes but not a lot. At least, there is an answer to everything. Whether its getting votes in dance competition, making it to the final round of dance competition... getting finger prints of villain's son... to making their way out with the diamonds.. even why the plan is called happy new year (after an unsuccessful merry Christmas attempt) the acting by everyone is great.. the best thing is the team work that shows in the movie and among the actors.. they look and work like a team... and there were aunty's sitting next to me.. who were saying.. ""comon, only 2 minutes are left for the safe lock to activate"".. (how can people say they had headache?) <br/><br/>Direction is top notch.. ""OSO"" was a drag after intermission, but this one is so MAGNUM and ENORMOUS that you can't feel bored at all.. so much money and effort has been put to make every screen shine like gold.. and there is a soul in every emotion... you feel for team India.. even when namo says ache din aa gaye after their selection in the finals :P people were drooling in the hall on it.. also the scene, where ""Nandu"" strips for the sake of the plan :) also the fight scene between srk and the korean guy... Hollywood standard... (and people were saying the duplicate was evident in that scene.... he did it himself guys :)) people were rooting for ""Indiawaale"" and the team diamonds (as they were after diamonds)... and this is i think the biggest achievement of the movie..<br/><br/>cinematography, choreography and background score... all of them fabulous.. we all talk about the actors... but background score, cinematography and choreography are never talked about.. they were phenomenal.. miles ahead of any other bollywood movie... of course, many people were not note the detailing put in the movie... but they all will at least notice one thing - the sheer beauty of the movie and effort of the people who have made it...<br/><br/>and the songs.. bad? watch them grow on you while you watch the movie... all of them<br/><br/>This is one movie that you need to watch in a movie hall... it is MEGA, it is ENORMOUS.. the best of ""bollywood masala"".."

","with in 25-30 minutes everyone in the audience would be able to know the plot and climax which was a huge black mark in the entire story plot. from a neutral point of view this movie offers nothing new but at least a new story with excellent music and background score especially in the climax where any true nationalist and Indian would get goosebumps for the first time at least.including the dance part to film shows the director passion for dance but fails miserably to present it on screen with a sense of humor . the comedy part carried in the film is totally senseless for a heist movie named 'biggest robbery of the world' probably could have been named easiest and silly robberies. only the climax song will keep you in the seats the rest you can relax and even miss it except the songs portion which was the only plus point in the film. overall a ten only actors in the lead role who carried the film on their shoulders with out whom the film could have been a disaster . a ten for the music directors who made the film and the end product watchable least of all. probably the actors from next on should choose a script and an apt director other than making films that may look commercial from the producer point of view but look a non sense from a neutral point ."

His movies makes you think about the relationships in life, about love, a bond between friends, a bond between you and your country, a bond between you and your family. Though it is not completely a message oriented movie, I like it very much because of their acting. Deepika has given her best but her role is less, Abhishek acted well but in a different way which is entirely comedy. Sonu Sud is good, Boman Irani at his best again.

","I don't write reviews normally. But seeing the IMDM user reviews filled with low stars, I took the courage to write a review. <br/><br/>The first of all, if you don't WANT TO LIKE the movie, and you don't have enough time to complete, in a hurry, you won't like it. All 3 hours will seem to you total nonsense. However, really it isn't. You need to refresh your mind, and just see the movie. You're definitely gonna like it.<br/><br/>What's the main things that it has to offer other than countless movies? It's a pure entertainer with logic. It has a strong storyline, correct drama and a brilliantly done heist (the theft of diamonds). People who have confusion that it'll be a rip off of Now You See Me and Ocean's 11, really it isn't. No, not even the concept. <br/><br/>It has comedy, it has action, it has the dance, it has romance, it has drama, it has a sense of nationalism. It's a great complete package and even some early scenes were too bit extravaganza, but once you skip this, it's a complete solid package. Do watch it. It'll put a smile and give you goosebumps in the end. <br/><br/>To compare three Farah Khan films, I'll rate Main Hoon Na>Happy New Year>Om Shanti Om."
"akshay-ranganathan","3","22","49","24 October 2014"," The worst heist movie ever
","Farah Khan, known for choreographing many actors, in n-number of films, for the kind of weight she carries, and also had choreographed the International Popstar Shakira, had tried her hand in direction, through her first film, 'Main Hoon Na' (translation:- I am here, friend). Since then she didn't look back, and went on directing films like, 'Om Shanti Om' (translation:- Solemn affirmation, peace and solemn affirmation) and 'Tees Maar Khan' (translation:- Heroic character). Except for 'Tees Maar Khan', every film, of hers, managed to do well at the box- office, though they did not manage to please the discerning movie-goers, like me. But anyway, after a gap of like 3-4 years, Farah Khan is back with yet another offering, called 'Happy New Year' (translation:- Happy New Year, 'duh').<br/><br/>Charlie(Shah Rukh Khan, generated the 10(or 8 or whatever the number may be, I don't care)-pack-abs, with the help of steroids) is a Boston University Grad, who makes his living by wrestling. Moreover he can speak Korean with fluency (I wonder are there such wrestlers in India, forget about the world). Anyway, when he gets to know about his arch-rival, Charan Grover(Jackie Shroff, with his oh-so- menacing looks and the salt-n-pepper hairdo) being the guardian of the diamonds, for he has a slick safe and the best security arrangement for the safe, Charlie assembles a team, and its members are Nandu Bhide(Abhishek Bachchan, in such an awfully thankless role) the loud-mouthed-cum-barfing tapori, Jag(Sonu Sood, clearly his character is inspired from 'The Italian Job' (translation:- The Italian Job, again 'duh')), the explosives expert, who currently works in movies, Tammy(Boman Irani, stereotyping Parsis yet again) a young-stud-at- heart old man, who is suffering from F.I.T.Z., Rohan(Vivaan Shah, is he really the son of Naseeruddin Shah, 'cause he doesn't look like him, in any angle) a loser small-time-hacker, and Mohini(Deepika Padukone, a poor lass, wasted in this film, though she dances well) a beautiful boneless dancer who has a fetish for English-speaking gentlemen. Together, they start a mission, called, tan-ta-dan, Mission:Happy New Year. Does Charlie have a plan? What do these six people have in common? What did Charan Grover do to Charlie? All these questions will be answered as the reels of 'Happy New Year' unfold!<br/><br/>First thing's first, the movie, produced by Shah Rukh's banner 'Red Chillies Entertainment' and distributed by 'Yash Raj Films', is just an awful heist movie, ever conceived. Though I have seen many bad heist movies, but they at least had some cheap thrills, and engaging heist-tricks as the redeeming factors. But in this movie, we can't find any thrill in this hackneyed-cum-illogical heist movie. The screenplay (Farah Khan, Althea Kaushal), as well as the final print, consists of logical loopholes, like:- 1) Since Charlie, the team-leader, has named his mission as Mission:Happy New Year, he should be sure that the heist would be committed at the night of 31st December. But no, they all turn out to be naive, including the captain, and try to commit it on a wrong date. This is just wrong as thieves ought to have complete information. 2) Which army-man in the world got a chance to work in the movies as the explosives supervisor, even when he is deaf by one ear. Sonu Sood, I'm talking about you 3) Boman Irani's character's handbag carries a supermarket. How does that happen? I've seen many over-the-top movies, but this is just appallingly awful. And so on. Moreover the screenwriters are inspired from movies like 'Ocean's 11 (translation:- Ocean's 11, 'duh' again), 'The Italian Job', 'Tower Heist' (translation:- Tower Heist, 'duh' for the last time), and so on.<br/><br/>The dialogues (Mayur Puri)range from clunky, to jingoistic, to over- sentimental, to cocky-funny, and to even lame, 'cause some dialogues, intended to be funny, are quite lame and cocky-funny. Some dialogues are heavily inspired from movies like 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge' (translation:- The big-hearted man will take the bride away), 'Chak De! India' (translation:- Rock On! India) and so on, intended as a parody, but fall flat.<br/><br/>Music, by Vishal-Shekhar, has never been so jarring, and deafness- inducing, except for 'Manwaa Laage'. Background score (John Stewart Eduri)is equally jarring. Cinematography (Manush Nandan) is exotic, though has a travelogue quality to it. I believe the editors (Tushar Parekh, Anand Subaya)must've slept while editing this awful movie. Visual effects (Red Chillies VFX) is quite good. I'm happy that Indian movies are improving considerably in visual effects. Stunts (Dave Judge)were quite good, if not the best. Choreography (Geeta Kapoor, Farah Khan)were quite apt, for this movie is a musical-heist movie.<br/><br/>Of the cast, almost everybody acted bad, or were wasted, except Deepika (to an extent), and Jackie Shroff. Abhishek Bachchan has a dual role, any of which, sadly, don't work. Anupam Kher, Prabhu Deva, Kiku, Malaika Arora Khan, Geeta Kapoor, Anurag Kashyap (was that you, Anurag, my favorite director?) and Vishal Dadlani (wasted after 'Tees Maar Khan') are wasted badly. Dino Morea and Sarah-Jane Dias make brief appearances, which is quite forgettable. The actor as the street fighter, in the film's opening scene, did well. On the whole, do not recommend 'Happy New Year' even to your worst enemy. He'll come out barfing, like Abhishek Bachchan, without the help of alcohol. I gave three stars out of ten, because:- 1) One Star for Deepika's dancing skills and Jackie Shroff's acting 2) Half Star for Visual Effects 3) Half Star for Cinematography 4) Half Star for Stunts 5) Half Star for Choreography. That's it!"
"nairtejas","3","33","80","24 October 2014"," An Unrehearsed Nonsense. ♦ 29%
","It all depends on what you expect. If rambunctious actors playing horse, wearing 100 different, colorful costumes, enacting a brainless heist is your definition of film, then you will be happy that you watched the film. Otherwise, you are in for a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>It was unwise of me to be in the latter category. The film starts with Charlie (Shahrukh Khan), a nobody with an athletic body who is planning for 8 years now, to avenge his father's wrong incarceration by a hot-shot ignoramus (Shroff). Now as stupid as it might seem, he gathers a group of idiots (aka losers) to execute his plan which consists of many parts. The losers can be seen in the posters, but I will care to itemize them:<br/><br/>► Tammy (Boman Irani) is the most annoying character in the whole film. With a voice improvisation that will make you wanna punch him in the face till it disfigures, he is an elderly stud who overacts and spoils the already botched attempt at making a film. Irani's worst performance.<br/><br/>► Nandu Bhide (Bachchan Jr.) could be termed the most comic character by the audience with whom I watched the film because with every joke (all mindless, naive, and substandard), laughs sputtered as if an original stand-up comedy was being enacted. We aren't expecting much from Bachchan Jr. since after his Guru days, but drooping so low to make his fans to dissolve into laughter? Well, no one can help him. His performance makes his Idea commercials Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>► Rohan (Vivaan Shah) is a child who was only last month discontinued from breastfeed by his mum. With no acting skills at all or at least the ability to maneuver and make do without it (like Bachchan Jr.), he is a misfit here. Hasn't he inherited anything from his father?<br/><br/>► Jag (Sonu Sood) is an explosive specialist turned body-builder out of the 2003 American hit film ""The Italian Job."" In fact, the whole film is relative to that film, which I guess Farah Khan didn't know, was brutally remade by Abbas-Mustan as ""Players."" She should've asked our Johnny-boy Bachchan Jr.. Sood is fine.<br/><br/>Anyways, talk about performances and there is a competition happening among all the actors to come up with the worst performance. Consider Mohini (Deepika Padukone) who is a bar dancer with life values etched on to her. She cannot speak English and her disability is rampant in the film, helped by Bachchan Jr., which is the main cause of humor. SRK is fine, as well, but expecting more from him was my only mistake. He's grown old, but looks young both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>The plot is as unoriginal as it can get. Borrowed from famous heist films, the first half blows. Traction builds up in the second half i.e. in Dubai where the actual heist takes place. The tens of dance performances, one unnecessary fight scene involving SRK, and loads of melodrama makes it a perfect family film by Farah Khan. The final scenes flash a lot of cliché and marks predictability. I have nothing special to say about Jackie Shroff, because he seemed like he played the role with only money (for the portrayal) in his mind.<br/><br/>There are lots of junk comedy scenes that you may want to relish, but not a single sequence that evinces an emotion or a style or a film factor. Editing is hopeless and so is the screenplay. One scene involves a dance, while in the subsequent scene SRK is changing his 71st sunglasses. Music (Scott Choplin's The Entertainer used in a wrong context, Carl Douglas's Kung Fu Fighting, again used in wrong context; the fighters hardly use kung fu) and songs are the only thing that made me rate the film a 3, along with the slight effort that was made for the faintly funny dialogs.<br/><br/>There are massive plot holes that if I start explaining will be longer than the reel of the film at 3 hours. But who even cares about these holes, when you know that the ship has already sunk. Towards the end, it looked like the makers didn't want it to end, slipping in unwanted parts of the film which may have been edited out previously. And the shindig ends with the typical way how a Farah Khan ends her films: the jokers who helped in making the film show their faces to get further embarrassed.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: It all depended on the direction, the torch bearer to bring out the performances in her actors, but after watching this 3- hour nonsense, I believe she was rather sleeping throughout the shoots and let her brother handle the unit. So the stupidity! Watch at your own risk if you are a fan of any of the actors.

","I do not know if the earlier review was written, by a fan or a hater of SRK or he actually went to watch the movie in the first place and clearly he seems to be having a biased opinion on SRK, which he seems to be more of a hater than a fan and thus if an opinion is biased then it cannot be simply taken seriously as a review.<br/><br/>Anyhow I went to see the movie yesterday while being disheartened by the previous review and thought it might be boring with all the crap and misleading statements spread made by the previous reviewer. <br/><br/>I have to say I was actually surprised how wrong he was , the movie was excellent , it had the necessary elements of surprise and classy in all of its form , it was hilarious right through-out and I cannot recall another time I was rolling on the floor in a theater with so much laughter and joy , the actors were doing their best and were fair by their character requirements and brought it all together perfectly blended to make it a box- office mega-blaster.<br/><br/>The plot was original in it's own form despite some claiming it to be lifted off from another , despite all this piece of art was a success in doing what they initiated to do and planned and was a complete success.<br/><br/>Not a Minute I was bored or yawning but most of the time hardly breathing with all the humor.<br/><br/>So either way I would like to conclude this review by noting that , go for it for the Humor and joy , have a bit of Fun , enjoy a movie forgetting all the logic (That's why we all go for a movie now and then yeah , to forget about the reality at least for a few hours, this movie excels doing that perfectly) , go to see some of the best acting by SRK , Deepika , Abhishek and rest of the crew and most of all go to enjoy the movie leaving aside all differences , trust me it's worth the money."

","Blatant unacknowledged plagiarism. I don't wish to reveal any spoilers, so i will resist the temptation to provide specific examples.. but in general this movie was practically a compilation of references to other movies. Moreover, it was practically an exact copy of the movies Italian Job and Ocean's 11, with the exception of the dance team element. Had credit been given to these movies which preceded Happy New Year's release, and had it been marketed as so, there would be no issues. It was definitely a slapstick humor kind of movie, but was very entertaining. I'd recommend this movie for ""time pass"" , as long as you haven't seen Italian Job or Ocean's 11, or at least know that its the same story."

"deepkrishna78","6","13","27","25 October 2014"," 100% entertainer-a Desi Diwali Bash from Farah Khan
","Watched HNY yesterday- And read some of the very sadistic reviews from the critics about the movie too. That is the reason I felt to take time to write down my opinion of the movie. I have noticed that 95% of common people get affected by reviews from influencers. One so and so director liked a review written by any x or y on FB, TADAthat creates an opinion in some 'poor' fellas. I can tell you my honest opinion as I am not biased to anyone not even SRK. India is different from any other country-We have colorful celebrations all throughout the year-so are the Bollywood movies. Most of the Hindi movies make no sense now days- HNY is a Desi Diwali Bash for the people of India -the movie also tries to induce patriotism . First important character in the movie HAPPY NEW YEAR is Atlantis the Palm Dubai Hotel & Resort. The majestic Atlantis is an eye candy which should be enjoyed only on the big screen. Kids would really love their favorite spots for example, Dolphin Bay in Atlantis and the New Year celebrations that happens here. After the interval, I felt, people enjoyed more as I noticed the entire audience in 'Reel Cinemas' (Dubai mall ) burst out laughing .No critic can influence the hearty laugh from unbiased people in the movie hall . SRK didn't show any talent other than his 12 pack body-which too is of course a treat to people of India. :-)<br/><br/>The pun intended scenes in the first half, I found as a taunt referring to the inside movie scoops in Bollywood- especially SRK- Salman fights and the petty Bollywood movie scripts-Match fixing trend in India etc. Many non Hindi speakers won't digest the humor as these are region specific-Marathi girl's sentiments ,Desi accents etc- some lines are included just to satisfy SRK fans. As HNY has a sensible plot for robbery- is better than Hrithik Roshan's ""Bang Bang ""- which banged our brain with a pseudo Kohinoor Hira robbery story – I have found the script of most of Hrithik Roshan movies adapted from Antony Horowitz children's books-but Pathetically screen played without giving credits to the English author for the great concepts. These are my opinions not referred from any ""GREAT"" critics so I can only suggest to read the books first before you bang on me to defend .I feel sympathy for other movie directors who has supported the criticisms without watching Happy New Year movie-I am not saying that HNY is a CLASSIC but it is absolutely a 100% entertainer - Before you encourage some crap reviews, you must think of your responsibility towards the society –kindly watch the movie before you show your opinion. I give 6.5/10 for HNY and 5.5/10 for Bang Bang."

While rest of the character played their role quite well. The movie was full with instant comedy having glances and dialogues from Shahrukh hit movies which made it more beautiful.

","I won't talk about the story, directions etc but will talk about the cast and their potential and why you should NOT watch the movie. Farah's work I have never appreciated except for Main Hoon Na. She is a good director but needs much more improvement. The movie is rather made to entertain the cheap audience, who don't need a very good joke to laugh at. And Shahrukh should seriously stop romancing actresses who are half his age. C'mon, man! He really needs to know the character inside him. He should start doing some grown ups or supporting mature roles. He is no more a superstar material. Deepika is like OKish in the film. She cannot match the potential of her contemporaries like Katrina or PeeCee, but nice try. Sonu, macho, hunky, did his best and really was good in the film. I didn't understand Vivaan's character so I am not gonna pass any judgement about him. Best performers of the film were Abhishek and Boman, really. They were so effortless and natural that, I guess, the movie worked out only because of these two. So let me put it like this, watch Happy New Year at your own risk. There's nothing new or exciting in the film. But while booking the tickets, just remember one thing that you're simply adding to SRK's bank balance and nothing else. You won't get entertained for sure."

"bobbysing","3","4","6","5 January 2015"," Shahrukh certainly deserves much better projects, directors & concepts matching his current status & simply doesn't need to do such poor, repetitive films.
","Unfortunately HAPPY NEW YEAR fails to deliver even a fairly engaging time and remains amongst the weakest film of the actor as well as the director post their entertaining OM SHANTI OM. To give you a fair idea, Shahrukh's CHENNAI EXPRESS still had much more enjoyable moments than HNY featuring a confident charmer Deepika Padukone with her fresh south Indian accent. But sadly, even Deepika is unable to save this pretty long, completely predictable and uninteresting film with her tapori mannerisms.<br/><br/>Clearing the speculations being made around its inspired status, HNY has nothing to do with the films with the same title i.e. HAPPY NEW YEAR (1987 - English), HAPPY NEW YEAR aka LA BONNE ANNE'E (1973 - French) or the Spanish heist film LADR'ON QUE ROBA A LADR'ON having few similar characters. In fact this is a poor mix and match of our own several Hindi films since the main revenge plot straight away reminds you of DHOOM 3 and many dialogues make you remember the previous films by the team quite clearly.<br/><br/>Beginning with all grand looks of the Dubai hotel, the makers keep stressing on the BODY structure right from the first few minutes itself and then go on giving the introductions for a good long 45 minutes. Looking for something fresh, one desperately starts expecting Deepika to come in fast to offer the much needed relief but such is the (all clichéd) below average script progression of the film that even her decent performance is unable to become the saving grace. The comedy barely works in only a few scenes and the dance competition before the intermission exactly looks like watching any mediocre movie unexpectedly.<br/><br/>The long and lazy sequences continue to test your patience in the second half and (once again) the heist is so easily done as if the owners were just waiting for the diamonds to be stolen in advance. Particularly the elements of 'not in use' AC duct & the excessive water involved in the act were just mind blowing throwing away the logic as always. Next the painfully stretched climax trying to pump in some fake patriotism simply falls flat and the film thankfully ends raising a big question in your mind that, ""Why did Shahrukh signed this and didn't they all read the script first before saying Yes?"" and moreover, ""Why everyone including Aamir, Akshay, Hrithik, Salman & now Shahrukh are all desperately doing the same heist films all of a sudden?""<br/><br/>Keeping aside the writing which more or less gets revealed from the description above, I would like to mention the direction which questionably doesn't give you even one impressive or memorable scene in the film to be precise. Refusing to learn from the mistakes of the past, this time Farah makes fun of Saroj Khan in a spoof and with Shahrukh (once again) being present in the act, becomes the 'partner in the crime' unarguably. In honest words, I really cannot understand the need and fail to laugh at any such act disrespecting our veterans, whom we have grown up watching in all the past decades.<br/><br/>Other than this highly objectionable addition Farha also brings in some surprising cameos featuring Sajid Khan, Prabhudeva, Anurag Kashyap, Vishal and more. But none of them is able to bring in that much desired laughter in the theater. Plus the overuse of a particular suggestive abusive word in the dialogues seems to be really strange as well as sick considering the King Khan's status. <br/><br/>And I would humbly like to ask the Censors that ""Does the committee only understands English abusive words, strongly objecting their use in our films and really not familiar with the Hindi abuse suggestively used in HNY? OR ""Do we have different set of rules for small, medium and big budget films featuring the known names?""<br/><br/>Musically, the songs are not able to make any kind of long lasting impact on the viewers and the only catchy number ""Main Lovely Ho Gayi Han"" is highly inspired from a Punjabi composition also reminding you of ""Main Yaar Manani Ni"" from DAAG (1973). Coming to the other technical departments, a heist movie is largely dependent upon its Background Score which keeps you glued to the screen when the task is being done without any major dialogues. But HNY doesn't have any pulsating Background score to make you feel the excitement and the camera-work keeps trying hard to fill in the missing element through its different angles along with some fine action. Also the editors are not able to deliver a fast paced, engaging product probably because they had to give each and every actor his due scenes keeping the main focus on Shahrukh.<br/><br/>In the performance section, I really haven't got much to write as none of the names come up with anything exceptional other than a few scenes of Deepika, Boman and Abhishek. Despite being there in almost every frame Shahrukh doesn't deliver the Khan magic and I truly missed the actor seen in SWADES and CHAKK DE India. BothSonu Sood & Anupam Kher are wasted just for nothing, Vivaan is only there to fill up the space and Jackie Shroff is the same, as seen before playing a routine act.<br/><br/>In all it seems that the film was made just for the sake of friendship since in comparative terms HNY is arguably one of the most disappointing films of the year which misses out the opportunity to encash a talented cast ensemble. Nevertheless its pretty obvious that the film will still make a big killing at the box office due to our own gross ignorance and so huge cinema loving population of the country.<br/><br/>However signing off on a positive note, I would like to request Shahrukh to please adapt new concepts, new directors and better films in the coming years, since the actor himself and his fans certainly deserve much better films than HAPPY NEW YEAR."

","This is a great family film, it really is funny and fun to watch however I felt that the film dragged on for quite long, this could have been avoided by cutting out some parts, I know Hindi films are known for being really long, but this film could have been less than 2.5hrs. Happy New Year is quite similar to the Hollywood film Oceans Eleven, it has a few themes and obviously the main objective of the characters being the same. All the cast in Happy New Year have acted really well, I particularly enjoyed Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Pudkone's acting, and I liked SRK putting in the one liners from his previous films. Jackie Shroff was alright I guess, nothing much to comment on his role. I didn't like the songs in the film, but thats my opinion. I don't think this film deserves more than a 7, there was just something missing. Overall,it's a good film and I would recommend watching it at least once."

","The superb entertainer, this movie is a laugh riot. Great work by the whole team especially Shahrukh & Deepika. Go & watch, this movie is really worth a watch. 10 out on 10.As far as the acting department is concerned, no prizes for guessing as to who the captain of the team is. It is Shah Rukh Khan, who leads the film on his able shoulders right from the word go. Be it his quintessential romance with his lady love Deepika Padukone or the fight sequences, or his acting performance as Charlie, Shah Rukh Khan excels in every department. In this film, he has been portrayed more as an action hero who can sing and dance, which again, the King Khan has done full justice to. If he sported a 6 pack abs in OM SHANTI OM, he moves 'two steps ahead' to flaunt a whopping '8- pack abs', which looks undeniably good on him! Deepika Padukone, on the other hand, does full justice to her character Marathi bar dancer. After CHENNAI EXPRESS, this is yet another quirky character that the actress has played in one more SRK film. Deepika has definitely evolved a lot as an actress and she proves that yet again with her comic role in this film. Do not miss the scenes when even her silent love for Shah Rukh Khan speaks volumes. Sonu Sood excels in his role and looks convincingly funny. Abhishek Bachchan is back to doing loud comedy in this film after BOL BACHCHAN. In this film, be ready for a double dose of Abhishek as he is seen in a double role."

It was always expected to be big but how big was the question. And team HNY has answered that question in their own style. To put it simply it is EASILY year's best film. Miles ahead of last year BB yes even CE. In fact I will go out the limb and say it is EASILY SRK's best since OSO!! Why? Well here is why:- 1. Unbelievable canvas! Film looks expensive in each n every frame. 2. Unbelievable chemistry b/w all star cast! 3. Amazing humor! Ah we so missed the good family comedy timings! 4. Action was of highest standard that you can see in an Bollywood Masala film. 5. Farah Khan is back in her elements. 6. Abhishek,Sonu Sood did commendable job. 7. Vivaan and Boman both were very efficient. 8. Deepika Padukone has again shown why is the most powerful lead actress going around! 9. And last but not the least Shah Rukh Khan! He is in unbelievable form! Looking like million bucks in each n every frame, impeccable comic timing, in ROCKING action avatar! He has carried the film on his shoulder and will take it to the BO glory as well!! PS:- Watch out for the super cutest AbRam Khan playing with his father for 30 secs and it will be worth your all ticket price Also any glimpse of Mrs Khan is worthy enough well here she has shown some of her never seen before moves as well!! And in the film they end up stealing Diamond worth 300m$ it looks well set to collect 300 cores in India alone. Now as for stars do I really need to give it? See you in theaters fellas for I will be seeing it for at least 20 times more now I feel I MUST BE A BIG SRK FAN"

","Charlie (SRK) is out on a revenge mission because his father Manohar (anupam kher) was conned by the crook Charan (Jackie Shroff) and put in jail for twelve years. The way to do that would be to steal diamonds worth 300 crores belonging to Charan. But for this, he has to take part in a world dance championship in Dubai. Despite not knowing dance, Charlie ropes in Jag (sonu sood) an ex-bomb squad member, Nandu (abhishek) who can puke anywhere anytime he wants, Tammy (boman) an expert lock opener, Rohan (vivaan) a hacker and Mohini (deepika) a bar dancer. Whether Charlie is successful in his mission or not forms the rest.<br/><br/>The director has come up with a routine storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was good . The dialogues were light hearted. The script was very average but the screenplay was effective at and enjoyable. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was okay. Costumes were extremely stylish to suit the royalty while the art department was superb. The film belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and he was too good. Deepika Padukone has once again proved why she is the best. Abhishek Bachchan was hilarious. Sonu Sood was perfect. Boman Irani was versatile and entertaining. Vivaan Shah was apt. Jackie Shroff was fair. Anupam Kher was graceful.<br/><br/>It is a huge challenge for any filmmaker to come up with a subject that justifies an ensemble cast and also provides the right kind of entertainment. In this film, the first half goes about with elements of humor, some romance and action as well. The interval bang was promising and the second half has a lot of dancing along with some amount of melodrama. Overall, this is a film which fits into the perfect masala potboiler and one should leave behind sensibilities and logic.

","I don't really know what has happened so such great actors as Boman Irani and Shah Rukh Khan that they chose to act in this movie. I didn't actually go to this movie with very high expectations, aware that it was from the Farah Khan stable. But, despite that, I felt tortured, irritated, and robbed of my money. <br/><br/>The plot fails to gather steam right away and falls flat on its face repeatedly. The dialogues feel drawn out, repetitive and vague. The script lacks substance and cannot be even classified as a brains-at- home type. The so called jokes are painful and tedious rather than laughable. <br/><br/>The whole plot of ""stealing the diamonds"" is given very little impetus and the story heavily revolves around nonsense one liners, annoying jigs, hearing mistakes by the cast supposedly meant to humor the audience. And when it comes to the all important task, it is done away with in a jiffy. The director has introduced patriotic elements in the plot supposedly to inspire, but it doesn't just align with the theme of the movie and feels segregated, overbearing and dramatic. Boman Irani is infantile, annoying and keeps getting Epileptic fits, Abhishek Bachchan has issues with repetitive vomiting, Sonu Sood bursts a vein at anything and everything to do with his mother. Shahrukh Khan, for all his good acting, is squandered. Vivaan Shah is apparently giving Edward Snowden a run for his money with his hacking skills. <br/><br/>Music by Vishal Shekhar is average and passable.The songs are placed at random intervals and with no relation to the progression of the movie.<br/><br/>I guess with the success of movies like Chennai Express, filmmakers have been encouraged to make movies with the IQ of an 8 year old and with the intention just to make money rather than provide any good to the audience. The plan looks like the movie would anyways carry on on its hype and momentum, and by the time the people come to terms, the producers would be laughing their way to the bank. <br/><br/>All in all, this is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Waste of talent, waste of money, time, and resources. The notorious duo of Farah and Sajid should stop making movies. Please wait for the DVD to arrive and watch at home if you so want to. This is definitely NOT worth a watch."

","Your eyes meet.

"maulin5","7","9","19","24 October 2014"," A SRK-Farah entertainer for family audience
","After Om Shanti Om, Shah Rukh Khan is back with director Farah Khan to entertain audience. And this time also, they are giving the best entertainer film of the year. The story is not new. It's a revenge story from a son Charlie to his dad's enemy Charan Grover. But in between that, world dance championship has been put to add some songs, some action sequences and background plot of the film HNY. Director Farah Khan once again proved that the masala films are actually her part of business to attract masses. I think Main Hoon Na was the first Masala family entertainer. Than OSO has been released. After that she made Tees Mar Khan with Akki, which was a disaster. So, she made her 4th movie with SRK and again she made a complete entertainer. Although the film is 179 minutes long, but, SRK fans don't need to worry because not a single minute is here to bore you, even in the end titles, the casts and crews can make you smile till the end. Dipika looks stunning in Lovely song. Everyone is whistling in that song. She is as usual. Vivan looks cute. Sonu Sood has limited scope but than also he entertains. Boman is also fantastic and funny, too. Abhishek may get the best comedian role award for this year. I liked him so much. Jacki is also suitable to his role. Anupam Kher, Sajid Khan, Maliaka Arora Khan, Dino, Vishal, Anurag Kashyap, Prabhu Deva & Kiku Sharda as Faroj Khan did the cameo roles, which are the funny sides of the movie. I was laughing very loudly in the Prabhu-Kiku cameo scene, I loved that. SRK is a baap of expression. He can use his voice only to show or express the situation. He has given the best. His entry scene is very well captured. Whistlings and shouting may happen in every theater for sure. No doubt in the direction. But I feel, the editing could have been sharp. So the film gets appreciation from the haters of SRK also. But, the length is giving the chance to the haters to drag the film to a flop. But, this is a super-hit movie, a bollywood entertainer which is released after a long time. Music suits the motion of the film. Manwa Laage, Satkali, Indiawaale, Nonsense ki night - all the songs are well sung. Music is given by Vishal-Shekhar. Irshad Kamil proved once again that he is the best lyricist after Gulzar & Javed, who can write soulful songs as well as tapori and dancing songs with such a beautiful lyrics. Indiawale is the example. Dialogues by Mayur Puri are fine, but, the situations are more funnier than the dialogues. Farah and Geeta Kapoor are the choreographer and they did well. On the whole, if you want the Diwali gift, if you are a fan of OmShantiOm & MainHoonNa, if you like masala movies, if you love Dubai, if you like to watch film with whole family - Than go for it. Happy New Year is a complete paisa wasul movie. Fingers cross for 300cr."

"shiraj-dakshy","4","17","43","24 October 2014"," Too many & too much spoil the New Year
","Big Star cast and big production value do not necessarily give you a GOOD movie; I guess Bollywood directors should realize this<br/><br/>""Happy New Year"" is another such opportunity, but somehow falls short in the overall narration<br/><br/>Written by Farah Khan, Mayur Puri and Althea Kaushal ""Happy New Year"" is your Bollywood take on ""Ocean's Eleven"" with the desi Bollywood tadka of Naach Gaana, Patriotism and over the top comic sequences. The story is of five losers headed by Charlie (Shahrukh Khan) who plan a heist to steal diamonds worth 300 crores , how they implement the plan and whether they are successful in the heist is what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>The story concept wise is brilliant but it is the screenplay which is full of loop holes and unnecessary sequences which do not add up to the overall movie experience. The first half drags, as it is solely spent to introduce the characters. The main issue in the narration is the emphasis on the Dance Competition and less screen time is spent in the planning of the heist. Though each character is defined excluding Charlie's well, but later the main characteristics are sidelined like Jag (Sonu Sood) is supposed to be deaf by one ear but this is conveniently over looked in many sequences, such is the case with other characters as well. The chemistry between Charlie and Mohini (Deepika Padukone) is missing completely. The climax looks too convenient and a bit stretched. Another issue is the 179 mins of screen time which is way too long and it could have been 30 mins short.<br/><br/>The dialogues are more of a spoof of previous Shahrukh Khan Movies, and there is nothing original.The dialect of both Mohini and Nandu are inconsistent. Excluding a few sequences the comic sequences falls flat and is hardly humorous.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan performs earnestly even in silly sequences, but definitely it is not his best. Abhishek Bachchan as Nandu Bhide unfortunately is a badly written character which is more of a clown without much to do. Sonu Sood as Jag is good in showing his abs but unfortunately the same could not be said for his performance. Boman Irani repeats his quintessential Parsi act as Tammy, I feel he is being repetitive and should re-invent himself. Deepika Padukone as Mohini unfortunately has nothing much to do but she is good and lights up the screen. Vivaan Shah as the hacker Rohan shows promise but his character is too one dimensional for any histrionics. Jackie Shroff as the antagonist Charan Grover looks too haggard to be a suave businessman and his act does not impress too much. Rest of the cast is also average.<br/><br/>Cinematography by Manush Nandan is full of glitter and gives a glamorous look. Farah Khan and Geeta Kapoor's choreography is pleasing especially ""Manwa Laage"" and ""Main Lovely"".<br/><br/>Farah Khan had an excellent cast and a huge production house backing her and off course a superstar like Shahrukh Khan, but she completely wasted this opportunity with a mediocre script and a narration which is full of loopholes. I think Farah should have concentrated more on originality rather than on spoof of other Bollywood movies.<br/><br/>The movie is neither very bad neither very good, and has nothing new to offer, in a nutshell a very average attempt."
"Vishboy","6","8","17","25 October 2014"," Decent movie but go with ""right"" expectations!
","As another Farah Khan/Shah Rukh Khan blockbuster comes out, as usual it tends to polarizes the audiences. But my opinion is that each director has a speciality and after having watched this movie, nothing surprised me. It was exactly what I expected based on Farah Khan's track record and also 'enough' was out in the promos for me to be prepared for as to what exactly I was walking into. A heist story based around a music competition. Shah Rukh Khan leads a bunch of no-hopers into this and how they juggle between the dance competition and the diamond heist forms the crux of the story. As Farah Khan movies usually span out, it moves along the expected lines of funny moments, decent song sequences and over the top finale! The music is good. Obviously ""India Waale"" song is the chartbuster of the movie but my pick would be Deepika's introduction in ""Lovely Ho Gayi"". She has danced admirably and looked million bucks. Acting from everyone is fine. Overall, a decent family entertainer and just exactly the kind of movie Farah Khan makes. So, enjoy and get entertained. And stop whinging about why this movie doesn't stimulate your grey matter (look for other options for that but please don't walk into this movie looking for exactly that). It delivers what it promised! But I must add that perhaps it is time again for Shah Rukh Khan to take some ""risks"" for his future projects."
"dineshprakash","5","14","35","24 October 2014"," Premature Happy New Year wish
","The major drawback of this film is its length. 3 Hours is too much when you don't have any super brilliant script. This type of product comes when Director is over obsessed with product. There were lots of scopes to trim it but they didn't prefer. When, You have to glorify the star rather than the character such type of things happen. Comedy punches are OK types. Story is old. Screenplay is routine. Dialogues by Mayur Puri, are good at places. You frequently get derailed that what is the main plot of this movie. How they culminated the climax, that is too kiddies. If you want to make a brainless comedy then how can you choose a heist as a main plot? It should be sensible but this is the least thing in this movie. There were lots of questions which are unanswered, like If one buy a security system from someone else then why should he keep the same password, which is one of main struggle in climax. Is it too difficult to distinguish the difference between real brick wall and a replica, for a Police!!? How can you call the son of a business tycoon via landline or intercom? There is only one answer to all question that they has taken the audience for granted. Performance wise Shah Rukh Khan is fine. Deepika Padukone is exceptionally good and stands out among all actors. Boman Irani and Abhishek Bachchan are good. Music by Vishal Shekhar is OK type. ""Manwa Lage"" is melodious."

","Good actors make an ordinary film work !<br/><br/>After seeing this film you will know the value of established actors like Shahrukh, Abhishek, Boman Irani, Deepika, Jackey dada. If this film were having some unknown/ordinary actors it would have tanked badly. <br/><br/>Movie reminds me of DHOOM-1 which was awful but for some sacred reasons worked. I thought about what worked for movies like these and concluded that these movies restrict themselves to the central theme of the <br/><br/>movie and never deviate from that. HNY is one such movie. <br/><br/>Movie is just like yet another Sholay like theme where a central person creates a team for a task. Numerous films have been made on this theme in India with several variations keeping Sholay's theme intact. In HNY too, <br/><br/>our King Khan creates a team for a hiest to take revenge for his father.<br/><br/>Locations, sets are big. Movie is colorful. Dubai is shown beautifully. Deepika steals the show in her unusual role. All are OK, but more weight and time is given to Shahrukh and Deepika. <br/><br/>And now the negative traits :<br/><br/>Characters were not polished at all. If a character is peculiar, then some decent build up must be there to bring more weight. Mere 2 minute verbal background story is not enough to bring out excitement. <br/><br/>This one should learn from notable film makers like Manmohan Desai(Amar Akbar Anthony), Late Mukul Anand(Hum), David Dhawan(Aankhen, 1993). These are multi-starrer films and every single character was <br/><br/>introduced and raised beautifully.<br/><br/>To bring out a hair raising heist is not an easy task. Remember Anil-Kapoor in Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja, Jwell Thief ? Farah Khan does every thing right but fails to create an edge. <br/><br/>Expecting more polished movie next time."

","Its high time certain directors who force themselves on to the 70mm screen without adequate know how of film making should kindly refrain themselves back.Happy New year brings in references from several Hollywood movies like Ocean's Eleven , The Full Monty & even Happy New year(1987)and is amalgamated with silly jokes , melodrama , the Hindi film revenge , song & dance and bit of skin show.If u have to blame the actors , u can only blame them for signing this movie , for the rest is not their fault.In fact they try too hard to lift the unevenly ripped apart & of course illogical screenplay.The cinematography & VFX work is applause worthy & so are the jobs of costume designers & art directors.But again we rotate back to the 'script' and sorry but the writers have done a forgetful job & the direction scrambles running out of ideas & constantly bringing in references from Shah Rukh Khan's previous hits be it in dialogues , background music which doesn't necessarily impart a substantial effect. Finally, wanna terminate by saying you can only endure this film with a smile if you are a Shah Rukh Khan fan rest all should wait for the satellite premier."

","Happy New Year is the latest magnum opus from Bollywood and as you can expect, it's a huge huge film. It has an incredible cast, a lofty budget and stunning locations to play with. With Farah Khan directing this, you can only expect a mas-ala bonanza. And this is what Happy New Year is. Farah has blended all the spices she could get hold of to dish out this film. It works well overall. Except, sometimes, too many spices end up spoiling the party. <br/><br/>How do I review this? My thoughts are all over the place. A huge film comes with big responsibilities as well. Especially when it's a 3-hour long mas-ala entertainer. You ought to have enough substance throughout. This is where Happy New Year falters. The two halves are poles apart in terms of entertainment quotient. I was well annoyed for most of the first half - which was too silly. Why would you spend a full 30 minutes introducing characters? Characters who you won't even develop properly? Characters who always end up looking like caricatures? And mind you, it's not like their introductions are worth it. Barring Charlie and Mohini, none of the ''sketches'' used to present the rest of the gang were funny or cheer-worthy. In fact, the humor of the first half was a huge letdown for me. I found the jokes forced and only chuckled at the guys learning how to dance or 1-2 one-liners.<br/><br/>However, it's the second half which catches you unaware. It's pretty brilliant. Everything comes together like magic. Shot entirely in Dubai, the second half in itself should have been the full-fledged film. The competition, camaraderie, chemistry, patriotism and heist scenes will win you over. There were a few futile scenes like the Jackie Chan v/s Bruce Lee scene (seriously OTT and not-needed, albeit well shot) or the random panic attacks of Tammy and Nandu - but overall, this was near-perfect, with an electrifying climax. The mash-up Indiawaale song and the whole choreographed act looked magnificent on the big screen. This works in favor of the film as you end up leaving the theater with a huge grin, wanting to enjoy the show again, blissfully forgetting the disastrous first hour. <br/><br/>Farah Khan, thus, is inconsistent in her direction. She doesn't come with her Main Hoon Na originality or her Om Shanti Om spunk and wittiness. She plays it VERY safe here, by ticking all the boxes, except one misses her trademark style. Along with Geeta, she does a damn good job with the choreography of Lovely, Indiawaale, Maanwa Lage and the finale version of Indiawaale. Yet, the other songs miserably fail. Nonsense Ki Night kept making me sing ''nonsense Ki film'', Satakli was OK and Dance like a Chammiyya was unintentionally intentionally absurd. :looney: I get it. They were meant to look like losers. But the makers probably wanted it to look hilarious. Well, it didn't. It was a pain watching Charlie and his angels ridiculing themselves. <br/><br/>On the acting front, Shah Rukh Khan, expectedly tops the list. He has the ONLY well-penned and layered character, and SRK sinks his teeth into it. He nails the intense and action portions. The romance is toned down, but his chemistry with Deepika is endearing. Surprisingly, he doesn't get to play much with comedy, as this is the only thing Farah chose to bestow on the so-called Angels. Deepika Padukone shines. Like a star. She looks flawless and there's no way she won't steal your heart. I found her irritating in the promos, but she's actually really cute in the film. It's not a role demanding histrionics, neither is it one which will add much to her resume, but nevertheless she gets to display her impeccable comic timing, has some of the best lines of the film and well... the usual - she mesmerizes the screen every time she comes on. Watch out for her in the two Indiawaale acts, especially the finale act. She'll bowl you away with her dancing.<br/><br/>Boman Irani and Abhishek Bachan exceed in their respective roles, mainly in the second hour. Vivaan Shah is passable but looks lost for most part. Jackie Shroff looks suave and pitches in a cool performance, although he's probably the weakest Farah Khan villain. Sunil Shetty and Arjun Rampal were more menacing.<br/><br/>My advice would be to stay away only if you can't stand mas-ala entertainers or SRK. Otherwise, Happy New Year is the film to watch this Diwali. It's stupid, flawed, over-stretched, tacky, over- the-top, but you know what? You just can't hate it. The film is cute and has a big heart. It's great harmless fun and has only one aim - to entertain you. And it does a damn good job at that!!"

","A movie with style but no class... Honestly it's got Ocean's Eleven, Charlies Angel and other such heist movies theme packed into one. Weak plot, and some really crude humor. A renowned Indian film choreographer is made fun off. A commercially successful ""Farah Khan"" lack of respect to her predecessors. Grandeur sets, picturesque locations, designer clothing and jewelry yet slapstick comedy. Hat's off to Abhishek Bachchan who shone above the chiseled looks of S.R.K and Sonu Sood. Boman Irani, Vivaan Shah, Anupam Kher and Jackie Shroff wasted talents. Deepika holds on to her crown. Over-hyped flop which will commercially do well. However, no one's going to own a copy of the same in days to come. India is commercialised and woven into a non patriotic backdrop. Go watch Mary Kom to cheer on the nation...

This film is just running because of huge promotions and advertising. It again portrays that Indians can easily fall pray to the promotions. Common guys raise your standards.

","The magical combination of a Farah Khan directed potboiler and the king of hearts Shahrukh Khan in a Diwali generates a lot of nostalgia.7years back, this combination gave us the humongous hit 'Om Shanti Om' which also introduced the talented Deepika Padukone on the silver screen. This time, it has got bigger and grander with Happy New Year. A heist plotted in the garb of participation in an international dancing championship, the film assembles the typical Bollywood clichÃ©s. With a plethora of self-deprecating humor and self-referencing, Farha employs all stereotypes which is sometimes funny and sometimes tiring.<br/><br/>The introductory scene in which our protagonist, Charlie(Shahrukh) decimates a well-built musculature in an unsanctioned fight evokes Deja vu,resonating with the voice-over of the Royal Stag 'Make it Large' endorsement. Within no time, we get to systematically know the Ocean's 5,rather 'Loosers' who must transform themselves into Charlie's angelic dancers since the only route to steal the diamond from the treacherous Dubai-based diamond magnate , Charan Grover(Jackie Shroff) is through the World Dance Championship. Amidst a lot of visual dazzle, you get familiar with the Parsi bumbling safe-breaker, Tammy(Boman Irani), the ex-army man with a defective ear, Jags(Sonu Sood), the cyber-hacker Rohan(Vivaan Shah)and the best of the lot, tapori Nandu Bhide(Abhishek Bachchan)who must team up for the mission. Enter Magic Mohini(Deepika)the bar dancer besotted with English and English- speaking men, who teaches them some killer dance moves without knowing their 'undercover' intentions.<br/><br/>The drama unfolds through a routine of countless dance sequences and sometimes the humor seems too feeble to sustain the momentum of the plot.The template is decidedly of a heist, but Farah,being such an ace choreographer,fails to cash-in on the opportunity to make us root for the dances.Things shape for the good post interval when the narrative switches to the scenic Dubai which is ravishingly captured with all its glorious and sprawling sky-crappers.It goes without saying that the writers must have kept the school-going kids in their mind when scripting the heist plan.It's too simplistic and over-explanatory.Equally un-cool are the racist digs at the Koreans who compete with our India-waale or the way this team hacks into the voting results and beats a children's' team.Farah degrades the quality of the jokes with too much of crassness.<br/><br/>While Farah Khan focuses on delivering entertainment not compromising on the budget, the movie seems a long drag.But yes,there is a generous dose of laughter which gets more effervescent with the camaraderie projected by the six oddballs,romance which is fueled by the sparks between Charlie and Mohini, melodrama which is stirred by a backstory spawning the revenge and lastly, a climactic dash of patriotism evident in the form of the spirit of dance.<br/><br/>Considering her earlier works like the regressive Tees Maar Khan,Happy New Year is a conscious improvement and relies on the enviable ensemble who pump a lot of energy into the proceedings. At the helm of affairs is SRK whose evergreen charm and eight-pack abs do the trick.Deepika looks gorgeous and oozes dollops of sensuality despite going overboard with her emotions and 'engliss'.My heart goes out to Abhisek Bachchan who is delightful in his comic avatar and tickles your funny bone with the goofy Boman Irani.While it appears that the lad Vivaan Shah has a long way to graduate as an actor, it is Sonu Sood who holds on to sanity despite showing off his well-chiseled torso. Cast in a negative role, Jackie Shroff is convincing and adds a suave streak to his persona. Farha also gathers her routine fav-boys for cameo including brother Sajid,Dino Morea, Vishal Dadlani and even Anurag Kashyap.<br/><br/>At a long running time of 2 hours and 59 minutes, Happy New Year is meander of a journey - only meant for the SRK-crazy fans and the optimists who feel that Farah Khan sincerely carries the legacy of the Manmohan Desai brand of cinema !"

"marirebch","3","2","3","10 February 2015"," Come on, sexism out
","Last year, Deepika Padukone made a fuss because an Indian newspaper had published an article that mentioned her clothing. She said that women shouldn't be judged by the clothes they're wearing, the newspaper said that they had photos of her wearing even less clothing, and to that Deepika replied that those were photos she had agreed to be taken, and that one thing was her characters and another her as a person. So why am I bringing this up right now? I love Deepika, I love her feminist attitude and the feminist roles she plays. But the, we have Mohini. What is the most disappointing to me about Happy New Year it's not the terrible script or the lack of acting, but Mohini's character. Deepika Padukone, one of the most famous Indian actresses right now has a change to be a role model, to let little girls admire her, and she chooses a character like Mohini, who is portrayed like an English-phile, who only wants someone to love her. Come on India, it's 2015, just grow up! It's great that Deepika denounced sexist acts such as what that newspaper did, but she should carry that to screen too, where she could make the most impact. Women like Mohini shouldn't be portrayed on film anymore because she's not a person, she's basically a live cardboard. Women are complex and wild, some are love crazed, some only want to study. It's time that we start seeing real women on screen, and I thought this was Deepika's goal too."

The actors were terrible except for Abhishek who did surprisingly well. <br/><br/>All in all, not worth watching at all and I really feel bad for Bollywood audience who made this movie a success which only result in many more crappier movies like these.

","I went to the cinema to watch this film with our family friend, hoping it to be a good film as Om Shanti Om (also directed by Farah Khan), but the film turned out be heavily flawed. The same story that is common in Bollywood is repeated, so don't expect any new thing in this film.<br/><br/>All the songs are bad and forgettable except for 'Lovely'. The lyrics are senseless.<br/><br/>But why I gave this film 5 out of 10 stars is mostly because of its entertainment value in the first half and its technical brilliance. The film manages to entertain you for the first half but with old sense of humor. So it can be kept as a third option if you don't have any other movie. The cinematography was splendid and colorful as most of the films nowadays have dull and dark approach. Moreover, the editing was also one of the finest I have seen. Many sequences were quite good and smooth rather than highly flawed shaky, blink and miss shots.<br/><br/>What also saves the film from being a total disaster is its use of characters. Each and every main character has an equal and significant role throughout the film which makes them a bit memorable.<br/><br/>So overall, it is an only average film and that too because of the bad story and script. The story is the main component of the film and if the story is senseless, then all other aspects of the film are wasted, and this very film is a good example of it.<br/><br/>Farah Khan wasted her money on this project and she could have made a movie 100 times better than this one."

The movie is good with its whole graphics thing,it looks too good,too colorful.But the story line is mixed up of ""Ocean 11/12"" and it can't copy that exactly.

","This movie is only waste of time. The senior guy Shahrukh should now act as a grand grand parent than the main hero. His age is clearly visible in his dance moves and close-ups. Compared to Tees Maar kha, this is Farah khan's new record of doing worst movies. Her capability is beyond the cast and crew. I believe to show shahrukh better, farah has purposely asked other crew to under perform. That has reduced the overall entertain value. Rather i will say there is no entertain value of this movie. The acting of boman irani is surprisingly low. And the acting of abhishek bacchan is better. As i said this must be the direction gimmick to show aged shahrukh better. for die hard fan of shahrukh khan this may be another way to waste money. i will suggest to give that money to some orphanage rather then promoting such movies."

"raveesh-shenoy","2","5","12","5 November 2014"," Outstanding movie with an other-wordly charm; This is what makes bollywood unique and special!
","An outstanding movie that typifies what Bollywood is supposed to be about and reinforces the other-worldly, unique charm that is pervasive in Hindi movies of its standing and genre. I observe nothing but negative reviews aplenty for the movie and I have one thing to tell all the nay-sayers. With a unique and perceptive thinking blueprint as a viewing lens, this movie will blow your mind. Happy New Year is not about about the destination, it is about the journey. And I want to share this blueprint with you all. The movie is primarily about creating a journey for the viewer; At any juncture, the circumstances will transform you into a virtual world infused with memories, instigate vivid imagination and fill your heart with feelings of love, wonder, anger, disgust. So allow yourself to be flexible and offer your emotions to be dipped hither and thither; Arm your imagination with wondrous fluidity, for this is a hugely important aspect of this blueprint. If you disrupt this thought journey by demanding the justification of the logical flow of the movie or it's character development, you will reduce your experience to unpleasantness and regret of having spent three precious hours of your life. Engage and indulge yourself in a virtual higher level flow that is created by YOU, using all your senses and which the movie feeds through its beautiful cinematography, inspiring locations, pretty women, macho men, great songs and crisp background music. Use the laughter in the theater and grimaces in the audience along with the other elements in the movie, to make yourself chuckle, wriggle, laugh; And infuse the virtual flow with wondrous momentum and catapult your imagination. The movie is riddled with exaggerated and dramatic responses for simple situations, which almost seems like it is a caricature or a parody of human reactions; And it does so in such a manner that it seems unpretentious and deliberate. While indulging in this virtual world and measuring your responses towards the emotional creations in the movie, it almost seems like the movie mocks you for showing seriousness and delivers a disruptive message to all of us; Our short time in this complex adaptive world should be about light heartedness, wonder and passion rather than seriousness, sadness or painful longing. The movie starts with a moment of awe at the herculean display of fireworks and right then it is very clear what the journey is all about. The brilliantly shot celebratory ritual of smashing a high hanging pot that is typical of Janmashtami, is close to every Indian and is well utilized to introduce one of the protagonist. Emotions are hurled around while interspersed with elements of surprise and shock just like a new year firework display exploding in the sky after provoking wondrous anticipation. This is demonstrated in a tense moment where nervous excitement arising from a simultaneous dance display of two competitors is transformed into a very touching moment induced by a show of bravery and selflessness. The lavish, colorful and celebratory atmosphere at the eve of the dance finale that forms the fabric for the impromptu dances from different cultures, is an inspired creation. Artistically choreographed athletic duels in the lucid arena of dirty brown muddy water or on the altitudes of a high rise, recreates in a specific modern setting, the feel of the combat between Arjun and Duryodhan in the Mahabharatha. I urge the movie goer to drop all notions about the conventional structure that highlights movies nowadays and go see this movie with an open mind and an open heart!"

"saytosandeep","6","4","9","26 October 2014"," MY REVIEW: Happy But Nothing New!!
","Happy New Year. After debacle called Tees Maar Khan, Farah Khan teams up with Shahrukh Khan again and result is similar to their last venture Om Shanti Om. Happy New Year makes you feel happy but there is nothing new or fresh about it.<br/><br/>Fortunately movie has a plot to talk about where a team of losers led by Shahrukh himself plan a heist while faking themselves as a dancing group. Movie has its moments because Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone has got a knack for comic timing and their characters make you chuckle. Farah Khan in her usual spoof style film making creates few moments of laugh as well as irritation.<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan is here in his comfort zone but an actor like him should aim much better at this stage of his career. Sonu Sood seems pretty uncomfortable in comic avatar. Boman Irani is competent as usual. Movie is around half an hour extra long. The first hour could have been easily trimmed for more impact.<br/><br/>I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Happy New Year. If you don't mind brainless entertainers in the name of cinema, Happy New Year might satisfy you."

","Happy New Year was a typical bran-less , nonsensical entertainer which could be a time-pass if you have least expectation from the movie and ofcouse if you don't have anything to do.<br/><br/>After his father is being duped by a diamond merchant, Charlie avenges the false charges implied on his father by pulling off a diamond heist with help of inexperienced yet brave laggards.<br/><br/>Farah Khan does a decent comeback with Happy New Year after giving us the disastrous Tees Maar Khan. HNY starts off with routine song and dance with little melodrama embedded into it. Once Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone enters the scene , movie becomes interesting and hilarious. However , the film loses the steam subsequently and leaves no impact at the later reel. In fact , it becomes unbearable that you wish you could press the forward button . Direction is lame with minute focus on screenplay at all. Sometimes you feel that you are watching some old 90's cinema with typical masala ingredients to make a blockbuster movie. Cinematography is efficient. Action scenes are hilarious and larger than life. Art direction is good.Editing should be done efficiently. Dialogues are just about OK. Performances by the entire starcast is commendable. Sharukh Khan does fine job as the team leader. Boman Irani and Sonu Sood are good. But it is Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone who are the soul of the film and they make it watchable. Music by Vishal Shekhar is good. <br/><br/>Happy New year is a movie which has decent story , no direction and simply no screenplay. As I mentioned , it is just a watchable time pass thanks to wonderful performances by the star cast. Above average : 2.75/5"

"sawan-nathwani","3","6","16","24 October 2014"," Wish there was something New
","Advice to the Happy New Year Team: What not to do when making a movie: 1. SRK you need to realise that past glory is a PAST. You cant have ""Picture tau abhi baki hain, choti choti baatien, baade bade ba ba black sheep in all your movies"" 2. Exotic locations doesn't have the entertainment value. 3. 6 pack abs is a passé. Almost all of you ""actors"" have it. 4. Deepika you no longer need ITEM songs. You are a great actor. Probably the only one who acted in the movie. 5. The fight scenes should look realistic. A punch in a reel should resemble a punch in real life. 6. SRK you don't need to potray in the movies that people love you, people adore you. They do it in real life. 7. Don't make the thrill too obvious. 8. Expletives don't pull the crowd. Expletives doesn't denote that you can act. 9. The brand placement should be subtle. They should not get more time frame than 3 seconds. Minimal to be used. If you think you can make money by giving brands a space in your movie, you are not sure of the work that you do. You do not have the confidence that the audience will appreciate your movie which would be sufficient to cover up the benefits of the in brand placements."
"tharindu-ssl","4","12","40","24 October 2014"," Only good thing is Abhishek Bachchan
","Before the movie, I had read reviews and had very low expectations. But the first half of the movie was really funny. There are so many out of place and mismatch contents yet it kept the audience laughing. Not that the jokes are original or very well thought. Creators put in all they can and it is like watching a cartoon. How can you not laugh when you watch cartoon . So if it's the entertainment you seek, first half of the movie is for you. Abhsihesk Bachchan is shining and he gives the most entertainment. Also references to other movies are okay, funny. <br/><br/>But then the life of the movie drops significantly in the second half. Other than one or two jokes here and there, there is nothing to keep you entertained. You want to get it over with but the movie drags on trying to justify the heist and why the characters are involved in it. There is unnecessary fight between Charlie (played by SRK) and a Korean where Charlie's team does not come to help despite the risk involved in the fight. <br/><br/>The patriotic angle of the movie is forced on. SRK does what he does in all the movies. His signature all over the movie. Some dance is like actually you are watching a SRK Live in concert. In a song they make all other actors raise their arms like SRK always do. How a leading actor like Abhishek falls to that level is so sad. In fact most of the scenes involving SRK looks very familiar. <br/><br/>In the theater I was watching, there was a technical error and movie was stuck before it's last 10 minutes. It took some 5 minutes to fix and resume play but meanwhile many people had started to walk off as they were waiting for it to be over and took the tech error as an excuse to do so. Film being too long actually overshadows some rare key points in the movie. <br/><br/>Finally, expect SRK does some meaningful movie. After all, he is an actor who has given some memorable movies. Riding that success to do movies like CE, HNY is so sad. <br/><br/>I give 4 stars. 3 stars to the comic flow in the first half and 1 star to Abhishek Bachchan."

","Happy New Year, one of the most anticipated flicks of the year comes smashing the records over and over again, but is this heist movie really worth the overpriced tickets? 'A Farah Khan film', the tag that thrilled everyone about 7 years ago, came as a downer 4 years ago when her disaster Tees Maar Khan. With the reunion of SRK-Farah-Deepika, it was touted to be Om Shanti Om part ii, however, post the lackluster trailer and songs, for me, the movie was an absolute downer, a Tees Maar Khan part ii, maybe. However, the opinions changed after watching the film last night.<br/><br/>Adding the emotional touch of framed dad, and his son taking revenge with his 'Angels' and a probable love interest, the story is simple a one-liner. But you can't expect more from a masala entertainment. What is actually good about the movie is its grandeur, something I have loved Farah for. This is perhaps bigger than even Om Shanti Om in terms of grandeur. There are some genuine comic scenes which will leave you in splits, but most of them are over done. The heist scenes are copied from random Hollywood movies. Action scenes are engaging. Farah appears to be in a full fangirl mode. The dance tutor scene specially looks like a parody of ""Shake It Off"" video.<br/><br/>All in all, it is much like Dhoom 3, having an upper hand in action and comedy, while lower hand in conveying emotions.<br/><br/>What really holds the movie is its star cast. However, even there it is flawed. Shahrukh was overburdened with responsibilities of the script- less movie which he had to carry on his shoulders and his abs. Abhishek comes out as a surprise in this movies, having had string of annoying performances after Guru. Boman is fantastic as ever, though his accent was annoying in the beginning. Vivaan makes a good debut. Deepika, was most the cheerful part of the film, but her role is limited as a sidekick, not one that people would remember her for.<br/><br/>Hence, to clarify, this movie is far from horrible, but isn't good too (as expected!).

"anshulpurohit","3","0","0","19 May 2017"," Most disappointing SRK movie I have watched
","Before this movie came out, I had high expectations from Farah Khan and SRK combination because they delivered Main Hoon Na (an ode to the 70s in a cheesy manner but a well-made movie with a good message and emotions). I do accept that I had some really good laughs in this movie but if I were to isolate them from the story, the movie itself is riddled with so many factual inaccuracies and plot holes that it could easily go down as one of the worst SRK movies in his entire career. This kind of movie making huge dividends at the box office is a sure sign that Indian audience need to rise above their star fad and give way to intelligent movies. 2014 witness some good movies too but they were all drowned by the SRK stamp during the year. One of the reasons for my disappointment with this movie was that it was shot in Dubai (which is a nice thing) but it fed all the stereotypes that Indians have about Dubai. SRK is a highly revered Bollywood actor among the Emiratis and this was one of his chance to showcase the glamour and glitz of Bollywood by taking UAE as a base and showing correct things about the country (since he is one of the brand ambassadors for Dubai) but this was by far one of the disgrace he has shown to the country. Few examples of this such as saying that the law for theft in Dubai is chopping off hands (which is wrong) and, in the ending, the Dubai police would never take an accused to the police car in front of public. I could go on and on criticizing this movie not because it was a horrible movie but because such movies made money and audience do not even object such nonsense and it showed the city in a bad light. If we see any misrepresentation of India in any Hollywood movie, we make it a personal offense and start boycotting, doing Twitter trolls and make mountain out of molehill then why should we bad- mouth or downgrade another city / country. <br/><br/>I also heard that the script of this movie was selected in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. I am happy for that. This movie is a testament for the budding film-makers on how not to make such a trash movie like this."

","So big deal, the movie had a lot of cliche's in it. No one cares about that in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. You sort of expect it. I enjoyed this movie because it was ""entertaining"" and took me away from all the depressing things I see on a regular basis in life. Just seeing Shah Rukh Khan dancing in a pink tutu and jumping into the arms of Sonu Sood was enough to make me laugh out loud. I mean, c'mon, how can you not laugh at scenes like that, which by the way had the piano tune, ""The Entertainer"" playing in the background, or Shah Rukh Khan dressed like Jackie Chan, sparring with a Korean dude, while ""Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting"" is playing? <br/><br/>Okay, it started out as a well planned heist for revenge, but turned out to be, for me and for ""Charlie,"" a story that made me feel good about 6 people who were willing to put themselves out there and won the respect and applause from all those people that had originally booed them and treated them disrespectfully. It was one of those movies that made you happy to see the the underdog win! <br/><br/>I'm not from India, I'm Italian, but during this movie, I found myself cheering on ""Team India"" primarily because they were so proud of their country and their heritage. Not only that, the music and dancing was great! It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while, so I bought the soundtrack...and the movie.<br/><br/>""Happy New Year"" was definitely a ""feel good"" movie. I don't think the movie was meant to be this epic drama. Leave that to ""Devdas"" and ""Kal Ho Naa Ho."" It was meant to be a fun, happy, musical movie that left you energized and proud of your country and it's people! We need more of that in our world!"

Grover, with his rich and despicable mind, labeled Charlie's father, Manohar Sharma (Anupam Kher) as a thief because Charan had conned him into stealing his own Diamonds (he stole his own diamonds and framed Sharma for stealing them) priced at INR 100 crore ($15 million). Charlie finds out through the media that diamonds worth $300 crore will reach the Atlantis Hotel on Christmas Eve. He wants to steal the same diamonds and frame Grover. To accomplish this, he must assemble a dynamic team.<br/><br/>First in his team is Former Army Bomb Squad Captain Jagmohan Prakash, or Jag (Sonu Sood) who has a hearing deficiency which happened when he failed to defuse a bomb; he gets furious when someone insults his mother. Second on his team is Tehmton Irani, or Tammy, (Boman Irani) who is an overweight jogger and suffers from epileptic fits. It is also revealed that Tammy and Manohar were best friends. Third on the team is Rohan Singh (Vivaan Shah), a young hacker who Charlie believes can hack into Shalimar's computerized system. He is also Jag's nephew. After thoroughly researching about the vault, the team finds the main vault comprises a bio metric lock (fingerprint lock). The problem is that only one person can access the vault at any time.<br/><br/>The team heads to a warehouse which was originally their workshop for a rehearsal. It is revealed that Tammy was immensely in love with the Shalimar vault and he is the only one to open the vault without the combination. The real Shalimar vault has a laser shield in front of the vault whose code combination is changed everyday. The team finds out a weakness that the Shalimar safe is in the Altantis hotel underground which is connected through an air duct system which is further connected to room 9C, a lounge room in Atlantis. Charlie then explains a problem, being that room 9C is booked for a team participating in the World Dance Championship (WDC), a dancing competition. The group refuses, but Charlie re-motivates the group, convincing them to become a dance team."

","Only reason I decided to watch this, was because it looked like it was getting a lot of hype about it and it appeared in Netflix. Also, probably because this movie has SRK(king of Bollywood) and Deepika (super pretty). This movie is basically a stupid comedy. You know, those types of movies, where everything is just so stupid, you can not help but laugh. It did attempted to be a drama and a romance but, with the sudden switches between these themes, it was difficult to take it seriously. Most of the romance were silly clichÃ©s, as well.The silly theme of love at first stuff. Also, it keep showing the main guys' shirtless all the time.I know its probably to get female views because of them have six packs, but it was too much. And not in the way ""omg its too much, i can not control myself"". More like ""are you kidding me, how does this make sense). Two good things about the film is Deepika's outfits (I want them) and the ending dance. That's why my rating is a 5."

","If you're an avid viewer of Bollywood movies, you'd naturally anticipate revenge and romance in the regular commercial movies. The story of ""Happy New Year"" also does revolve around the revenge of the hero and a brief romance; but the thing more in this movie is a scheme on heist. The scheme isn't very different from the popular Hollywood action flick ""The Italian Job"" in which a group of five with different capabilities plan a heist. The scheme of ""Happy New Year"" consists of many improbabilities and many unlovable characters. The stunts are unbelievable, characters are a bit card board, and the film stretches on and on. Had the film focused on the heist only, the film could have been a tight entertainer though a copy of a Hollywood movie. The biggest flaw of the film was the very regular type cast characters, like Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, or Shahrukh Khan himself. The characters and their jokes or emotions don't offer much of novelty. Despite this, the film remains partly watchable for the nice flow maintained in the story and nice songs and dance numbers. Anyway, this is not a movie I would love to watch again.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 stars out of 4"

","Come on people. It's OK. Let's admit it. Happy New Year is a terrible film. Did I laugh? Yes. Do I regret going to see it with my friends? No. Did I have fun watching it? Yes!<br/><br/>But the movie is just plain bad. I won't totally trash it. The good parts - Abhishek was very funny, the fight scenes were nicely choreographed, and SRK took his shirt off a number of times. The mindless jokes had my friends and I cracking up at times. But the negative aspects of the film - well, I'm assuming IMDb has some maximum word count, so I will not even attempt to list those things. However, I will say the absolute worst part of this film was the patriotism organism that exploded randomly in the last 10 minutes of the film. Just... there are no words.<br/><br/>Here's some solid advice: if you want to enjoy this movie, turn you brain off. By this I don't mean suspend a need to analyze every aspect of the plot, I mean, literally, turn your brain off. All the way off. Don't think at all. Thinking during this film could be a health hazard. The moment your brain turns on, it could explode from the insane amount of plot holes, inconsistencies, mindlessness, and most of all the awful clichÃ©d dialogues. But be warned, the movie tips the 3 hour mark - so this is no simple feat. If you can turn your brain off in this way, AND if you like the actors, you will enjoy this movie (although you might leave the theater missing a few IQ points). I enjoyed it for that reason. However, if you don't have this power, or if you're not a fan of the actors, I would not recommend this film."

","Well one of the biggies from Bollywood has reached cinemas to ignite the spark already we have in the country with all the celebrations connected with the festival of lights and crackers in full swing. As expected, the film has lavish sets and foreign visuals, rich & colorful feel with vibrant costumes and above all the towering presence of the Badshah from Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan. But other than these and other than what the trailers showed, Happy New Year directed by Farah Khan has nothing much to offer content wise. <br/><br/>The story mixed with humor and revenge has a heist backdrop and that is quite common in Bollywood these days with every superstar becoming part of such plots now. Charlie /ChandraMohan Manohar Sharma (Shah Rukh), Nandu (Abhishek Bachchan), Mohini (Deepika), Jagmohan (Sonu Sood), Tammy (Boman Irani) and Rohan (Vivaan Shah) are the six people or rather losers who are the participants of World Dance Competition in Dubai with a hidden agenda. How these losers become the ultimate winners is what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>For a festive season, people looking for a mass film of this magnitude,HNY might be more than enough to satisfy their entertainment quotient but as a cinema other than technical finesse and rich visuals this is not a great film and perhaps if you leave your logical side of the brain at home before taking off to theaters, there are chances that you might be able to enjoy this stuff that has nothing much in terms of any unexpected twists and turns. <br/><br/>The biggest highlight and life of the film even with the negative aspects is of course SRK. He brings that much needed color to the film when the proceedings becomes tiring. So it is more of a Shah Rukh Khan show all packed in a predictable and clichÃ©d Bollywood film with all the mass elements. Abhishek was comical but went overboard at times. Deepika was sexy and charming, Boman Irani was funny well supported by Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah. Jackie Shroff as the baddie was stylish. <br/><br/>On the technical aspects, cinematography, edits, choreography and background score were impressive. Also the costume designer deserves praise for coming out with such varied and colorful costumes to give some richness to the overall feel. I wouldn't say Vishal Shekhar has done a bad job in composing the songs but they were not impressive either.<br/><br/>Overall this three hour film is just an entertainer and a one time watchable one apt for a festive season with nothing much to rave about in terms of content. Whether you want to watch it and whether it will make you Happy or not it's up to you to watch and decide.<br/><br/>P.S - Please don't miss out the end title credits. There is something special out there."

If you are willing to just watch it for a good laugh and some great music, then you will definitely enjoy Happy New Year. I have seen this movie multiple times and I still laugh at some of the scenes. And not just a smirk or chuckle, a serious laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The music is both fun and beautiful ( Manwa Laage is my favorite) and will make you want to dance. Deepika looks beautiful and lovable as her character. Sonu Sood is hilarious without trying hard and SRK just looks like a tall glass of wine (that beard needs to stay on ALL the time, super sexy) Personally I wasn't dead set on having a perfect plot and the perfect story. I was just watching it for fun and it was great. And it actually is funnier the second time you watch it. Just go for it, ENJOY!"
"coolboy20112012","6","3","12","27 October 2014"," A below average movie
","The movie which is starring SRK is surely to be watchable. But this movie is too much boring from starting to the end.Everything is so predictable that u can tell it by seeing the previous scene.Usually Farah khan movie is good to watch because of its comedy timing and no humor is there.But sometime comedy means not only the physical comedy it also means the comedy diolauge which is truly lacking in this movie. The movie is good with its whole graphics thing,it looks too good,too colorful.But the story line is mixed up of ""Ocean 11/12"" and it can't copy that exactly. I recommended that not watch this movie because its a total time waste of 3 hours but if u are a true fan of SRK then go watch it once for ShahRukh Khan."

There is hardly a 2 min climax if thats what you wanna call it. <br/><br/>Direction and editing are pathetic, i don't know how this movie got such a good opening.

Acting also gave it away well maybe not for Boman Irani who like always developed his character. Deepika I think was again the same one from Chennai Express with her talking style. I just have one question to Farah how can Jackie Shroff not see that his son has a look alike when posters of Abhishek Bachan are on the skyscrapers of Dubai.

","It's a wonderful movie: action mixed with original humor and great screenplay and acting. The fight scenes are really delectable and each character has been carefully crafted. The character portrayed by Deepika, a dancer and wanna-be dance teacher, is simply wonderful! Her obsession with people who speak English is hilarious,but that has a significant message, reflecting how missed dreams can influence our hearts...She is also the target of SRK three times when the latter talks in a humiliating manner about her, while she has silently approached him and stood behind his back. That's a funny moment even if we see Deepika breaking into tears...<br/><br/>Regarding the story, the theme of stealing precious stones is found in Bang Bang as well, and at one point, I got the impression that it's a bad timing to release these 2 films close to each other! Also, I find that the title is not appropriate, as it does not correspond to the theme. When we hear of ""Happy New Year"", we tend to anticipate that the movie will be about some end-of year celebrations; but this is not at all the case! However, I feel that this is an actual habit in Bollywood...if we refer to Bang Bang and even Kick, for example. <br/><br/>But, in the end, well done to all! This film is a must-see!"

Happy New Year is her comeback film,again reuniting with Srk and Deepika Padukone, alongwith Abhishek Bachchan,Sonu Sood,Boman Irani.etc The mantra is simple...Diwali time so such big films with big stars, huge canvas works big time and earn 100 crores at the Box Office whether it has substance or not The film does have a plot but it's nothing great, it mixes elements from The Italian Job(remade as Players which also starred Abhishek) and several more films. The filmmaker also adds her own 70s tribute formula and several scenes have references to several films. Farah also adds dance in the film, in a way she tries every masala on the shelf. The film is very lengthy, clocking at 3 hours 8 minutes which is too long, however several scenes are well handled like Srk-Jackie confrontation, even the robbery is handled well though it does look too easy at times. There are several problems too like cringeworthy comedy at times, also several silly scenes.<br/><br/>Direction is decent, though writing is nothing great Music is decent, except Manwa Laage most of the other songs are routine<br/><br/>Shahrukh Khan gets to display his 8 pack abs and does well in his part, nothing out of the world but good, Don't be mistaken if you see him in the nomination list of filmfare awards afterall thats how it works. Deepika Padukone is good in her role which is nothing great Abhishek Bachchan gets to display his comic antics and does a good job in both the roles, he is improving in comedy no doubt Boman Irani is good in his role,Sonu Sood is good in his role which is hardly demanding more then showing his body Jackie Shroff gets less scope and is okay Anupam Kher has a blink and miss role, Vivaan Shah makes a good debut though he gets hardly anything to do"

That says it all about the quality quotient to the script and attempt at humor.<br/><br/>Imagine Boman Irani, Sonu Sood and Vivaan (hardly a dancing phenomena) representing India in World Dance Competition.<br/><br/>Sonu Sood, the macho man of the movie, doing his fight sequences as if he inherited it all from Charlie Chaplin himself. And his responsibility in the grand theft being left to turning water pipe levers.<br/><br/>Boman Irani, who is the sole quality performer in the movie, having to contribute to the choreography in WDC eliminators with a slurry of fit, which ends up becoming a rage of hit.<br/><br/>Abhishek was excellent, but am afraid he might end up stereotyping himself if he doesn't take up better characters. He is the man who played lead in Guru and Yuva, and he needs to remind himself of that versatile ability.<br/><br/>Vivaan the hacker, who doesn't look like having seen enough summers, being the brainiest of the lot who can hack anything under the sun.<br/><br/>Shahrukh falling to deeper and deeper abyss with his 'i-m-the-greatest- actor' acting mode which he is in of late. Guess who is hamming Shahrukh these days.... Shahrukh himself. <br/><br/>Deepika was OK. Sincere in her acting and gracious in her dance.<br/><br/>The comedy dialogs in first half are right off from the unrefined evening discussions over coffee of the script writers.<br/><br/>Jackie was forgettable.<br/><br/>Lastly, Farah and Shahrukh and others need to remember that the youngest generation of the country blindly follows some of the big names in the movie. So they should show some decency and behave responsibly instead of emptying their carts of cheap and at-times ghastly dialogs in the movie. Strangely, they are different people, when propagating and PRing their movie on various TV channels and serials and appealing to kids and parents and elder ones alike to come and watch their movie. But then, if they felt responsible towards their influence on the young ones, they wouldn't make such cheap brash humor anyways.<br/><br/>Second half was exciting at times, but largely due to Abhishek and Deepika and Boman. The so-called King is in his own virtual empire at the moment, even when shooting. And Farah is challenging her own brother. Lets hope they both call it truce, and stop competing err.. making movies any more.<br/><br/>Highly doubt such movies can make the millions they mention that they are making. Potential possibilities such as labeling funds from other sources to legit revenue, comes to mind."

","Happy New Year: One of the most celebrated festive season across the world, where everyone greets to welcome the new changes in their lives. So that much expectation we might have in this musical heist drama, which delivered almost in some sequences not in terms of plot. Directed by Choreographer cum Director Farah Khan, she knows the pulse of the masses by capturing the biggest star of the bollywood, some inspiring ideas from previous films(irrespective of whether it is bollywood or Hollywood) and spicy-masala dish is ready to serve. Coming to performances, Shah Rukh Khan(as Chandramohan Sharma aka Charlie) he looks great in his physique avatar but if compare to earlier Farah film's, the charm seems to have faded down. But in the emotional sequences he over shines everyone. Abhishek Bachchan(as Nandu and Vicky Grover) finally he got the certificate of acting(i hope its not fake) he is super funny and entertains through his gestures. His role should be more lengthier and meatier, but the last sequence in the vault is hilarious. Deepika Padukone(as Mohini) she looks great, almost similar character of Chennai Express but it is no where compare to that role which was exceptional. Boman Irani(as Tammy) he was the show stealer with his perfect parsi accent and hilarious in his sequences. Sonu Sood(as Jag) he was just average, nothing much to deliver except some few introduction sequences. Vivaan Shah(as Rohan) he is completely wasted as an amateur hacker. Jackie Shroff(as Charan Grover) he was fine in his part. Story is kept simple(SRK keeps saying this ""Keep it Simple""),nothing new in it. If you have seen heist films like Ocean's Eleven,Tower Heist,Italian Job etc. then there is nothing new in the heist plans and execution. Screenplay is good in bits and pieces where in the first portion they are unintentionally funny scenes. Even if they forces you to laugh, your mouth doesn't even smile for it. Second portion is much better than first with some good sequences to remember. There is a sequence which is totally illogical, why you need a helipad to do dance rehearsal? Were all the rooms in atlantis were booked? or you just want to showcase amateur kung fu hustle types stunts between SRK and a Korean man(the action was good but unintentional). Music is good by Vishal-Shekhar but not as good as OSO. Verdict: **.5 stars On the whole, it is a complete family entertainer but in bits and pieces with some good hilarious moments. Abhishek and Boman are to watch out for, they are hilarious in their sequences. Irrespective of what the reviews are, moviegoers will watch it for SRK as it has been made for his fans. Even it is a multi starrer film. If watched it will remind you of many good entertainers and if skipped will not make you feel about missing out something important. Still missing the SRK of 90's(only the evil side)."

It is a pathetic with it's vomit eating scenes, male stripping scenes, burps, fake accents and what not. The only grace is the India Waale song and a scene or 2 in between. The first half is a headache! How on earth did Farah Khan make this after Main Hoon Naa and Om Shanti Om! I thought after TEES MAAR KHAN she must have learnt a lesson. Sorry, I am in no mood to write anything about the non existent plot and non existent acting from any of the actors in the movie. I will just vent out my anger and frustration at the ""KING-KHAN"" of Bollywood who now has to resort to Heavy Marketing and fake ratings to make his DUD movies work.

"aksnameg","4","1","12","29 October 2014"," WHY Farah WHY?
","OK first thing first, I am here to rant about the new assault on our senses brought about by the most expensive holiday advertisement for Dubai a.k.a Happy New Year. I think Farah Khan thinks her audiences are a stupid bunch and I think she might be right. After all we do go to the theater and spend our hard(ly) earned money on those expensive movie tickets, obligatory and overtly expensive sodas, candy and popcorn. Boman Irani plays a Parsi middle aged man who still lives with his mother and surprisingly is the hottie of the society. Sonu Sood is the all brawn no brains guy who can hear through only one ear and gets crazy mad, huffing and puffing like he is in a gym lifting a really heavy barbell #nuffsaid. Abhishek Bachchan is neither brawn nor brains but he drops his pants in the movie (no ladies, no sawariya happening here) and oddly the only guy who is slightly funny in this anesthesia fest. I won't be too harsh on the young Vivaan Shah playing the nerdy hacker who is socially awkward especially around women (talk about stereotypes), it is his second film and no one would pass up an opportunity to stand next to this cast. Deepika Padukone does what she was supposed to do, sing songs, dance sexy, look pretty, act dumb, shed some tears, fall in love with SRK and be Kamlee (hihi see what I did there). Jackie Shroff looks good as a baddie daddy but that's all I can say for it. Last but not least SRK plays the young man named Charlie who is also a Boston university topper (so we know that he is very smart) but works in a dinghy, muddy fight club as a fighter dude (so we know that he is strong). Somehow, we make through to the end of the movie where everything is right with the world, all wrongs have been corrected and the cast is dressed in sparkly costumes dancing away to glory in midst of fireworks, platforms that lift up in the air (ooohh fancy) and all that razzle-dazzle. Finally, this brain numbing movie comes to an end and the audience is left dumbfounded by what just happened to them! To all those people who are ranting on the internet about how bad this movie was, please remember guys we did this to ourselves, we knew what was going to happen but we still went on hoping against all odds that this movie would be something else. We sat there coz SRK, we cried internally and got brain bleed coz SRK and we came out of the theater feeling dead inside coz SRK. At least there were abs, all 8 of them. P.S. This is in no way to disrespect anyone's feelings, I love SRK and I am a huge fan of all the other actors in the movie, in fact, I like Main hoon na and Om Shanti Om a lot but I couldn't help talking about Happy new year. As a true blue SRK fan, I would say just go and watch it for yourself. Maybe you will feel differently, though I doubt it."

","I used to be a solid SRK fan until couple of years back but some of his recent movies like Chennai Express and now HNY has made me realize that he cannot be an actor/entertainer anymore. His big lifestyle demands colossal money spinners with unabashed budgets. This means , most of the time no-brain movies which makes absolutely no sense at all and are sometimes downright insulting. Happy New Year is one such movie. Although I did not expect a cult classic from Farah Khan when I went to the theater, I surely did not expect the low standards that the movie stooped into. Its such a low brow, poorly scripted tedious torture of a movie that you would just want to step out and get some fresh air. The clichéd tiring jokes which you might have seen a million times are run through this movie again to evoke laughs. The movie makes fun of epileptic people even going so low as to invent a signature dance move based on Boman Irani's character which is epileptic. There is no respect to women and every thought in this movie is parochial and stereotyped. From calling North Korean dance team 'Chilli Chicken' to a Bar dancer's poor English or the quaint Parsi accent , everything is unapologetically made fun of . People like Sajid and Farah should stick to what they are good at whatever it is and refrain from making movies. I regret wasting 3 torturous hours of my otherwise happy and fun Diwali 2014."

Her love for Sharukh Khan has again resulted in a movie that lacks a script at all, and something which she claims to be entertainment. Her love for melodrama and songs, has resulted in yet another disaster called Happy New Year. As she and her like minded directors always do - this movie is high on color and glamor, but has a poor script and dwells on low quality humor. Its the kind of humor which probably a low IQ person would only appreciate. Its a waste of money watching this movie. Please go and spend money on other movies. A consistent feature in such kind of movies is the minimal importance given to female actors. Deepika Padukone plays a dumb damsel in distress. I wonder why a female director would like to portray a female actor in such a light.

","I watched the movie first day. All the shows were houseful. When I first saw the trailer I was disappointed and I thought the movie would also be the same but I was wrong. The movie entertained from the beginning till the end. The movie was full of comedy but not only comedy it also had thrilling moments, action moments and many more. The film has many genres like Comedy, Drama, Heist, Musical, Thriller, Romance, Action, Revenge and Crime. The movie is for everyone. It is a family entertainer. Some people may find it crappy and non-brainer but it is a great movie. In the hall everyone was enjoying the movie. The movie keeps getting better in every scene. The movie couldn't break records because people like heroic type action comedy movies of Salman but I found the people enjoying it more than Kick. The movie would have created records if it would have released at the time of Om Shanti Om because at that time there were not many heist genres films and the script was ready at that time too. You will have a smile on your face throughout the entire movie. The acting was done very well by everyone. Abhishek Bachchan had surprised everyone by his great acting. The movie has many laugh out loud moments. The camera work was great too. It is a must watch for everyone specially the comedy fans."

I don't think that this film deserves 200 crores.<br/><br/>Good points<br/><br/>family entertainment- yes, many kids are fan of SRK and they went to theatre with their family. comedy- everyone loves comedy. who doesn't wants to laugh. music- there are many songs in this film.

"mumbhaaai","7","0","3","23 December 2014"," There's some things movies can tell, for everything else, there's documentaries.
","Research shows that when certain chemicals are released in the brain, you experience euphoria, happi(y)ness, feel elated (google more synonyms, my English has exhausted). How are the chemicals released? Certain activities such as being with good friends, laughing heartily for ""no reason"", being goofy, being funny, being bindaass, hugging your kids, eating chocolates, being in love. Note that all these things don't require any ""logic"", so to speak. But we still do it. Why? Because they make us happy.<br/><br/>Now, I want you to question me on providing you with evidence done on such a research. Truth is, I made it all up. Has there been any such research? I don't know. Frankly, I don't care. I just know that I feel amazing when I hug my son. I feel awesome when I meet my friends. I feel nice watching a happy film. It's to do with feel. You don't need research for everything in life to assure you of your actions.<br/><br/>Watching a Farah Khan film is exactly that. There's euphoria, there's excitement, there's fun, in short the movies are very high on EQ (Entertainment Quotient). Tees Maar Khan was an exception, I think Farah missed the point then, she had to have Khan in the film, not in the title. Anyways.<br/><br/>hny01<br/><br/>Pre-requisites for watching a Farah Khan flick<br/><br/>You have to know Bollywood and Movies.<br/><br/>Understanding the philosophy behind this ""Being Happy is Simple. But Being Simple is the Trick."" The movie starts off with the line in the promos, ""There are two kinds of people in this world, winners and losers. And every loser gets an opportunity to become a winner."" Something on those lines. It's a Heist Flick. What that means is there is a robbery to be done. The protagonist ""Charlie"", a Boston University topper with Eight Pack Abs has been waiting for 8 years for the right timing. He has long hair with a mustache and a beard and is in desperate need of a shower and a shave. (OMG, that reminds me of my bathroom renovation where I need one too). His fights are cool and there is slow motion muscle flexing for his introduction. All the characters are introduced one by one with a lot of homage to many Bollywood flicks (Read pre-requisite #1 above).<br/><br/>He starts getting his team together for a huge robbery and the only way to get to Dubai and execute the plan is through a dance competition. How the team pulls this act together is what the movie is all about. But you already knew this, didn't you?<br/><br/>Happi(y)ness Factor #1 – The Simplicity (Charlie's line – Dad used to say, Keep It Simple), that's exactly what it is. These guys are not heroes, not machos (chord na yaar), they have regular drawbacks, shortcomings and are plain and simple humans. They have weaknesses and how their weaknesses, in fact, become their strengths and a trademark is nicely done. Next time you have a job interview, remember to talk about your weakness in a way that displays strength. OK? Aha! Now all the pseudo-intellectuals can have their logic switch lights start to go on. a bit.<br/><br/>Happi(y)ness Factor #2 – The importance of having good ""attitude"" over ""aptitude"". Attitude will take you a long way, we know that, but when it comes to testing the waters, most people show bad attitude and they think their talent will be good enough. It's not. Learn to respect human relations, learn to respect your friends, families, your employer, your employees, your society and do it without expectations. It goes a reallyyyy long way. So does bad attitude. The whole idea of a healthy competition was nicely shown. Aha! Aha! Now, all the pseudo-intellectuals are jumping off their seats, as their logic switch lights start flickering.<br/><br/>Happi(y)ness Factor #3 – Having fun and being yourself. Not different, just yourself. If you're not having fun and if you're not being yourself, you're not doing it right. Unless you're SoDumb Kapoor, then you shouldn't be yourself. Then you are in desperate need of an upgrade. Anyways, fun brings out the enthusiasm, delivers results, and boosts team spirit. Management terms? Now me sounding intelligent? Aha! Everything sounds intelligent in English. Clap Clap! The idea is that you can convey serious messages by being funny. You can deliver results while having fun. It doesn't take away the message. In fact, it helps retain it. Go and watch this movie with your loved ones, let the happy chemicals in your brain release (wait, we agreed that was made up, or maybe not.) and just relax, loosen up and laugh a little. Don't wait for any research to assure you of your intelligence, your creativity and your idea of having fun, Kyuki, Zindagi Abhi Baaki Hai, Mere Dost. :-D"

","A typical commercial entertainer. The movie depicts plot of a gang of losers out to seek revenge and finally emerge winners. This movie of course is charming. When SRK is there, how can there be no charm. Deepika as the sexy and seductive yet innocent Mohini, definitely makes men go gaga over her. She has that charm to make her desirable yet admirable at the same time. Being at an age close to fifty, SRK proves tat his magical charms have yet not faded, the results of which are shown in the box office collections of the movie. Weak script, no plot and a worst movie by Farah Khan, is saved due to the presence of the mega star SRK. He once again proves that any movie will work and earn huge, when he is present in it.

And the most secure safe in the world I could not help it but laughing even my boarding room cupboard is secure than that :P. Even the safe owner itself not aware of the layout of the building that safe resides. Hacking with a just flash screen, those are just good for newbies. There are some scenes included humor, at least we can have a laugh forgetting the unrealistic plot. This is a typical example of how Bollywood movie would look like, in fact we could not expect more from them. <br/><br/>Aamir Khan maybe the only actor in Bollywood with some dignity, who concerns more on the quality of the production.

He utterly smashed his performance and superglues you to your seat. His famous quote in the movie was ""Nandu Bhide, Demak na firee"" (I'm Nandu Bhide and I've lost my mind!) He more than makes up for the 175 minute duration due to his quote and what he calls -world famous- snake dance. two other people entertained us in the movie, Boman Irani and, of course, Shah Rukh Khan.<br/><br/>The Heist plan in the film is well planned out and the film is full of twists and surprises into the second half. The first half tells us their ride up the mountain and the second half tells us how they go down. The first half length is fine but the second half is stretched too far, no kidding. But the second half did have more funny moments than the first half, unpredictability and Nandu Bhide, so it doesn't keep you bored. The film does have lots, I mean lots, of special appearances and the introduction scene to everyone are really funny.<br/><br/>The climax may be predictable to some while others won't have a clue, and finally Manwa laage, the best song in the album. Deepika comes 50 minutes into the film with ""Lovely"".<br/><br/>So Happy New Year Directed by Farah Khan and Starring Shahrukh, Deepika, sonu, abisheik, boman & Vivaan is WORTH A WATCH. 8/10 stars (4/5 stars)"

I told him he's a great actor if he can act stupid in front of the camera like that.""<br/><br/>Jaya Bachchan, star of acclaimed films like Abhimaan, Mili and Sholay, also said, ""I can't be part of what is being done in films these days and hence I don't do films anymore.""<br/><br/>Abhishek's character, Nandu Bhide, is seen in various get-ups and also performs what he calls a 'snakes dance' in the film. With co-stars Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Boman Irani, Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah, Abhishek plays a 'loser' who enters a dance championship in Dubai but really intends to rob a bank."

","Farah Khan has been known to make some good films but this one is definitely not one of them. The quintessential element that binds a movie together is the storyline. ""Happy new year"" lacks in it. Acting is mediocre at best. Direction is not that great either. I liked the songs but other than that the movie is not worth a watch. <br/><br/>Apart from that the movie seemed a culmination of several other prior films. Every step of it seemed predictable and not interesting. It's amazing to know it made so much at the box office. I wonder how that happened.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, SRK is his usual self, junior Bachchan probably needs to go to acting school, Deepika is her wonderful self and Kareena seemed charming as ever. Sonu Sood did a great job as well. <br/><br/>All in all, although the movie has probably one of the biggest (and most expensive) star-cast and quite a few lovely songs, it lacks in all other aspects. Can I get my money back?"

","Its like the Indian recipe of Italian job mixed with Step Up revolution with a hint of the old Shalimar movie.<br/><br/>Yeah. This is the 2nd Indian movie to be based on the Italian job. All the characters have been transformed into Indian heist masters with a slight change in their genders. However, Charlie is still Charlie. Sonu Sood and Young Imad shah are poor copies Mos def and Seth Green. Its sad that Indians have lost the art of film making and are trying their best to copy from the west. I honestly have no words to describe how awful the movie is. Awful is too small a degree to describe it. This is one of those movies which will give your brain the deadly disease of curd transformation. It will be better understood when its transliterated to Hindi. I vow not to waste money on Indian entertainment films ever."

","I never scrutinize the plot in Bollywood movies but at least some movies attempt to do something. <br/><br/>The plot in this movie was to boost the losing popularity of SRK. <br/><br/>The visual effects, fake abs all proves it.<br/><br/>Too much advertising is too disturbing. <br/><br/>Too much references to other movies did that too. <br/><br/>A twist of a rotten remake of Ocean's 11 and a crappy dance movie. Jokes were too crude. <br/><br/>A sloppy movie. <br/><br/>But many people laughed at the jokes. Kudos for that. I had to look for humor. Did not find it often.<br/><br/>Deepika is very pretty but still an amateur in acting."

"musavhai-540-37270","1","0","9","2 November 2014"," Bullshit movie
","Typical bullshit movie.Most of people liked it because they are die hard fan of sahruk.I also like sahruk but i never thought sahruk who is king of bollywood choose this movie. Acting so far good. Honestly after watching this movie, one thing that struck my mind was - Since when Bollywood audience have become so dumb/stupid/senseless that they really want to watch any kind of crap these stupid film makers throw at them. Really a poor attempt at creating entertainment.Such a boring and dull story line.I couldn't under stand how it ranked 6.9 :o. People should rank it by judging everything.Its not just like ""I love sahruk so 10.:o"
"jhingalalahmm","1","0","10","1 November 2014"," Crappy New Year
","Why is there no number lower than 1 allowed for voting? This is one of the most awful movies out there in recent times. There is no story and no content in the movie. There was no hard work done to write some original dialogues. Everything was just recycled from old movies. The only saving grace of this movie was Deepika Padukone. She looked like a million dollars and performed as good as any of her other movies. No wonder she is the queen of the 100 Crore+ movies. Boman Irani was ho hum as an older single Parsi. Sonu Sood was sadly wasted. Naseer's son (cant even remember his name) made a mistake by signing this movie. He will never be taken seriously now. What to say of Abhishek. He has once again proved that he is a failed hero who cant act apart from his two and a half expressions that he has learnt by copying his superstar father. My advice to him would be, if you really want to continue as an actor even after your father is no more, then please take a break and learn your art by joining a theater for a few years and then come back. Till then please spare us. Lastly, SRK. Absolutely boring. Trying to compete with Salman by showing off his fake photo-shopped abs. Really? SRK, do you think we are fools??? The ONLY reason this movie has had great opening is because of the hype created by SRK as he does with all his movies. Nothing more nothing less. I personally don't believe the figures in the media though. They sound fake. This movie should be called Crappy New Year. Don't waste your time with this one. Go watch a Haider or a Daawat E Isqh or Ex Villain instead."
