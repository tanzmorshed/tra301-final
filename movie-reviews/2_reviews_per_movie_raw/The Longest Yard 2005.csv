","Don't compare today's comedy version of ""The Longest Yard"" to the old with Burt Reynolds. Today's is good and effective for what it is, a comedy film with a bit of action interlaced. So many classic Hollywood films were so good, that any attempt at a remake is just going to fall flat on its face. The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler is more of today's take on the story if you asked me. It has humor, and is Sandler at his best with Chris Rock playing his role well too. Critics and classic moviegoers beware. Unless you are open-minded, you will never find the hidden treasures of the movie world. It's a football comedy, plain and simple."
"TOMASBBloodhound","6","69","114","4 December 2005"," It made HOW MUCH????
","People who lined up to bash this film had better get used to seeing more like it. Hollywood these days is stuck in a rut where three types of films account for nearly every film they release. Those are: remakes, sequels, and films based on comic book characters. The Longest Yard would of course fit into the first category. It is a slightly updated, but fairly faithful remake of the 1974 film of the same name. This time, we have Adam Sandler who plays the incarcerated quarterback that Burt Reynolds played in the original. Reynolds is on hand to play a minor role which the original film also contained. The plot is still the same. Prisoners vs guards in a game of football. Pretty simple.<br/><br/>Did the film make me laugh? Sure it did. There are more than a few chuckles, but not much in the way of side-splitting material. Sandler is actually not that memorable in this film. Some of the best performances actually come from people you might not expect. I was truly impressed with Nelly and Michael Irvin. Both men had their characters down, and really proved they could actually act. Chris Rock is about as good as you'd expect. Your own personal opinion of him will determine how you rate his performance. James Cromwell plays the corrupt warden about as well as you might expect. He's pretty much got the market cornered on evil white guy roles, since J.T. Walsh's untimely death. The rest of the cast becomes a game of ""see if you can spot the NFL player, WWE combatant, or famous sports journalist"". And what on earth was Cloris Leachman doing in the Bernadette Peters role from the original? Did she lose some kind of bet with Sandler on the set of Spanglish or something? <br/><br/>Should this film have been made? Well, we film critics can argue that point all day. The truth of the matter is that this film grossed over $150,000,000!!! As far as the studio bosses are concerned, this film was more than worth it. This was actually one of the more profitable comedies released this year, so you can expect more like it in the near future. I'll give it 6 of 10 stars. Don't expect anywhere near the film we got in 1974. But there are plenty of worse films on the shelves at your local video store.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","I have read bad comment, after bad comment, about this movie, and I saw it, and I am sick and tired of everybody giving it a bad rap. People are downsizing it because it isn't enough like the original. But to truly enjoy this movie, you have to realize that it isn't really a remake. It's an homage. All it has is the same basic idea, and the characters. I found this an absolutely brilliant comedy, filled with frequent references to the original. It's genius characterizations of what some prison inmates might act like work perfectly. Especially Richard Kiels character turned into a weightier, less intelligent black man. I also quite enjoyed the frequent humor derived from taking scenes from the original and changing the words into PG-13. Although it originally seems silly, the player sh***ng himself scene is so much better when you realize it was originally the broke his f****ng neck scene. Also, the million one-liners, I guess could be taken badly, but only if you're looking for them to be. Possibly the reason everybody hates this so much is because they're looking for it to be the original. If you're going to see this, remember, it's not the original. Its an Adam Sandler movie making homage to the Longest Yard."
"T1Thousand","7","42","67","6 June 2005"," Good kicks, near touchdown
","I'm going to start off by admitting that I had no interest in this movie whatsoever. I only saw it because I was dragged. Was it as bad as I thought? Not at all. It was way better than I expected it to be. We all know those mindless comedies that barely have a plot, cheap dialogue and jokes, and are just filled with stupidities galore. I thought this was one of them. I was wrong. This remake had a pretty good storyline and a few laughable jokes and moments. I usually don't laugh out loud at movies, but I did find myself doing so three or four times here. So that takes care of the Funniness Factor. The story is easy to get involved in--you want to see the prisoners kick the guards' butts in football. It is a well played story and fun to watch. Sandler is not one of my favorite actors, but I have to give him his props because I am starting to see that he usually stars in movies that are at least remotely funny and that have a pretty decent plot. But the main thing is that his characters usually act the same. I would get into the slight lack of character development, but I'm sure you don't care to read about that. You only wish to know if this movie is funny or not and if it's worth watching! Well, yes the movie has its moments and it's good to watch, especially if you like football or are a Sandler fan. This has its good kicks and it is near a touchdown in the comedy category. So if you want to have a good time and relax to some entertainment, you can watch this one =) <br/><br/>6.6/10 Stars"
"drjimmycooper","6","59","101","25 May 2005"," it's trade-off: less character development, more laughs
","I went to this film thinking it was going to suck. I was a big fan of the original. Loved it as a kid, although I know it's not a great film or anything.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how fun the remake was, although it is a superficial kind of fun. The original had better casting and stronger character development. Reynolds and Eddie Albert are so wonderful in their roles, Sandler and the new warden are pretty damn lame in comparison. And the original spent more time building the characters, so that by the end, the film really resonated in a way the remake does not.<br/><br/>BUT, the remake is a fun & energetic piece of pop entertainment. It goes much more for broad comedy and pretty much succeeds. It's not super- hilarious, but it's funny enough and much funnier than the original. Although Sandler is wrong for the part, he's likable enough. Chris Rock is funny, as are some of the others. And the overall brisk pace keeps the whole thing afloat.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a disposable movie. It lacks the dark undercurrents that made the first one so good. It even seems to self-consciously acknowledge that it will never stand outside the shadow of Burt Reynolds. No, it doesn't have as much substance, but it has its own childish charm."
"BigHardcoreRed","Null","78","138","5 June 2005"," Excellent Remake, In My Opinion... And Bob Sapp Still Rules!
","The remake here was surprisingly good and pretty true to the original movie but will be most enjoyed by Adam Sandler fans or fans of the original. Except for a few exceptions to keep it up to date and a few to screw with those that saw the original, the stories are pretty much identical. The main character were all the same as well, but the supporting cast, especially the guards and cons, were changed up a bit.<br/><br/>Former NFL quarterback Paul Crewe (Sandler, replacing the original Burt Reynolds) is arrested and faces a 3 year sentence for GTA, DUI and I am sure some other stuff which is unimportant. After his sentencing, Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) pulls a few strings to get Crewe placed in his prison so he can coach his semi-pro team. Upon the urging of Captain Knauer (William Fichtner), Crewe declines, which sets the wheels in motion for an eventual game between Crewe and the convicts against Knauer and the guards.<br/><br/>The supporting football players were the real highlights of the movie, most notably Bob Sapp and Kevin Nash (I hate to say it but Nash did a good job. If only he was this good a wrestler), with honorable mentions to Nelly, Michael Irvin, Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin, Bill Romanowski & Brian Bosworth. Also, who could forget Chris Rock as Caretaker? This could not have been cast better.<br/><br/>Overall, A good comedy worth seeing. Especially if you are a Sandler fan."
"ccvix","9","48","87","3 June 2005"," Laugh out loud funny
","I loved this movie! I have seen the original, also, and I have to say that this version is much more fun to watch and should appeal to a wider audience. For those who thought this was going to be a more serious movie for Adam Sandler....what on earth gave you that idea?? It's a comedy. It's meant to be funny and it is. If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler's then don't bother with it, because you won't like it. If you are a fan, I believe you will enjoy it very much. If you have absolutely no sense of humor, as it seems quite a few who have written comments about this movie are lacking just that, then don't bother with it either. I know when my husband and I saw it, the whole audience was roaring with laughter throughout the movie and my husband has informed me that he cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. It was a whole lot of fun to watch and I recommend it highly."
"ma-cortes","6","11","16","15 January 2008"," Hilarious remake about one of the all-time classic football films
","This remake from Robert Aldrich film deals about a professional quarterback (Adam Sandler in the role of Reynolds)is sent to high-security prison for stealing his sweetheart's car(an unbilled Courtney Cox) . There, the warden chief (James Cromwell substituting to Edward Albert) forces him to put together an inmates team to play his semi-pro made up of wardens(led by William Fitchner substituting to Ed Lauter, here playing a cameo). The disgraced quarterback is caught among brutal wardens(Brian Bosworth,Steve Austin, Todd Holland) and embittered fellows prisoners( Nicholas Turturro,Lobo Sebastian, Bill Goldberg, among others) organizing a strong cons-versus -wardens match . He's helped by sympathetic inmate(Chris Rock) and veteran player con(Burt Reynolds).<br/><br/>This comic bone-crunching comedy is constituted by three parts, the first about introduction characters, the second part deals a football training and the third, dedicated to the game. Delightful serio-comic film about two likable crooks(Sandler, Rock), who became trainers of a motley group. This remake is as violent and humorous as the former film though no originality but rips off situations and scenes. The picture is plenty of violence, bone-crunching brutality, profanities , but also humor and amusing. Agreeable script by Tracy Keenan Wynn and production by Albert S. Ruddy , the same from Aldrich version that was remade in 2001 as ¨Mean machine¨(with Vinnie Jones Jason Statham and David Kelly) the original movie's British title. The motion picture is well directed by Peter Segal, usual director for Adam Sandler(50 first dates, Anger management) and comedies expert( Nutty professor, Naked gun: Final insult, Tommy boy) and recently filming ¨Get Smart¨. Rating: Acceptable rendition from classic movie for those who delight in football sports and crunching cruelty and with some moments very funny."
"blondie1972","7","59","110","13 May 2005"," A Great Pre-Summer Film!
","I too got to see a free-sneak peak of this film in NYC and I'll tell you one thing . . there were no sleepers in the cinema! A very mixed crowd from race to ages here and everyone seemed to be having a great time . . even the teenager who sat behind me who reminded me of every actor when he appeared on the screen .. like Nelly. I haven't had this much fun in the theater in quite awhile. No, it's not a super serious film, but if you like football and the good feeling of revenge you'll love this film. Lots of violent blows from the guards and a little racism, but nothing too ""out of the ordinary"" . . some great one-liners from Chris Rock's character. A definite #1 film for Memorial Day weekend when it opens. I can see this film bringing in some good dough this summer."
"tompeterson5","6","32","67","15 April 2005"," Better than ""The Waterboy""
","I got to see the same sneak preview movie at the theatre last week. <br/><br/>With all the TV advertising and trailers at the movies I thought the film was coming out soon, but I just checked and they said it won't hit the Cineplex until May 27th!<br/><br/>Prediction? It will the box office winner on Memorial Day weekend. Perfect time to come out with a football picture because all the NFL fans are fed up with Arena football and thirsty for any real football.<br/><br/>Well, what can I say about the movie? Loved it! Very entertaining. You could get into the characters, no matter how despicable they were and you were rooting for them. Of course the story is an old one. They filmed it in 1974 with Burt Reynolds and it is about prisoners playing a football game against the guards. It's a comedy, but boy it is Violent with a capital V.<br/><br/>It is a real macho man movie and everyone is going to love it. Adam Sandler gets beat up or beat down a lot in the movie, they give the best lines and jokes to Chris Rock and there will be a few other Saturday Night Live people you will recognize in it. There are a lot of scenes of cheap shots and unsportsmanlike conduct. Very physical, very brutal. Some scenes will make you cringe. You will feel their pain. Not blood and guts with stabbings or shootings, but extreme football hurts and hits.<br/><br/>Yes it's a comedy and yes it's funny, but also ultra violent, did I mention that already? Now I know why I gave up on football in high school and focused more on Cross Country and Track & Field...because I realized I would live longer if I competed in a sport where no one is trying to injury me or knock you out of competition.<br/><br/>A great film? No, but people will feel they got their money's worth and yes, it will be popular on DVD with outtakes and behind the scenes footage. I can't see it getting a PG-13 rating, not with all the language and use of the ""N"" word by the cookie cutter, steroid popping sadistic guards."
"shredsofmetal","8","20","39","14 December 2005"," Good movie for a sports fan.
","Revenge is the one thing on the mind that every prisoner wants to impose on the guards. This idea of revenge is exactly what Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) does to help motivate other inmates to organize a football team in an inmates vs. guards football game.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with Crewe being chased by cops after he stole a Bentley. The car chase ends with Crewe getting arrested and bragging to his girlfriend by jumping up and down in front of the media helicopters that were covering the chase. Immediately we get to see the personality of Paul Crewe as a cocky spotlight loving person. Crewe is a former NFL player who is the only player to be banned from the league for point shaving. When he enters the jail, he is hated by everybody because he caused so many people to lose bets from the point shaving incident.<br/><br/>An NFL player, or any celebrity usually has special treatment in prison. Crewe's opportunity arises when the prison Warden, Hazen, (James Cromwell) offers Crewe a chance for a nice cell and good words in parole hearings. The offer was to organize the inmates to play the guards in a football team. The point was for the inmates to have such a horrible team, that the guards would win easily and have high enough spirit to be able to compete in their organized league. After vowing to never be involved with football again, Crewe declines the offer. The guards beat up on him, and he is unable to socialize with any inmates. After not wanting to take anymore beatings from the guards, Crewe accepts Hazen's offer.<br/><br/>The first friend that Crewe makes is Caretaker (Chris Rock). Caretaker had already spent a long time in prison and knew most of the inmates. Caretaker helps Crewe with tryouts for the team, but there was no talent. As are most prisons, the Old Main prison is racially separated. Crewe wanted some of the black players on the team, but they wanted nothing to do with football. Megget (Nelly) had a respect for Crewe, and was the first player to join the team. He was an extremely fast runner, but there were not enough players to make a decent team.<br/><br/>Enter Nate Scarborough, (Burt Reynolds) a Heisman Trophy winner, who still lived for football. He helped train the team, but the lack of talent made it so that there is no chance for the inmates to win. After several racial incidents involving guards, many other black players join the team, and the inmates become a decent team. The inmates are ready to face to guards in the battle of revenge they have been waiting for. Most of the inmates only want to play so that they can impose as much pain as possible on the guards. Crewe and Scarborough want to take the respect out of the guards by beating them. They train the teams until the Warden asks Crewe for something that he will not do again; shave points off the score so that the guards can easily defeat the inmates.<br/><br/>The cast of The Longest Yard has many big names. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell, and Nelly are the main characters of the movie. On both teams there are many NFL players such as Michael Irwin and Bill Romanowski. One of the best roles in the movie is Chris Berman's cameo as the ESPN announcer during the big game. Berman is the benchmark for football commentating, and for such an important game, it is fitting to have such a personality as Berman.<br/><br/>The visual effects of the film are fantastic. The bone crushing hits are presented well in slow motion and with up close camera shots. The set of the prison gives a realistic sense of a jail as well. It is in the middle of New Mexico with absolutely nothing but desert near it. The sense of isolation is similar to what the prisoners probably feel.<br/><br/>The Longest Yard has the same basic premise as Happy Gilmore but football rather than golf. Adam Sandler is trying to get revenge, but turns to a sport rather than fights. In both movies, I found myself rooting for Sandler's character, and hating the antagonists. This film is not as crude as other Sandler films, but still has plenty of laughs. Chris Rock's humor is similar to his standup as most of the things that Rock says in The Longest Yard has something to do with race. Burt Reynolds is not given a lead role in this movie, but he still has a ""tough guy"" attitude through his character.<br/><br/>I have not seen the original The Longest Yard, so I cannot compare the remake to the original. While watching the movie, I found myself cheering for the teams as I do when watching the Bears beating the Packers. Chris Rock's character adds a lot of humor to the movie. The one complaint I have with the movie is that the conflicts at the end are not completely resolved, and it is unclear about what will happen in the future. The Longest Yard is not an Oscar worthy masterpiece, but for a typical sports fan, The Longest Yard is a great movie. In all, I give it a rating of 8 out of 10."
"bek-12","4","16","30","28 May 2005"," This movie is crap
","I really hate to say that, because I wanted to like the movie. I just couldn't. It was the same old tired gags that guys like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler have been peddling for years. Sandler had a chance to make a serious motion picture with some real drama, and he blew it. There were various changes made from the original movie, from specific lines to entire scenes, and I honestly can't think of one that was an improvement. All the times where Crewe was a tough, underspoken character that really shined, well... he just became a smartmouth in the new movie. They also ""sanitized"" a couple of scenes that really bothered me...<br/><br/>**SPOILER ALERT** Crewe no longer slaps the girlfriend at the beginning, but now locks her in a closet. Not a big change, and at the time I didn't think much about it, but later on when it's revealed that he actually did shave points for money, the new movie subtly changes it so that a reason is given, and he says that his life was in danger if he didn't do it. I guess Sandler wasn't happy with Crewe having real, human flaws like the rest of us, and needed to justify Crewe's actions. I liked the original better, where Crewe just made a mistake and felt regret for doing it. It somehow felt more real to me.<br/><br/>**END OF SPOILERS** They basically turned a great movie into a movie with nothing but cheap gags. It was very disappointing."
"Matt_Layden","4","11","20","12 December 2006"," About As Bad A Mr. Deeds
","Crewe was a football superstar back in the day, but cast a black eye on the sport when he sold out his team-mates. Then a drunk driving accident sends him to prison, but the thing is the Warden specifically requested he be sent to his prison. Now Crewe has been giving the duty of putting together a football team, full of the inmates. Recruiting is hard, until the inmates find out that they are playing the guards.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I've never seen the original, so my views on this film are not in comparison to it, but as a film on it's own. I'm sitting here asking myself if I should judge this film against other football films, or even other Adam Sandler films. I can't really do that with the latter because it's not like any other Sandler film. It seems that he has grown up out of the stupid jokes that involve him yelling a lot and hitting little kids. This seems to be a softer side, a side that wants to show that he is not just a comedian, but a money making star. If this is a side of Sandler that we will be seeing, then I want to shun him out of the business right now.<br/><br/>I've never seen ""Punch Drunk Love"" or ""Spanglish"", so I can't comment on those films, but other then the recent ""Click"", Sandler hasn't had a good, or even funny, film since The Waterboy. The Longest Yard, if I were to describe it in two words it would be, NOT FUNNY. Now I know it's not suppose to be a flat out comedy, but with comedic actors like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, you would expect to maybe laugh every once and a while, this is not the case. Mr. Deeds was Sandler's worst film in his career (not including that boat one) and The Longest Yard seems to be giving it a run for it's money. I had a more enjoyable time watching Little Nicky then I did this.<br/><br/>The film is full of clichés. I was rolling my eyes when the mean prison guard gave Sandler the ""you're okay"" speech at the end, not to mention the useless and meaningless character of Chris Rock, who is only there for sympathy, only there to get a few tears, but it doesn't even work. It's sad really. Let me tell you this, just because there are stars in the remake that were in the original, does not make it ""okay"" or ""good"". Does having them in the movie signify some kind of blessing? Give me a break. I can see having wrestlers in the film to play football players and guardss, but they didn't add anything to it. No star value of ""Hey, look who it is"" because there are so many of them. Also, Nelly makes an appearance, yet another rapper trying to make it in Hollywood. Again, I'm asking myself, what's the purpose? Couldn't get real actors? So you try to reach out to the young crowd, ""Hey look, it's NELLY kids.""<br/><br/>Now after telling you that the film is full of stupid clichés, that it's not funny and that it tries to pass of rappers and wrestlers as actors, what else is there to tell? How about how it's not even a good football movie? Not once did I ever think that they would lose and not once did I ever think that any of this would ever actually happen. Never would the inmates be wondering around the prison at night. Basically you need to pass on this film, all it consists of is poor McDonald's jokes that never hit the mark. Go watch the original insteadand I haven't even seen it."
"jellyneckr","Null","22","47","28 May 2005"," Peter Segal's best film since TOMMY BOY
","In 1994, Peter Segal made his feature film directorial debut with NAKED GUN 33 1/3: THE FINAL INSULT, the hilarious concluding chapter of the NAKED GUN series. His follow-up was the even funnier TOMMY BOY in 1995, one of the best comedies of the 1990s. His next film, MY FELLOW Americans, was pretty funny but failed to generate the same number of laughs as his two previous films. Still, it seemed like Segal was destined to become one of the next great comedy directors. That is until 2000's NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS, a lame rehash of the 1996 remake. Since then, he's continued to direct pretty mediocre comedies like ANGER MANAGEMENT and 50 FIRST DATES so I had low expectations when I heard he was to direct the THE LONGEST YARD. Luckily, THE LONGEST YARD, his latest movie, is his best film since TOMMY BOY thanks to Segal's great comedic direction. In addition to handling the comedy well, he also does a fantastic job with the football scenes. In fact, I think it is safe to say that because of Segal's direction, THE LONGEST YARD is the best football film of the 2000s so far.<br/><br/>Anybody that knows me knows that if there is one type of movie I hate, it's remakes. There is no reason for them, making them pointless. However, for whatever reason, I actually enjoyed this one. From the great opening shot of a beautiful girl swimming in a pool to the very last shot of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) getting Gatorade poured all over him, I found myself having a ball. It's just an all around fun film. Everyone does a great job with their roles (especially Sandler and Rock) and for an almost two hour movie, THE LONGEST YARD is fast-paced.<br/><br/>Still, THE LONGEST YARD has its fair share of problems. The rap sound track doesn't seem to fit the picture very well, some of the jokes fall pretty flat(i.e. most of the gay jokes), and there's not nearly as much character development as there was in the original. Despite these flaws, THE LONGEST YARD remains one of the highlights of 2005. Recommended."
"dumassays","9","14","28","23 June 2005"," Longest Yard... Touchdown!
","I haven't laughed like that in a long while. Welcome back Adam Sandler. Sandler hasn't offered a performance of this scale and quality since Happy Gilmore. With movies like Punch Drunk Love and Eight Crazy Nights, you had to ask yourself if Sandler had lost his golden touch, though he did save himself with his dramatic roles in Spanglish and 50 First Dates. Sandler, like Jim Carrey and Robin Williams, really belongs in the comedic roles, where quick wit and obvious ad lib are not only welcomed but expected. Sandler absolutely dominates in this film. <br/><br/>He wasn't hurting for supporting characters either, Chris Rock's role as Caretaker is a bit unbelievable, but he delivers his lines with his well known stand-up approach to comedy. He's funny and lovable, a definite asset to the movie. Burt Reynolds, taking on the senior role this time around, as opposed to the lead in the '74 version, obviously has a lessor impact on the story, but he plays it well with his hard nosed, shy but deadly, attitude. Then there is Terry Crews as Cheeseburger Eddy... if you thought that this guy was funny in White Chicks, then you can expect more of the same hilarity in The Longest Yard. Every scene with Crews is laugh out loud.<br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect from this movie being that it was a remake, but I can say with sincerity that I was truly impressed with the acting and story line. With characters like Sasquatch, Mc-Asshole and Colonel Sanders, it would be difficult not to be. This movie is not to be missed!"
"VermonterVol","3","20","43","29 May 2005"," No Wonder Eddie Albert Just Kicked
","I would echo the sentiments of those who said this is a very pale imitation of the original. No wonder Eddie Albert died the day before its release. I didn't believe any of the actors because of the poor character development -- the dialog was extremely wooden, even from Cromwell, who can do much better. Sandler showed no emotion and gave the audience little reason to support of empathize with him. Rock does a good job ad-libbing through a poorly re-written script (the original screenplay by Tracy Keenan Wynn was great. He must be cringing through every minute watching this hash). I found myself for much of the movie comparing scenes, line delivery and dialog with the original. And nine times out of 10, the remake came up lacking. Sadly, Hollywood is not going to get the message we all want this poorly made film to deliver, because it will do extremely well at the box office thanks to the casting of Sandler, Nelly and the ex-jocks, bringing a built-in audience. Only source of enjoyment to me were the less obvious cameos, including Dan Patrick as the Miami traffic cop."
"jmverville","4","13","26","28 May 2005"," Quite Mediocre
","Though this film was riddled with occasionally funny portions, I found that overall much of the humor was offensive and predictable. A lot of the material was not original and seemed as if it was rehashed, had been done before many a time.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it seemed s if within the humor of the film they occasionally lost track of the main plot of the film. Plus, the plot was so dry and drawn out that one almost wished that they had totally thrown it out the window and ran without it. There were also rather surreal moments of corniness that jolted me, being suddenly taken into the realm of the melodramatic after laughing at some juvenile humor.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was not well put together and not that funny for a comedy. Not a great accomplishment. I do not really recommend anyone to see this film."

","This was the worst film I have ever seen at the cinema, and I have seen some terrible films in the last 20 years. <br/><br/>It was recommended by a friend of a friend who we can only assume finds Police Academy 7 funny too.<br/><br/>My mate wanted to leave after 10 minutes when we realised there weren't even any good looking women in it to distract us from another moronic Sandler remake e.g. Mr Deeds.<br/><br/>The main premise of this 'comedy' appears to be showcasing how great, popular and hard Adan Sandler is. Sandler seems unable to cast himself as anything other than: <br/><br/><ul><li>a mistreated retard who beats people up </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the most popular man on Earth who always gets the girl/wins a competition despite the efforts of a rich bad guy.</li></ul><br/><br/>Considering he was surrounded by a decent support cast in Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds, it's amazing that he felt the need to give the 'funniest' lines to a group of wrestlers. I truly have seen better comic delivery at a nativity play. Steve Austin is the best of a bad bunch and to be honest no-one could be as unfunny as Sandler's best mate Rob 'Deuce Bigalow' Schneider who has a cameo for no reason.<br/><br/>So in summary, never ever watch this film unless you want to not laugh or are trying to split up with someone.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Sandler was first choice to play the cab driver in Collateral. Maybe they wouldn't cast Rob Schneider in Cruise's role so he declined (?)<br/><br/>Seriously Sandler please, please stop making films. Leave comedy to funny people like Ben Stiller. If you do carry on cos a seven year old once laughed at a fart gag in 'Happy Gilmore', don't do another remake and ruin the memories of a decent original."

","I rate Adam Sandler pretty highly as an actor: Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish are among my favourite films and he is excellent in both. Sadly, The Longest Yard utterly stifles this talent - and the talents of his co-stars, including Chris Rock, James Cromwell and William Fichtner - by entrusting the direction and script to witless cretins. I probably wouldn't have minded the litany of movie clichés if they hadn't been so wilfully and ineptly used. To make matters irredeemably worse, just about every ethnic and social male stereotype is kicked out onto the field for the delectation of their young white target audience. I haven't seen the original, but I'm willing to bet Burt came away from this remake ruing the direction popular cinema has taken since 1974."

","There have been some good remakes and there have been some bad remakes of great films... Then there was this film (I'm being kind when I refer to it as a film) Now you take a film that is a classic, which the 1974 version is most certainly one of the best sports movies ever made.. The idea was fresh, funny and well done... Then 31 years later this truly dreadful movie gets released.. The whole problem was trying to do a carbon copy of the original film.. But they failed to even make a copy of the original film.. The original had character development with Crewe, Caretaker, Nate Scarboro, Captain Knauer, Warden Hazen and Unger.. This didn't...<br/><br/>The film failed to create character development, it was introduce the characters give them a few insights and then just cut to the football game... It was like the filmmakers actually believed taking shortcuts in the actual story and relying on the people who actually enjoyed the first movie to know about the backstory..<br/><br/>Other problems with the film was just throwing in so many homophobic stereotypes and other racial jokes that truly detracted from what would have been moderately passable film.<br/><br/>This was all in the first 25 minutes until I got so annoyed with a total waste of celluloid that I turned it off and watched the original..<br/><br/>If they were smart enough they should have continued on the story not just have remade it, use the ideal that was established in the original film where Burt Reynolds (Paul Crewe) is still in prison for pissing off Eddie Albert (Warden Hazen) much like John Steadman (Pop) did, then have Sandler's character whatever they would call him be arrested for something similar.. If they did that then they could of had a good movie.. They didn't.. SO you got this piece of garbage.."

","Now I'm not one to bash movies very often, but sadly, this movie deserves a bit of bashing. I found this movie to be one of the poorest re-makes I have seen in all of the years I have been watching, and writing about movies. This Longest Yard lacked all of the personality, characters, and true feeling of the original. Sure, there were some funny lines, but plain and simple, this movie does the original no justice at all. Secondly, I certainly understand product placement in today's movies, but to be completely honest with you, this film was more of a commercial for McDonald's than anything else. For those of us who loved the ""Real Longest Yard"", I leave you with this thought, buy the original on DVD - you will be glad you did ! HIS-TO-RY.

","I just saw this movie for the first time. I really like sports movies, so I was expecting to like it. But within the first 15 minutes there were so many stereotypes and really derogatory comments that I was disgusted. But, I didn't have the opinion to stop watching it (I was on a bus with 40 other people).<br/><br/>I was so shocked that they would do that. I mean, they talked about black people, white people, and gay/transvestite people is a way that you would think that the writers had never really met any of those people. The stereotypes of the black people was everything you would expect. Trash talking, playing dirty. They are even playing street basketball. The white people are just as bad. The one that shocked me the most was the portrayal of the transvestites. These people were shown in such a bad way. It was suggested that they kind of slept around and that they pushed their sexual orientation onto everyone. Granted, I have never been in prison. But those kind of people do not act like that in the real world. At least not the kind that I've met. If a person didn't know the facts, they could easily assume that's how all transvestites act. And I would think that in a country like ours, people would come to be a little more respectful and not pull stuff like that.<br/><br/>I was basically appalled by the writing of this movie. It is one thing to write to what the audience wants to see. It is a totally different subject to write characters based on stereotypes and misconceptions. The writers really need to think about what they are writing next time."

","Everyone is instructing us not to compare the current to the original version. How is that possible? That's like going to a restaurant, being served a lousy steak, and being asked that you not compare it to other good steaks that you've had in the past.<br/><br/>To any guy who was watching movies in the 70's, The Longest Yard is legendary. Burt can act big enough and mean enough to convince us that he could survive, and become a leader, in the prison community. Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, Billy Madison and Little Nicky. He can't pull off the ex-NFL quarterback gaining cred in the joint. It was simply bad casting.<br/><br/>The rest of the casting, beginning to end, was superb. Most of the writing, and the additional comedy, was great fun. But Adam Sandler? Why not Woody Allen? The movie really needed someone that can pull off ""tough"". Josh Holloway, aka ""Sawyer"" on the TV show ""Lost"" might have been a good choice.<br/><br/>If they didn't want us to compare it to the original, they shouldn't have remade it."

","Even though I am yet to see the original I find it highly unlikely this could be a better movie. The name Adam Sandler is possibly unfairly associated with movies involving the same old jokes and big punches and hits. Sandler isn't this one dimensional as movies like ""Punch Drunk Love"", and the romcom ""The Wedding Singer"" will attest. It bothers me that his comedy's are becoming fairly stagnant. This is fine if you are a huge Sandler fan, but if you are impartial to his work you will be losing interest quickly. Sandler needs to pop up with a few art-house serious roles, and evolve a little more with his own material.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast plod along with less than exciting performances. Perhaps my biggest problem was the way violence was deemed to be the resolution to all the problems. This may be the truth in the real world or it may be part of the movies humour, but I found it sickening.<br/><br/>I loved the table tennis table and ball."

"rams_lakers","1","18","41","10 October 2005"," Remakes: for the ignorant
","Need I say in this review that I hate remakes, especially if the original was a classic? Nothing made today could even come close to the original Longest Yard. The only things there are to gain from a remake are self promotion and profits. Not because they love the movie, but because they want to feed off of what others love.<br/><br/>It's all about money. After all, it's much easier remaking something that's already loved, rather than creating and inventing something from scratch and hoping everyone will like it. That is the bane of today's filmmakers, abandoning creativity and taking the shortcut to success. Now they introduce The Longest Yard to a younger, ignorant audience. Where will it end?<br/><br/>The first scene tries and fails to capture Burt Reynold's classic Paul Crewe from the start. Not only do we see that Sandler is not worthy, but he really has no good reason to crash his girlfriend's car. Of course it is captured on CNN in a heartbeat when realistically cops these days take 20 minutes to even respond to a call unless it involves a life and death situation.<br/><br/>The cons in the original were easy to side with and the Warden and Captain Knauer were much meaner. These 2005 cons are a bunch of lame cocky rap-listening self-absorbed jerks that reflect the ""me"" athletes of today. I could not find myself rooting for these shallow inmates.<br/><br/>Richard Kiel's original character was copied into being a big dumb bald black fool who had some of the worst lines in the movie. ""I LIKE little Michael!"" WTF! The classic character of Connie Shokner was turned into some ugly big-jawed Mexican on steroids. Proof enough here that you can't imitate a classic with stupid wannabes.<br/><br/>The gay cheerleader roles were expanded to give Tracy Morgan more air time. A convict is giving out cheeseburgers, how stupid is all this? This whole movie is like watching a WWF wrestling match with all it's brainless chest beating, suitable for rednecks with the brain of a fern. Of course, today's ""MTV kids"" will love it! My god, get a life!<br/><br/>I saw this at work off a bootleg, thank god I didn't pay for it. I mercifully turned off the DVD before the end, not caring what happened. If this is going to be the sorry result of remakes, the entertainment world is in trouble. I'll give it a 1 of 10 just to knock it lower than the overrated 6.3 rating that the ADD-riddled youngsters of today have given it."

I believe the movie to be as funny or funnier than the original. Burt Reynolds is very good as the old hand and it turns out Micheal Irvin can act.

","This was a mess from the get-go. Do yourself a favor,and when you do compare the two. First off,go by the nearest video store and rent the original version of Robert Aldrich's 1974 version of ""The Longest Yard"" and you'll know what the definition of ""dumbing down"" really means. What the producers did here was take the concepts of the original movie and they not only killed it,they butchered it. Totally. Just recently,Paramount Pictures has been doing this to a LOT of there classic movies and turning them into remakes that are totally bogus to why were they got to be remade in the first place. A prime example of this chaos was Micheal Caine's 1966 version of ""Alfie"",where as in the new version,the remake was played by Jude Law and the results were a disaster waiting to happen. This isn't the first time Paramount has done this to there classic movies,but instead of going by the original format,the producers did here was rehash the original storyline but updated it to present a new and bogus effect. You see a lot of this in soon-to-be-released upcoming movies between now and Christmas.<br/><br/>And now to ""The Longest Yard"",the 2005 version. This is a version or to say an update on the classic film that starred Burt Reynolds,whom from this film cemented his status as one of the biggest superstars of the 1970's. In the new version,Burt Reynolds is totally wasted as if he were going to asked the question...What in the hell and I am doing here in the first place? Also,in the starring role is Adam Sandler,who is totally miscast and miswasted(the village idiot)as Paul Crewe,and who knew that Sandler can played football is anybody guess. The rest of the cast consist of former NFL players,Wrestlers from the WWE and WWF,Sportscast announcers,and Hip-Hop superstar moguls who THINK they can act. And again,who told Chris Rock that he can act? Lets face it, Chris Rock can't act,period. He is the sidekick,the jester and above all else the guy who always gets his somewhere down the line. The only saving grace here is the villain roles especially by James Cromwell and William Fichtner respectively.<br/><br/>The analysis? When the original ""The Longest Yard"" came out in 1974,this was a serious movie with some very hilarious moments,and not to mention some serious acting from Burt Reynolds,Eddie Albert and Ed Lauter,who were in the prime of there careers,especially Reynolds who became a megastar overnight because of this movie. In the 2005 version,you get a movie that is between or veer between silliness and stupidity,and excessive and lurid violence. This was suppose to be thrown in for good measure but in all aspects that is a joke between the contests of supermacy between the Inmates and the Guards and win one for the gipper is way beyond the point of this movie. And with nothing but comments and humor about fat guy jokes,gay bashing jokes(check out the scene with SNL regular Tracy Morgan),redneck jokes,jokes about black people and the ghetto,and other lame lines along with some intense racist comments many of them are repeated twice. And from there its not funny. Moments were the hip-hop soundtrack and occasional burst of the music from the 1960's and 1970's are for the older crowd. In all it just falls flat. The worst of 2005."

One character is dedicated to talking only about McDonalds products.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, there are several attempts at juvenile humor and they all fall flat. There is not a genuine laugh in the whole movie. It's stunning that Chris Rock is so funny doing stand-up and so bad in a movie. Adam Sandler's funny days are clearly behind him.

","I can't believe audiences these days. They'll sit through mindless and dull crap like this while a cinematic masterpiece like Cinderella Man tanks at the box office. Truly pathetic, if you ask me. Basically, this is your typical post-Wedding Singer Adam Sandler movie, which is (other than Punch Drunk Love) a very bad thing to say about a movie. Yes, there's the obligatory groin-kick jokes. Yes, there are plenty of penis/ass rape jokes. Finally, there is the lame Rob Schneider cameo in which he yells ""You can do it!"" Ha. Hilarious. Right? Wrong. This film lacks any genuine laughs or clever moments. Everything from the shameful product placement (""Oh, Halo 2?!

Honestly, my IQ must have dropped 50 points after seeing this steaming pile of poo.<br/><br/>The subplots, too, are absolutely ridiculous and never fully developed. The whole deal about Paul Crewe in the NFL scandal was waaay over my head and the thing about the assassination came of very awkward. The characters in this film are almost completely one note characters. I got sick of the constant penis jokes for Stone Cold's character, or all of the gay jokes about that Hispanic guy. Did I mention that it wasn't funny? Basically, all I can say is that if you like seeing people get kicked in the crotch(and that must happen 2 dozen times in this film) or if you're one of those kids who votes for Adam Sandler every single year for the Kids' Choice Awards, you might like this film.

"film-critic","3","6","12","27 October 2007"," Fumble. All I can say is fumble.
","What did I like about this film? Was there anything worth keeping with this nearly play by play remake that would make even the British version blush? Outside of the hits and the music, there was absolutely nothing. ""The Longest Yard"" was the sorriest sad sack of a comedy ever to be called a film. While it tried to be identical to the first, it misses the mark mainly due to the characters, the cheap inserted jokes, and the obvious over budget. Do we need to be spending millions of dollars to make the grass greener? Before I begin, I want everyone to look at the box to this DVD  see Adam grinning  does he look tough enough, does he look like a QB, does he look like he can be hit by huge linebackers and live to tell? My answer is no, and for you hoping to see a Happy Gilmore in a football jersey, you will be sadly disappointed. This film was plastic wrap in its grandest of ways. This film is Styrofoam when you really just needed a big belly laugh to ease the day. This film was cliché after cliché with a VERY LOUD soundtrack. How could this be? Basically, this was the same film that Reynolds did a long time ago, but with Adam Sandler  shouldn't it be funnier? <br/><br/>Alas it wasn't. How did this film fail? After watching the original film, the British ""Mean Machine"", and finally this one, I came to realize that the spirit was just missing from the cast, the production, and the design. While Sandler spewed the same lines that Reynolds did during his prime, it was difficult for me to see Sandler filling into Reynolds' boots. The two actors are not the same, the age of America is different, and what originally was a creative film about self-discovery, turned into an over-budgeted film about trying to make the audience see those amazing hits that can be seen on ESPN. Director Peter Segal has nobody to blame but himself. ""The Longest Yard"" is one of those films that couldn't be remade today because the surrounding themes are obsolete. The bulk of this issue falls on the casting. I have already denounced Sandler, but Chris Rock is the icing on the cake. He is absolutely not Caretaker. He was not the smart, Jiminy Cricket-esquire character that Crewe needed to see what was important to him in the long run. When it comes to the quintessential pinch moment, there is no emotion  I literally didn't care what happened between the two. They tried to be funny together with words, but the humor in the original fell in the situation, not Rock lounging around like this was his obvious first day at prison. The rest of the story, with the miscast of these two, fell completely to the ground. Sandler's cronies are there, Schnieder humiliating himself again, but Cromwell made me twitch again. Where was his evil, his motive, his sinister tenacity? Again, due to a much bigger budget, bigger stars, and a decision to make the punches bigger than the story, Segal let this film slip right out of his hands and into a failed category.<br/><br/>Nothing worked in this film  at least I didn't think anything did until I finished the film and found myself humming a few bars from the music. The music was way TOO LOUD  it distracted (like so many other elements of this remake) from the essential story lines, but it was perfect music for this film. They strengthened the hits, made us feel like we were on the field with the team, and inspired us to root for the good guys  but the music alone doesn't create an amazing film (unless it is a musical  but I digress). ""The Longest Yard"" suffered because of its poor character development, its poor casting decision, the painful story, and the insufferable direction. Yet, the music remained a constant focus. Thank you music team  it is the only one that I am handing out for this review.<br/><br/>Overall, I hated this film. It disgraced the original and I don't even find myself a fan of sports films. If I had to rank these three films (the original, the remake, and the British) it would be a tight race between Vinnie Jones and young Reynolds  I thought that the Brits seemed to have a better grasp on what this film was trying to accomplish more than Segal did. Sandler was a joke, Rock sunk to the bottom, and it was obvious that Reynolds was just in it for the nostalgic effect. While the cameos by the ex-jocks would make any enthusiast drool, they try their best to hold up any remaining value to this film. It took me two views to make it through this, while I can nearly recite all of the lines from ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"". That should be the perfect example of what horrid road Sandler has been traveling. I would strongly suggest skipping this film. Watch the original or import, but seem to know better what comedy is all about than Mr. Segal.<br/><br/>Grade: * out of *****"

There is no storyline...The plot is just about getting ready for the football game. I never saw the original movie so I can't really compare the two. As for the acting, it's not that the acting is bad...it's that no one has to act. The best part of the film is the opening scene where Adam Sandler insults some police officers and gets into a car chase.

","I'm a white guy. Saw this movie in theater where the entire crowd (full house) was nearly all black. So I'm watching this movie, realizing that every single white character on screen (with exception to a charisma-free Sandler) is utterly terrible: one-note, shallow, flat, weird/creepy, etc. (oh yeah, the former governor of Minnesota, too, but as he's wearing an ""X"" jersey, I suppose a self-deprecating reference to the XFL debacle, he fits in the last category). And all Texans are racist and sadistic, by nature of being Texan. Okay, well, I don't know many Texans, maybe MTV does. But I'm not just getting my liberal-white-guilt dander up: this movie REALLY is racist, and very violent - I mean, not just football rough-and-tumble, but I mean just taking grim pleasure in punching and kicking, in very personal ""gangsta beat-down"" kinda ways. Everybody loves to see a prisoner get punched in the stomach with a truncheon, repeatedly, with a sound effect like a giant slab of meat splatting on a marble floor - but after four or five dozen times it loses its dramatic impact. The race baiting is really so deliberate, it's insulting: the filmmakers could defend themselves by claiming that the one scene where ""n*****"" is used as the worst possible fly-off-the-handle taunt (and practically right INTO the camera, repeatedly) is an indictment of racism. It's not at all; it's re-enforcing stereotypes and reactions, re-enforcing subservience vs. dominance roles, re-enforcing grinning complicity vs. dignity, as well as just being the basest kind of audience manipulation. Oh, the movie CONDEMNS racism on the surface, sure - and thank God, because I don't think enough people knew that racism was bad. And it IS a prison movie - so naturally, every black person you see in the movie is a criminal. What's funny is that no crimes happen in the movie - a little harmless B&E, a little sabotage, but the only violence perpetrated by anyone in the movie is by the white drawling guards, and mostly upon Adam Sandler - and normally, that would be entertaining enough for me. <br/><br/>To give the movie credit where credit is due: a bunch of great songs all the way through. What a sweet music supervision deal this movie must've been, for MTV, for Sony, for a bank of happy lawyers ! <br/><br/>Oh yeah, another message of the movie: McDonalds is better than drugs or sex. Believe it ! What's their big popular sandwich, a something something with cheese ? Oh, they repeated the product name at least twenty times, how could I forget ?<br/><br/>I like football movies cause I like football. Sometimes movie football is more drama than realism, and that's okay. This movie moved away from the realistic, and moved away from the drama as well. Football is a plot device, a tool, providing many soundtrack song placement opportunities. <br/><br/>Oh yeah - this movie, in one of the opening bits, also shows how much fun driving while stinking drunk is - fun and ultimately harmless. Many cars get totalled, terrible wreckage, flying down the 101, then BOOM, our hero stumbles out drunk as hell, with maybe just a scratch on his head. But it's okay ! The wrecked cars are all cops, no one gets hurt, and it's all good fun. See, honey?, this is what grownups do to let off steam !<br/><br/>Shame on Chris Rock for being in this turkey. For a comedian who's gotten so much mileage out of race stereotypes and sub-textual racism in society, he's not doing his beloved peoples any favors here - and he doesn't really do anything funny. <br/><br/>One bright glimmer of hope for comedy: Tracy Morgan as a classic-flavor prison bitch. He plays it to the hilt, and makes it as funny as the boneheaded script would let him. Good for him.<br/><br/>Shame on everyone else. There's a lot of them to be ashamed - all the way through the movie, I kept saying to myself, ""Damn, HE'S in this, too ? And there's THAT guy !"". Thanks, MTV power ! Now see if you can Premiere-plugin airbrush the age spots off of Courtney Cox's cleavage. <br/><br/>I walked out of this movie during the last third, wandered around the theatre, dropped in on other movies. Came back just in time for an anticlimax that Bert Reynolds, I'm sure, had insisted upon in his contract - HE was going to get the big winning touchdown. Hoo. Ray.<br/><br/>Oh, I see that Adam Sandler's production company is called ""Happy Madison"" - Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, very clever. See, if I ever made just one crappy horrible sports/retarded flavored comedy after another, I'd want people to remember me for them, too.<br/><br/>So what was up with that ""Punch Drunk Love"" crap, anyway ? Who thought THAT was funny ?<br/><br/>Seriously, I just have to come to the conclusion that the reason Adam Sandler did a great movie there was because of P.T. Anderson, because his talent is of a school-cafeteria-lunch table clown level.<br/><br/>One great thing about this movie, too - good sound. A very good sounding mix on this movie. Good sound."

Worst Movie Ever is a title saved for only the absolutely most painfully bad movie possible. I don't think I previously had an occupant to the title Worst Movie Ever, but I now most certainly do. The Longest Yard remake is the Worst Movie Ever. So much so, that Worst Movie Ever must be capitalized. It was painful. Or perhaps the fact that I actually heard laughs in the audience was more painful. I can't tell. Either way, I had to physically remove myself from the theater before the last 10 minutes because I thought I was going to cry, it was so bad. Every single joke was almost directly taken from another movie, and every single plot turn, character, lousy dialog, and even every camera angle was unoriginal.

","A remake of the 1974 classic The Longest Yard, this film features Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds in a cons versus guards knockdown, drag-out, bare-knuckles brawl football game. However, if you've seen the original, you've already seen this film as well, but done much better.<br/><br/>The film centers around Paul Crewe (played by Sandler, but made famous by Reynolds), a former football all-star professional quarterback, who was forced to leave the sport after allegations of points-shaving surfaced. The film opens several years after the allegations, and Crewe is a kept-man. Forced jump at his girlfriend's every beckon call; Crewe flees their home intoxicated in his girlfriend's Bentley. A high-speed pursuit ensues, the car is totaled, and Crewe is incarcerated in a federal prison for three years.<br/><br/>The warden of the prison is an avid football fan, and the prison has its own semi-professional team. The warden wants Crewe to coach his team; however, the guards would prefer that he not. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Crewe eventually agrees to assemble an all-convict team to scrimmage against the guards; with one catch, Crewe has to play quarterback.<br/><br/>What a difference thirty years make. In the original, you could almost believe this premise. The film was set in some work-release prison in the bayous of the south, with chain gangs, and southern drawls; where you could almost feel the heat and desperation the convicts not to mention their total resentment toward the guards. In this remake, the conviction just isn't present; plus, I really find it exceedingly hard to believe that any state would sanction this game, much less it being televised on ESPN.<br/><br/>Anyways, I highly recommend watching the original, rather than this 21st century reincarnation of the same. However, if you feel the need to see Adam Sandler in a football film, defer to his hilariously funny The Waterboy! http://farisreel.com"

","My son rented this DVD. I like Adam Sandler and I remembered enjoying the original 1974 title starring Burt Reynolds, so I was looking forward to seeing the remake. Unfortunately, besides miscasting Sandler as a pro football quarterback (I was subconsciously waiting for him to come onto the football field driving his lawnmower from ""The Waterboy""), the film is little more than a melange of one-liners and lame racial jokes. The story never builds any serious tension and the actors look lost. Yes, Courteny Cox' breasts were nice in the opening scene, but even they couldn't carry this dog. This film insults its audience - there were so many inaccuracies and unlikely scenarios that I lost my ability to suspend disbelief. I hope Adam Sandler gets better roles in the future."

"donjeffries","1","8","18","27 May 2005"," Most Ridiculous Casting In History Of Film
","Adam Sandler as a football player? Come on, now! Okay, we bought it once with ""Waterboy,"" but at least that was supposed to be a comedy and you could suspend your disbelief and buy what they were selling, just like you might have in an old Jerry Lewis movie. ""The Longest Yard"" expects you to swallow the notion that a short, dumpy (if not chubby), completely non- athletic nerd like Sandler could outdo much bigger and faster players on the football field (many of them ex-NFL stars). Why not just hire an actor that at least looked like an athlete? Or, if you must hire Sandler (for whatever bizarre reason), shouldn't he at least work out a little bit so that he could be in somewhat better shape? Sandler's movies have been unwatchable for years, for similar reasons to this. Sandler must be one insecure guy, because every movie he has been in has cast him as some kind of tough guy, with him punching out someone at least once. That is almost as ridiculous as casting him as a football star. Like so many recent Hollywood remakes, there was no good reason to remake the original here."
"robmeister","7","5","10","27 December 2006"," Mean Machine Redux!
","Okay, going in, I will admit freely that I am not the biggest Adam Sandler fan. I liked ""Big Daddy"" and I thought ""Anger Management"" was okay; you can have ""50 First Dates"". But this movie was very not bad!<br/><br/>But, the one thing I do like about Adam Sandler is the fact that the soundtracks in his films are top-rate. And this one is no exception. Every song used in this movie fit the story and the action to a T, and I really liked that the opening chase scene featured the same song (Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Mr. Saturday Night Special"") as in the original.<br/><br/>But enough about the music. Let's talk about the movie, while it's still fresh in my mind. In a nutshell, I enjoyed it. Some plot points were changed around from the original (like relocating the prison from Florida to Texas). But for the most part, ""The Longest Yard"" basically follows the same exact story line of the 1974 original. I was especially surprised about the library scene, something I did not expect in today's PC society. In case you haven't seen this film (or the original) yet, then I will stop here about the story.<br/><br/>James Cromwell slips into the shoes of Warden Hazen well, and seeing Burt Reynolds (star of the original) lend his support as Nate Scarborough was refreshing. Chris Rock, whose work I have enjoyed for years, was well-cast as Caretaker. As for Sandler, he took what was a dramatic story with funny moments into an all-out comedy with serious undertones. And, in a tip of the hat to Richard Kiel, this version of ""The Longest Yard"" features not one, but two XXXL players: Pro wrestler Dalip Singh (all 400 pounds of him), and heavyweight martial arts fighter Bob Sapp (whom Chris Berman himself described as a ""refrigerator with legs""). Throw in some former NFL players (Brian Bosworth, Michael Irvin), more wrestlers (Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin), and a hip-hop star (Nelly), and you got yourself a team (or two). And, oh yeah... Adam Sandler's in it too (Just kidding! He does a good job here!).<br/><br/>I liked some of the characterizations here. For example, Warden Hazen has a motivation for this football game of his (I won't say what it is, though -- That's what they call a ""spoiler""); in the original, the warden just seemed absently maniacal. At the same time, Scarborough was too shallow. No offense to Burt Reynolds, but I couldn't help thinking that some people would watch this film and ask ""Okay, so who's the old man on the team?""<br/><br/>Technically, this version flowed a lot more smoothly than the original. I also like that the editing style employed in the game (as well as in a basketball scene and some of the practices) was an homage to the original. To me, it seems that Sandler wanted to honor the original, while making it his own film with its own legs at the same time. If that is so, then to me, he succeeded.<br/><br/>If you like the original, don't be afraid to watch this. Believe me, it's worthy. If you haven't seen the original yet, then do so (After all, it's Reynolds in his prime). I won't review the original here, but I did post it.<br/><br/>So, there it is. ""The Longest Yard"" excels in some spots, falls a little short in others, but this remake is worth a look."

It surprise me at this movie can go up and be one of the most successfully movies of 2005, or well; maybe not.... since Chris Rock and Adam Sandler is in it, but still - it sucks.<br/><br/>If you instead want to watch something funny with Sandler, watch Litte Nicky, Happy Gilmore or Spanglish.<br/><br/>Hopefully Click will be better."

","The longest yard comes up a little over two feet short. I think Burt must have been very hard up to even consider the script. Hopefully the screenwriter of this title graduates from junior high so he can get into high school in the fall. If he studies hard maybe in about 80 years he will be able to write another script that will be worthy of production....this one wasn't. Don't get me wrong....there are a lot of people laughing all the way to the bank. This is why the Hollywood click makes films. This one was an exercise to demonstrate why sequels JUST DON'T WORK most of the time.

Adam Sandler seems to just be going through the motions and Burt has a look in his eye in about every scene that seems to be saying, ""Why the hell did we screw with a good thing?""

"Kulp02","6","4","8","31 May 2005"," The Longest Yard scores with music television crowd
","The Longest Yard is a better than average movie that is likely to disappoint moviegoers that enjoyed the original in its box office run. Anybody would be able to enjoy this generally well put together story, but its MTV-style production is a miserable failure that is both obnoxious and over-the-top.<br/><br/>In fact, this film's desire to appeal to the music television crowd is not only its worst aspect, but its embarrassing at times. Chris Rock, while funny in the supporting role as Caretaker, the friendly inmate that can things from the outside, is almost as racy on his HBO specials, and his racial comments are frequently unnecessary and inappropriate. In fact, The Longest Yard is filled from top to bottom with cultural stereotypes and builds on unnecessary racial barriers.<br/><br/>And no football film could be complete without cheerleaders; unfortunately, the unit is comprised entirely of guys in outfits that can only be described as upsetting. While this may have been funny to see once or twice, there are no fewer than 5 shots of the spectacle, and the group is in way too many other scenes. There is so much more here that is simply wrong, and to put it simply, some stuff just is not funny and some people are going to be offended.<br/><br/>If the possibility of being offended appeals to you, there is a pretty solid movie here. Adam Sandler stars in what is arguably his best film in years, and he is very believable in the role of a washed up quarterback. The supporting cast is also mostly superb, right up to bit roles like the one sportscaster Dan Patrick plays at the beginning of the film. Former NFL wide receiver Michael Irvin and rapper Nelly are also notable for their excellent performances.<br/><br/>While there are a lot of good things to be said about the cast, the direction of the film strays at times. Some of the more serious scenes were corny (yes, corny) to the point where I wanted to laugh out loud, and on the total opposite end of the spectrum, many of the events that took play were completely irrational, totally ridiculous, or just flat out impossible.<br/><br/>In the end, what you get is a typical Happy Madison movie with MTV's production. The results are some fantastic camera work, a ton of celebrities and athletes in the cast, and of course hip music. The Longest Yard is a success because it isn't a failure, but it falls short of being a really good movie."

But I didn't come out saying, ""Great movie."" I came out disappointed. Adam Sandler didn't make me laugh like Burt did in the original; James Cromwell was wasted as the warden; and Chris Rock seemed like he was just reciting his stand up act.

","The original version of The Longest Yard is a near classic. Burt Reynolds was believable as the ex-football star turned bad guy.

It made sense that women were falling over him, which partially got him in trouble in the beginning of the movie. But Adam Sandler? Are you kidding me? Sandlker playing a role that Burt Reynolds originated? Sandler playing a role of a tough guy? That's just not believable. It's even more absurd that played a former NFL quarterback. This guy probably couldn't throw the ball a yard, much less the longest yard. The Longest Yard is a move that needs to be carried on the back of its star. Burt Reynolds did that so well in the original. Sandler, a huge miscast (probably by his own demanding) couldn't this movie off the ground. And that's where the football would be with him, on the ground, under a heap of football players who would have flattened the wimpy Sandler. The movie gets a five overall, however, because of a decent supporting cast (including Reynolds), and it was still a good story."

I like the idea of Adam Sandler starring in another football movie.<br/><br/>This time around he plays Paul Crewe, a former pro football player famous for point shaving (throwing the game) in a game years prior to the start of the movie. He pulls a crazy drunk driving stunt that lands him in a Texas prison. He is forced by Warden Hazen, played by James Cromwell, to be a consultant for the football team consisting of his guards. Reluctantly, he agrees and is then forced to form a football team of the prisoners.<br/><br/>In prison, he meets Caretaker, played by Chris Rock. Rock is brilliant in this part and makes this character his own. Caretaker becomes Paul Crewe's assistant coach.<br/><br/>Another supporting player is Nate Scarborough, played by Burt Reynolds. Reynolds is one of two actors from the original who appears in this movie. Scarborough is a former Heisman Trophy winner who wants to coach.<br/><br/>There are many other interesting characters. Rapper Nelly plays a running back. Former Dallas Cowboy receiver Michael Irvin plays receiver for the prisoners. Terry Crews is a prisoner who is associated with McDonald's, his character is known as Cheeseburger Eddy. Tracy Morgan plays a cross dressing cheerleader. Former NFL lineman Bob Sapp plays Switowski, a defensive lineman who is not smart but is good at being aggressive.<br/><br/>Even some famous wrestlers appear in this movie. Bill Goldberg plays a linebacker for the prisoners. Kevin Nash plays a defensive lineman who has steroids replaced with estrogen. Steve Austin plays a fullback who is racist and arrogant.<br/><br/>There is even a brief appearance by Cloris Leachman, who previously worked with Adam Sandler in Spanglish.

With his pal Peter Segal's camera and a screenwriter named Robert Sheldon, he recreates the prison football movie ""The longest yard"", riskily leaving his acting partners behind (not all of them, Rob Schneider gets a stupid cameo: he's not funny!) and gathering a whole new team that includes the heavy Chris Rock, the experienced Burt Reynolds and the rapper Nelly.<br/><br/>The story, I believe, is quite the same as the original one, but probably with some updates here and there. Failed football star Paul Crewe (Sandler) gets drunk and in big troubles with the law. Ends up in prison where Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) likes football and wants him to train the inmates and play against the guards' semi-pro team led by the evil Captain Knauer (William Fichtner).<br/><br/>Rock plays the black friend (why does that character always have to die?) Caretaker, Reynolds plays the pro Coach Nate Scarborough and those three will try to get their team complete, including the ""neighborhood"", where fast guy Megget (skillfully played by Nelly) and partners reside. The rage every inmate has for the guards will make them play; with effort and dedication. The matter will grow wider, and the match will be televised by ESPN, and the team <br/><br/>The team is the core of the film. It includes the extremely big and with problems for speaking Turley (Indian power lifter Dalip Singh), the supposedly not gay but not strong or talented Brucie (Nick Turturo), the enormous enough to kill you with a friendly hug Switowsky (Bob Sapp), the arrogant and strong Deacon (Michael Irvin), the Mc Donald's fan Cheeseburger Eddy (""White Chicks'"" Terry Crews) and others.<br/><br/>With them you experience the events, with them you sympathize, for them you want the best. Sandler finds himself in his best moment, telling the people he's still funny or even truer, that he never stopped being, and that he's doing Hollywood's best comedies (leaving ""Mr. Deeds"" aside). Chris Rock provides all of the fun, but the loud way of speaking doesn't work the same in live flesh as in animation; and the racist commentaries tire a little bit.<br/><br/>The pros; Reynolds sets himself in a type of role that suits him perfectly and could help him during the last phase of his late career, if he doesn't wan to take risks. And Cromwell manages to look very young and to keep us entertained as he uses a very monotone and serious tone of voice throughout the entire ride. While not a pro, William Fichtner also highlights as the bastard Knauer.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, Peter Segal is at his best making his piece look beautiful, at least, for what a prison declares. Also unexpectedly, MTV Films and Sandler's Happy Madison company, dedicatedly make us happy (without the need of any female pressence...), as they accomplish another one of those good contemporary comedies."

It just doesn't work. I was thinking that this had to be just horrible miscasting until I saw that Sandler is the Executive Producer. Mmmhmmm... It just got worse: from the most unimaginative screenplay I have heard in a decade to over-the-top cinematography (was like watching 115 minute commercial) to its caricature inmates and guards to its unbeLIEVable prison grounds... it doesn't end. Sorry, friends, stick to the original. At least Reynolds didn't take himself so pretentiously serious. Yikes. (MVP quarterback???? C'mon!)"
"tastyhotdogs","7","2","3","11 November 2005"," It was a'iight
","This was the movie I've most wanted to see on DVD for some time. I love great comedy pairings, and even though in the last decade very few have worked (bar Wilson and Stiller), what else are you gonna see at the movies except a braindead action movie, a comic book adaption or an art-house movie that walk out of totally confused?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a remake of the 70's classic which I never saw. Basically, it's about a washed up,disgraced ex NFL star, who loses the plot one night and crashes a heap of police cars. He goes straight to prison, luckily besides the guards it looks like a lovely place to hang out. Pretty quickly the warden wants to put his football skills to the test and a guards vs crims match is set-up.<br/><br/>It's pretty predictable, and focuses pretty much purely on the football game. There's plenty of stars in the movie, but most went into this one purely to CTC. Rock and Sandler put in pretty lazy performances, although they have a few good one-liners. The best performance comes from Terry Crewe, playing Cheeseburger Eddy. He was also great in ""White Chicks"", and is likely gonna keep getting these same ridiculous roles for years to come."

","The Longest Yard is one of the summer blockbusters. It made near 150 million. There was a lot of talk about it and how it was becoming successful at the box office. But the critics were pretty harsh on this one. Yet, I can see why there were many bad reviews, but this is something different form Adam Sandler. His movies were always the same. The Longest Yard is a little different because it deals with something else. He had two movies that dealt with football. The Waterboy and The Longest Yard. He had the same character as he always did in The Waterboy but his character was different in The Longest Yard. Most of his movie are always funny because of the idiotic things. This is a much different movie than his others.<br/><br/>I would have thought The Longest Yard was a lousy and cheesy comedy. It isn't. It was an entertaining comedy that I enjoyed. 7.5/10"
"okieindian","1","2","3","29 September 2005"," The Longest Yard 2005 is poor remake of the Original
","Like so many of today's remakes of GREAT movies, The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler has substituted bad dialogue,less believable actors and left out key scenes that made the original a classic. I have watched the original Longest Yard dozens of times and it is always entertaining without the vulgarity of this remake. The scene with Cloris Leachman and Sandler was a sad departure from the original with Bernadette Peters and Burt Reynolds. Sad because it wasn't funny, was unrealistic and basically was a bad parody of some Mel Brooks comedy that has long been forgotten. <br/><br/>Watching the movie, my thoughts turned to the inability of today's movie makers to create something NEW and makes me wonder why so many are so intent on turning something good into garbage. If ""Oklahoma"" comes back to Broadway with an all different cast, would anyone be dumb enough to trash the dialogue, the songs and the scenes?? I doubt it! Then why must the boys making movies try to ruin a good movie...<br/><br/>Eddie Murphy has done a terrific job of trashing great movies and now Sandler is following in his footsteps... <br/><br/>I would rather watch dust settle on the furniture than watch even a small part of the Longest Yard remake again."

"eric262003","6","1","1","19 March 2019"," Can Drag At Times With An Exciting Climax
","It will never go down as a timeless classic, obviously because this a remake and remakes usually never are, but still even the original 1974 film wasn't anything we can call memorable either. This version of ""The Longest Yard"" has a mixed array of comical nastiness, with some prison drama for good measure and a climactic football scene at the end. There are scenes that are at times hit or miss, but if you stay till the end, you've managed to witness the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Though it tries to recapture the essence of the original 1974 version, it's still just another added lazy attempt to take an old movie just to add a modern spin to appease the younger generation. What gave the 1974 version of ""The Longest Yard"" a fresh take on the sports genre was that through all the plodding and conflicts aside, the fans can genuinely sit through a fictional game while at the same time, the filmmakers can do some manipulating by making it feel like it was a real game. The energy, the action and the intensity looks and feels very authentic. Since then sports themed movies have captured that formula ever since.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler steps up here while taking himself out of his man-child phase to play the role as Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe, a former NFL star player who while drunk-driving in his girlfriend's (Courtney Cox) Bentley and then his car was smashed in a pileup. Crewe was then taken to jail at a maximum security prison where he's being roughed up by the guards who take the pleasure to abuse their power like every prison drama (the cliches come alive here).<br/><br/>James Cromwell stars as the scheming Warden Rudolph Hazen was the man responsible for Crewe's imprisonment. His prison guards are also trained football stars and he wants his elite to win the state championship wish will guarantee that he will win his seat as the State Governor. Crewe agrees to coach this team and wants the guards to have an exhibition challenge where Hazen suggests it be up against the inmates.<br/><br/>And so the story takes off from there, just everything from the original version is redone and recycled and it's up to the audience to make comparisons and judgments between the two. Even though it wasn't a common trend back in 1974 it is now. Like in every sports themed movies all the repeated scenarios come into play. We have the overwhelming coach, the bumbling underdog team that lacks in coordination, training sessions don't go as planned, the tough love approach, the underdogs emerging on top and other stuff that has been done to death. In the end it can be a bit of a drag with each scene doing the same things repeatedly. Crewe goes to great lengths to get big or fast guys on the team with his recurring belief that going against the guards will be the best way for them to get their comeuppance and to exploit them for who they really are.<br/><br/>The movie does manage to stroll along, but very sporadically. if it weren't for the performances of Chris Rock who provides the most laughs here and Burt Reynolds who starred in the 1974 version and returns here which is nice as they play important roles in getting their team together. It's nice that Reynolds is playing a supporting role and not some nostalgia pop cameo role. Nice some nice comic relief from Cloris Leachman who plays an old lady who has the hots for Crewe.<br/><br/>If you could survive two thirds of this formulaic cliche of a movie, then you are in for a real treat because the football action is filled with excitement and atmosphere. You can't get any better than this. If you're a WWE fan, you'll be pleased to see several wrestler appear here including Bill Goldberg, The Great Khali, Kevin Nash and Steve Austin. This movie may not be for everyone, especially for those who hate remakes, football or prison dramas. Please be advised there are scenes with crude humour sexual innuendos."

"phubbs","4","1","1","19 September 2017"," The Longest Yard
","So as you can tell from the title this is a modern (for the time) remake of the Burt Reynolds vehicle of the same name. And when I say its a remake I mean its literally a scene for scene remake, but now a vehicle for Adam Sandler. The plot is identical to the original movie which sees Paul Crewe (Sandler) going to jail after assaulting his rich girlfriend and then going off on a joyride in her expensive car. <br/><br/>Upon arrival in the big house Crewe is pressured/blackmailed into coaching the jail football team by the warden; but eventually ends up organising a training game between the convicts and guards. Crewe must battle his inner demons, pride and dignity versus cowing down to the warden for a safe but cowardly existence. Of course not much of that is translated across into this because its an Adam Sandler movie. Cue lots of immature toilet humour and sexual innuendos.<br/><br/>The first thing that really doesn't work in this movie is the plot opener. We find Crewe with his rich girlfriend, living in her luxurious pad. Said girlfriend is an uncredited cameo by Courtney Cox who looks unbelievable gorgeous I kid you not. She basically explains to Crewe that she owns him, he is her toy, as long as he obeys...his life will be very comfortable. Who in their right mind would say no to this??!! And before you think about it, you all need to see Cox and the outfit she's in. No bloke would walk away from this scenario, I'd be on my knees begging to be leashed and collared! So straight away I'm thinking this character is an idiot for throwing this away (the hot girl and her assets).<br/><br/>The next problem I had with this is Sandler and the fact he's just not believable as an ex-pro footballer. Admittedly Reynolds wasn't overly convincing to look at either but at least he looked relatively fit. But that's just a minor issue really, the real issue (as mentioned above) is the fact that this movie loses all the heart, soul and grit of the original. The 1974 movie was three things: an acceptable comedy, a hard and surprisingly dark prison drama, and a reasonably gritty sports flick. This new movie is a cheap slapstick riddled spoof, chock full of profanity and cameos mugging for the camera. The prison setting is merely an excuse for lots of clichéd predictable prison related sight gags and nothing more. There is no real tension or drama, that aspect has been totally jettisoned. And despite the sports side of things being much glossier and slickly shot, it doesn't hold a candle to the original movie.<br/><br/>Its actually incredible to see the difference between the two movies when it comes down to the football side of things. In the original movie the game was very down to earth, nothing fancy. A brutal game of football in a very basic looking arena with no frills, it was believable. In this remake the game looks like something from the flippin' NFL! The arena is huge with all the modern perks, the pitch is perfect, massive crowds, sexy cheerleaders, all very glamorous. Clearly this prison has some money apparently. I admit I don't know much about American football being British, I do know American universities and colleges do have amazing sports facilities that far outstrip anything similar in the UK. But would a US prison have such sports facilities?<br/><br/>As for the cast, well naturally you have double the big name cameos of the original, both sports and entertainment wise. Sports wise there are quite a few big football names in here, never heard of them myself so I'll just leave it there. Entertainment wise there are some cool additions such as one time action man (and footballer) Brian Bosworth. David Patrick Kelly is perfect as the weaselly snitch Unger, but criminally underused. Quentin Tarantino collaborator Eddie Bunker just about manages his role (he looked pretty old). And Crewe's right- hand man 'Caretaker' is played by Chris Rock; who spends most of his screen time making jokes about white boys because apparently that's all he can do. <br/><br/>Cloris Leachman, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, William Fichtner, Dalip Singh (dude his HUGE), Rob Schneider makes his usual pointless Sandler movie cameo, and James Cromwell adds gravitas as warden Hazen. Lastly Reynolds plays Nate Scarborough in a cringeworthy performance that isn't helped by the fact his ancient character steps in to play as a replacement and manages to score a touchdown. Because of course he does. I can't single out any one cast member though seeing as they were all pretty terrible. Twas like watching amateur dramatics half the time.<br/><br/>All in all this entire venture just seemed pointless. A chance for Sandler to mess around with his mates and call it work, and Reynolds needing work. What makes it so painful is the fact they've totally missed the point of the original movie by cutting the actual drama. Yeah there is some funny visual stuff sure, but you balance that with gritty tension of the prison setting. The only part they kinda got right was the death of Caretaker, but cutting back into infantile humour so quickly just destroys any emotional impact. Maybe if they hadn't aimed this at the moronic teenage MTV crowd (obligatory rap soundtrack...ugh!) it could of been half decent. But even then what's the point when the original captured it all so perfectly. And that's where I'm gonna end this, stick to the original.<br/><br/>4.5/10"
"stormhawk2020","5","1","1","7 September 2017"," Powerful machine!
","For those who like American football and absurd comedies, this can be a drinking option.<br/><br/>The tape seeks at all times the entertainment and the fun with situations full of tolerable and sympathetic ridicule, where the pursuit of the claim in the pride and the value of playing for the ideals in spite of the consequences are the strongest subjects that are developed in the speech. Thus, a group of convicts will be able to take revenge of the abuses committed by the guard-prisons in a game of football. Although the circumstances deviate from common sense and do not cause the laughter, they become dynamic and keep hooked to that spectator without so many pretensions in the elaboration of the argument.<br/><br/>From the performances we have what we can expect a priori: Adam Sandler and Chris Rock in their conventional comic roles. They do not leave even a single moment of what they know how to do better: light characters but with a lot of charisma. Also it is necessary to mention that Burt Reynolds hardly obtains a discreet personage, although its interpretation brings the unique hint of sobriety before so much dizzy chatter.<br/><br/>From the aesthetic and technical section we have a film full of sequences in slow motion to give showdown to the spectacular and action that becomes a contact sport. This is accompanied by familiar musical themes that further promote and accentuate the dynamic character of the film.<br/><br/>In short, an acceptable and jovial alternative if one can deviate from prejudices and accept in advance that the film is a hobby lacking in presumption."

","It's not funny, just silly. The humor's corny overall. I can picture a little kid having written this one. Adam's made funnier. It's not the acting, it's the dialogue and directing. Out of four stars, I'd give it one, for it's definitely sub-par. The original's better. The only good part is Here Comes the Boom. And I understand the ending's trying to make an @$$ of the warden but come on, it's obvious that even William Fitchner's character sure thought Adam Sandler was going for the gate to escape. ...And then he shoves the rifle at the warden upon the false alarm like he's such an idiot. The stupidest thing, though, is Adam deciding to stay in prison from a fellow inmate's insight. You don't throw your life away to metaphorically pop someone. You POPPED him, it's not like you negatively altered his LIFE. And how has it been worth ""every dam minute"" of staying in prison when it's obvious he'll never change and isn't exactly crying about it every day? Your punch to his face he's clearly shaken off and forgotten about as easily as an itch that he simply scratched away."
"Drake_Clawfang","8","1","1","15 January 2006"," A Surprising Twist from Sandler
","After all of Adam Sandler's mediocre comedies, this one stands out above the rest. Unlike so many comedies, this one never sacrifices plot for humor. The final football game, titled 'Pros vs. Cons' only features humor in small doses. The majority of the final scenes are geared towards the game that has been the highlight of the whole movie.<br/><br/>The movie has some surprisingly tender and heartfelt moments. Just watch that scene were Crewe (Sandler) runs for the first down without his team's support, and try not to be inspired. And the funny, but oh-so believable part of the game comes in the opening plays when the prisoners care nothing about the ball and tackle the guards that have caused them personal trouble. Of course, this allows the guards to get 2 touchdowns in 2 plays, but the Mean Machine makes a comeback.<br/><br/>Chris Rock provides just as many jokes as Adam Sandler, playing the resourceful but foul-mouthed Caretaker. With lines ranging from 'I'll teach you anything, just don't eat me!' to 'You've got one brother out there, this ain't hockey.', Caretaker's quick wit snaps in a joke whenever Crewe can't fit one in. Such a pity what happens to him.<br/><br/>The Warden seems like an odd character. At first, he appears nice and fair, being friendly to Crewe. Then he rigs the game in his favor at half-time and floods the practice field so the prisoners can't practice. But considering that Crewe's motives go from losing the game to actually winning, it makes sense. And the various hulking prisoners have their jokes. Of particular note is 'The Sasquatch', a 7'10 450 pound titan that has all his lines subtitled. Apparently, the directors did this so people can understand his easier, but it actually becomes funny without trying after a while.<br/><br/>If you've been disappointed by Sandler's films thus far, go see this one. It's a touch above the rest."
"michaelRokeefe","4","1","1","17 December 2005"," Fourth and long. More silly than gritty.
","Maybe director Peter Segal just didn't have the right people to work with. I was not impressed with this remake of the 1974 sports comedy. Paul Crewe(Adam Sandler)is a former pro football player banned from the game for shaving points. He steals and crashes his wealthy and foxy girlfriend's(Courteney Cox)car and is also picked up for DUI. This roguish NFL quarterback is now set to spend the next two years in Allenville, a Texas prison. The warden(James Cromwell)forces Crewe to organize a team of cons to play the prison guards led by William Fichtner. There is some pretty well choreographed football sequences; story line is mostly repeat of original...just not acted out as well. The cast is made up of comedians, rappers, wrestlers and former sports stars...the likes of: Chris Rock, Bill Goldberg, Brian Bosworth, Tracy Morgan, Nelly, Michael Irvin and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Others in the cast: Cloris Leachman, Nicholas Turturro, William Williamson and Burt Reynolds. Sight gags and prison queens in drag as cheerleaders evokes the substance of this poor stab at comedy."

Some of the sexual jokes may not be suitable for younger audiences. As compared to the original with Burt Reynolds, the remake is much funnier and more enjoyable to watch. The director also did a great job of introducing the characters and gets viewers to really dislike the guards with use of racial discrimination and abuse to Paul Crewe. Adam Sandler along with Chris Rock makes this a great comedy for all teenagers. The chemistry of these two actors showed in this movie. They were why this movie was so funny. Sandler did a great job of playing Paul Crewe and was a huge factor of why this remake was better than the original.<br/><br/>Movie technology played a big role in why this movie was so entertaining. The final football game was intense, humorous, and fun. Camera positioning and cutting made one feel as if they were in the game. This not only occurred in the final game, but also throughout the entire movie. This remake is one that can be watched over and over because the comedy never gets old.

The original was so much better that I would recommend people go rent it. It's very good. Blockbuster is open late. That show had its comedic moments, but it also had good tension between Reynolds (NFL QB) and Eddie Albert (Warden). There was good acting, drama, suspense and relief in the resolution at the end. That was a drama that had good comedic moments. This is a ""comedy"" that has nothing.<br/><br/>This remake is a mess. Adam Sandler is miscast (but he is one of the producers so..), Chris Rock is annoying and the wisecracks, prison transvestites and football stunts are old hat, not funny and actually quite boring. I didn't find one line worthy of a laugh or even a smile. No drama, no suspense and I didn't care about anyone. Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell and all the supporting cast are very good, but with the ""star"" being miscast there isn't much hope for the rest of this.<br/><br/>Now, why is Sandler miscast?

","First let me say that any movie that is a re-make should expect comparison and face the wrath, especially if the original is of extremely high quality.<br/><br/>1. The Warden - I'm sorry but, the gritty performance that Eddie Albert is far superior. His warden was just mean. You could see the hate in his eyes and the contempt he held for anything and everything. The way he spoke when upset, you could see him grinding his teeth. <br/><br/>2. Caretaker - Unfortunately, when you grab a comedian like Chris Rock, the humor that this movie is directed at requires that it be his type of humor. The end result, though, funny CR adds nothing new to the role. And it's about high time CR step out of his style of humor and do more challenging work. IE Tom Hanks, Jamie Fox (just a note - Ray was a joke - one long music video - Enjoyably, but Oscar worthy, I don't think so). The role caretaker could really have done it for him. Hell, even the name tells you what the role is about. A role that Morgan Freeman does so well SSR (robbbed of the Oscar that man was).<br/><br/>3. Crewe - Sandler does an acceptable performance and this along with Spanlish you can see that he wants to step out of the typical Sandler role.<br/><br/>4. Nate - The problem for me is that because this movie went for the jokes it waisted the pivotal role the Nates character was in the original. Nate's character went into the game because Crewe's character had quit and it was when he got his knee broken that Crewe's character shifts.<br/><br/>5. Players - Did a pretty good job, especially finding a David Keith look alike. Except he shouldn't have been playing the psychotic character. The reason the psycho character was so great for me was that he wasn't the biggest one, but he was definitely the last one you would ever want to be in a room together with. They were acceptable, but lacked the grittiness of the original players and way over done on the joke aspect.<br/><br/>6. Guards - Again acceptable, but jokes over done. Especially the Estrogen joke. The original did a great job of focusing at the end and this movie distracts from this by overplaying the hormone Joke.<br/><br/>7. Captain Knucker - Fintchner does a good part of it. But the problem is that they give too much expose of whether we should view him as a good guy or not. The original its not clear as to if he is a good guy, or is he more disgusted by the Warden that he doesn't shoot Crewe.<br/><br/>8. Warden's Side kick - What joke this character was. I know that in the original all he does is walk around, but the one line he gives at the end of the movie and how he delivers it ""His store re."", is incredible. This one scene is living proof that ""there are no small roles only small actors."" Give Albert's Warden an ice shower and he'd a shot them on the spot.<br/><br/>9. Showeroom seen - Reynold's Crewe speech is more mocking the Wardens inability to be out on the field versus Sandler's ""I wish you were out there"". It is a way of calling the Warden impotent.<br/><br/>10. Caretakers death - Again the movie lightens it up by not showing the man burning or hearing him scream. <br/><br/>OK, but the absolutely unforgivable thing I have is the letting the audience off the hook scene. I have to say now, that I hated this when I first saw the original, but now I see how brilliant the original movie makers were. Can you guess where I'm going? That's right, the original gives the impression that Reynold's Crewe will spend the rest of his life in prison, this one lets you off the hook. I can't forgive this, because the original leaves a bitter sweet feeling. Yeah, he won the game, but damn. He's going to spend the rest of his life in prison. Which makes it more ironic when he walks off with Pop.<br/><br/>11. Side problems - A film maker does have some moral responsibility to society. Drunk Driving is just not acceptable. To diminish it as a joke, well it's just in bad taste. Just because you can do something, does not mean you should do it. The point of any art is to influence people - to laugh, to cry, to think, to motivate etc. As a result an artist should be careful what he does, because if he is to accept the good things that his art inspires, than he must also accept those negative things it inspires. Getting off the soap box for a moment, the original doesn't let Crewe's character off the hook in this respect. We immediately view him as a flawed man and rooting for him is not meant to be easy for us. The way they played it was just for laughs, how about him hurting someone.<br/><br/>I guess you can some up for me that this Mean Machine, had no Machine and a lot less Mean. My suggestion watch the Soccer Version ""Mean Machine"" It keeps better faith to the grittiness of the Original.<br/><br/>The sad part of it is, I would have liked this movie if had not been for the original. This is proof of what happens when your bring the peripheral humor to the foreground."

","The Longest Yard was, in my opinion, an unsuccessful remake of the classic, even though it had some funny moments... First of, for me Sandler just doesn't look like he could be a quarterback, let alone the MVP of the National Football League, I'm just not buying that... Secondly, Chris Rocks character was pretty much ... well...Chris Rock, which is a good thing because he's hilarious in this one. Rock and an almost equally funny Tracey Morgan couldn't hold this movie together though as i lost interest quickly. The movie just seemed to drag on too long and the ending was very predictable.

","When you watch these things, they provide little amusement by themselves. All the fun is in watching ourselves watch it.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that this is a genre twice removed. You start with the sports movie. The formula there is rather strict: underdog or compromised hero, forces working against them in a deliberate way, goodness and godliness equated with something like perseverance and commitment, and the little guy(s) triumph.<br/><br/>For some reason this little formula just won't die and I think it is because we have discovered how to make sports cinematic. Or we have reinvented sport to be cinematic: basketball, for example.<br/><br/>Because the formula is so tight, you can have all sorts of comedic takeoffs. When Burt did his 30 years ago, that notion was fresh.<br/><br/>Now we have a whole new genre to apply, the Adam Sandler movie. I admit I like this man's created persona. He seems to have good intuitions about how to surround himself with elements that support his type of light, self-deprecating humor. ""50 First Dates"" was in its own way a parody of self-referential cinema, the re-introduction to love each episode. Turns ""Groundhog Day"" inside out both in concept and manner.<br/><br/>So in watching this, you have several degrees of separation: life, whatever collection of metaphors that sports abstracts from life, movies about that, movies that parody that, and this, an Adam Sandler movie of a parody of a representation of an abstraction of life.<br/><br/>++++<br/><br/>Since watching ""Bleak House,"" I am reminded of how much society hates lawyers. When something is so deep, it takes on a life of its own, beyond stereotype. James Cromwell has made a career out of playing lawyers and men who have power and carry it with a dignified artifice. Dangerous because they know their own fragility. He also does wardens, as here.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"urbanlegend23","6","3","7","11 July 2005"," Enough with the football, Adam!
","""The Longest Yard"" (2005) Dir. Peter Segal Gosh, Adam Sandler really does need to call it a day with these mediocre football films. ""The Waterboy"" was retarded and lame, bringing Sandler down from a once actually-quite-good-comedic-reputation. ""Yard"" is better than ""Waterboy"" but it is still nothing more than just another football movie from Sandler with a lame moral.<br/><br/>It actually doesn't start out too bad. Courteney Cox-Arquette plays the bitch from hell with great breasts so well you're not left wanting her to wither and die in the closet she's locked in but to come out of there and join the football team herself. The situation which leads to Sandler being thrown in the joint is fairly humorous and well-filmed.<br/><br/>Once he gets there, the film remains entertaining and puts Sandler's character in a tight spot, he is left to recruit an entire football team by orders from the nasty warden played by James Cromwell (perhaps spoofing his own role in ""The Green Mile""?) to play the guards, despite William Fichtner's vicious guard leader seriously disapproving of the competition.<br/><br/>Sandler goes off about recruiting members of the football team to play, and in a jail full of huge, scary convicts, it isn't too hard to get together a team to bring Fichtner's guards to weak knees. I particularly enjoyed the basketball sequence, very cool, and the character of the enormous black guy who could lift an entire bench of his inmates up like they were flies, while all the time underneath being a bit of a big softie.<br/><br/>The film is successful in that it works up a number of likable, funny characters, even though most of them are stereotypes. The draggy/cross-dressing stereotype is played on in a funny way when they become the official cheerleaders. The black guys, big guys who look scary but are nice underneath, all of that is here. All of these are obviously unoriginal and undeveloped characters but they remain fun to watch nonetheless.<br/><br/>Less enjoyable to watch are the prison guards, though we see very little of them. When it comes time for us to finally feel sympathy for them and kinda like them a little bit, it's too late in the game (no pun) as we haven't had enough time prior to this development to give it any build-up. The battle between the prison guards and the inmates is also irritatingly far-fetched at times, it's doubtful that the guys doing time would be given enough freedom to gain access to the guards' locker rooms, or that they would be left alone in the projector room! But where the movie really falls from grace is the last half an hour or so, which feels like the entire two hours all in one go. The final game against the guards and inmates (held in a stadium to cheering fans, dear God) just drags on for too long, personally I lost momentum and interest after five minutes.<br/><br/>Chris Rock is also wasted here, the resolution to his character is such a bad move for the film, showing that he was in ""Yard"" to be nothing more than Chris Rock himself and make funny lines in the background. He had no relevance to the plot at all.<br/><br/>Sandler himself is stomachable enough, I always like him better when he's not doing his crazy over-the-top antics ALA ""Little Nicky"" and is just playing the regular guy facing off against incredible odds. The film's cast is actually quite impressive, with Burt Reynolds playing a supporting part with enough Reynoldsy charm to render him watchable, and Nelly being one of the film's highlights (!). Nelly even holds his own in a sort-of dramatic scene in which the guards continuously drop books while Nelly's character is doing library duty. He was very likable in the film and one of my favourite parts of it.<br/><br/>Though the film has energy to spare until the last frame, Sandler doesn't know when to call it quits with the damn final football game, and he has to realise that watching guys to tackled OVER and OVER again (a Nelly song, in fact) may not be as enjoyable for an impatient audience as it is for him.<br/><br/>6/10"
"DKosty123","6","3","7","29 May 2005"," Remake is Funny, Len Burman Whoop, Whoop, Whoop
","This remake of the Classic Burt Reynolds film is very good. The review I read in a Gannett Publication was from a reviewer who obviously had a chip on his should because he did not like the original. He should have not reviewed this new one.<br/><br/>Burt Reynolds original film was more a Comedy-Drama & is a Classic for the more mature viewers. Doing Football as a straight comedy is not easy to do. This remake goes to straight comedy & gets the job done. It is the best football comedy since the Marx Brothers did HORSEFEATHERS in 1933.<br/><br/>While this films follows the script of the original, it softens the serious tone & adds much more comedic talent updating it to the present day very well. The music soundtrack for this fits in very well to mixing Rap & Classic Rock in fine form.<br/><br/>It is sad this movies premiere week-end marks the death of Eddie Albert, fortunately this film softens the latest warden into more of a straight man role than a dramatic one. If you compare the 2 wardens & films, you will see just how talented Eddie Albert was.<br/><br/>My favorite throwaway humor line in this version is after the Warden tells Crew (Sadler) that he is planning to be Governor of the state & run it like his prison, Crew says ""only with a lot less Sodomy?"" The Warden hilariously replies ""Hopefully none!"". <br/><br/>Len Berman commenting during the game is great addition to this film. I am afraid that the sequel is but a sequel. Unfortunately, because this was good, it has spurred on way too many football movies since it was released. <br/><br/>Caretaker by Chris Rock is much funnier than the serious tone James Hampton took, & both versions work well in both films. This remake is a good film for the young teens, funny & solid. Love Chris Berman in this too. Enjoy the laughs & you could go all the way to some harmless fun."
"aeo","1","4","11","4 June 2005"," What a terrible remake!
","I give this 1 star out of 10.<br/><br/>The original Longest Yard with Burt Reynolds had grit, interesting characters, good dialogue, good acting, and a overall good chemistry between the actors to create a very good movie. This remake is 180 degrees from what I just stated above. This is a slapstick and totally unfunny remake of the 1970's classic.<br/><br/>The reason why I hate this movie is first, Chris Rock is totally unbelievable as the prison inmate who is supposed to be respected by all because he can you get things, however, all he does is just do his stupid one dimensional stand up in this movie. He just sucks in movies. He should just stick with voice-over work in animation where we don't have to see him. <br/><br/>Second, the actor who played the evil warden was unbelievable as the menacing villain in this movie. That is not to say that I don't like this actor. He is good but just not convincing as the evil warden. In the original, the warden was played by the actor from Green Acres TV series and he played it very well. You really believed that the warden was certifiable psycho who was bent on winning at all cost. <br/><br/>Third, the supporting prison inmates were not funny, and on top of that, most could not act. <br/><br/>Fourth, it was annoying to see Courtney Cox playing the spurned lover of Adam Sandler in this movie. I do not like any movie that has any of the Friends cast in it. Those actors and actresses have had their moment of fame, and it is now time for them to disappear. <br/><br/>Fifth, Adam Sandler does a very poor job of portraying the main character Crewe. In the original, Burt Reynolds brought a great dimension to the original character by showing the nuances of this burned out football player. Here, Sandler just plays his part in a stilted manner and he almost seem like he does not want to play this part nor be part of this movie at all. <br/><br/>If you put all this factors together, you get one big pile of CRAP! Now, what I am saying is not to see this movie, but rather, it is not necessary to go out and purposely see this movie in a movie theater unless you can see at a substantial discount; meaning, for no more than two dollars. Just wait for it on DVD."

Burt Reynolds, the star of the original 'The Longest Yard' has a brief role. Sandler is alright though no one is really stretched in the film.

","What was Adam Sandler thinking? To pick a remake of a film that shouldn't have been remade. And give it an R rating. Sandler needs to stick to what he does best, which is the off-beat guy who is sort of crazy and enjoys poking fun at himself. Here he plays this ex-football player that got kicked out of the NFL for shaving points. That right there makes him the popular guy, not the off-beat guy he always plays. He gets sent to prison for DUI, so you have all the male prison jokes thrown at you. None of its new and it's not funny. This prison is in Texas, where football is king. The warden has his guards on a football team. He suggest letting them play the cons as a warm up game, plus it will be on TV since the cons have the famous quarterback.<br/><br/>Of course, the cons enjoy the opportunity to hit back at the guards. The movie turns dark for a while by having one of the main characters die in an explosion. It's like the movie can't make up its mind, is it a comedy or drama. Then the cons that this guy was close too are over it a few days because we got to get back to the laughs.<br/><br/>The football game is boring, you know the cons will rally because they'll get together and be like, we have to win the game, we'll always have that. And there's the dramatic final play of the game. And the evil warden gets his humiliation.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it. It's not funny and this is not the typical Sandler film."

"MichaelMargetis","5","2","4","28 May 2005"," 'Yard' is Better Than I Thought It Would Be
","First things first, the 2005 remake of 'The Longest Yard' is not as good as the original -- obviously. Now that's out of the way, this version of 'The Longest Yard' isn't that bad. I was expecting it to be pretty dreadful (mostly because most remakes of good movies are, and the critics really slaughtered it in their reviews). But, the 2005 updated version of 'The Longest Yard' isn't. It's actually pretty funny at times, but it isn't anything close to great. Yes, 'The Longest Yard' is what many people like to call a guilty pleasure, an entertaining and enjoyable movie with some good laughs, but nothing original or outstanding about it. Both my father and I enjoyed it, and if you like campy, silly and raunchy fun, I think you'll enjoy it too.<br/><br/>This remake actually follows the original pretty closely. It's about an ex-football quarterback, Paul Crewe (played by Adam Sander, once played by Burt Reynolds), who was banned from the NFL for shaving points in an important game. Crewe one night gets absolutely sh*t-faced drunk, and decides to take his rich girlfriend's sports car out for a night cruise. He's speeding like crazy, and is swerving all over the road. He eventually causes a major accident while being pursued by a dozen police cars, and is sentenced to three years in a crummy sleaze ball prison with redneck guards and dangerous criminals, for reckless endangerment. When Paul is asked by the warden of the prison (played by Six Feet Under's James Cromwell) to coach a football team consisting of prisoners to face the guards in a match, Paul refuses, but quickly changes his mind when the warden threatens him with 25 years in the prison instead of three. Paul puts together a football team consisting of very different inmates, with the help of his newly made friend, Caretaker (played by Chris Rock). The team is absolutely horrible, but Paul gets help coaching from a convict who was an ex-NFL coach, played by Burt Reynolds. During the course of the movie, they prep the team to not only be a challenge for the guards but beat them in the upcoming football match. The film also features William Fichtner as a cruel prison guard who is the star of the guard's football team, Cloris Leachman as the warden's elderly and horny secretary wanting to jump Adam Sandler's character's bones, Tracy Morgan as a prison drag queen, Wrestling's Goldberg and rapper Nelly as football players on the prisoners team, and Rob Schneider, in cameo, as the 'You Can Do It!' guy he seems to play in almost every Adam Sandler movie.<br/><br/>The film is usually pretty funny, but at times it seems as though it doesn't earn the laughs it expects. There is some very poorly written one-liners in the script, but besides that most of the film is witty. Adam Sandler is hysterical as Paul Crewe (taking a kind of different turn playing the role then Reynolds did in the 70s). Chris Rock is not as funny as I'd had hoped, and Burt Reynolds really needs to brush up on his acting skills (man, is he bad!). The supporting cast is pretty funny, especially SNL alumni Tracy Morgan, who steals every scene he's in. The writing is very average in quality, and directing is what's to be expected from this kind of film. Not all of the film is comedic though, there are some sentimental scenes (well they at least try to be) and one pretty sad scene in the film.<br/><br/>I was glad that this new version of 'The Longest Yard' stuck true to it's original for the most part, and didn't try to re-write key elements. Although 'Longest Yard' is enjoyable, I can't really recommend you going to see it in theaters. It's a good rental, but not really worth paying nine bucks for. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 5/27/05)"

Still, once I get beyond the point that I would not laugh I start to enjoy it in another way. I started to watch how all those WWE superstars were doing their performances. I guess they had a real good time with Paul Nash playing the gay person.<br/><br/>So after all, once the game is on I was really into this flick. For me not a comedy at all, for many it is.

","I've always held a special fondness for the 1974 version of ""The Longest Yard"" starring Burt Reynolds in the role of Paul Crewe.

However when I saw this picture during it's initial release, I was rather surprised that Sandler and the film makers pulled off a reasonable remake of the original.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways it's more than a remake, most of the picture follows the original script pretty closely with the expected updates for a modern audience. For example, the picture replaces football greats from the original like Ray Nitschke, Sonny Sixkiller and Ernie Wheelwright, with stars from the pro wrestling world like Kevin Nash (Guard Engleheart), Steve Austin (Guard Dunham) and Bill Goldberg (Con Battle). Bringing Burt Reynolds in for this picture was a well conceived homage to the original, and it was also cool to see Ed Lauter, the Captain Knauer of the earlier picture, as part of the buddy group that posed for a group shot on the golf course.<br/><br/>One definite point of distinction here that you'll note is the size of the players and the guards. Steroid use back in the Seventies wasn't nearly as rampant or publicized as today, but with the wrestlers on hand especially, virtually every prison player and guard are veritable freaks of nature. The Richard Kiel lookalike who plays Turley (Dalip Singh) is a monster, never mind guys like Switowski (Bob Sapp) and Torres (Lobo Sebastian). If you wanted to build guys like this I don't know if you'd be able to.<br/><br/>Overall, this wasn't too bad of a tribute to the 1974 picture. I still prefer the original but I'm a product of my times I guess. So if you're a football fan and would like to see the underdog stick it to the Man, this one does a pretty good job. And as an added bonus, keep your eye on that scene of Crewe in the hotbox - it's got maggots."

","The Longest Yard (2005): Dir: Peter Segal / Cast: Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell, William Fichtner: Remake of the 1974 classic about endurance in both physical and mental conditions. Adam Sandler plays former football quarterback who ends up in prison and is ordered to put together a team to play against the guards. Typical setup grows repetitious but the big payoff is the tremendous football action. Directed by Peter Segal who has worked with Sandler in two previous films, Anger Management and 50 First Dates. Sandler does well as an inmate who remembers the glory days of football and wishes to revisit it but the conclusion really never leaves a positive vibe in terms of his future happiness. Chris Rock plays Caretaker who first befriends Sandler then help him put a team together as well as sabotage the opposing team. What occurs as a result of this may be seen as too far in bad taste. Burt Reynolds plays a former football coach who is underwritten. His appearance has all to do with the fact that he starred in the original film. James Cromwell plays the stereotypical warden who barks orders and sabotages when able. William Fichtner plays an aggressive guard, which is not much of a stretch. While the football action is done well, the screenplay is nothing more than a recycled rehash remake that is the longest yard in patience. Score: 5 / 10"

","Absolutely terrible film based upon the 1974 masterpiece which perverts the story into a pointless Adam Sandler Movie debacle. In comparison to the original, this is a travesty. As a stand alone motion picture, it is an insult to cinema and to all who have made it an art form. This is simply a vanity piece by someone who expended virtually every ounce of his limited talent on SNL years ago. From the Sony hacking event and the exposed studio e-mails we learned that even the bosses and fellow performers wonder why Sandler is still making movies. He has done well in one (Punch Drunk Love, because of Emily Watson) and fair in another, The Wedding Singer (largely due to Drew Barrymore.) This horrendous stinker is simply another addition to the garbage heap where old Sandler films are discarded after raking in money from a mindless movie going public. All his violations of cinema could be forgiven, however, if this man would keep his hands off classic films and not attempt to further corrupt the legacy of great motion pictures left us by the true artistic masters."

","I watched the original Mean Machine before I saw this, and I think the screenplay did quite a great job in recreating the game in the different game environment. The story rolls out very predictably as it goes out as almost an exact copy of the original. At first the only thing kept me watching was the curiosity of who's going to play what character. But as the movie progresses, it's nice to see some variations here and there beside the whole game being changed from the football that the rest of the world know to the football Americans know. It's great that this movie has more humor compared to the original Mean Machine. I like how the movie twists the death of one of the characters into something more touching compared to the original. Also the last scene where Crewe is aimed at is a very nice touch that set this movie apart nicely from the original. It's nice to see many faces, especially those hard faces of action actors, making the merrier out of this movie. And it's great that the can handle jokes too. Sandler performed nice here, although it's quite strange to see that he can take on those violence and not get injured."

","Remakes are a tough thing to do. They have standards to live up to mostly in comparison to the original version. It's no different with this remake. It doesn't hold up. The story is kind of the same but it doesn't have the same flair as the original. I think the biggest flaw is Adam Sandler. He plays Paul Crew which was originally played by acting legend Burt Reynolds. The difference is BR had a lot of wit in the original where Sandler is dry and somewhat forgettable in this. The movie has funny moments but it just fizzles out and the game between the inmates and guards seems long and tries to be too much like the original with the split screens and some of the antics. Basically the movie doesn't take a life of its own which is it's down fall. It's not a horrible movie and worth a watch,"
"vchimpanzee","Null","0","0","5 August 2013"," Worthy remake but not quite up to standards of the original
","The movie begins with multiple images of a hot girl in a bikini. This is during a party at the San Diego home of Lena, girlfriend to former star football quarterback Paul Crewe. Lena's dress appears likely to have a Janet Jackson moment. Paul and Lena get in an argument and Paul takes her fancy car, driving around town in such a way that he attracts the attention of the cops. By the time the brief but exciting chase is over, Paul has violated his probation for point-shaving, which gets him sent to a prison in the middle of the Texas desert.<br/><br/>Warden Hazen wants a successful prison league football team and believes Paul can make that happen. Guard Knauer threatens Paul if he does what the warden wants. After some time in the hot box, Paul goes along with the warden anyway.<br/><br/>Paul doesn't have much luck, even with the help of sidekick Caretaker. Success comes only when longtime inmate and former football star Nate becomes the coach, and when the inmates realize playing football means playing against (and beating up on) the guards. And even then, the team isn't that good.<br/><br/>But can they succeed?<br/><br/>I saw the original where Burt Reynolds was the star. He was better there though quite good here, and the original was the superior movie, but this one is pretty good too. <br/><br/>Adam Sandler is satisfactory. His best moments are when he insults a cop who resembles Armin Shimerman (though that actor is not in the credits) whose appearance invites ridicule, and during half-time in the game. <br/><br/>Chris Rock gives his usual performance, which like pretty much everything he does just has to include ranting about blacks being mistreated and everything being about race. That's part of his appeal, at least to me.<br/><br/>Cloris Leachman stands out as Lynette, the secretary to the warden. Most of her scenes are ... not exactly family viewing.<br/><br/>This is a men's prison, but there are ""women"" other than Lynette. They are the cheerleaders. The standout of that group is played by Tracy Morgan, flamboyantly gay and hilarious. Yes, they're actually men.<br/><br/>James Cromwell is good enough, though Eddie Albert somehow seemed so much more cruel in the original. Maybe it was because I was used to the actor being such a nice guy (and even when he was mean to Haney and the Monroes, it was nothing like this). <br/><br/>I think I'm correct that Bob Sapp is the big teddy bear who cries. He's really funny.<br/><br/>Chris Rock is reunited with his TV dad, sort of (I can't recall whether they hared any scenes). Although he didn't do much other than hand out food from McDonald's, it was interesting to see Crews as a genuine tough guy after two hours of watching him be a clueless dad on his latest series.<br/><br/>Steve Reevis must have been the funny sports commentator. His partner kept expecting him to say something, and yet he mostly just sat there looking dignified. If he said something, it needed to be said.<br/><br/>This movie definitely scores a touchdown. It's the original that goes for two and succeeds."

","This film is just about as average of a comedy as you can get, I say this but I still really enjoyed it as a film, but I was still left a lot of the time spent wandering why the inmates were getting away with so much. As much as it is a good comedy, the fundamentals of realism is what really stops this film from showing more strife in the characters and therefore being a better player.<br/><br/>Some of the main annoyances were small things such as Captain Knauer saying that he ran the place at the very beginning but we didn't really see him for much of the rest of the film, instead all the spotlight was on showing small little actions that forced the inmates to was to fight the guards so much, which was kind of irritating to watch as mainly they were small little actions.<br/><br/>The other main thing I hate about this film is Caretakers death, firstly he doesn't really take of anything much until after his death, and secondly why did they have to kill him off as the team were a little sad when for some odd reason they buried him on the same day of his death without his beloved family being present, and then the team was over it by the next day, making his death fairly irrelevant, which was a shame as he was the lovable sidekick for much of the film.<br/><br/>However I did love the idea of the team coming together to defy the odds but it did have a real sense of chance and the storyline itself is highly unbelievable, however you have to expect this when you see this movie due to its nature. For once I though Adam Sandler was actually kind of the right person for the job as he was laid back and this made sense due to his history but still I felt he could have acted a little more and so he could have had a bit more of a transformation by the end.<br/><br/>All in all I liked this film as a light hearted comedy, but if you do watch it just look out for the trillions of little irritating errors in this film that by the end make it kind of irritating."
"elshikh4","Null","0","0","31 December 2009"," The Disease That Will Eat Up Hollywood !
","I don't hate this movie. I just can't love it!<br/><br/>What's my problem with it? It's simple. It's the same disease that I encounter many times lately in numerous Hollywood movies. And to know a disease, you must define first its symptoms.<br/><br/>It's a remake, so why to lose time searching for new ideas?! And more than this, I've seen it 3 times before already: 2 times from America (The Longest Yard - 1974), (Stir Crazy - 1980). And one more time from England (Mean Machine - 2001).<br/><br/>I waited this time for different and witty material, but there was no respectable effort done; maybe the idea of the rubbery bomb to cool off the prisoners. Some dialogues have been re-used, exactly as they were, again and again from the first movie. The characters weren't real humans to be involved with, or droll cartoon to be interested in. So, generally, I didn't run into something smart or moving, special or memorable.<br/><br/>The first half is the best where the odd characters of the prisoners are shown with a certain characteristic for each one, and a variant reason to hate a certain guard. The second half, the match, got noting solid or more comic. And the end's thrilling scene was forced and idiot.<br/><br/>The main problem though is that when the movie wanted to make comedy, it depended wholly on: penis jokes, feces jokes, butt jokes, sodomy jokes, and naked old woman; no, not jokes, but literally naked old woman; which was the most pathetic and disgusting try to make comedy, before being the most pathetic and disgusting moment here (I was about to puke!). And you know what the worst of all of that is? IT'S SO EASY!<br/><br/>Add to this, Burt Reynolds died since nearly 10 years before this movie was made. I don't know how did they wake up his ghost like this?! Chris Rock is just UNFUNNY, NOT FUNNY, or NONE-FUNNY. Ok, I want to write it by all the known languages on earth! Adam Sandler is in somehow strange land, I thought that they should have hired Bruce Willis instead, otherwise I didn't see clearly why to bring a comic star to undertake un-comic mission, with big physical job as well!<br/><br/>I bet you have guessed by now that the disease that hit this movie, and will eat up Hollywood, is called the easy writing. And if you haven't, re-read the aforementioned, starting with ""It's a remake""! Simply with this story, there are endless enjoyable treatments (comical, satirical, musical,.. etc). This is the dumb, little sick, and predictable one. But originally it's another commodity that has to be in market, in time, anyway. Thus it's justified as a natural flaw of swollen industry that wants money, money, money and more money with, or without, making any entertainment along the way. So, it's rapidly written, rapidly shown, and rapidly forgotten too!<br/><br/>I liked: Only some moments for that director. The fact that this movie didn't get to use one fart joke (Strange! It's in the manual?!). And, make no mistake, the chance finally to see Chris Rock getting killed in a movie. I'm not that violent to have fun out of that in itself, but it should be fun whenever Rock's violent presence and comedy wouldn't continue till the end of a movie!"

Basically Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe (Adam Sandler, also producing) was once a very popular football superstar, but he has gone down hill, and ends up being imprisoned for drink driving. Not long after settling in, and making a friend with the prisoner known as the Caretaker (Chris Rock), duplicitous prison official Warden Hazen (Babe's James Cromwell), well aware of Crewe's athletic skills, tells him to prepare a team of players for a football game, prisoners vs. guards. As well as Caretaker, Crewe gets help from legendary Coach Nate Scarborough (Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds), and Crewe is promising a very interesting game, even if training is starting off rough, they do improve, don't worry. So training is complete, and it comes to the big game, and even without Caretaker, who suddenly dies, they are a strong team, and even with Crewe facing the possibility of going back to jail, he is not going to let the guards beat his team.

","When I walked into my local Blockbuster one fateful September evening, realizing that the remake of the 1974 film ""The Longest Yard"" was the only movie I had any inclination to rent, I felt a small part of my dignity die. I had never seen the original, so I had no idea what to expect, but something didn't feel right as I was walking out of the store, getting into my car, and making my way home to watch the movie. Adam Sandler films have never been considered Oscar-worthy, but his earlier titles, such as ""Billy Madison,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" and ""The Waterboy,"" were at least slightly humorous diversions I could enjoy during otherwise mundane afternoons. ""The Longest Yard,"" the 2005 remake of the aforementioned Burt Reynolds vehicle, let me down in ways I should have predicted beforehand. Speaking of predictions, I can't say I was completely oblivious to what I was going to see in this movie. Of course, it would be full of juvenile humor, a few too many unrealistic crunches and splatters during the football scenes, and, of course, the obligatory Rob Schneider, ""You can do it!"". What I didn't expect was the general sense of boredom conveyed in the role of Sandler himself, playing former NFL quarterback Paul Crewe, or the disappointment that came along with Reynolds himself, phoning in another role in his already dying career. Even judging the film as what it is trying to be, a tasteless two-hour romp through scene after scene of stereotypical, clichéd prison humor and a glorification of football violence, I still found it difficult to love; sort of an ugly stepchild among Sandler's more prominent, entertaining movies.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a drunken Sandler being nagged on by his wife, played by the well-known Courtney Cox-Arquette (Scream, Scream 2) in a small, uncredited role, who wants him to wear a ridiculous sailor outfit for a costume party she and her husband are hosting. Sandler, who plays a forgotten quarterback whose football legacy has been forever tarnished by gambling accusations, instead steals his wife's Bentley, gets into a police chase, and ends up totaling the car. The most emotion I felt during this movie was when several police cars slammed into the Bentley from all sides, as I was hoping they hadn't destroyed a real Bentley for such a waste of a film. I have to say this scene soured my attitude towards the rest of the movie. Anyway, as punishment, Sandler is sent to a maximum-security prison in Texas, full of the huge, dumb yet lovable inmates and cruel, so-easy-to-hate guards we've all grown accustomed to in pretty much every prison film ever made. And I can't forget to mention the greedy, corrupt warden (Shawshank Redemption, anyone?), who forces Sandler to organize a football team comprised of inmates to test the warden's team of guards before their big game against a rival penitentiary. One thing to commend this film for is the grayness it gives to both the heroes and villains, as no character is completely good or evil, but always somewhere in between. Playing the comic relief is comedian Chris Rock (Doctor Dolittle, Dogma), who brings a few laughs to the table, mostly dealing with what-else but racial issues. Reynolds (Bean, Boogie Nights) plays Sandler's mentor behind the bars of the prison, in a forgettable role he seems to be sleepwalking through. Former WWF wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin plays a sadistic prison guard, while former WCW wrestler Bill Goldberg plays one of Sandler's fellow inmates, whose physical ""gifts"" are used as the butt of far too many cheap jokes. I found it hard not to root for them to get into a ring and duke it out, as it wouldn't make the film lose any credibility, while still managing to add some real action to another generic sports movie. Of course, the climax of the film is the showdown between the inmates and guards, which I won't spoil the outcome of, but by that point most viewers simply won't care anymore and be counting down the minutes on the scoreboard until the game is over.<br/><br/>Director Peter Segal (Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps, Anger Management) gives the film a sleek, polished look, full of quick-cuts and plenty of close-ups, especially during the football scenes. The dialogue, while not worthy of the Tarantino-Seal Of Approval, isn't terrible by any means. And the humor, which many viewers might find quite offensive, and most sober viewers will not find very funny, maintains a level of consistency from beginning to end, offering a hearty chuckle or two. But as a whole, the film just doesn't work. It lacks any sense of desperation or the kind of foreboding atmosphere any quality prison movie should offer. When you have ESPN announcer Chris Berman doing the play-by-play for the final game, you're pretty much taking any kind of realistic feel out of the movie altogether. What is this, the Entertainment and Sports Prison Network?<br/><br/>Since I've never seen the original, I can't make a fair connection between the two. What I can predict, however, is that this film will be soon forgotten while the original will continue to enjoy its reputation as one of the better prison/football movies ever made. This movie steals elements from far better football films, such as ""Any Given Sunday"" which may cause viewers to cringe once the bone-crunching, hard-hitting mayhem begins. In the former film, however, it was used as a way to garner emotion from those witnessing it, while in this it succeeds at being nothing more than a gross-out effect. And the obvious homage to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" will make some think to themselves, ""Have I been here before?"" Overall, however, this film succeeds at what it is trying to be: a foul-mouthed, somewhat entertaining (at least I was able to sit though all of it) effortless comedy, and with that, it earns 4 bananas out of 10 bananas."

The remake, however, is both stupid and funny in some areas. I'd even say that it is funnier than the original, but some parts of it bring the film down. Sandler is OK in his role with some funny moments, but Chris Rock's enthusiasm is what really keeps the film from being average. Burt Reynolds does a surprisingly good job and doesn't make a fool out of himself like he did with ""The Dukes of Hazzard"". The rest of the cast either isn't very good or wasted in their roles. Overall, the film is worth seeing mostly for Chris Rock's hysterical performance and the final 30 or so minute football scene is very nicely redone.

"axopnk","5","0","0","15 January 2006"," Pretty good in some parts
","I don't know if its just me, but Adam Sander movies are getting pretty redundant. His comedy, along with the whole teen phase thing just isn't selling right now (compared to Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Ben stiller comedies).On the bright side, Adam isn't the only one. Jim Carey is getting pretty dry himself. Anyway, this movie is a solid 5 because there were definitely some funny parts in the movie, but not everywhere. The movie starts off pretty good, with Courtney cox and Adam getting in a fight (by the way, David arquette is a lucky guy). From there the movie picks up into prison which is funny on some parts but not everywhere due to some of the issues prison inmates face, as well as other issues. I have to admit, i wasn't laughing when Adam was physically assaulted in prison. But it still was funny with the secretary and the try outs of the inmates. Toward the middle of the movie the comedy was still fresh, but than it started dealing with issues like racism which i have to admit is pretty extreme for Steve Austin to even do. The actors were cool though because of the wrestling stars and NFL icons used in the movie. Hunger's character was weird, he didn't have any motivation to do what he did to his fellow inmates but yet you still hate the guy for what he did. But what does he get out of it? His character didn't really have any advantage by telling the warden or guards any info. You would think the warden would cut him a deal like he does with Adam Sander. The low point of the movie though is when caretaker died. I was expecting something like just throwing rats inside the cell or something funny or stupid, but a bomb? that right there is too extreme for a comedy. When caretaker died, it felt like you shouldn't be laughing anymore from that point on. You wanted Adam to take legal action or something else besides just play football and beat the warden. Even when the classic rock and roll music hit at his grave side you didn't feel like ""yeah we should kick the wardens ass"". You felt more like mourning for the guy besides just thinking about football. I know adam tried to give a inspirtaional speech but hey, if a buddy just died, you probably wouldn't start cheering when they give you your uniform. The problem with this is the movie went from a comedy to a drama in 5 minutes. Don't get me wrong, it was still a comedy after his death but it just didn't feel like it, or you just didn't want to really laugh at all. People are probably asking ""well it's a comedy, so don't go to hard on the story line"" but hey, don't throw in any drama in the movie. If you look at wedding crashers for example, the friends got in a fight, which happens in life and it can be repaired. But owen and vince didn't DIE. Death is something that can make comedy go from funny to serious in no time (Good example is chazz in wedding crashers at the funerals, it was written so that it wouldn't be funny at all, and you get that feel with owen looking at chazz and wondering what he just done). The football game itself was standard feel good story of the year type. Rob Schneide made his cameo to get the crowd rolling again (lucky he was in there too), but it didn't sum up the movie or leave you with heart warming satisfaction that everything would be OK from that point on. Of course there in a prison, but come on, this is a comedy not a drama. The part with the warden wanting to shoot Adam was once again like a drama and you felt like Burt Reynolds was going to jump in front of the bullet in slow motion saying no. It just ended off strange. so the cons beat the guards but so what? Adam is pretty much done for the rest of his life (didn't resolve that issue) nor did it resolve the issue with the guards (you know there's a price to be had). Overall the movie was a solid 5 on the comedy, but it was just hard to laugh on concepts like racism, abuse, death etc. Sure it was set in a prison, but too many issues presented in the movie."

","I have to start off this review by saying that I have never seen the 1974 original with Burt Reynolds, who also shows up in the update as the inmates coach, so I can't compare the two movies. This could be a good thing because most reviews I read always stated how much the first one was better. Granted I can still compare this version to the other Adam Sandler football movie, The Waterboy. It's odd that no one complained about Sandler playing a linebacker in that movie yet everyone jumped on him for trying to be a quarterback. And he was a washed up one to boot so I really didn't have a problem with it.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is about the washed up QB in prison but how he gets there is great with cameos by Courtney Cox's newly enormous breasts and Dan Patrick, who apparently didn't get the memo that the movie would be set in present day as he instead chose to go with the 70's gay porn mustache with a dash of the Village People. But from there Sandler is shipped off to a Texan prison where the warden pulled some strings in hope that he would help out with the prison guard's football team. And what would be better practice for the guards than a little warm up game against a team of inmates.<br/><br/>Even though most of the inmates and guards are played by former football player, pro wrestlers and other non-actors, most of the characters are so well written, it makes up for any lack of acting experience. Ultimate Fighter Bob Sapp is great as the mentally slow Switowski, Michael Irvin in a role before he started holding onto his buddies narcotics plays a con who still doesn't trust Sandler after selling out his teammates in the NFL, and the giant Dalip Singh English was so bad they had to subtitle everything. As for the guards, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Brian Bosworth, who was always a better actor than football player, but that isn't saying much, and Bill Romanowski all play their tough guys well but I bet Romo was mad that Stone Cold got to utter the racial slurs and not him. But the standout of the guard is Kevin Nash who even though goes into every cliché conceived is hilarious after the inmates replaced his steroids with estrogen.<br/><br/>But not all the characters are well flashed out. It's hard to relate to Nelly talking how poor his character is when he has a couple gold teeth and Goldberg one running gag that his, um, chariot swings low, so to speak, gets old before it starts. The cast is filled out with more traditional actors with Chris Rock channeling Morgan Freeman as Caretaker, Terry Crews, who has gone on to play Rock's dad on Everybody Hates Chris, is hilarious as the cheeseburger dude, as is Nicolas Turturro as the early recruit who is quickly benched as more black inmates show up."

","Paul Crewe(Adam Sandler) gets arrested after causing chaos with cops one night while extremely intoxicated. He is transfered to prison in which the warden has a prestigious football team made of guards so he can lead a team of inmates because the warden feels that his guards need a little practice/attention. Paul puts a team together with help of the caretaker(Chris Rock), coach(Burt Reynolds) and amazing running back(Nelly) for a chance to finally get back at the guards.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that as well-liked as Adam Sandler may be, he was a horrible choice for this film. I'm not saying that Burt Reynolds was a great choice for the original, but at least he was better than Adam Sandler. It was extremely hard to get over the idea of Adam Sandler being a professional football player, even if he was the quarterback. He was ineffective in every way and Paul Crewe is by far, his least funniest role he has ever played.<br/><br/>Besides making fun of the rest of the cast I will go on by saying that the movie was very unrealistic(I'm mainly taking of the football games), unenlightening, and just plain dull. It lacked the certain spark that every great comedy has and a certain dramatic effect that every sports movie has, making it more useless teenage garbage. Although the movie had its fair share of laughs, it was still unoriginal and boring in every other aspect. Overall, the movie was everything I predicted it would be: Useless crap.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie."

","I really can't stand Adam Sandler. I don't quite know what it is, but every time someone pops one of his movies in the DVD player, I feel the overwhelming urge to leave the room. Go watch something else. Change the oil in my car. Do dishes. Anything but sit there and watch it.<br/><br/>I could actually sit through this one, which is saying something.<br/><br/>He spent more of his time playing a dramatic character than a comic one, and this movie demonstrates that he has the chops for it. I was very surprised.<br/><br/>The ""recruiting"" scene where he's playing one-on-one basketball stands out, in particular. I mean, you KNOW he's hurting; you feel sympathetic pain for what he's going through. You're wondering just what the hell he's proving. Then, at the end of the scene, you understand. Here's a character which has some depth, which actually thinks longer-term than most Adam Sandler characters.<br/><br/>I like that.<br/><br/>During the final showdown, you hate his guts, then you feel for him, then you cheer for him. I realize it's the formulaic good-vs-evil showdown, but I don't care. I care what happens to the character.<br/><br/>That's the difference between a good movie and a weak one; you give a damn what happens to the characters.<br/><br/>Chris Rock is his usual funny self. Burt Reynolds play an understated, but solid role. You can say that when it's hard to pick out any one scene where they really stood out, but at the same time, you can't quite figure out how the movie could've done without them. He just lent a little more depth and foundation to so many scenes.<br/><br/>I never would have gone to see this in the theater, simply because it had Adam Sandler in the lead role. After seeing this one, though, that could change."

","Art-house snob or Bruckheimer bandwagoneer, you see a movie like this and know you are just being facetious to make cracks about how it won't be as good as the original. I'm not the biggest Adam Sandler fan and some of his movies I just outright loathe. Somehow I end up buying and watching most of them again and again. (Eight Crazy Nights and 50 First Dates notwithstanding, even then, I can't help but think of Sean Astin's antics in that movie.) Check the director and the lead role credits and your expectations for a shot-for-shot remake should be in the toilet, but who really wants that anyway? This movie is fun. Burt Reynolds adds to the cool cred and I get the impression that he had a lot of fun making it, rather than just seeing a quick way to collect a check.<br/><br/>An admirable job was done; shoving a crowbar between The Waterboy and The Longest Yard, though there are a few funny references to the former. It was a gamble to take a somewhat redundant stab at Sandler's somewhat niche (but according to his box office reciepts, not that niche) market, but it plays out well and the humor is different now that Adam Sandler is the cool guy on the team rather than the team dork."
"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","0","0","9 October 2005"," Adam Sandler Goes to Fantasy Camp
","The original Longest Yard had grit and style; the new Longest Yard has fake grit and non-style, and reeks of Vanity Project. The movie often seems little more than an excuse for Adam Sandler to hang out with athletes, to live out some kind of jock daydream in the company of real ex-football players like Michael Irvin, Bill Romanowski and Brian Bosworth. Athletes play at being actors, while actors (and rapper Nelly) play at being athletes - it's not a movie but some kind of two-way fantasy camp.<br/><br/>Sandler plays disgraced point-shaving ex-quarterback Paul Crewe, whose post-athletic life involves leeching off his well-to-do girlfriend (a plump Courtney Cox), drinking beer and watching TV. In a fit of drunkenness Crewe steals his girlfriend's car, then becomes involved in a televised police chase; his antics land him in a penitentiary in Texas where the guards have a semi-pro football team, and the warden is serious about re-claiming the championship. It's someone's bright idea that the prisoners should put together a team to play the guards as a tune-up; Crewe is put in charge of this endeavor, and sets about recruiting various thugs, psychos and hard-cases and trying to mold them into a team. Naturally this is all a character-building experience for Crewe, who has faced some maturity issues in the past. It also provides an opportunity for a lot of lame prison humor, jokes about homosexuality, penis-size and other things that are apparently hilarious.<br/><br/>Sandler tries something different here; he sets aside his usual sweet-hearted-class-clown persona and goes for something edgier, something less ingratiating. In the past Sandler wore immaturity as a badge - it was the thing that connected him to his audience, which is made up mostly of teenage boys and people who want to still be teenage boys even though they are in their thirties and losing their hair. Now Sandler seems less-willing to just play the fool; he's decided to grow up a little bit as a film star, and play a character for whom immaturity is not a point of goofy pride but an obstacle. The Longest Yard represents Sandler's departure-point moreso than Punch-Drunk Love, which was a small movie and therefore not really representative of the star's work. Sandler the actor may have grown-up in Punch-Drunk Love, but Sandler the movie-star hasn't tried until this film, which is too tottery and formulaic to work as much of a vehicle for his new, semi-serious concept of himself. Sandler may be trying to grow up, but the movie is still silly and backward.<br/><br/>The film is tailored to sports freaks, the kind of people who chant ""De-fense"" in front of their TV, think Tom Arnold is hysterical on The Best Damn Sports Show Period and dream of jumping in a hot-tub with the twins from the beer commercial (""I love/being a degenerate slob/ having the IQ of a doorknob/and twins!""). Sandler may be trying to depart from his old arrested-adolescent ways, but someone forgot to inform the writers and director, who go all out in providing Sandler's yahoo audience the kind of rowdy energy that seems to stir it up (lots of AC/DC on the soundtrack in other words). I'm not saying this kind of stuff can't be amusing - I like Caddyshack as much as the next person - but for it to work you at least need some halfway decent material, not a dried-up old '70s formula tricked out with modern references, testosterone-worship and a healthy dose of black-people-are-cooler-than-white-people cliché. Ooh look it's Dan Patrick only goes so far; at some point you need a joke that's actually funny, a comic rhythm instead of a string of weakly assembled gags. The surprising thing about The Longest Yard is how unfunny it is; outside of a couple of Chris Rock's ad-libs, there isn't much here that rises above the level of a mid-season replacement sitcom. It's fine if Adam Sandler wants to indulge some fantasy of hanging out with jocks and ESPN announcers, fine if he wants to up-grade his screen persona by playing a guy who actually appreciates the value of not acting like a jerk all the time, but in the process he might consider getting hold of writers who can come up with stuff that at least out-paces Porky's 2."

","As a fan of the original, I wasn't expecting anything close to it, but this version really is pretty lame. I blame poor casting for much of the films problems and the weak writing doesn't help either. Adam Sandler brings nothing to the old Burt Reynold's role of Paul Crewe, an NFL quarterback chastised for point shaving in a game. he gets thrown into the pokey for basically acting like a big dope. There is no reason for him to go to jail except for absolutely wanting to spend some time with some very rough boys.<br/><br/>Chris Rock is wasted in his role as ""Caretaker"". He is given nothing to do. Even Burt Reynolds shows up as the coach. He is fun, as is trying to pick out all the ex-NFL stars in the cast including Bob Sapp, Michael Ervin, and Brian Bosworth. The original film also had some former players in the cast.<br/><br/>The warden played by James Cromwell is football obsessed and arranges a scrimmage game between his guards and the cons. His guards are a champion team and he does whatever it takes to keep it that way.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler can be an engaging comedic actor, but he basically plays an angry unfunny puss. He isn't funny and neither is Rock. The casting is all stunted and the writing doesn't warrant the payroll. (**)"

And all the other actors were great in their roles could not really fault them.<br/><br/>As for the game, it wasn't anything special I've seen better matches but it still kept you watching the screen hoping for the prisoners to win and of course the back stabbing twist wasn't exactly a huge surprise or the fact that his team wouldn't play when he came back overall though a good film one thing this film is EXACTLY the same as Mean Machine, i think the one difference i saw was that in mean machine the old guy died and not the assistant manager apart from that everything from the way they looked up the guards weaknesses to the warden forcing Sandler to stop playing its all the same except its American and not English sport"

We get some updated dialog to make it entertaining (mainly Rock's quips), but I wish they had tried something a little different with it rather than taken the lazy way out.<br/><br/>In the end though, a good rental for the football fans out there.

"RobinCook70","2","0","0","22 September 2005"," Punt Hut Hut Hut
","Just how many movies having prison guards and prisoners battle it out with some sport like football will Mollywood continue to generate? Sandler had a few good spots in this movie, but not enough for me to stop waiting for it to end. At least we were spared having the hackneyed scenes of the guards giving nonstop brutal beatings to Sandler, but is that the only highlight? Even though I'm not a big fan of Chris Rock, he did more for this movie than Sandler. I think Anthony Hopkins helped Rock with his acting since I have observed definite improvement and have begun to like him more as an actor. I suspect that this movie was used by Sandler to begin a bridge into more serious non-comedian roles, which may be his goal at the cost of viewers' expectations.<br/><br/>I suspect this movie appealed more to the male population or sports fans (or kids with little on the ball). For me this was a punt into a dreary hut that I was praying would get torched. Once again, Sandler needs to come about with being more selective in his roles and move away from these associative sportsy types of flicks that had given him his initial big movie fame. Happy Gilmore was great and very funny, but football is a sport that I am hard pressed to locate a comedy mentality. Comedy attempts in this movie was rather forced.<br/><br/>Summarily, if you like Sandler, Rock, prisons, prison posturing, a hackneyed script, and football you'll like this movie. If not, and you still watch this movie at least try not to have any general to medium expectations."

","I watched this last night on a whim that it might be entertaining. ""Blah"" would be the correct term for this movie. If it had come out five or six years ago, it would have been a bigger hit. I love Adam Sandler but this was not his movie. He is usually THE scene stealer in his movies, but like Mr. Deeds, it was the rest of the cast that made the movie semi-interesting. Chris Rock owned this even after his character died. The football team was hilariously put together, my favorite having been the big guy who liked ping pong (classic). Adam Sandler is not a convincing drunk. Well, he might be convincing, but only for an after school special. Courtney Cox... well... let's just say she has definitely.... improved? (boobies are fun). Nelly was pretty good in the role as the star running back and Burt Reynolds lived up to my expectations of awesomeness. William Fichtner needs to stop playing the asshole who is a total jerk and then is a nice guy at the end for no reason. The real person who stole the show was Tracy Morgan. He just rocks my socks.<br/><br/>So to sum up...<br/><br/>1) Adam Sandler fans may not be pleased 2) Watch this if you don't like Chris Rock 3) Don't expect the greatest comedic writing but watch it for the game and Chris Rock 4) Rent it, don't buy it, unless you are Chris Rock"

","After 15 minutes I already noticed that this movie its concept is almost he same as the soccer variant with Vinnie Jones, called Mean Machine (which also is the name of the football team adam sandler is leading against the guards later on in the movie) The original of the Longest Yard was probably the first in it's genre, but if you want to compare this movie, do it with the modern variant: Mean Machine. The story is almost the same, A famous sportsman get's in jail for bribing, faking the football games. He get's molested by the headguard, the warden wants him to coach the soccer/football team, there are inmates who ""can get you anything you need"" .. and this is everything that happens within 15 minutes and it's almost identical as in Mean Machine. The only difference is that this movie is less British, and more in an American Style. I enjoyed this movie more then mean machine because it has funnier and better casted characters in it, especially the inmates are enjoyable. The rest of the story is to be guessed, Sandler starts a team of inmates to take it up against the Guards team. It only took me 17 minutes of the movie to figure this all out. It isn't a movie to criticise, because it is a COMEDY which is made to make you laugh and entertain you during the movie. Which it quite succeeds in. its just damn hilarious, even Rob Schneider has 2 sentences in it like he always has a small role in Sandlers movies. Go see it ;)"

Especially the changing of ""I think I broke"" The quote they changed it too was lame. Casting was the biggest downer. I didn't think either movie's Caretaker fit. Chris Rock to be honest would seem more like one of the cheerleaders than a Caretaker. Adam Sandler doesn't have the toughness Burt Reynolds brought to the role. The Warden was as badly cast in both movies as Caretaker. No edge to them, too comical a figure when they are all of the drama in the movie. Switowski was perfectly cast in the first movie. His role diminished and really badly cast this time round. In short I think they took what could have been a really excellent movie and did minimum effort to get it out the door. No magic, no chemistry like the original. Little added and lots taken away from the original. Why did they bother?"

I did not go to see the movie for the story (it a remake for goodness sakes) but I did go for some laughs. The movie was not afraid to make racism seem funny (silly)...sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying (or worse). While the audience in the theater gasped at some of the racial jokes I was usually smiling or laughing. <br/><br/>Although this was made by Hollywood I felt that it nearly represented some of the tensions that exist within the prison walls, between inmates and inmates, inmates and guards, based on race and power...but it was not that deep and did not dwell too long on these issues. There was plenty of homo erotic jokes, as well, and this was expected.<br/><br/>I thought Nelly played a surprisingly layered character for the brief time he is on screen. I was really feeling the scene in the library with him, the guards and some of the inmates/peers. I don't even like Nelly's music but I liked him in this film. <br/><br/>Also, there are some cool action shots and the football sequences are surprisingly realistic. When one of the characters gets killed (no real spoilers here) about half way through, the movie actually stumbles down the stretch without him.<br/><br/>Overall, I think The Longest Yard is one of the better Sandler movies.

"lawnboy1977","6","0","0","6 June 2005"," Tough to do a remake
","This has certainly become a trend in Hollywood lately, remaking classic films with plot revisions and new actors. Occasionally it works, but for the most part, remakes need to be avoided at all costs, this is my opinion with ""The Longest Yard"".<br/><br/>The original film is considered one of the greatest sports movies of all time. Paul Crewe takes a rag-tag bunch of convicts up against a well oiled machine of a football team, and on shear determination and the fact that this is their only chance at glory in their prison lives, beats the guards. Classic of course, timeless story, so why not remake it with a more comedic twist and more action packed football scenes including pro-wrestlers and ex-pro football players? The filmmakers got the football scenes right, but not much else.<br/><br/>The great thing about the first movie, was that you really felt for the prisoners who were seemingly up against insurmountable odds, not only on the football field, but in life. I never really felt that was established in this movie, which moves way too fast to establish anything.<br/><br/>Quite a few scenes were changed, sped up, or completely removed from that were in the original version that took away fro the story in this movie. In this one, Crewe becomes too well liked too quickly, while in the first one, he goes through a long period of earning himself in prison. It never really established Crewe's downfall from pro-football and how much of an impact his point shaving scheme had on his life and those around him.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 6 only because the action was up to par and the football scenes were better than the original, which they should have been considering they had a bigger budget and bigger effects.<br/><br/>the worst part of this movie is Sandler and Chris Rock. You would think that these two comedic all-stars would be able to write much funnier lines for themselves, but they don't. I have actually been very disappointed by all Chris Rock films, he's a great stand up, but horrible actor.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great football movie, rent the original ""Longest Yard""."

","I knew I was in trouble when I saw that MTV helped produce this film during the opening credits. In normal MTV fashion, it took Sandler's film and tried to make it into a giant music video. If you think I'm kidding, just watch the credits and you will realize that there are over 30 random songs played throughout the film. Further, the multiple screens during the football game and the overabundance of super slow motion during football practice add to the overall music video effect. This takes away from the story and, more importantly, takes away from the Adam Sandler humor we all know and love (or at least the humor that people who go to see this movie love). Though this movie was not up to par with the comedic zaniness of Sandler's past movies, it would have been much better without MTV's influence. It bothers me that the music video industry is having such an impact on cinema (even if it is only clearly visible in summer teenager comedies). This being said, ""The Longest Yard"" (2005) was funny and worth seeing if you're looking for easy laughs and an adrenaline rush. Sandler and Rock make a good duo, and Burt Reynolds (who played Sandler's character in the original) is an inspiring coach. I just wish MTV didn't get its talons into this film."

Etc.<br/><br/>Well let's start with the last part, Adam Sandler just sucks in the lead, Sandler himself is pretty hard to put up with so why put him in the lead? <br/><br/>Other failures. The fact of the matter is that is a typical Sandler vehicle, his worse one yet , but if you have seen his other movies they're almost the same He makes an ass of himself gets away with it, then the movie ends. ""Punch Drunk Love"" was the exception.<br/><br/>The plot is that Paul Crewe (Sandler) wrecks his car into another police car while the fact that his car was reported stolen by his girlfriend played in a small role by Courtney Cox. Then he gets of to prison which results in the usual prison offensive jokes we've seen a million times that gets old:<br/><br/>""Someone will make you his bitch""-Caretaker (Chris Rock).<br/><br/>How enlightening, lol Tell us something we don't know. Eventually the Warden of the prison played a weak and flat James Cromwell who has an easy role recruits Paul to play against the guards in a football game.<br/><br/>As someone else stated Sandler is totally unrealistic as a former football player, much less a quarterback. Didn't we actually see Sandler play a football/loser type of role already? Why yes we did it was called The WATERBOY!!! <br/><br/>Why Peter Segal elected to choose Sandler is anyone's guess. I guess he figured Sandler could carry this movie, he was wrong. I guess he figured Sandler could be funny enough in this movie to warrant a full viewing. He was wrong again. I guess he figured that fans would forget the great original that inspired the remake and wouldn't notice the fact that this movie is a pale and cheap imitation of it, he was wrong a third time.<br/><br/>I did get a couple of good chuckles though (one or three at the least) when Paul recruits this huge inmate playing Ping Pong is actually well executed. However that's one of a few good laughs I did get.<br/><br/>Unlikable characters, prison stereotypes and familiar jokes, a dimwitted weak actor/comedian in the lead is all that told me this movie was a familiar. Ebert and Roper were right on this one panning the movie.<br/><br/>The original was funny but it was also raw, gritty, suspenseful and the keyword....it was original.<br/><br/>Thus a remake was unwarranted and unneeded. I second then all the other critics and fans who say Hollywood should stop remaking these classics and leave well enough alone.<br/><br/>They're not fooling anybody and in the process our respect for any filmmaker who participates in a remake is lost. Peter Segal has made some good funny movies: The Naked Gun the Final Insult, Anger Managment and Fifty First Dates were entertaining but this movie is not.<br/><br/>It's just a predictable ride, boring and lame that doesn't deserve a second turn.<br/><br/>But then again Segal as most Hollywood directors , probably could not deny the huge money he was offered to do it as well as the unfunny and uninspiring Adam Sandler."

","In this movie remake, a former NFL MVP pro quarterback Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is sent to prison. The warden (James Cromwell) wants Paul to help coach his semi-pro prison guards' team back to the championship. Paul says no at first, but the sadistic warden has him beaten and put in the hot box. Paul now agrees to do anything the warden wants. Paul comes up with the idea that the guards need a warm-up game with the inmates. Paul gets the Caretaker (Chris Rock) and Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) to recruit a team of the meanest and biggest inmates in the prison. The inmates only join the team to get their revenge against the guards in a no-holds-barred game. At first, Paul is just playing a football game, but later he realizes that he wants to win the game for his teammates, and his new friends.<br/><br/>In the original 1974 movie, Burt Reynolds played the quarterback. The first movie was a little more serious and not as funny as this one. This movie can stand on its own, because it is a totally different type of movie. This is still one funny movie even though the football game is so brutal. Actually, if the referees let them play games like this one, most of the players would end up in the hospital.

","This was one of the best movies i have seen in years. Sure, people complain that the humor is crude, the violence is unnecessary, and the prisoners are bad people portrayed as heroes, but that's not the point. the point is, these inmates all made mistakes at some time or other. Now they're stuck inside a prison with the cruelest, steroid-enhanced guards to ever walk the prisons, along with a greedy, spiteful warden (remind you of a certain movie? Hint: it starts with ""the shawsh"" and ends with ""ank redemption""). they are sick and tired of taking the beating, the disrespect, the animal treatment. instead of revolting, they rebel in the best chance they can get: an organized sport. sure, it's macho. it's brutal. people like that. but that's not the flavor of the story. the flavor is in the sweet, sweet revenge, and the emotional roller coaster you go on for these guys. you feel their pain, you laugh at the jokes, you share their joy and anguish. you felt a knife stab to the heart when caretaker died; you felt your heart grow soft as the basketball gang joined up; and you got queasy whenever the warden approached. the prisoners developed something through the movie. before, they hated each other, hated the guards, the prison. but through football, they learned teamwork, friendship, and most of all: a sense of purpose. people desperately need that; it's a reason to live. they had a goal; they were determined to reach it. this is the inspiration that the movie is making. this is the core of the movie, and why it's so incredible. in my opinion, The Longest Yard is on par with classics like Remember the Titans."

A British soccer adaptation but filmed better and funny without the usual Sandler jokes that we have seen in all his other movies. I like him but he's very good at playing the same guy in every movie with a different name. Mean Machine is a Guy Richie film and i am sure you know what to expect when you know that Guy is involved. The Warden's role in Mean Machine is even shadier than the newer installment of Longest.

","If you want to laugh until your guts split, this is it. A re-make of an old classic starring Adam Sandler, who plays Paul Crewe, a once in a lifetime quarter back who threw a game before he went to prison. Inside, he meets a rather Motley Crue of misfit cons who in their own way provide Crewe and his team the needed punch to play against the guards on national television. Although Paul, (Sandler) does train them well, the warden (James Cromwell) has his own agenda to make sure his guard team wins. In the middle is Caretaker, (Chris Rock) who provides the necessary items for the team and to hone their playing skills. With his usual brand of wit and humour, it is an all out laugh fest as Paul gets together the mean machine, and to dedicate it to the caretaker when his life is taken by a pyromaniac. This is a good re-make, filled with laughs, punches, kicks, school yard bullies, and tranny cheerleaders. Together they give the public what they demand, a great football game with all the bells and whistles including one big India born behemoth named Turley (Dalip Singh). If you want to laugh, watch it. If you want to feel a good story, watch it. But if you want to see Burt Reynolds play a coach, definitely watch it. He was the classic Crewe in the original movie. Excellent film, laughed through the entire movie."

"db-beurylaw","1","1","2","6 January 2013"," 200 NFL players should line up and kick Sandler in the nuts
","This movie should be called a tribute to the absolute wonderfulness of Adam Sandler, by Adam Sandler. Sandler plays a pro football player who behaves like a jerk and goes to prison. There he forms a football team and they play a revenge game against the guards. That's pretty much it.<br/><br/>This movie is a remake of a much better movie starring Burt Reynolds. Reynolds could carry it off because he was in fact a college player. Nobody, no matter how stupid believes for a minute that Sandler could make a high school team. When an actor makes a movie like this and is cast as a macho he-man, even though he is clearly a wimpy girlie man, they should permit the real NFL players, all of them to kick the pretending actor in the balls. Even the kickers. Especially the kickers. This is Sandler's second offense, he did the same crap in Waterboy.<br/><br/>The only time a movie should be re-made is when the original, and every print, DVD, VHS, Beta and laser disk was destroyed in the same fire and civilization would crumble without this artistic achievement. This is not at all true, the original was a decent popcorn movie, this is crap.<br/><br/>Sandler reminds of the ego of Jerry Lewis minus the talent. Every movie he has been in would have been better if some other actor, any other actor played the Sandler part. Since the only reason to re-make this movie was so Sandler could once again massage his ego and play a macho football player, all of the prints, DVDs should be destroyed.<br/><br/>For all of you people who gave this crap a high score, I hope your tastes in movies improve by your tenth birthday."

Burt Reynolds, who starred in the lead role in the original plays the coach.<br/><br/>Starring Chris Rock, Nelly, and numerous World Wrestling superstars, The Longest Yard is a hilarious popcorn flick! Paul Crewe, an ex pro-football quarterback is sent to prison for grand theft auto. He is asked by the prison warden to form a team from among his inmates and put them up with the guards of the prison in order to boost their confidence before the start of the season. The prisoners however, have better plans. They build up a team in order to beat the c**p out of their oppressive guards, and disgrace them by winning the football game. Right from the word go, the film is rib-tickling fun. Whether it is the rap and rock music that ensues with a showdown or an introduction to the characters; or the priceless dialogue; or, what one calls, the bling-bling of American football; The Longest Yard is high octane entertainment! Rob Schneider, in his cameo as an enthusiastic supporter; Kevin Nash's girly-ness after being estrogen induced; and the 'Ready 58. Ready 58 hutt!' and smack in the referees area - I think I started crying with laughter! Sit down one afternoon with popcorn, chips, pepsi, and a bunch of buddies; turn up the volume; and enjoy The Longest Yard. It's going to make you laugh your head off!! 7/10!!

","The world was crying out for a remake of a movie about penitentiary prisoners and guards having a football game. Yeah, right. Why should anyone care? The film's whole premise is that everyone on the planet seems to care about the outcome (it's on national TV ha ha), yet the film never offers any reason why anyone (especially you) should.<br/><br/>People are bribed, threatened, beaten, even murdered because of this game. Naturally, prison guards are the bad guy: cowardly, plotting, bullies etc. you've heard it all before. The convicts are (Wow!!!! Original!!!) the good guys, but you're never given any reason to like anybody on either side. Then we get some typical stereotypes: the loudmouth fast-talking guy inmate (Chris Rock, who tries to strain humor from the uninspired script, but even he can't save it), cross-dressing cheerleaders, a plotting warden, a hero who fell from grace and wants to redeem himself, and so on. Adam Sandler does his usual slow, dull, droning voice: he could have put the opposing team to sleep, but instead comes up with other tired, overused, predictable tricks during the game. Burt Reynolds does his usual ""Look at silly Burt"" routine, which also fails to save the movie.<br/><br/>Dull, clichéd, stereotypes that you never care about. A dead script, pointless plot, and humorless overacting. Not recommended."

","How many times must this plot be filmed? I'm not sure that Burt Reynolds was the first back in 1974, but that version was my personal favourite, even though fellow countryman Vinnie Jones did a worthy rendition with an English spin in ""The Mean Machine"". This attempt by Adam Sandler seems entirely unnecessary, somehow. The script remains almost word-for-word the same as the 1974 version and Sandler brings nothing additional to the part of Paul Crewe. Indeed, Sandler was far less wooden in his classic, ""Going Overboard"", which also had the distinction of at least being original. (Let's give thanks for that!) Some excellent films have been released in the past year or so; this is most definitely not one of them."

"studdly_spud","8","1","2","12 December 2005"," Crews way to victory
","In the film The Longest Yard, the name Mean Machine represents love and power because their friend the caretaker gave the football team that name and because they wanted to win the game for the caretaker who was killed at the prison. I did not know a lot about the film. All I knew was that it was a football movie and staring in the movie was Adam Sandler, Nelly who is a rap singer, and some professional wrestlers. I also knew that it was mostly taking place at a prison somewhere. A thing that I learned from the film that actually might be of some use to me some day is that in a prison if you want to get along you have to go along. The warden used this phrase in the film. In a prison, you also have to trust yourself and no one else because if you go along with the wrong thing instead of saying no, your sentence might be extended. Crew learned this in the film because the warden was trying to get him to throw the game or shave points. He had already done that before, but if he didn't do it, the warden was going to pin the caretakers' death on him. Crew knew that things would work out all right so he still won the game. Because one of the other inmates who were on the guards' side killed the caretaker, AKA half a star, the players gave their love to the caretaker. The caretaker gave the team uniforms with the name Mean Machine on them, which they all received just before the game against the guards. Caretaker wanted to be there to see the looks on his teammate's faces but he could not because of the way things happened. This is why the phrase Mean Machine showed love. Love was given to the caretaker for all of the things that he did for each one of the players on the football team. And Because they all thought they were not going to win, until they remembered their friend, the caretaker, and what he did for them. Therefore, they got their heads up and all of the players got tons of pumping adrenalin power just before the game. They knew that they were going to get back at the guards for the way that they had treated them and what they did to their friend before at the prison. It turned out that they did have enough power and pride to beat the guards. I believe that the name of the team gave them power because they knew that they didn't have to only win it for themselves, but mostly for the person who encouraged them the whole way through training and who gave them uniforms and a name to make them all a real team; this person was the caretaker. Further more; the events that took place in the movie convinced Crew (Adam Sandler) that he could not shave points twice in his life off a football game. He had a feeling that he was going to be with the rest of the team a lot longer because the warden was going to extend his sentence if he did not loose the game. They all became a family and they won the game. I wonder if they will have a sequel to this movie like a second season between the guards and the inmates."
"TerminalMadness","3","1","2","3 December 2005"," People can not be dumb enough to find this good...
","I personally find it hard to believe that people would find this utterly weak recycling of the original film even remotely worth watching. Adam Sandler uses this effort as another vehicle, while Chris Rock is there to perform his routine. Meanwhile the film is unfunny, and the jokes fall flatter than ever. It's a shame audiences could find this to be a good movie, when the original strived in. The story is purposely neutered to appear to the bonehead teen demographic, while the original was violent and menacing in every way shape and form. Reynolds was a man in a jail filled with psychos trying to turn them in to a football team, while here they're all just harmless lovable buffoons that will make the audience wonder what they did to get in to that penitentiary. This remake is a disgrace."
"Chris_Docker","4","1","2","6 September 2005"," Is there really any mileage in American football movies for non-US audiences?
","With an all star cast including Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds and ex-convict Edward Bunker, this re-make of legendary Robert Aldrich's film about a football match by convicts, The Longest Yard would seem a sure-fire winner. For fans of American Football who can never get enough, it probably is, but how well does it translate to audiences unfamiliar with the sport? Non-Americans barely understand or recognise the game, so for them there needs to be something else with which to engage (unless we were given a proper briefing, which we're not). American Football bears little relation to Soccer, the mainstream game of the rest of the world. In Britain, we are beset with the unfortunate association of hooliganism with British football, we might be forgiven for looking across the Atlantic to America, where sports heroes are often role models (not just in the U.S., but in Latin America as well).<br/><br/>Our hero, Adam Sandler, has been dropped from the professional game for fixing a result. He goes out and crashes his girlfriend's car spectacularly (while drunk) and lands up in prison. After various rounds of blackmail and counter-blackmail, he is persuaded to lead the prison football team against the prison guards team. The film straddles sports and comedy uneasily.<br/><br/>When someone makes a movie about our favourite hobby, we tend to find jokes much funnier simply because we allow ourselves to be carried away on a sympathetic wave of feelgood enjoyment. For others, the jokes need to stand up on their own merit. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, both brilliant comedians in their own right, are out of their familiar territory with this movie. Many opportunities for belly laughs are missed by inept timing and lack of pacing. The cross-dresser cheerleaders should have been riotous, but they are badly introduced and then overplayed. A constant stream of jokes about MacDonalds and Coca-Cola become monotonous to all but the thickest-skinned, beer-bellied macho men. There are the occasional lame attempts to portray Sandler as a sex-icon, whether as the prey of the prison chief's wife or rolling around (in slow-motion) in the mud. Is he really that gorgeous? For more serious movie goers, this film may simply represent a grandstanding of all the bad things America has to offer the world  sadistic, overcrowded prisons, steroid-chomping would-be athletes, and prison guards who are effectively the worst type of role model. The sad thing is that the real situation is probably much worse. The Longest Yard accepts all this with utter bravado  perhaps just how George W Bush would like to see prisons run.<br/><br/>The U.S. has overtaken Russia as the world's most aggressive jailer. When local jails are included in the American tally, the U.S. locks up nearly 700 people per 100,000, compared with 102 for Canada, 132 for England and Wales, 85 for France and a paltry 48 in Japan. Roughly 2m Americans are currently behind bars, with some 4.5m on parole or on probation. At least 3m Americans are ex-convicts who have served their sentences and are no longer under the control of the justice system, and one estimate says that some 13m Americans  7% of the adult population  have been found guilty of a serious crime. Roughly one in five black men has been incarcerated at some point in his life; one in three has been convicted of a felony.<br/><br/>If this wasn't bad enough, there is a small hitch with America's policy of imprisoning more people than any other country on the planet: most have to be released at some point, even if mass incarceration makes a very temporary reduction in crime levels. America's homicide rate is still five to seven times higher than most industrialised countries. The 'correctional facilities' singularly fail to correct: three in four prisoners will be convicted of another crime within three yearsand three out of five will be back in prison. This keenness to lock people up is matched by a complete lack of interest in them when they get out. Britain seems to follow the U.S. lead: ""Prison works"", declared Michael Howard, addressing his first party conference as home secretary. Really? Ten years later, the prison population increased by 60% to but overall levels of serious crime recorded by the police doubled.<br/><br/>There is no incentive for prisons, whether privately or state run, to invest in reform. Their benefits need to be linked to re-offending rates  exactly the opposite to the current situation (where jobs are ensured by high offending). In America, the political agenda is even stronger. The guards unions make large donations to political parties, and their salaries and benefits have been suitably looked after in return. Offenders, on the other hand, are usually barred from voting and from many jobs, something which is generally seen as helping Republican votes. In Virginia and Kentucky, one in six black men cannot vote.<br/><br/>Edward Bunker (who played himself in Reservoir Dogs and died some time before the release of Longest Yard) made a movie called Animal Factory that was a tough and convincing look at prison life. The Longest Yard is not tough, convincing, or even that funny except for die-hard American Football fans. Adam Sandler is known to be a big Yankees fan  one wonders if there isn't a modicum of fantasy-fulfilment in this Big-Mac, Quarter-Pounder-With-Cheese no-brainer of a movie."

He is then sent to a prison where he gets a chance to play football again--AGAINST THE GUARDS!!! With the help of an inmate (Rock) and a former Heisman Trophy Winner (Reynolds), he puts together a team that, in the end, puts the guards in the Hall of SHAME! <br/><br/>And we can't forget the direction by Peter Segal. Him and Sandler work great together!<br/><br/>So, if you haven't already, see this movie. <br/><br/>If you saw it and liked it, see it again. It only gets funnier!"

","OK, well whoever said that this movie isn't good, is extremely stupid. (Sorry but i definitely love this movie). This movie is my new favorite movie of all time, not even kidding. OK well I just got out of the theatre from seeing this movie, and the first thing i did was come home and see what the movie was rated, I thought it's at least a 7, and was shocked and disappointed to see that it was only 5.8 out of 10. This movie was hilarious, shocking, and even sad. I got so into this movie, that i even talked to the screen a few times. (A little embarrassing, I got a few weird glances from other movie viewers, but I didn't really care.) I loved this movie, and am definitely going to go see it in theatres at least once more, and will most certainly buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD. Well i am going to say that many adults might not like this movie, it is more targeted to teens (boys and girls), the girls will love it because they can't help but fall in love with the characters. I mean you get to see them with their shirts off A lot, and it's pretty awesome.. haha, and I am a football lover, so it was even greater for me. Well the characters were very lovable. (except for the guards, they were kind of a** holes, but their is something very touching at the end, that makes me forgive one of them.) Adam Sandler's character was hilarious, I thought he was so cute, and he is definitely my favorite comedian. Chris Rock in this movie is adorable, and he is one of my other favorite comedians. All of the football players were so funny, and i couldn't help but love ALL of them. This movie was awesome! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hilarious, fun, and even sad movie. It's great!"

","I did not realize to be honest that this was a remake. But I had so much fun watching this version of ""The Longest Yard"". I went to the theater to see this with my friends and we just had a blast watching this.<br/><br/>Lately, Adam Sandler hasn't come out with too many comedies worth watching really. ""The Longest Yard"" has his typical styles of fighting, football, rough men, stereotypical gays, and him being a basic jerk who finds his light at the end of the tunnel ordeal. But ""The Longest Yard"" has it's great laughs, although it could have dealt without the whole beating Adam Sandler scenes in the beginning when he arrives at the prison. He must put a team together out of the inmates in the prison to play football against the guards. With the help of Chris Rock and none other than the original Longest Yard's star, Burt Reynolds! Nice, Adam! The Longest Yard is one of the best comedies I have seen this year so far. I would recommend it for a good laugh and time with your friends. This is a definite buy on DVD when it comes out. If you don't enjoy the movie, at least don't tell me you didn't get a kick out of the beginning with the car chase sequence! ""I think we should see other people! HA HA HA HA HA!"". Priceless.<br/><br/>8/10"

","First off, I normally hate football, (don't ask why.) but this movie is actually pretty cool.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler gave one of his best performances since Happy Gillmore and that's a plus. And let's not forget Chris Rock: every one of his movies I've seen before this was really painful to watch, but this redeems him.<br/><br/>Of course, if you're also a wrestling fan like me, you'll automatically notice some fan favorites right off the bat. (Stone Cold, Great Khali and Goldberg) Not to say that I like football now, but even if you don't, you're going to love this movie."

And despite all the testosterone- and steroid-infused bodies, rough stuff on the football field and in the prison, there was a real sweetness about the story. Adam Sandler is growing on me. Chris Rock also turned in a good performance. He's sure funnier when he's not using four-letter words in every sentence.<br/><br/>If I have any complaints it's that my home state, Texas, is again a caricature of meanness.

","This movie takes the over proportioned cast from the original and ramps it up a bit. Some of the largest men in Hollywood, the NFL, and professional wrestling compete in one of the most brutal games ever to hit the big screen. The best part is this movie also has some of the biggest laughs to hit the big screen in a long while. <br/><br/>One of the problems with a movie remake is the comparison of the two. This movie overcomes that by holding true to the original, keeping a faster pace, and throwing more laughs than footballs. This movie can almost be categorized as violent slapstick. With some heavy hits laid down by heavier players. Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe has a lot to overcome. With the help of the convicts and their ""special"" skills, this team of inmates realize they actually stand a chance.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler steps out of his typical goofball roles to deliver a great performance and shows some real acting abilities. Straying from the same antics, gibberish, and violent rages that made him famous, it is great to see him in a role with feeling. Sandler does a great job of bringing humor and attitude to the role.<br/><br/>The Longest Yard is without a doubt a great movie to break out the summer box office. This movie is poised to be big. Gauging the size of the actors, this movie will be huge. Bigger is better, this movie proves it. In the day of 5'4"" heroes like Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis, and Colin Farrell, this movie backs the old adage you can't teach a guy size. However you can teach him intensity, attitude, and how to steal a car, break and enter, pick pocket, and go to jail."

","Such a weird weird movie this one. I was so surprised it was actually a Happy Madison Production as it's so unlike any other movies by them & Adam Sandler. It took me a while to realise but this movie is actually trying to take itself fairly seriously. And so is Sandler. He's actually attempting to play a straight dramatic role. But then they try to throw in the odd bit of typical Happy Madison Adam Sandler humour but it feels forced & flat. The movie can't decide if it's a stupid comedy or a seriously dramatic sports flick. The worst thing about this movie is that they COMPLETELY waste Hollywood Legend Burt Reynolds. He literally is given nothing to do or say even remotely interesting or comedic. He has zero character & zero chemistry with Sandler. If he was supposed to be a sort of Mr Miyagi inspirational mentor type of character, it missed the mark hugely. Eveytim he's onscreen I hoped Burt would have something interesting or funny to say. But nothing. It's a very weirdly under written role for poor Burt. Courtney Cox is totally wasted too. Thankfully Happy Madison & Adam Sandler went back to their usual slapstick humour / formula after this one which was a big relief for their hardcore fans. Recently I watched ""Just Go with It"" for the first time & it was excellent, a million times better than this tripe."

And the mix of Pro wrestlers also makes it brilliant, especially since you see Kevin Nash's character is completely different to his wrestling persona. It's so violent at parts but comically funny at the same time (the violence I mean). I could watch this film every week or so and not get bored of it, it's just so cleverly made.

"Alwood","1","1","3","12 March 2006"," When is Hollywood going to stop remaking great movies?
","I attended an early screening of this film and actually dozed off about 20 minutes into it, remaining in that state for about another 20 minutes. In spite of a few chuckles, the 2005 incarnation of the classic black comedy THE LONGEST YARD, is yet another example of a big studio lacking the imagination and ingenuity to tell NEW stories, by remaking a great film from yesteryear (which Paramount has done recently with films like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and ALFIE, also with middling results).<br/><br/>First problem: who is going to buy diminutive Adam Sandler as a former NFL pro??? He simply doesn't have the physical attributes of a professional athlete, and right away, the film loses credibility with his casting.<br/><br/>Second, Chris Rock is relegated to spitting out lines from a script that sounds like it was written by committee (which it undoubtedly was) and as a result, most of his lines fall flat. If the filmmakers were smart, they would have just ""let him go,"" so he could improvise with his very unique, brilliant brand of edgy humor. He is utterly wasted.<br/><br/>Third, poor Burt Reynolds, who headlined the original 1974 version of the film, looks like he can't wait to get paid and go home to Florida, now playing the role of Nate Scarborough, the aging former gridiron star that was played by the late Michael (HILL STREET BLUES) Conrad in the original. I'm a big fan of Burt, but he completely phones it in here, another example of a fine actor who is wasted in this corporate ""product."" Finally, the original LONGEST YARD was a tough, bone-crunching, ""hard R"" film, even by today's standards. The characters were very well-developed, from Eddie Albert's corrupt warden, to Burt's tormented, self-loathing Paul Crewe, to Ed Lauter's sadistic captain of the guard. Helmed by the great Robert Aldrich, the film was a potent mix of very black humor, and very tough, violent drama. Watching it today, it not only holds up beautifully, but even feels contemporary. The remake, by contrast, is a watered down, PG-13, middle of the road piece of Cool Whip. What was an edgy, tough film for adults, has been made into a ""safe"" film that will offend few, in spite of a few ""poo-poo, pee-pee"" jokes, aimed at the junior high crowd. There is NO character development in this at all. Everyone in the film is presented as a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out. We never gain any insight into why they do what they do, why they are who they are, or how they even wound up in prison to begin with.<br/><br/>The moral of the story: GET OFF YOUR LAZY BUTTS, Hollywood! There are a plethora of great writers and directors out there who are waiting tables, and who have amazing, contemporary stories to tell to the world. Give them that shot. That's your job. Quit remaking great films from yesteryear. Even if you do them relatively well (as in the MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remake), they still will never stack up against the original. It's kind of like covering a song made famous by Sinatra or the Beatles: once it's been done in ""signature"" fashion, everything else is going to seem like a forgery.<br/><br/>* 1/2 out of 10"

","Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. Get the original. The only thing this version improved on was the soundtrack. Even that was not a large improvement.<br/><br/>Let's start with the obvious. Can anyone really picture Adam Sandler as a football player without flashing back to ""The Waterboy?"" Aside from that, he is too scrawny to even pretend to be an NFL MVP. Very poor casting. And Chris Rock. How many times do we have to hear his ""white boy this and white boy that"" schtick? Man, is it old. It stopped being funny years ago. Burt Reynolds. How much of a movie slut do you have to be to take a supporting role (played superbly by Michael Conrad in the original) in a remake of one of your best movies? I am sure that anyone under the age of 16 would love this movie. It has loud music, lots of gay jokes and bone-crunching football sequences. But the sequences are cheesy. Picture Nelly making the same stupid spin moves to break or avoid tackles and you have the bulk of the action.<br/><br/>What really bothered me about this movie is that the director expected his audience to be stupid and had to over-explain everything. Here is a perfect example: At the end of the original, Crewe appears to be escaping and Warden Hazen tells CPT Knauer (Ed Lauter) to shoot him. You can see that Crewe won over Knauer, who can't bring himself to pull the trigger. When he realizes that Krewe is picking up the football, he slaps the rifle in Eddie Albert's chest and says, ""Game ball."" That's it. We knew what he meant and that he would be a stand-up guy. Fast forward 30 years and Peter Segal has his CPT Knauer tell Hazen, ""IT'S the game ball."" The Knauer has a heart-to-heart with Crewe to tell him that Knauer will not let Hazen falsely accuse Crewe of a crime. Thanks for the touchy-feely moment to close the movie, Segal. It was more saccharine than I could bear.<br/><br/>Maybe someone can explain this one to me. When the police stop Crewe in his girlfriend's car, he gives them the beer he has been drinking. Just for fun, he also gives them the other five beers from the six-pack. When the car is wrecked, he gets out and salutes the TV chopper with, yes, another beer. Did he stop during the chase for another six-pack or did Segal figure that we would forget what happened one whole scene ago? Okay, I'm grousing. I did not expect this remake to be as good as the original. I also did not expect it to be such a cheesy hack of a movie."

","I very rarely as a girl and therefore not a sports fan go and see movies based around a sport but this was really worth it. I went initially as I am a an Adam sandler fan and thought it would be a laugh. I was really impressed however as the movie went on to actually find some depth to this movie and not solely a surface comedy. After Adam sandlers character Paul is sent to a prison in Texas after being caught drink driving he is asked by the warden of the prison to aid the football team of the prison which consists of the sadistic guards. He refuses but suggests that as a warm up game they play the prisoners. This the warden takes on board and so Paul goes out looking for a football team amongst the inmates of the prison, and soon discovers that they can not only warm up the guards team but beat them. I found myself throughout the course of the movie feeling more and more part of this team and when the end game was played felt the urge to cheer and shout every time they scored a touch down. The longest yard did not only deal with the sport but actually had a backing story that struck a chord with a majority of the audience and when one of the characters suffered a terrible death many of the viewers in the cinema were welling up with tears. Overall this movie was well cast with sandler and even d12 and Nelly making an appearance, the story was quite lighthearted and fun yet did have a realism to it that was good to watch. I would give this movie a 10 as I could watch it again and again."

However, I thought as a comedy, this movie just doesn't work nearly as well as other football movies such as ""The Waterboy"" and ""The Replacements"", both of which I absolutely love, and both of which have a strong element of fantasy - neither plot is supposed to seem too realistic and the comedic humor and drama for each movie just ""works"". Both are more than just stupid comedies.<br/><br/>This movie had plenty of funny bits. I laughed a lot. I also felt cheated out of the money I paid to see it, although I knew the reviews were mixed and I knew I wasn't there to see an Oscar-nominated film.<br/><br/>I think too much was crammed into this movie for this movie to be good. Too many gags, too much ""drama"", just too much crap. It just doesn't work. I sat there wondering why so many good actors, artists, and athletes (and sports personalities -- I even saw Peter King from SI.com up there) chose to do this movie after reading the script.

","I never saw the original but I really liked this movie anyway. I usually don't like Adam Sandler comedies this much. I like Sandler but I think he chews scenery too much in most his movies. Plus they all have the ""YOU CAN DO IT!!"" plot. He has to go against all the odds with everyone rooting for him by the end. Sure the Longest Yard isn't that much different than his usual movies. Still it's funner and for once it's just not only about Sandler's character. <br/><br/>Richard Roeper totally tore the movie apart. He said that Chris Rock is in another forgettable role. He's just picking on him due to Rock's comments on Jude Law at the Oscars's though. I'm not the biggest Rock fan and didn't like those comments either. However he does shine here and does have the best lines. I also like the wrestlers in the film that star in supporting roles. You have Kevin Nash as a prison guard who gets his steroids replaced with estrogen. He's pretty funny in the movie, he doesn't have the potential of the Rock. Still scenes like where he asks the other guards why his nipples are so hard are pretty funny. <br/><br/>Goldberg is funny as a prisoner who's nickname for his private part is ""the Sledgehammer"". Stone Cold Steve Austin also stars as a prejudice prison guard. He doesn't get as much to do as Nash and Goldberg. The WWE was promoting the movie by mentioning just Austin and talking about his potential as an actor. If there's potential you don't get to see it that much in this movie. Sandler got knocked by Roeper for not being believable as a football player. I think he's much more believable here as one than in the Waterboy though. Plus quarterbacks don't have to be that big. I mean Jamie Fox isn't the biggest guy either and he played a quarterback in Any Given Sunday. I think Sandler pulls off the role fine. This is his best comedy I think. I can't count how many times I laughed. Most football comedies think they need a bar fight in-order to be funny. In the Longest Yard at least there's no bar for them to have a big brawl in."

Chris Rock also adds a little spice to the mix and where did they get those huge guys from anyway??!!"
"saint405","8","1","3","26 June 2005"," This film proves not all remakes are bad
","When I saw The Longest Yard I was really entertained by all the action, comedy, and football tactics going around. Adam Sandler has outdone himself playing the ex-quarterback Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe, Chris Rock did a good job on portraying the assistant coach Caretaker, and straight from the original Longest Yard is the legend Burt Reynolds playing the coach. Along with the main actors is James Cromwell who plays Warden Hazard, and I just have to say he is not as tough as the original Hazen but he still plays the part well, plus we have Courtney Cox in the opening as Paul's girlfriend. Now the whole football team is another story. Bob Sapp is hilarious ""I love little Michael."", Brucie is amusing "" Dear God please help me kick this ball and I promise I'll stop cheating on my wife with black men."", we have Bill Goldberg as Hammer and wait till you see the actor who plays Turley! The guards are all played mean and evil, I liked Steve Austins performance. Sure this film doesn't beat the original but it beats a lot of other remakes. This film is hilarious with action and comedy rolled up into the main football game, wait till you see Rob Schnieders cameo "" You can do it!"" This film gets the big 8, great remake."
"EmperorNortonII","7","1","3","24 June 2005"," Adam Sandler Scores In the Remake
","Adam Sandler's ""The Longest Yard"" is a remake of the 1974 original starring Burt Reynolds. Sandler stars in Reynolds' original role as Paul Crewe, fallen football star turned prison inmate. Sent to a rough jail in Texas, Crewe is forced by the sadistic sports-loving warden to form a football team of inmates. The all-star cast includes Chris Rock as Caretaker and Burt Reynolds as coach Nate Scarborough. Rounding out the case are some real former athletes: football players Brian ""The Boz"" Bosworth, Terry Crews and Nelly (who actually did play in high school), as professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and Kevin ""Big Sexy"" Nash. The movie offers many funny moments, and exciting action. Whether you liked the original, or not, or you didn't even see it, the new version is worth watching."

","I never saw the original film. I was en't really expecting anything great out of this film. All the critics were saying bad things about it, but the critics are not always right. It was a very funny film. It was about a former MVP football player who steals his girlfriend's car. He goes to prison and the warden tells him to couch his own football team against the warden's team. Chris Rock's character is killed and Paul is framed. It turns out Paul's team wins. Chris Rock was the funniest guy in the film. The men dressed up as women were hilarious. I think this is one of Adam Sandler's best films. The big guy was funny, especially when he would ram the other team players. A fun and entertaining film."

","THE LONGEST YARD: The fact that I barely remember the original (seen it once in the theatre in the 70's), and the fact I wanted to rent it again, and give you a proper comparison theatre report, is one of the main reasons I'm late. Anyways the movie starts off in the right foot and follows a formula (like most movies these days), but as time wears on race & homosexuality tend to way heavy, veering further away from the original, and how many gay jokes do you need in a prison flick? (this ain't Will & Grace do Alcatraz!). The addition of Burt Reynolds was purely cosmetic as he did little to offer the story, its a shame as he was in his element in the original. Sandler can barely fit in Reynolds shoes and leans heavily on comedy verses story. Chris Rock as the caretaker seemed funnier than Sandler, still the racial conflicts are weak in the 2000's verses the same situations of the 70's. The actual game seems weak in comparison too, from what I can remember in the original, the game was exciting and you rooted for the underdogs (much like in M*A*S*H), this game I couldn't wait for it to end, much less care who won. I also heard Eddie Albert (original Warden) died a day before this movie was released, just giving him enough time to try out his rolls in his new coffin. So like most remakes I have to ask why bother? Write something original for a change Hollywood, PLEASE!!!!"
"butrnip2","1","1","3","12 June 2005"," A cheap prostitute dressed in fancy clothes
","What a waste of perfectly good film! How Adam Sandler continues to get funding for his projects is beyond me. Extremely poor, story and character development, lousy casting and predictable ending (and I don't mean by who won).<br/><br/>This movie was no homage. It was nothing more than a cheap prostitute dressed in fancy clothes. A remake of the classic, edgy, well-developed, dramatic original, that was laced with intelligent humor and good acting. I couldn't believe the crap they were trying to sell the audience. <br/><br/>To start with, the poor choice of location for the prison. In the New Mexico dessert? 'C'mon.' Didn't I see a ghost town tour bus in the background? And what's with the century old prison with 2-year-old, apparent, freshly planted trees? And what's with the movie's southern undertones; like the warden's completely out of place Colonel Sander's sidekick, and the guards who are referred to as ""Rednecks?"" Are we in the South or the West? Give me a break guys. Totally ridiculous. Oh, and how about the stadium where they play this Superbowl in? Glad ESPN was there to cover the game to give it that... oh so authentic feel.<br/><br/>Hey Burt! You were great in the first one, but you should have said, ""thanks but no thanks,"" to the this one. The constant look on your face of... Oh God I wish they weren't destroying my great movie, but I really need this paycheck, was painful to watch; Not to mention, the I wish I was in my twenties again look. I really felt for ya' buddy.<br/><br/>Also, 'gotta' love the uniforms stitched with each player's name on the back. In the original, Caretaker stole the guards' old uniforms. Where did they get these from, Vince McMahon's disbanded football league (I can't remember the league's forgettable name)? I kept looking for, ""He Hate Me."" <br/><br/>Sorry, but this movie was so contrived and totally stupid. Moreover, it really sucked!"

","I enjoyed this movie. I will admit that I have not seen the original and have heard that this new version was different in many ways, I still enjoyed it. It seemed to be more geared toward a teen-aged audience than an older or family audience. I also thought that Adam Sandler was the perfect man for the lead role. I also think that people need to go into this movie with an open mind. If you go into this movie expecting it to be just like the original, you will be sadly disappointed. It is like the old movie with a modern twist. If you go into this movie with a closed mind, you will not like it. But if you go into this movie with an open mind, you may be surprised."
"Dgabgblo123","8","1","3","8 June 2005"," One of the better Adam Sandler movies of late
","I saw ""The Longest Yard"" with my friend today and have to admit I did not have high expectations. However, after 15 minutes, I knew this was a different kind of Adam Sandler film. I have never seen the original, but have to guess that the story is the same. Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who infamously threw a game. An alcoholic when the story begins, he is sent to jail after playing a reckless cat-and-mouse game with the police, using a stolen car. He is called upon by the warden (James Cromwell) to put together a football team, with the intention that they would lose, in an annual game against the guards. Sandler brings together an incredible group of misfits, which include several giants, Chris Rock as his assistant coach, and Burt Reynolds, who pretty much gives himself the job as coach (I read that Reynolds played Crewe in the original; it would've probably been more interesting if Reynolds' character would be Paul Crewe and Sandler's character would've been differently named). While in many ways a standard Hollywood movie, with plenty of Sandler-esquire product placement, it is by far his best movie since Punch-Drunk Love and his most entertaining since The Waterboy. Chris Rock also gives one of his better performances here. I think the film really excels, however, in its good execution. It is fast paced, well edited, with some good music in the background. Not an award-worthy movie of any means, it is, however, a fun way to spend two hours with plenty of entertainment to keep nearly anyone happy."

And the verdict...a very good bone-breaking, head snapping crunch of a movie. Exciting story, even though the end and storyline was evident from the word GO...or rather ACTION!! The movie unfolds in a rapid pace and doesn't let up...no time to get bored. Sandler gives a sterling performance, one of his better flicks with such intensity rivaled by maybe Punch-Drunk love. Nelly, Chris Rock and the rest of the cast push the movie and its plot, so no dull moments here.

This movie was a remake from a 1970's film with the same title and Burt Reynolds was in the original movie. The movie is about a former NFL star Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe (Adam Sandler) who was a superstar back in his day since time has faded. Then one night he gets arrested for drunk driving in his girlfriend's new car and then goes to jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. Paul assembles a football team with the help from Caretaker (Chris Rock) and an old legend Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving force behind the new team. I laughed my ass off through out the entire movie! Plus Adam Sandler's stunt double was backup QB from the Los Angeles Avengers (an pro Arena Football team), Brian Mann!

I DON'T CARE if Adam Sandler is a diminutive actor, quarterbacks don't have to be as big as Warren Sapp. Brett Favre is 6'2"". No-one questions his football ability. The other common complaint is that the star cameos detract from the movie, quite the opposite, because the stars did a great job. Nelly, Stone Cold, and Goldberg all had acting parts that they could handle. The movie is stupid and I like it that way. I don't want to laugh at an intelligent film. I take all-honors courses, but I certainly don't need any jokes about the decline of the Roman Empire. I want physical comedy, well written jokes, and Chris Rock's racial comedy. SEE THIS MOVIE.

That's all this movie was ever meant to be, entertainment! It is extremely funny. Everyone in the theater was practically rolling in the aisles, and yes men and women found this movie funny. Yes, a lot of the humor is rather sophomoric, and I for one could use a dose of pure laughter from pointless things from time to time. I'm so tired of everyone judging movies based on how realistic and dramatic they are. I thought the whole point of film and television was to escape the reality of our everyday lives. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock have a great comedic chemistry and timing, probably left over from their SNL days. Here's a little advice, if in the first five minutes of this movie you're not laughing your butt off, do yourself a favor and GET UP AND LEAVE because this won't be your kind of movie. So if you like to laugh and you could care less about the Oscars this movie will suit you just fine!"
"TheMovieMark","7","2","10","27 May 2005"," Entertaining, but not one of Sandler's best.
","What exactly is The Longest Yard? Is it merely a movie that follows the adventures of an imprisoned former NFL quarterback as he assembles a rag tag group of hardened criminals into a football team and then prepares them to play against a team consisting of the prison guards? Or is it a lesson in breaking the laws of physics? After all, a yard is a yard, correct? How can any one yard be longer than another? It's impossible, right? Well, yes, but the movie never addresses the issue. So we'll accept this as a football comedy.<br/><br/>But is it more than a comedy? Is it a warning about us as a society? Honestly, what is it about our human nature that causes us to cheer on a football team consisting of convicted murderers and probably even rapists? Sure, the prison guards are painted in a negative light, but is that reason enough to root for a group of criminals? Is this Adam Sandlerized social commentary? No, of course not. But unfortunately, the movie does seem to have a slight identity crisis at times. Overall, this is a fun, entertaining movie. The action and jokes come at us fast amidst the backdrop of classic rock. That's all well and good, but I was a little dismayed that things were more dramatic than I expected. Plus, the third act focused mainly on the football game.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching the big hits, the dropkicks, and the clotheslines, but it's just one of those things where once you watch the game and see how it plays out, there's not much incentive to go back and watch it again. The laughs are sufficient, but the movie simply doesn't measure up to Sandler's best comedies.<br/><br/>My enjoyment also waned a little whenever the movie dipped into ""least common denominator"" humor territory. I suppose some people will laugh uproariously at the prisoners who are dressed as women and posing as cheerleaders. These people are whom I like to refer to as ""the easily entertained."" But I guess I'm just one of those guys who doesn't really enjoy looking at men in skimpy outfits grinding against each other. If the thought of a scantily clad, transvestite Tracy Morgan makes you as sick as it does me, then keep your trusty yellow bucket handy.<br/><br/>I was also hoping Sandler wouldn't be quite so subdued. He's still funny, but things get a little awkward when he turns into Mr. Conflicted Emotions and plays the hero. That's nice, Adam, but can't you talk in a funny voice at least a couple of times? No? Fine. Whatever, Mr. Forget Your Niche.<br/><br/>Oh well, I guess I just come from the Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer school of Adam Sandler comedies, so I was a little disappointed that The Longest Yard wasn't in the same vein. It's still pretty entertaining, but darn it all, I want to know which yard is the longest, and I want to see the proof! I still say all yards are the same. That's what sequels are for, I suppose. Man I'm a dork.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>To be completely honest, The Longest Yard can wait for a DVD rental, especially if you're on the fence about it. It's not like there are any great special effects that just have to be seen on the big screen. Entertaining? Yes, but I won't be adding it to my DVD collection. Worth $8+ per person? Nah. Make it a rental or a matinée."

"zardoz-13","9","1","4","21 June 2007"," Adam Sandler and company score a touchdown with ""The Longest Yard!""
","The Adam Sandler remake of the classic, bone-crunching, Burt Reynolds' football comedy ""The Longest Yard"" captures the rough and rowdy Three Stooges spirit of its 1974 predecessor in virtually every respect, except director Peter Segal doesn't stage the gridiron exploits with the virtuosity that Robert Aldrich did, with Reynolds calling plays opposite veteran Green Bay Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke and former Pittsburgh Steelers great Mike Henry. Nevertheless, this crowd-pleasing, slam-bang rendition of ""The Longest Yard"" ranks as the best Adam Sandler farce since ""The Waterboy."" <br/><br/>Freshman scenarist Shelton Turner succeeds where most scribes fail in that his inspired update of writer Tracy Keenan Wynn's original screenplay sticks with the previous game plan, smooths out the rough spots in some instances, but deviates only when necessary to conjure up fresher gags. Long-time Sandler fans will spot some of these alterations, especially when Sandler's comic pal Rob Schneider's shows up to perform his 'you can do it' shtick from the sidelines, and Cloris Leachman's hilarious football prison secretary upstages anything Bernadette Peters did in the first time out. The casting here is bullseye perfect, smack down to the smallest detail, specifically perennial villain David Patrick Kelly as the jealous pyromanical inmate who torches one of the team players. Quiet, unassuming ""Babe"" star James Cromwell turns in a top-notch performance as the sleazy warden that the late great Eddie Albert (he stole the show as the warden in the original) would stand up and cheer from the grave. Although the new ""Longest Yard"" doesn't surpass the first ""Longest Yard,"" you'd need a chain marker and a committee of officials to tell the difference.<br/><br/>Like the original ""Longest Yard,"" the Sandler version opens in the bedroom with a drunken Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler of ""50 First Dates"") appropriating his girlfriend's sports car for a joy ride and winds up receiving a three year sentence in the can at Allenville Federal Penitentiary in Texas. Warden Hazen (James Cromwell of "" "") pulls strings to get Crewe into his correctional facility, because Hazen dreams of running for governor and believes his prison guard football team will put him into the political end zone. Hazen approaches Crewe and asks him for his help in straightening up his team that hasn't clinched a championship in several years. Initially, Crewe refuses to give Hazen the benefit of his experience because prison guard Captain Knauer (William Fichtner of ""Armageddon"") has beaten him repeatedly with his baton and warned him to refuse the warden. After a week in solitary sweating it out in a shack with no amenities, Crewe capitulates and suggests that Hazen schedule a tune-up game between the guards and the convicts. Unlike the original where the guards were just guards, in the remake the prison warden has recruited his guards from college players who missed out. <br/><br/>Several familiar faces flesh out these plug-ugly prison guards, notably former Seattle Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth, two-time, NFL Pro Bowler Bill Romanowski, and wrestling legend Steve 'Cold Stone' Austin. At first, Crewe appears at a complete loss until he meets Caretaker (Chris Rock of ""Head of the State"") who clues him into who is who behind bars. Initial attempts to recruit team member falter because pro-football banned Crewe from playing because of his alleged point-fixing schemes. Nevertheless, Crewe comes up with players who make the guys in the Burt Reynolds version look like pygmies.<br/><br/>Director Peter Segal, who helmed two previous Adam Sandler comedies: ""Anger Management"" and ""50 First Dates,"" never lets the action lag and manages to convey important exposition (narrative information) in a more streamlined fashion. Clearly, he must have seen the first ""Yard,"" because his use of split-screen is patterned after what Aldrich did in the original. Wisely, funnyman Adam Sandler doesn't try to one-up Burt Reynolds whose real-life college football career helped his physical performance enormously in the original. There is no scene where the hero tosses a pass through a tire swinging at the end of a rope. No where near as cool and charismatic as Burt was in 1974, Sandler sticks to the game plan that he knows best: wiseacre humor. Sandler's scenes with the glorious Cloris Leachman will be hard to top for any comedian who takes on this project. The repartee between Sandler and a short, conch-eared San Diego traffic cop is fantastic. Everything up to the big showdown on the gridiron is either perfectly rehashed by director Segal, writer Turner, and a strong cast or taken to the next level. Notably good is the way that Segal introduces each player as they join the team for practice. <br/><br/>Particularly funny is the inclusion of a Hispanic Hercules whose accent isn't thick enough to require subtitles but the subtitles add to the hilarity of the moment. The only two things that this ""Yard"" fumbles are the tension crackling plays, the sports car from the first movie, and the infamous F-word line that surprisingly has been toned-down and rewritten for this PG-13 movie. While PG-13 movies lack the profanity levels of their R-rated counterparts, the Motion Picture Association of America allows on F-word for every PG-13. However, the gag in the original had the cast using the F-Word in the same sentence three times. All quibbles aside, Adam Sandler and company score a touchdown with ""The Longest Yard,"" not only as first-rate entertainment but also as homage to the Robert Aldrich original."

","Well this movie has everything in it to make a person laugh out loud and also adds a bit of importance of friendship and so on. I for one personally like the plot-A former NFL star has been taken into prison and then is made to make a team of prisoners to take on the guards so that they can get a good warm up game before the season. But as everyone knows it is not that simple. the whole process takes over of getting the right people to play and mostly to inflict as much as pain on the guards as possible.Together with a lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun this movie keeps you wanting to see more and more this is one great movie with good entertainment but lacks a bit of seriousness needed to make this movie a success story but still it was very enjoyable and it would be a really really good way to pass out any time of the day whenever free. The acting was perfect and the whole movie did what it was supposed to do. Overall to me i think that this movie deserves a creditable 7 or 8/10."

I said to myself, ""Hey, What the hey?"" Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a gridiron great who gets it when he wrecks the car by letting police cruisers smash into it. That's a far cry from what Burt Reynolds character did to it. He sends it into the water, deep water. The cast and characters are unbelievable. Some SNL alums, and some sports stars to make the movie. Football, wrestling, R&B star Nelly, man can it get any better that this? The scenes are outrageous, I liked the part where this towering prisoner named Turley(Dalip Singh) kicks the burly guy in the helmet and breaks his nose. Then in the football game, Crewe threw the ball at the referee's groin twice. Can't make the call with your friends in pain. HAHA! Then I liked the part where Battle(Bill Goldberg) switched the steroids with estrogen pills. This movie really surpassed the 1974 version, and it's a lot funnier as well.

","by Blake Nettles.<br/><br/>The Longest Yard was a funny movie. It was also suspenseful. This movie was about an ex-quarterback going to jail for shaving points off of a football game. The prisoners try to get back at the guards by playing them in a football game. The suspenseful part was during the game. At half time the warden wanted Paul Crewe to lose the game for shorter time in prison.<br/><br/>This was a great movie and it was also funny. The funniest part was when Paul Crewe got pulled over. He made jokes about the cops, ran from the cops, and while he was driving he stopped and wrecked the car.<br/><br/>I think that the actors did a great job, that's why it was a great movie. It was one of the best movies I've seen lately."

","yes, this is Adam Sander's attempt at an homage to the original film, but the problem is that its an unbelievably uninspired homage. man, i never thought i'd post an angry film review online. suffice to say, it was necessary due to the fact that this movie was bad, and i didn't want anyone to be mislead by the above comment. i see now that i need to provide ten lines for this to be posted, so i'll give some reasons: 1) nothing but extraordinarily obvious, already overplayed MTV songs that make the movie dated after a week. 2) nothing but extraordinarily obvious jokes lifted from old Adam Sander movies. it felt a robot studied every Adam Sander movie and attempted to program a movie based on the specifications of the previous ones: no originality, no delivery, no subtlety, no charm. 3) script suffered from an extreme case of ""white guy trying to act like he perfectly understands black guys and accidentally caricatures them like crazy"" syndrome. all in all, almost as good of a movie as 'honey' with Jessica alba. boy, 'honey' is a good movie. it's almost as good of a movie as 'glitter' with Maria Carey. boy, 'glitter' is a good movie."

"metalrox_2000","8","1","4","17 June 2005"," better then many remakes
","Seeing MTV film's name attached, seeing Adam Sandler as Paul Crewe, I had some doubts going into this one. I was gladly wrong about what I first thought. The movie was updated to modern times, while still remaining very faithful to the original, and in many cases, some of the same scenes were played out. They even managed to kill off Chris Rock's caretaker In almost the same fashion they did in the original. The library scene, and the scene in the shower in which the Warden asked Crewe to throw the game were very close to the original. Instead of simply making a scene for scene remake, like what was done years ago with the Bashinger/Baldwon 'The Getaway"" flick years ago, the director manager to remake the movie, without being scene for scene, put a creative tip to the scenes, and still remain faithful to the original. I would have preferred to see Bernadette Peters reprise the role of the Warden's secretary, instead of Cloris Leachman, who was the weakest part of the film. The only other thing that I was kind of disappointed in was the end. Guard Knauer saying he knew about the Warden's plans to blame Crewe for caretaker's death smack of having an overly happy ending. in the original film, the director let you know about the respect the two had for each other after the game, instead of being blatant about it. Kevin Nash was a plus as the Guard slipped female hormones, and Steve Austin seemed to be at home in the role of sadistic guard. A few other negatives however, goto Bill Romanawski as Guard Lambert and Bill Goldberg. Romanawski was a poor substitute for the late Ray Nichstkkie, and Goldberg was a bad as actor as he was a pro wrestler. Instead of Romanawski, Brain Bozworth would have been better in the role. (funny that Boz wore his old sooners number 44 in the film. Other better candidates would of been Broncos safety John Lynch, or former NFL player Steve Emtman. Romanawski's acting seemed awkward and very amateur.<br/><br/>Overall, this rates as one of the bets remakes that I've seen in a long time, and I was glad to see that my one view of the movie was wrong. A great movie, worth the price of admission."

Ironic that Eddy Albert (the original warden) passed away the day before it was released nationally.

Not once did this movie get boring and not once did this movie get real stupid. The laughter and interesting story just kept coming, keeping you into the movie.

Both Nelly and Micheal Irvin surprised me as far as acting ability. Although, I'd honestly say Bob Sapp and Kevin Nash stole the show. I found both did sub-par in their previous movies (Nash in The Punisher and Sapp in Elektra) but they really excelled here. Nash's feminine acting brought comedic relief to the hard-hitting, intense football game. As for Steve Austin, I'm disappointed with his role. He gives Nelly a hard time for a few minutes then gets hurt during the game and sh!ts himself...LA DEE DA who gives a sh!t (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the movie and recommend it to ANYONE who has any kinda of passion for the sport of football.

","The Longest Yard is an absolutely brilliant film which is very funny and entertaining and enjoyable to watch. The film which is about a man called Paul Crewe(played by Adam Sandler) who gets arrested and is put into Allenville Penitentiary one of the most cruelest prisons in the country. Whilst he is there an evil prison warden called Warden Hazen(played by James Cromwell) asks Crewe to form an American Football team to play against the prison guards. Crewe gets help from a Black guy called Caretaker(played by Chris Rock) to do this. With his help the two manage to form The Mean Machine one of the most craziest teams to ever play the game. Crewe is continuously pressurized about
the American Football team by the malicious warden Warden Hazen and gets one of the prison guards to kill Caretaker there and pins the murder of Caretaker on Crewe who has made friends, formed an American Football team and built a good friendship between him and Caretaker. When in an American Football game with the prison guards, the malicious and manipulative Warden Hazen wants Crewe to give up and let the prison guards win but that doesn't happen and when Crewes team wins the game, the malicious and manipulative Warden Hazen wants one of his prison guards to Kill Crewe who formed the team, but the prison guard refuses which makes the prisoners pour dirty water over Warden Hazen when winning the American Football game because Warden Hazen is a malicious and manipulative man who wants things all for himself. I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler but this film had some excellent acting by Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, Nelly, Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, Bill Goldberg, Terry Crews, Bob Sapp, Nicholas Turturro, Dalip Singh (aka WWE American Wrester The Great Khali), Lobo Sebastian, Joey Diaz, Steve Reevis, David Patrick Kelly, Edward Bunker, William Fichtner, Bill Romanowski, Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, Brian Bosworth and James Cromwell."

","I have no connection to the original The Longest Yard, the classic Burt Reynolds sports flick, so my review of Adam Sandler's remake comes without the full context. That being said, I find the 2005 film one of Sandler's best. A hearty mixture of prison comedy, football drama, and vice-versa, The Longest Yard is nothing if not entertaining, especially for fans of the gridiron.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe, a former football star who is sent to jail for drunk driving. Once there, the corrupt Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) organizes a football game where the sadistic prison guards can take out their frustrations on the inmates. Crewe gathers an eclectic team to take on the guards, and this is where kickoff starts, so to speak. <br/><br/>The Longest Yard boasts an all-star cast, but not in the traditional sense. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds are the headliners here, but the real genius of the casting in The Longest Yard is in its supporting characters. The use of other kinds of stars, namely actual athletes who play the inmates and guards is no less than inspired. A rapper, Nelly, professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg, Bob Sapp, Dalip Singh (The Great Khali), and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, and NFL stars Michael Irvin, Terry Crews, and Brian Bosworth, are the heart of The Longest Yard. The athletes' here have screen presence to spare, and the movie oozes with goofy machismo. Each of the supporting players, including other comedians like Nicholas Turturro and Tracy Morgan, are cleverly drawn comedic characters. Each player has his place in the story. Both teams are made of people you can remember, and root for (or against) by the time the big game rolls around.<br/><br/>As funny as The Longest Yard is, and it is at times up-roaringly hilarious, the movie works on more than just one level. Unlike another Adam Sandler football comedy, The Waterboy, The Longest Yard has some truly sensational football sequences, as well as a dash of genuine drama in a couple later scenes. On the topic of the ""Big Game"" that the movie builds to, I really can't think of a time I have been more amused by such a well-worn cliché. These football scenes are a joy to watch, if only because the inmates vs prison guards framing device allows the filmmakers to go above and beyond what you'd see on a regular Sunday. The players hit each other absurdly hard, but there is still a layer of authenticity to the scenes, thanks to the professional athletes in front of the camera.<br/><br/>I'm not one to turn my nose up at Adam Sandler or his popular comedies, but The Longest Yard is more wildly and consistently entertaining than just about anything he has ever done. From the start, there is a macho zest coursing through this movie's veins. It's a guys flick if ever there was one. For dudes who can handle some good-natured racial ribbing, and tackles that make your head rattle just watching them, The Longest Yard is as cathartic as a touchdown and as satisfying as a cheeseburger.<br/><br/>75/100"

","Want to see a great football movie here it is! The Longest Yard directed by Peter Segal. This a fantastic movie that will make you laugh until you cry. It stars Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds, it released into theaters in 2005. The movie was produced by ""Happy Madison"" film productions. I've noticed that Adam Sandler has been in a lot of movies produced by Happy Madison, and every one I saw was really good. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock make a good on- screen duo, splitting the major character roles in the movie. <br/><br/>The movie takes place in a prison camp where Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler), a former NFL quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is put in prison for a DUI for driving while he was carrying beer and taunting the police. He got put in charge of creating a football team of the inmates in the prison to compete against the guards in a semi-pro football game live on TV. Crewe met up with another inmate named Caretaker (Chris Rock.) Caretaker said he is terrible at football, so he decided to help Crewe help to form his team together. Lastly, he meets this former college and NFL coach named Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds.) Scarborough agreed to help Crewe collaborate with the football team to work the inmates into football shape. <br/><br/>I really liked this film over all because I love comedy and football all together. It really sticks out in my mind how Paul Crewe formed this football team with the inmates who never played football a day in their lives. It was impressed that he never gave up on them, and they never gave up on him. Likewise, the comedy stood out to me the most. I was surprised how funny the movie was when I first watched it. Almost every seen cracked me up, and I couldn't stop laughing. For example, how one of the character's clothes lined one of players and said, ""I think he sh** himself,"" The rest of the announcers and crowd said it as well, and I was laughing my head off. Lastly, how Turley said after Crewe decided to play the game, ""good, now I don't need to stab you."" Crewe was shocked and said, ""good to know."" <br/><br/>The characters really seemed realistic, I've noticed that because it didn't look like they took any part of acting out, and they used their own emotions and feelings during the movie. I cared about what happened to the actors. For example, the collaboration of plays between in the game. Also, Crewe's passion for the team to win instead of him throwing the game instead of repeating what he did in the past. This movie was made in 2005, so I expected all the visual effects to be how they should be in the movie. There were no technical aspects in the movie. The soundtracks for this movie fit together so well. I didn't know the names of the songs, but they were all very sports-like and made the scenes perfect. The story of the movie made it compelling because of the plot, the characters, and the game of football. Every aspect that was listed made the movie great.<br/><br/>The Longest Yard was a great movie. I recommend it to everyone who loves football and great comedy. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock make the movie perfect through their acting and the way they work with the co-stars. Also, the way throughout the movie how the characters learned to play football and work as a team, and never gave up. Lastly, the chemistry between all the actors in the movie, they've all worked together in other movies as well. They all tend to work together and like each other a lot. The Longest Yard is a movie that I would recommend to everyone."

","The Longest Yard isn't your typical Adam Sandler movie. Yes, it's got the typical crude humor but it takes a new twist into a blend of comedy and sports. The result, an odd mix of amusing nonsense with inspirational game play and beating the odds. With an incredible soundtrack, script, and acting you will find yourself laughing at every witty joke and just plain ridiculousness of each character. <br/><br/>Adam Sandler as Crewe, a former NFL quarter back accused of throwing a game, decided to steal his girlfriend's car and take it on a beer-driven joy ride, landing himself in a Texas Federal Prison. Being unanimously hated by everyone, Crewe is recruited by the Warden (James Cromwell) to help their guards football team. With threats from the guards if he declines, Crewe suggests an exhibition game against the inmates. Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and Caretaker (Chris Rock) take over the team of convicts with Crewe as the quarter back which makes for some hilarious recruitment tactics. <br/><br/>Overcoming the fact that they have a nice line up of gangs and ruthless inmates as their team, they do what they can to prepare for the big game against the guards. After all, they are inmates! Sabotaging the guards by switching steroids with estrogen is just one way this movie brings in the childish humor we all love. Despite the hilarious circumstances they find themselves in, the game is one for the record books. Any sport fan will love it, watching it as they would watch their favorite team on a Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we are presented with a diverse cast of characters. We have the stereotypical guards with big hats, the over exaggerated tough guys, and even the not-so-sexy cheerleaders. Bringing all these characters together makes for some gut-busting interactions. Cheeseburger Eddy (Terry Crews) is an inmate with the McDonalds hookup. He's got ""the fries that will cross your eyes."" His one-liners will leave you laughing and shaking your head because they are so bad it's just funny. <br/><br/>Adam Sandler does an incredible job of portraying the sarcastic and arrogant Crewe who never gives up. He really connects and embraces his role and it helps that he has a history of staring in comedies. With Crewe constantly getting pummeled by the guards, it gives us a sort of sympathetic response which leaves us cheering for the convicts the whole game. While doing the unthinkable, he brings together the worst of the worst convicts by sharing a similar hatred – the guards. Throughout the movie Sandler is constantly delivering sarcastic comments one after another. Overall, the Longest Yard either had amazing writers or Sandler is one clever actor. He delivers each line exactly how it should be and plays off of all the other characters creating great on screen chemistry. <br/><br/>The creators of Longest Yard also do an incredible job of music choices. Choosing songs that are all from the hip-hop and rap genre which perfectly accompany a prison environment and giving a 'pump-up' or 'pregame' vibe. This gives scenes such as when the team walks out of the locker room a dramatic entrance and gives the movie an overall essence of toughness. <br/><br/>All though Longest Yard isn't a very deep film, it is a great movie for those looking for a humorous plot with a suspenseful and unexpected turn of events. It brings a fresh blend of comedy and sports into one which will leave you laughing and satisfied."

","A remake of Robert Aldrich's 1974 film The Mean Machine, which starred Burt Reynolds, this version sees Peter Segal direct and Adam Sandler headlining. Also starring are Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell and William Fitchner.<br/><br/>One time gridiron superstar Paul Crewe, now disgraced, gets himself sent to a prison run by a gridiron fanatical warden. Coerced into being part of a match between the guards and the cons, Crewe has his work cut out to make a team out of misfits, runts and near idiots!<br/><br/>Adam Sandler has always proved divisive, and this film has proved to be no exception. Massively popular at the box office (over $100 million profit), it's a film that anyone with an aversion to Sandler should stay away from. I mean if by 2005 you haven't realised he's not for you then why would you watch this?<br/><br/>Coming from someone who absolutely adores the original film, I had no hesitation in watching this, I like Sandler and I don't mind remakes as I'm always intrigued to see how they pan out. This is full of prison stereotypes, close to the knuckle humour and meaty violence, but is it funny? From my perspective yes it is, very much so, with some of the dialogue sparkling and delivered with comedic grace by a fine cast. But that's me, others, as we know, don't feel the same. <br/><br/>The action is well put together by Segal, the convicts training sequences are great fun, while the main game that crowns the pic is exciting, dramatic and yes, great fun. The support slots contain more beef than an Aberdeen Angus stew, with the likes of Michael Irvin, Terry Crews, Steve Austin and Brian Bosworth fronting up, while David Patrick Kelly playing a weasel is never a bad thing. A lot of people loved it in 2005, I'm now one of their number. 7/10"
"merjones","10","0","1","17 November 2015"," Very fun
","The similarities between the British version and this film are obvious. The only essential difference is in the choice of sport since soccer has no popularity in the US, and therefore the choice fell on football. Although at the first glance you may think that this is a typical sports movie, but that is not true, because ""The Longest Yard"" is a collection of comedic fun dialogues, scenes and events that revolve around the game itself and its preparation. The cast in this is a great achievement. Central figures are Adam Sandler in his characteristic role and Burt Reynolds who starred in the original movie. The central duo has excellent support from Chris Rock Terry Crews, Bob Sapp and rapper Nelly. Even the star of American wrestling Dalip Singh appears on several occasions. Truly, a great team, that easily creates entertainment for the viewers."

","Paul Crewe (Sandler) was a former star quarterback, but was banned for life. He gets too drunk one night and steals his girlfriend's (Courtney Cox) car. He's busted for a DUI and sent to prison. The Warden asks him to assemble a football team to compete with his. The Warden gets more than he bargained for when Crewe's team is much better than expected. I really think this movie is as good as the original. It's got plenty of laughs, a decent script, and more importantly, it's entertaining. This is not one of Sandler's ""Paid vacation"" movies. There is a lot of thought put into this movie. They use the original's formula, but add their own touches as well to make an enjoyable combination. There is also some great football action as well. Football fans should be at least fairly impressed by some of it. My only big complaint is the crappy rap music. The performances are surprisingly fun. I'm a fan of Sandler's. He can be very funny when he wants to be, but he has been p**** me off a lot lately with the awful comedies he's churning out. He has become really lazy. That laziness is non-existent here. He's still Adam Sandler, but the passion is there. He's funny and makes for a fun lead. He's no Burt Reynolds, but I enjoyed him. Burt Reynolds pays tribute to the original by playing Nate Scarborough. He was a lot of fun and added presence to this movie. Chris Rock is actually amusing as Caretaker. His banter with Sandler was enjoyable. James Cromwell is excellent as The evil Warden. Nelly doesn't embarrass himself, delivering a decent performance. Wrestlers like Stone Cold, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, and The Great Khaili show up. Nash is hilarious. Rest of the cast is good. If you've seen the original, you'll know how this one ends.<br/><br/>I thought it was just as good as the original. What's not to like? You have laughs, action, football, among other things. If you like the original, I see no reason to not like this remake<br/><br/>7.2/10"

","The Longest Yard (2005) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Remake of the 1974 classic has Adam Sandler playing the quarterback who gets sent to prison where he gets involved in a football game between the guards and the convicts. If you've already seen the original movie then there's really nothing going on here that you're not going to see coming from a mile away. This remake pretty much uses the same story outline and we get the same twists throughout the film. With that said, overall I thought this was a fairly entertaining film even if it doesn't come anywhere close to the original. Sandler actually manages to be quite believable in his role as a former NFL quarterback who was accused of throwing a game (just like the original). Sandler can certainly deliver on the laughs but he manages to work very well with the supporting cast. This includes Chris Rock in his role as well as Burt Reynolds who of course was the star of the original. One wishes that he had been given a better role but it was still fun seeing him here. Another plus is that there are some pretty funny jokes aimed at the various groups of people inside the prison. There really aren't any mean moments or anything like that. Even the stuff dealing with the murder and racism inside the prison is toned down compared to the original movie and the majority of the stuff is just played for laughs. Being a Sandler film you can expect some crude humor, which there's plenty of but it's all done in good fun. There's a lot of things that missing from this film but the biggest thing is just the overall rawness that the original had. It was a pretty straight-forward and raw film where this one here is pretty much watered down."
"SeriousJest","5","0","1","6 September 2012"," Not a good movie...but it's a football movie!
","Don't get it twisted. I'm not saying that this is a good movie. It's not especially creative, and the dialogue is mediocre. But it's a football movie, and I'm a sucker for football. I'm so happy football season is back. Go Giants! Go Hurricanes! Go Check Out My WebCam Newton (my fantasy team)! As far as I'm concerned, you have to try really hard to make an unwatchable football movie. Hell, even Little Giants held my attention.<br/><br/>You'll get a few chuckles out of this one, but not many actual LOLs. More importantly, though, you'll see some cool football plays executed by Michael Irvin (who delivered a surprisingly-good acting performance), Nelly (who is actually an awesome athlete; I've seen him hang with pros in MTV Rock 'n Jock face-offs), Bill Goldberg, Terry Crews, Bill Romanowski, Steve Austin, and Brian Bosworth, with motivating background music, and ESPN ""Swami"" Chris Berman commentating. Given the amount of sports personalities and notable actors in this movie, it was underwhelming, and it's nowhere near as good as The Waterboy. Still, if this movie's on, it will hold your attention. Go Mean Machine!"
"StevePulaski","7","0","1","31 May 2012"," A Division II comedy
","One could call The Longest Yard remake one that was bound to happen and play more as a hilarious comedy rather than a dark, gritty picture. While there are some dark elements conveniently scattered throughout the film, it is safe to dub this an Adam Sandler comedy. Again, I'd rather have it succumb to this instead of one of Sandler's ""anti-character studies,"" but we won't even go there.<br/><br/>This is a remake of the Robert Aldrich film of the same name from 1974, but that note will undoubtedly have little importance to modern audiences. Sandler has taken the film and pretty much revamped it into a modern day take on the underdog formula. He plays Paul Crewe, a selfish former football player who was immediately blacklisted after ""shaving points,"" or in simple terms, purposely not covering the point spread on a given game. Crewe has become a careless louse, and after a recent run in with the law from stealing his wife's car to getting into a high speed chase on the freeway, he must do three years in the big house.<br/><br/>Crewe is harassed by Warden Hazen (Cromwell) to join the football guards' football team in prison, and despite his decline of the offer, he is manipulated into doing so by Hazen's threat of adding five years to his sentence for false accusations of attacking Captain Knauer (Fichtner). He rounds up his team of misfits including his close friend, nicknamed ""Caretaker"" (Rock) and the gentle giant Switowski (Sapp), along with the legendary coach Nate Scarborough (Reynolds). At first, everyone seems to be rather hasty of the idea, until they learn the prisoners will be facing the guards and perhaps get some much needed anger out of their system.<br/><br/>Something I noticed almost immediately; the film is abnormally cast, meaning a lot of actors you wouldn't think would be in a comedy football remake do a pretty commendable job. Most notably Chris Rock and very underrated rapper Nelly, who also wrote the song ""Here Comes the Boom"" especially for the film. The song is easily more memorable and impressive than the picture itself.<br/><br/>Sandler does a decent job, and the script seems rather potent and lively, at times almost having too much fun with the formula. My immediate problem with the film is this is more of a by-the-numbers, textbook take on the underdog football formula. Scenes of long, droning, and cliché training take place, not to mention the inevitable tragedy the team will face just before the big game and sporadic gay jokes litter the picture.<br/><br/>What rather elevates The Longest Yard is its quick comebacks and its unlikely talents utilized in the picture. It's nice to see the film pay respect to the screen legend Burt Reynolds, and even feature a well-composed collection of songs, but the film, as a whole, is long, dry, and conventional, and it winds up being a Division II take on Division I material.<br/><br/>Starring: Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, Chris Rock, James Cromwell, William Fichtner, and Nelly. Directed by: Peter Segal."

","The Longest Yard The Longest Yard is a funny movie with a good story line. The movie takes place in a county jail. There are some cool people in this jail that help out the Protagonist. <br/><br/>The movie starts out in a big, nice house with a huge party going on. Paul Crew (Adam Sandler) is sitting in his room, drinking, alone. He decided to take his girlfriends car out for a ride and gets arrested. Now, he is in a county with a Warden that really likes football. Crew used to be a Quarterback in the NFL, so the Warden makes him a deal. Crew has to put a football team together to play against the guards. Crew rounds up a team and they practice for a few weeks until the season for the guards starts. They go up to a high school in Texas. The stands are full of people and highly skilled riflemen to shoot the convicts if they try to escape. The game starts and Crews team starts to win, the Warden doesn't like that. So the Warden threatens crew with the murder of Caretaker. Caretaker is one of Crews friends who got murdered in Crews cell. The Warden makes a deal with Crew that if he throws the game then he will not charge crew with the murder.<br/><br/>Crew is a nice guy who just wants to get out of jail and doesn't like people messing with him. He decides it's a smart idea to take out one of the biggest guys in the jail, so that no one else will mess with him. The Warden does not like Crew, because Crew does not follow his rules at all. The Warden is just a stuck up, mean, quick tempered old guy. No one really likes the Warden even the guards don't like him.<br/><br/>The movie was made with a sense of humor in almost every scene. The only part that was sad was when Caretaker died. The rest of the movie was very, very funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor, or anyone who likes football cause that's what this whole movie is about."

Adam Sandler, Chris Rock and the rest of the cast did a great job of keeping us laughing, while keeping us rooting for the inmates. I know it may sound weird to cheer for convicts, over prison guards, but as the movie progressed I just wanted to see the prison guards crushed. Many people have said it was nowhere near as good as the original, but the truth is that it was not a remake but a homage to the movie. I watched this movie, and then again about 3 three times, it was just that good.

Confused? You shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler makes a decent job as portraying the all-American superstar gone wrong in this remake of the Burt Reynolds '70s movie. Sandler, like Reynolds rarely stretches his acting and it felt like a vision of what Sandler's life would be like if he had not made a living making movies.<br/><br/>The difference between the two films, for me, however, seemed that the original attempted to educate people about the complexities of American Football. The remake assumed a knowledge about rules and scoring systems, yet at the same time decided that keeping the scoring system simple made for an understanding. The original had missed kicks etc. This one keeps the more technical aspects such as the drop goal and the safety kept back in the locker room.<br/><br/>The sports clips are well made and the convicts feel more realistic. The original tough guys lacked a certain menace, whereas people liked Dulip Singh bring an all too real physical presence. In addition, the guards are more physical and commanding.<br/><br/>On the negative side, Cloris Leachman should have not stooped so low for a paycheck. She's better than that. Why Rob Schneider suddenly appears is also a mystery? I guess he replaces Chris Rock as the comedy provider.<br/><br/>In the original, Paul Crewe spends time in the swamps before caving in, whereas this time, it is time in the hole. In the swamp, you really felt the punishment, whereas the film failed to portray the hardships of the hole and the desert in which he was detained.<br/><br/>I am always critical of remakes. Why? because they often fail to produce anything new and often detract from the vision or the impact of the original. Fortunatly, this is a remake worth making, if not to put the abysmal Vinnie Jones' Mean Machine into the relegation zone."

","I have seen this movie more than 5 times and i enjoyed it every time. The start of the movie is fantastic as well as the ending. This movie was very good and i recommend it for people above 12, as some of the jokes are quite racist. This movie starts out with Adam Sandler being with his girlfriend at a party, and then stealing her car and crashing it into police cars. He gets charged for driving while under the influence and is sent to a prison because the warden wants him to teach Football skills. Then he starts to get a prison team to play against the guards, in the process Adam Sandler's best friend gets killed by a bomb. In the end the inmates win against the guards even though the guard threatened Adam Sandler."

","Never saw the original. But this remake with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock is entertaining enough to keep you enthralled. Sandler, of course, is a has-been quarterback who gets thrown in jail after leading police on a high-speed chase and being a little too cocky for his own good. Now he has to quarterback the prison team to victory over the guards. Probably one of the more entertaining things about this movie is that you watch all the ESPN lackeys and they're just as laughably pathetic as they are every Sunday in the fall. Michael Irvin acts like he still plays for the Cowboys dynasty and Sean Salisbury continues his ""I've got a know-it-all analyst gig at ESPN even though I was a journeyman NFL quarterback"" shtick. There are a few twists to keep you interested. As a football fan who's never really been too into football movies, this one is probably one of the better ones."

"Isaac5855","7","0","2","13 July 2006"," A Respectful and Entertaining Remake
","I was initially very wary of seeing the remake of THE LONGEST YARD. The original film is a classic and one of my absolute favorite films in the world and there is no way I thought Adam Sandler or anyone else could do it justice, but I have to admit that this remake was a pleasant surprise. I found this 2005 remake of the 1974 classic to be a respectful and affectionate valentine to the original film with very few changes in the original story. As a matter of fact, executive producer Sandler had the screenplay tightened up from the original so that the audience is brought to the main story in a more direct manner than we were with the original. Crewe gets his order to organize the team from the warden during their first meeting in this film, which happens later in the first film. If you can accept Sandler as a pro football player then accepting the rest of this breezy and entertaining remake is no problem. Sandler delivers a nicely modulated performance that worked for me and Chris Rock, as always, steals every scene he's in as Caretaker. James Cromwell is acceptable as the slimy Warden, though he wasn't anywhere near as slimy as the late Eddie Albert was in the original. Sandler again pays homage to the film by casting its original star, Burt Reynolds, as Nate Scarborough, the role played by Michael Conrad in the original and even beefs the part up a little and Reynolds makes every moment on screen count. Sandler cleverly cast former pro football players and WWF wrestlers as various guards and convicts including Michael Irvin, Kevin Hall, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Goldberg. Hip hopper Nelly also shines as a barefoot running back. All in all, a respectful remake that doesn't diminish the gloss of the original but manages to stand on its own as solid entertainment."

","I confess I've never seen the original '74 flick, but I found this version from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions to be a pretty good time. Sandler as the disgraced ex-football hero, plays it straight and understated keeping the character grounded, likable yet not without his personal demons. The inmates, the guards and the ever corrupt prison warden are all well cast, with Chris Rock, James Cromwell, and Reynolds (star of the original '74 flick) all turning in appropriately complimentary performances. Some of the most entertaining and memorable moments, however, belong to lesser known actors, without whom this film would've lost much of it's charm. We love the 'ol ""underdog story"" here in the states and we get just that with this film, ultimately a typical feel-good American movie with some decent laughs. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours, but nothing beyond."
"mentalcritic","8","0","1","30 April 2006"," Underrated
","After reading Roger Ebert's review of this remake, I tend to believe that one's view of a film is skewed somewhat by the end of the cinematic bell curve they lean toward. Ebert, for example, lives to review films like The Godfather or The Empire Strikes Back, and his perspective on films that achieve less than these milestones in history reflects this. Me, I am very much at the opposite end of the scale. I view films like Ghosts Of Mars or From Justin To Kelly and see all kinds of cinematic delights, mostly in guessing how the makers will screw up next. Now, while I was expecting neither extreme from The Longest Yard, I did not expect it to be as enjoyable as it turned out to be. Easily Sandler's best film since Happy Gilmore, The Longest Yard sets out to do one thing, namely to make the viewer laugh, and it does so quite well. Others have commented that it is not the original and we should all get used to that. I agree. I have seen both remakes of The Longest Yard without having seen the original. If the original is better reflected by Mean Machine, then I would even hazard a guess that this particular remake is better.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest hurdle for this film is selling Adam Sandler as a star quarterback. In a sport where two metres in height is often the minimum requirement for a professional career, Sandler does have a hard sell. Instead, he chooses to emphasise the has-been aspect of his character, playing up the drunken antics until one is ready to believe that yes, this obnoxious moron really did make a living throwing a ball from one end of the field to the other. The opening scene is calculated specifically for this purpose, and in the sense that it suspends disbelief, it is a success. The pace slows a bit when we are establishing the prison, where the character finds his notoriety more of a hindrance than a blessing. Missing from this remake is the ""you had everything they would give an arm for and threw it away"" that was so memorable in Mean Machine, but this remake makes up for that in more crafty, subtle ways. Also of great benefit is the characterisations, painted in far broader strokes than the British remake. It helps to distinguish the characters a little.<br/><br/>Some would say that the Adam Sandler routine gets in the way of the story, but I truly believe he enhances it. Sandler works best when his character has a second or third dimension. Granted, attempts to graft these dimensions onto his character have backfired before (Big Daddy and 50 First Dates spring to mind). But Sandler and the script he is working from are working in sync rather than against one another, and the scenes are integrated together rather than seemingly cobbled from different films. Other unlikely heroes pepper the cast, with Chris Rock in particular standing out as the only cast member who looks less likely to be an American football player than Adam Sandler. Burt Reynolds shows up for no readily apparent reason other than including someone who was in the original, but he too makes the viewer believe in the role. The myriad of small roles portrayed by men so large that crane shots are required to keep their heads in frame with those of the stars are one-note, but oh what a nice note it is.<br/><br/>About the only real problem I have with this remake is that I had some expectations which weren't met. The original has a reputation as a social satire, whereas this remake is about as deep as a puddle. Once the first layer is peeled away, there is little going on underneath. It's just that the first layer is so hilarious at times that this hardly matters. Even Courtney Cox is better than her usual self here, providing setup for the introduction that hints she may have a future in real comedy. Chris Rock even manages to get in almost a solid hour of screen time without being annoying. Just as hilariously bad films have to happen by accident, The Longest Yard is the kind of film that seems to have just come together naturally. Adam Sandler fans will find much to enjoy here, although he restrains the more obnoxious side of his schtick for obvious reasons. It is also a credit to him that he does not hog the spotlight, instead sharing it with his co-stars or foils, which in turn allows the characters he is bouncing off the appropriate level of development to be funny.<br/><br/>On a scale of one to ten, I gave The Longest Yard circa 2005 an eight. It is nowhere near the same sport as classics like The Godfather, but it was never meant to be. Instead, it simply tries to deliver a good laugh, and succeeds for the most part. It shows that Adam Sandler's pool of comedic inspiration might not be totally dried out just yet. See it with a couple of friends and a keg of beer."

","My Better Half has been raving about this film for some time and so it was that I ended up spending damn near the rest of my store credit getting this on DVD. I'd be lying if I said that I was enthusiastic as movies and American football tend to go together about as well as Naomi Campbell and Spanish housekeepers. But despite a blip with one film which I still don't like, her recommendations have usually hit the right spot so I wasn't too bothered. And believe it or not, she's done it again! Perhaps she should get into the movie reviewing business, even if her typing needs improvement! <br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a former NFL star who has fallen on hard times. Kicked out of the league for throwing a game and busted for drink driving (on national TV), he finds himself in a Texan dustbowl prison under the supervision of a football-mad warden (James Cromwell) who quickly conjures up a plan. He needs to get his team of sadistic guards up to speed and quickly so he arranges a game between the guards and the inmates, believing it to be little more than a one-sided massacre. But Crewe gradually assembles a worthy opposition of convicts with the help of fellow cons Caretaker (Chris Rock) and Coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and realising that they could have a game on their hands, both teams resort to every trick in the book (as well as some new ones) in order to win. Cameo fans will be in seventh Heaven with at least three wrestlers, Nelly, Michael Irvin and Courtney Cox all in there somewhere.<br/><br/>First of all, this is a sports movie and therefore, it is as hackneyed and ridden with clichés as they come. Performances are varied, as you'd expect from such a rag-bag cast of actors, rappers and wrestlers but nobody tops Burt ""The Ham"" Reynolds for the worst performance. The good news, however, is that despite some dodgy delivery and an unashamedly predictable script, the film still works despite all the odds stacked against it. The comic touches hit all the right marks (even if some of the gags are somewhat crude) and the rivalry between guards and prisoners descends into an entertaining all-out war. But although this is basically the same as ""The Mean Machine"", you still leave the movie with that uplifting feeling that most sports movies strive for but rarely attain.<br/><br/>So can I recommend ""The Longest Yard""? Yes, I feel I can. By it's very nature, it isn't going to change the world or be remembered as a classic but it does what it does very well indeed. Like I say, it ticks the box for every prison movie and every football movie cliché in existence but that doesn't stop ""The Longest Yard"" from being a fine example of a sporting comedy. Let's face it, name another one. Personally, this strikes me as being a perfect rental movie in which you can watch and enjoy it but probably forget about it the next day. So it's good but not what I'd call a classic. Think of it as a touchdown conversation instead of a two-pointer."

","I saw The Longest Yard after watching Two for the Money last week and as I thought we have a bit of a sports theme going ,The Longest Yard just seemed to be in the right direction to follow . Being that Hollywood is going through a rather annoying stage of doing remakes , sequels and prequels so there was something to look out for . I have never really seen the original movie with Burt Reynolds in it so I thought that I should really approach this film with an open mind as it is not really my normal genre of films. However It really did seem to like the film and what it had to offer . Adam Sandler up grades him-self from his waterboy days to something a lot more enjoyable like this and you really feel your-self routing on for him as the film progress's forward but this by no means his best performance as it basically still mirrors his previous performances . Chris Rock provides a few decent laughs especially in the beginning where we meet his character . Nick Turturo also is a good laugh to watch especially when his true nature is shown on the film in the hall . Burt Reynolds plays the wise old pillar of support pretty well not to mention wwe wrestlers Goldberg,Steve Austin,and Kevin Nash I found them to play their part pretty dame well !!! Nelly was also good as he made use of what he had to work with . The warden and guards were all a right bunch of A!sholes , as at times you found their sadistic treatment funny but also shocking at times , Courtney Cox did look hot in that pink dress but sorry honey ! You still kind of remind of your FRIENDS days . The good thing about this film was that the plot kept going along rather smoothly rather than dragging along , the laughs were consistent but nothing making you fall out of your seat funny , with a few good moments to talk about i.e , the chase in the Bentley and Colenel Sanders from The Waterboy . I had my doubts about this movie but it ended up being one of those movies where you can just watch and forget about the out-side world for a while . For comedy and Adam Sandler fans worth a purchase but highly recommended rental . All in all nothing new or fantastic but still a good laugh . <br/><br/>LONGEST YARD 7.5 OUT OF 10 <br/><br/>THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT ."

","I am not burdened with having seen the original 31 years ago, so was able to enjoy the DVD with my two 16 year olds. There is absolutely nothing ground breaking here. Everything has been covered before in prison movies and various sports movies. The ending is fairly predictable. Those of us who enjoy seeing it are fans of Adam Sandler, fans of Burt Reynolds, and fans of old-fashioned slapstick humor. My only complaint was the rather heavy amount of off-color language and sexual references for a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is Paul Crewe, former pro football QB accused of throwing a game. He ends up in prison after taking his girlfriend's car for a ride, getting stopped by cops acting on her stolen car report, then running from the cops, thinking as a celebrity of sorts he would not get into trouble. While in prison, he agrees to put together a team to play an inmate football game against the guards.<br/><br/>Much of the middle of the movie is about recruiting various large and tough prisoners for the team. Many were reluctant at first, but various insults from the guards motivated them. Chris Rock became the assistant and they called him Caretaker. Burt Reynolds, former Heisman winner, helped out as Coach Nate Scarborough.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. When the big game came, the guards scored two quick touchdowns because the inmates were channeling all their anger at getting back at the mean guards. However, after Crewe organizes them a bit, they come back to tie at halftime. During halftime, the warden had a private conversation with Crewe. Not wanting the guards to lose, he gave Crewe an ultimatum -- throw the game or face blame for the prison death of the Caretaker and spend the rest of his life in prison. At first he cooperates, then sees the disappointment of his prisoner teammates, confesses to them that he had thrown the pro game, vowed not to do another and, in the last seconds personally scores the 2-point conversion to win the game by 1 point."

Paul Crewe went through his life as a sports hero, but it all changed when he was caught in a bad situation with some worse people. After Crewe fixed a big time football game, he started to give up on life. However, prison turned out to be the best thing that ever happened for Crewe, because he began to care for people again.

Seeing cruel prison guards obviously on steroid diets show fear to the prisoners they tortured for so long in a game that they have dominated for years is fantastic.

","I'd agree. Critics all over the board panned this film and it nearly tripled the box office earning of the critically lauded ""Cinderella Man"", which only seemed to get the attention of movie critics. It's almost unfair to compare movies to the original, because if they tried to do a remake, I'm willing to bet many of the complainers would gripe about how it's too much like the original and contains no authenticity of its own. This featured a couple SNL veterans who helped make the show a hot ticket back in the early 90's, and certainly gave us a reason to laugh our butts off in a summer season that sank. Yeah, it won't win any Academy Awards, but I don't think I've seen this many sports celebrity cameos in quite some time, with 2 former NFL players and 4 ESPN journalists."

Damon from Friday after Next, rapper Nelly, and even the funny Latino guy from The Waterboy (""You Can Do It""). Chris Rock shines as a very funny, albeit somewhat racially motivated caretaker.

"DICK STEEL","7","0","2","3 September 2005"," A Nutshell Review: The Longest Yard
","The Longest Yard is one of many remake movies that Hollywood has churned out in recent years. Others did well, like Charlie's Angels, while some fumbled, like Bewitched. This Adam Sandler movie, helm-ed by director Peter Segal (who also worked on Sandler's Fifty First Dates), managed to keep afresh the already familiar material.<br/><br/>It was a perky (heh) start to the movie, with No Doubt's (and of course Gwen Stefani's vocals) starting the movie, keeping in mind that MTV Films also had a hand in this, it isn't surprising that the audience will be treated to various pop, rock and hip hop music. Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a forgotten, down and out quarterback infamous for throwing in the towel and rigging a game. He's sick of life with his control freak fiancÃ©e (did Courteney Cox undergo a boob job?), and got arrested for dangerous drink driving when she reported he stole her Bentley.<br/><br/>Well, we have to thrown our protagonist into prison to get the game going, right? Unfortunately for Crewe, the prison guards are a bunch of sadists, and fortunately (depending on how you look at it) the warden is a football fanatic, who propositions Crewe to set up a team amongst the prisoners for his guards to have a practice tune up match against.<br/><br/>Most of the movie then dwelled on recruitment and training, as with all sports movies, the recruits are all misfits, which is supposed to provide some comedic moments. Scenes in which Crewe handpicks prisoners according to their traits (aggression, speed etc) were formulaic, but extremely fun. An addition to the fold is actor Chris Rock as Caretaker, the man with links on the inside and outside; the resident smuggler. As with all remake movies, there should be the complimentary actor from the earlier film, and here we have two, the more recognizable one being Burt Reynolds as the coach, who played the protagonist in the original.<br/><br/>It's kind of ironic that in prison films, the line between ""good and evil"" are somewhat blurred, with good characters having improper morals, and the bad characters turning out to be likable underdogs. For all its funny set pieces, the humour seemed somewhat subdued, not overly slapstick, or worse, feeling forced. You know what's coming, but the delivery was enough to at least make you smile.<br/><br/>What crowned the filmed was the football game at the end. Shot wonderfully with the right moments to break into slow-motion or high speed action, it managed to convey the contact sport accurately, and with excitement thrown into the mix. You will really be rooting for the Mean Machines, as do the transgender inmate cheerleaders and Rob Schneider.<br/><br/>But the main theme was on obtaining, losing, and maintaining Respect, and the exploration of camaraderie amongst the boys in the hood. Standing out, in a somewhat cringeworthy manner at times, was when Crewe persuades a bunch of basketball playing inmates to join his team, as do some parts in the end game.<br/><br/>This movie should appeal to the fans of sports films, one filled with plenty of physical contact, moments of humour, and a predictable finale (which of course is known to those who watched the original)."

","Let it be known that I would be one of the first to stand up against all the Hollywood remakes. This is actually the first time I've wanted to see a remake, and I caught it the weekend it came out. And I must say, I was entertained the whole time. I think if you look at this movie as a football comedy, and not try to compare it to the Burt Reynolds version, you'll enjoy it. I think a lot of people are turned off by this movie for that reason, and because they see this as being nothing more than ""The Waterboy Pt. 2"". But it's not, despite the cameo by Rob Schneider (sp?), which honestly, I could've done without. The characters could've been a little more developed...I mean, why should we root for the ""Mean Machine"", other than the fact that the guards were really corrupt? With no character development, it just seemed like we were rooting for the lesser of two evils. The library racism scene w/Nelly was a nice start, but there could've been a few more scenes like that.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a pretty entertaining movie, once you realize that 1) it's not the Burt Reynolds version, and 2) it's not trying to be. I give it 7/10. If you're a football fan, you'll like this movie. The game will probably get you energized, especially the last moments of the game. I usually don't like a bunch of gratuitous split-screens and camera shots, but for a movie like this, it works (in this case, it almost seems like a homage to the original).<br/><br/>7/10"
"jmille42","7","0","2","13 July 2005"," a very funny remake
","Adam Sandler leads an all-star cast to pull together a very funny remake of The Longest Yard, originally created in 1974 starring Burt Reynolds. Sandler plays Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe, a former quarterback of the professional football league. Crewe finds himself behind bars as he leads police on a high speed drunken chase. All bets are off as Sandler is forced to pull together a group of lawless inmates to face the guards in what Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) calls a ""tune-up"" game.<br/><br/>Sandler once again snags a hit with a sports film, with other successes being Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy. Fellow SNL alum Chris Rock takes on the role of Caretaker, the lovable team manager, whose wise cracks and racial dialogue keep you laughing from first to last shot. The biggest acting surprise of all comes in the form of Michael Irvin, who has no films to his credit, plays the very talented wide receiver (shock) Deacon Moss. I suppose all the time in front of the camera on ESPN Sunday mornings has paid off.<br/><br/>I would sum up The Longest Yard as a ""pick me up"" summer laugh riot to make up for a season of ""not so funny"" films. This is one of those classic underdog stories that climaxes with one of the finest theatrical football games I've ever seen."

"Buddy-51","4","0","2","9 July 2005"," undistinguished remake
","In what is fast turning out to be one of the biggest years ever for cinematic retreads (doesn't anybody out in Hollywood have any NEW ideas anymore?), ""The Longest Yard"" is the second remake of a Robert Aldrich film to hit theaters in the past six months. The first, ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" was released last December. Now all we can ask is, can the ""new and improved"" version of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?,"" starring Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, be far behind?.<br/><br/>In this new edition of the '70's hit, Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, an ex-quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who was banished from the league six years earlier for allegedly shaving points off a game. When he is arrested for stealing his girlfriend's car, Crewe is sent to a Texas prison run by a diabolical warden and his cadre of sadistic guards. The warden, a football fan from way back, enlists Crewe's expertise in putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a ""friendly little game"" of intramural football. The caveat is that this ragtag team must be good enough to make a decent show of things but not good enough to beat their opponent or there will be hell to pay. Thus, the game becomes an inverted, high stakes encounter pitting the forces of good (the prisoners) against the forces of evil (the penal authorities).<br/><br/>Thirty years have elapsed since I saw the original version of this film, so I don't feel particularly qualified to evaluate how this new one stacks up against the old. I will say, however, that this ""Yard"" faces some serious problems at the get-go with the casting of Sandler in the lead role. Burt Reynolds, who played the protagonist in the original film and who gets a fairly good-sized role in this one as well, was at least credible as a man who might have been a professional football player. But Adam Sandler!? Come to think of it, Sandler is probably more believable as an NFL legend than he is as a hot underwear spokes-model, an absurdity we are also asked to swallow - but the less said about that the better.<br/><br/>There isn't much to recommend this latest edition of ""The Longest Yard."" The plotting is predictable, the characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes and the humor obvious and lowbrow. And the final showdown - i.e. the big game - goes on for so long that most of the tension inherent in the material simply drains away long before the closing credits.<br/><br/>Perhaps the saddest aspect of this movie is watching Cloris Leachman making a complete and utter fool of herself playing a grotesque, beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed with seducing the young Mr. Crewe. Some sights we should just not be asked to face in this lifetime."

","I generally like Adam Sandler movies. I've gotten used to his crudeness and vulgarity. I don't accept them, and I'm sure he would be funnier without them, but I expect his personal habits to be gross and disgusting. I also expect him to have some redeeming quality, being nice to some kid or kind to some less fortunate old woman or something. I don't think Adam Sandler stars in this movie. I think he goes through the motions as though some body-snatcher had taken over for him. He has the same predictable ending where the bad guy decides to be good at the last minute, but the lead role could have been played by an extra.<br/><br/>***** Spoiler: don't read this is you haven't seen the movie ***** <br/><br/>As for Chris Rock's part in the movie, when he dies and they had their little memorial service for him, I wasn't sad at all. In fact, I was kind of glad he was gone. During the big game, I hoped Adam Sandler would be killed off so Burt Reynolds could play quarterback and save the day. That would have made a much better ending."
"nowonmai42","1","0","2","2 July 2005"," Now if only Adam Sandler would make a football movie...
","It's a measure of how truly terrible is ""The Longest Yard"" that star Adam Sandler, no stranger to awful, awful movies, seems throughout to want desperately to be elsewhere. I've never been a fan of most of Sandler's films, but seeing him stuck in a movie this cut-rate, lazy, and uninspired almost makes me feel sorry for the guy. He's always tended toward the lowbrow, but drags himself through this abomination with the apparent realization that such crap is beneath even his meager standards. A film in which a football player pops steroids from a bottle labeled ""STEROIDS"" unambiguously reveals its regard for its audience. This is by far one of the year's worst movies, and it's only June.<br/><br/>I didn't laugh once during this film. Not a single time. Not at the crew of cross-dressing, cheer leading prison bitches, not at the 300lb black guy with the IQ and demeanor of a little girl, and certainly not at poor Chris Rock, trotted out to highlight yet again the rib-tickling differences between blacks and whites. ""The Longest Yard"" can't come up with even one character worth caring about in any regard, neither through sympathy nor laughter.<br/><br/>Sandler fills the unlikely role of former NFL MVP Paul Crewes. Already on parole from a point-shaving scandal, he's soon a poor man's Cool Hand Luke in a southern pokie after leading police on a drunken, high speed chase. Conveniently for Crewes, this particular prison is essentially just a side show to the obsession of the warden; the ""semi-pro"" guards' football team. Crewes is soon quickly enlisted to head an inmate squad on which the guards can beat up in a pre-season scrimmage. Hilarity ensues. At least that's the idea.<br/><br/>A consistently, even occasionally funny movie could be forgiven for presenting a prison in which inmates can do whatever they feel like as long as it's football-related. ""The Longest Yard"" seems to be shooting for an ""Animal House in leg irons""-type dynamic, but here characters who are able to break into the warden's office to peruse prisoner files and wander wherever they want are simply requirements of the ridiculous plot. Are there no rules or guards anywhere? Oh, that's right; they're too busy training for the big game against the ragtag team of cons, which of course is being nationally televised on ESPN 2, complete with snipers on the stadium perimeter and color commentary by Chris Berman.<br/><br/>Sandler at least seems to be enjoying himself in most of his movies, regardless of their dubious merit. Yet here he's withdrawn enough to qualify as a straight man, which is certainly not why he gets 20 million per. ""The Longest Yard has the half-assed reek of a contractual obligation. If it can't even muster the enthusiasm of its star, it certainly can't ask for more from us. The only thing more disgraceful than this turd is the killing it will surely make at the box office."

Even the British remake with Vinny Jones was better than this. Even they managed to work in the whole ""mean machine"" name in a lot better than the shoe-horn attempt of this huge pile of steaming crap. Stone Cold Steve Austin hardly appears, how he managed to hurt his hamstring in the football scenes in beyond me. We see him play for all of about 5 minutes. Do the guards not bother with their field goals because we don't see them in the 1st half (in fact we only get to see the con's 2nd field goal during the whole 1st half). Bill Goldberg just magically appears in the film from no-where when the hunt for players starts. Kevin Nash, he's here - he's there, he's pointless. How did the prisoners get Estrogen in an all male facility? And if Mr Nash was taking steroids like candy like the film shows it would have taken months of Estrogen to upset his hormonal balance. Is it legal for Bill Goldberg to wear the letter X on his jersey on the field of play and not a number?<br/><br/>Why isn't Sandler sent to a Federal Prison? He's already on federal parole for match fixing/points shaving. He then commits DUI, resists arrest, damages police property, flees arrest, leaves the scene of an accident, has an open liquor container. I'm not going to list Grand Theft Auto because thats a bullsh1t charge. How did people NOT notice Courtney Cox Arquette in this film (and since when did she get breasts?)<br/><br/>On the whole this film is a POINTLESS remake. I assume Happy Madison is Sandlers company? Burt Reynolds should never have attached himself to this, he's lost a lot of credibility - however much he had left.<br/><br/>Chris Rock is the best thing in this film and he's f()cking awful so that's saying something.<br/><br/>In a film that's a remake of a remake I laughed once. Lets see - the longest yard 1974 (US) which was sold as the mean machine in the UK, remade as a UK mean machine then remade again into this huge pile of camel dung again as the longest yard.<br/><br/>Now I did some checking up, Richard Kiel aka jaws from James Bond was in the original and he was in Happy Gilmore too, couldn't Adam Sandler persuade him to be in this as well?<br/><br/>Adam Sandler, find something better to do with your time.

The reason for me being reluctant to watch it is that the typical comedy by Adam Sandler features him being a total jerk and then yelling uncontrollably which makes the audience laugh incredibly hard.<br/><br/>I'm not saying he doesn't do other things in his films, but generally that's the impression I get, and it could be funny, but the problem is that it gets played out over time. I'm not here to comment on Adam Sandler though, there's other people like Chris Rock, Nelly, etc. etc.<br/><br/>So back from digressing, the film is about a football game between the prison guards and the prisoners. That's the basics, and while this is not generally funny, it manages. It is incredibly funny at times with little shocking things twists and turns that generally are needed within comedies.<br/><br/>I suppose I can say that this film went nowhere really. There's no overall moral (well there is one, but it's not strong enough to even be remembered).

"saxman12","3","0","2","9 June 2005"," Terrible Movie
","The Longest Yard was a movie with great potential. It had two of the hottest comedians around in Sandler and Rock, a recognizable name for the older crowd in Burt Reynolds, an excellent villain in James Cromwell(watch LA Confidential if you don't believe me), and finally it was based off of a pretty good original (which starred Burt Reynolds). Despite all this the sum of the parts was disappointing. Here is why.<br/><br/>The plot holes are enormous. Sandler does not look anything like a football player for obvious reasons of stature. The scene where the guards try to pick a fight with Nelly is ridiculous because when he doesn't fight back the guards don't do anything. Earlier in the movie Sandler is beaten up by the guards without picking a fight and they were looking to injure Nelly. They didn't want to injure Sandler.<br/><br/>Many of the jokes were way overused and stale. Cheeseburger Eddie was not funny at all and his putting a burger on Rock's grave was almost insulting. The male cheerleaders in drag was not very funny the FIRST time they showed them. By the end of the movie the cheerleaders had been on the screen for at least 10 minutes. The football player on estrogen was funny however. But only for the first few times. They just kept showing it and showing it. Keeping with the overuse theme, the use of the slow-motion technique. The first time with Nelly running was cool. After that is was boring. I think that movie would have been another 10 minutes shorter if that was taken out.<br/><br/>Finally the script was just bad. It gave Rock nothing to sink his teeth into. Sandler looked like he was bored half the time. And many scenes were just not needed (the secretary who has the hots for Sandler, the Brucie character's on again of again relationship with the lead male cheerleader).<br/><br/>I will admit i laughed at some scenes. The cameo by Rob Schneider was funny. The whole scene leading up to Sandler's arrest was funny. I also enjoyed the cameos by the football players and announcers. Irvin and Chris Berman especially. But it just wasn't enough to save the movie. I'm saying this as a big fan of both Sandler and Rock. I love Waterboy and Happy Gilmore, but The Longest Yard is nowhere near up to the standards of those two."

","Paul Crewe (Chris Sandler) is a former American Football Player who fell from grace because of cheating. After violating a parole order, he is sent to jail, to one of the most brutal and most corrupt prisons which would not be found in any government or UN chart. After taking a few beatings from the guards, Crewe announced his plan that would bail him out of prison: He'll form a team made of Convicts that will rival the Guards. With the help of a Con known only as Caretaker (Chris Rock), He sets up a team that is totally unskilled, unfit, and inexperienced. But with the help of former Am. Football player Nate Scarabourgh, and a Con Basketball squad led by Nelly, this ragtag team becomes a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Adam Sandler is recognised for creating films that audiences love and critics tend to dislike. This formula is still intact. It was a nice thing to include Burt Reynolds--who played the main part in the 1974 original-- in the cast, which gives the film some style and substance. Sandler and Rock also give impressions with their adequate sense of humour that fit the movie perfectly well. Rapper and ""Bad Boys"" star Nelly also contributes to the franchise as a the captain of an unofficial Basketball team who joins Sandler's cause, and his scenes are some of the best and the funniest of the movie.<br/><br/>But there are several drawbacks: the movie is so full of clichÃ©s that people tend to feel a bit frustrated. The slow motion Rap walk of Nelly's squad and the transsexual cheer-leaders are just a few examples. The supporting characters are basically flat and one dimensional and are there just to serve the leads' purposes of making a Dream team. The play scenes are usually fun, but they are so commonplace--and also so aggressive-- that you feel like you're watching a BMW or Toyota commercial.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is better (and currently more successful) than the critically-unacclaimed Waterboy (which was a surprise hit) and improves on some that movie's flaws. The relentlessly fast pace and rush, as well as the Sandler-Rock-Reynolds trio make this movie stand out from your average sports comedy. I'm satisfied with one viewing of this film (I saw it in the US, since it won't hit the UK until October 2005).<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

","This adaptation was great. It was awesome that Burt Reynolds was part of the cast as well.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a reason to see this movie just let me say: Adam Sandler and Chris Rock! This is their first movie together.<br/><br/>This movie had it all. It was funny, it had hard hitting sports sequences. This movie will definitely go in my DVD collection when it comes out.<br/><br/>The plot is similar to the original movie, but they made a lot of changes to make it more modern and since Burt Reynolds was in the movie he apparently approved.<br/><br/>This movie is a great movie, their is a little language in the movie so if you have sensitive ears, be prepared. But it was funny to me.<br/><br/>The most surprising to me was Nelly. He is actually a great natural actor. I definitely think he has the potential to the next Will Smith. He has the acting skills down much earlier in his career than Will did. The ladies love him, guys adore him! Oh, that's L.L. Cool J. But you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie I haven't laughed this hard in a movie in a while so check this movie out. I've read a lot of reviews here on IMDb and they are really hating on this movie, I think they missed the demographic in which this movie was targeted. It is an MTV production, don't forget that. If you are not a MTV person, then the movie ideally wasn't targeted for you. But if you are not a MTV person and you like to have little fun at the box office then this is by far the best choice for all of the comedy movies currently playing. And next to Star Wars EIII this is your best bet for a great time at the movies!"

","Adam Sandler is funniest when he plays a normal person and not an over the top character. The Waterboy and Little Nicky were terrible because Sandler wasn't funny, but like Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy, Adam plays a normal guy who says and does funny things. The only problem with this film is that nearly every joke has been done before in other Adam Sandler movies, while this coupled with the fact this is a re-make completely destroys any originality this film has, it did do the IN-original parts in a way that still makes them funny. And it had a good story to back its self up which makes it better than some of the other comedies out there.<br/><br/>Now for what makes this movie really great and that is Peter Segal's directing. Every movie he makes I notice his spot on camera direction more and more. In this movie he used music to set moods better than in any comedy movie I've ever seen and I've always said that even if the movie is horrible, if the director does a good job with the camera you are still entertained till the end. (Kinda like Troy or The Patriot.) I enjoyed this movie from and entertainment standpoint only. It's not Adam Sandler's best, but it's definitely not one of his worst."
"r2good","9","0","2","1 June 2005"," A very entertaining movie!
","I think that the critics were much too harsh in their assessment of this movie. Of course, it's not possible to do a re-make EXACTLY like the original. That would be boring, but this one had enough similarities and differences to make it enjoyable. It had its own personality, and I enjoyed it. The cameo appearances by Burt Reynolds and Ed Lauter were welcomed, and this movie made me appreciate how much I dislike Brian Bosworth as a football player, as an actor, and as a person. The Kansas Cty Star gave it only 1-1/2 stars out of 4. I would rate it three and a half of a possible 4 stars...no doubt about it. The only suggestion that I would make would be to go into more detail about how the inmates were to inflict physical pain upon the guards. It's also a shame that Eddie Albert couldn't make a cameo appearance, but he passed away last week at age 99."
"prince_ilanco","7","0","2","1 June 2005"," Overall a Good Funny Movie!
","This movie is obviously a remake of the original ""The Longest Yard"" starring Burt Reynolds which was a hit comedy in 1974. This remake starring Adam Sandler is overall pretty good, it has occasional periods of humor especially from Chris Rock although Sandler is not as comical as he is in other roles. I probably find it a lot more up to date in the humor and actual character roles of all the main characters in comparison with the original. I actually think this film has more in common with the British Hit ""The Mean Machine"" starring Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham rather than the original ""The Longest Yard"" which both films are based upon. From the Troubled Hero sport star to the characteristic satanic guards ""The Mean Machine"" and ""The Longest Yard"" (2005), have a lot of similarities although ""The Longest Yard"" is far more comical. So to Conclude this is a pretty good funny film but not for the whole family, if you like this check out the film ""The Mean Machine""."
"Alley789","10","0","2","1 June 2005"," Adam Sandler in The Longest Yard - Best Movie yet!
","The longest yard was a really great movie. What can you expect when you put ""Adam Sandler"" ""Chris Rock"" and ""Burt Reynolds"" all in one movie? A great film. A lot of my friends that are female seem to think its mainly a guy movie but i quiet enjoyed it and there was a lot of reasons of why it wasn't a guy movie you just have to look for them- I really do give it 10 Stars! :) And its not too often that you end up cheering for the bad guys in movies but in this one you want them to totally kick some butt cause the good guys are actually the bad guys lol...>Good Guy Bad Guy. Adam Sandler was awesome and this movie was hilarious - See it for your self and let me know what your thoughts are as well I am off to read other reviews!"

","Alright so this might not be a funniest movie ever, but if you are a fan of Adam Sandler movies go see this.<br/><br/>The variety of cast members is genius and the way they are all brought together is perfect.<br/><br/>This movie has every kind of humor and will make anyone laugh, everyone has a line that will leave you laughing. <br/><br/>It will have you laughing the whole way through. <br/><br/>Its so stereotypical of prison movies and they poke fun at every thing. <br/><br/>A must see!<br/><br/>Just trust me and go see this movie it is so hilarious"

","Entertaining, but somewhat dumb remake of the minimally successful original of 1974. Ex-pro quarterback Adam Sandler is put into a rough Texas prison after a crazed night of driving drunk and breaking his probation restrictions. Inside he meets a wide range of characters (old Heisman Trophy winner Burt Reynolds, wise-crack Chris Rock and thugs Michael Irvin and Nelly) and tries to turn the rag-tag group of cons into a team in a month's time to play a football game against sadistic warden James Cromwell's prison guards (led by ex-pro players Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski). The whole set-up is little more than window dressing to get to the film's final act and the big game. This movie's predecessor had a hard edge to it that made it somewhat believable in spite of the ridiculous material. The characters here are not developed well enough and the Sandler/Cromwell combo is just not up to the Reynolds/Eddie Albert duo of the original. The comedy borders on being downright offensive here, but really nothing should be taken too seriously. Not terrible, but honestly not very good either. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"asam3122","8","0","2","31 May 2005"," Not the Best Adam Sandler movie, but in the top 5
","Adam Sandler Movie Top 5 List<br/><br/>1. Happy Gilmore 2. Billy Madison 3. Bulletproof 4. Longest Yard 5. Mr. Deeds<br/><br/>I came to this movie thinking it would be like the Waterboy. Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a former quarterback, who after trashing his girlfriend's car, gets sentenced to three years. <br/><br/>James Cromwell plays Warden Hazen. He is a cold, evil man who brings Crewe to Texas. When Crewe suggests that the semi-pro guard team does a ""tune up"" game, the Warden tells Crewe to recruit some convicts to be the other team.<br/><br/>What follows are hilarious and sad obstacles. Burt Reynolds plays Nate Scarsborough, a former Heighsman Trophy winner who helps the convicts get their game on.<br/><br/>Chris Rock plays Caretaker. He is the guy with all the connections to different people.<br/><br/>Nelly does a great job playing Earl Meggot, a running back. Overall, this movie isn't bad. It's probably in my top 50. But in the end, the original will always be better.<br/><br/>8/10."
