"tfrizzell","Null","86","94","3 July 2002"," May Have Saved Disney's Movie Franchise.
","Disney animated films had become somewhat second-rate by 1989 and it appeared that one of the great genres in the cinema was on life-support. But that all changed with ""The Little Mermaid"". The film is a cinematic classic that tells the story of a young mermaid princess who just wants to be human so she makes a deal with an evil sea witch to get her wish, but she loses her beautiful voice in the process and she must be kissed by her true love to get it back. A really great motion picture that has some really memorable songs in it. 5 stars out of 5."
"BigAir","10","159","180","17 December 1998"," This is my favourite movie of all time...
","I probably never would have seen this movie if my mother hadn't persuaded me to take my little brother to see it. I enjoyed it a lot the first time, but it was only when I saw it again a couple of years later on video I realised just how superb a movie it is. It's not a clever or complex movie, it's not the kind of film which works on an adult level as well as on a children's one. However, three aspects of it make it truly great:<br/><br/>1: The music. 'Under The Sea' richly deserved its Oscar, but 'Part Of Your World' deserved it even more.<br/><br/>2. The animation. Quite simply, it's absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes in particular take your breath away.<br/><br/>3. The Story. How can you resist a love story that touching?<br/><br/>I urge anyone with even a touch of sentimentality about them to set their predjudices aside and see this movie."
"JKearse","Null","32","36","28 April 1999"," ""The Little Mermaid"" Surprised Me
","It has been ten years since ""The Little Mermaid"" was released.  Back when Disney originally released the film, I was both excited and apprehensive. Excited, because it is one of the best children's stories and one of my favorites.  Apprehensive, because I knew Disney would change the ending and give it a happy ending, which is understandable but still unfortunate. When I first saw it, I liked it much more than I thought I would, and after each repeated viewing, I have liked it more and more.  I am now convinced this is the second best American Animated film, after ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The music, story, writing, and animation are superb as others have stated, but the villainess, Ursula, is also a major factor in the success of the film. She is the best written and performed of all Disney villains.  She is purely evil but totally believable.  Pat Carroll, who I have often noticed but never really considered, did a fabulous job with Ursula's characterization. The music and songs are consistantly very good.  There is no deep thought to this one, but ""The Little Mermaid"" is artfully near-perfect entainment."
"cLoNe","10","68","81","6 August 1999"," An incredibly romantic movie!
","Yeah, yeah... It's the little mermaid, the same cute barbie-like character little girls love so much... But the movie is great. If you just free yourself from the sissy pink image of the movie you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>The songs are great, by the same team who gave us Little Shop Of Horrors: Alan Menken and Howard Ashman who teamed up in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin as well. Aladdin was their last project together with Ashman's untimely death from AIDS in 1991.<br/><br/>The story is funny and romantic, so who cares if it's not following the original tale? A perfect movie for everyone, not just little girls."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","78","95","20 January 2004"," Life must be great under the sea!
","The Little Mermaid is one of the best Disney films of the 80's! It's such a wonderful film and is such a tear jerker, lol. The songs, the story, the animation, the voices, were just so wonderful and perfect. This is the film that I'm sure will go on for generations to come, I just showed it to my cousin recently, he's 6, and he just loves it as well. I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and I just wanted a friend like Sebastian, he was so much fun, even though he's somewhat of a buzz kill, he can really get the party going. Just the whole story is a blast to watch and is so beautiful.<br/><br/>Ariel is one of the many princesses of King Triton's mighty kingdom under the sea, but she has a different dream. She goes up constantly to the shore to collect human items and wonders what it would be like to be a human instead of a mermaid. One day when she gets into a nasty fight with her father, Ursella, an evil octopus woman who wants to take over King Triton's kingdom, grants Ariel's wish, but she can only stay human if she can get her crush, Eric, to say her name, sounds easy, right? Well, Ursella takes her voice away, but her intentions are for Ariel to fail and make sure that she takes over the kingdom.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid is such a fun Disney film and is a great treasure of our time. I just love the song ""Under the sea"", it's so much fun to sing and dance too, I admit it, I'm a dork, I still sing and dance to it when I see it. I highly recommend this movie for anyone, it's a true Disney classic that is so much fun, I guarantee you that you might shed a tear when Ariel says ""Daddy"", you'll see what I mean when you watch it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Victor Field","10","61","76","6 October 2002"," Wait a minute - there are actually people who HATE this?
","I was definitely no kid when I saw ""The Little Mermaid""; in fact, I was 20. I was thoroughly captivated by this movie - one of the last real delights from Disney's regular animation crews (before they had to get help from Pixar and Tim Burton) - and the Mouse couldn't have wished for a better movie to get them back on the proper road, animation-wise. (Of course, after this, ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" they've slipped a bit - though they're still better than DreamWorks.)<br/><br/>Though not exactly loyal to the original story - Hans Christian Andersen was much more keen on unhappy endings - it's doubtful it would have worked as well if it had. The movie has just about everything going for it... lush animation, spirited musical numbers (this started Alan Menken's run of success for Disney, and he's surely had enough time to refresh himself by now, and for us all to forget ""Pocahontas""), wonderfully evil villain, likeable supporting players, and my all-time favourite Disney heroine, the endearing and lovely Ariel (remember the episode of ""Cheers"" when Norm said he fancied her? She got a lot of real life guys' hearts - beat that, Princess Fiona from ""Shrek"").<br/><br/>And as a plus, the subsequent TV series (set before the movie) even managed to capture some of the spirit of the movie. But go for the original... a classic."
"White Dolphin","Null","42","51","6 November 2000"," Disney at it's best
","The Little Mermaid is one of Disney's best animated motion pictures. It tells the classic Hans Christian Anderson story of a mermaid who wishes she could be human in order to capture the love of a human prince. The animation is beautiful, in fact I think this is one of Disney's most flawless films. It features lovable characters: Ariel the little mermaid is one of my favorite 'Disney girls', Sebastian the crab, Scuttle the wacky seagull, Flounder the... flounder, Triton Ariel's father the Sea King and of course prince charming- Eric. And don't think I forgot the most despised octopus of the oceans- Ursula and her two eels Flotsam and Jetsum. Great beginning and great ending... and of course a lovable story. The music is beautiful (and rightfully won the Oscar for best score and best song). The score is by Alan Menken (who also provided us with the scores of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast). Some of the most beautiful Disney songs are in The Little Mermaid- Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl and for a little bit of dancin' Under the Sea. A movie for all ages, you will be enchanted by Ariel's world under the sea, by the wacky characters, the cruel but in a strange way lovable Ursula, the score, the songs, the story and the animation. I hope everybody has The Little Mermaid in their video collection to one day show their children and grandchildren or any youngster (or adult for that matter). You will be captured by Ariel and want to be part of her (most intriguing) world."
"arthera09","9","8","8","20 June 2007"," Oh how I love thee Disney movies
","What can I say about this movie. I grew up watching this and I don't care if I am a little girl or not I love this movie. I think it is really well done and it maybe the last of the classic Disney films. For me the best part is the songs. I love all of them and I think they are all really well done and fit into the story well. Having Sebastian being a conductor made it a little easier. I must say I still get a bit of a wave of emotion when I see King Tritan give up his daughter so she can be happy. One of my favorite scenes which amazes me every time I see it is when Sebastian decides to help Ariel. The look on Ariel's face and Sebastian's body language are amazing. I think they really were able to create a whole slew of characters with very unique characteristics and movements. I also have to say I thought the use of the accents and how none of them seemed to come from anywhere made me smile because it was silly and just clichÃ©. This will be one of the movies that my kids will watch and will in my mind always be a classic"
"Lady_Targaryen","8","12","13","21 January 2006"," Somewhere under the sea ....
","''The Little Princess'' is a great movie from Disney and also one of my favorites from it. Ariel, a 16 years old mermaid,is one of the princesses of the sea with her older sisters and her dad, king Triton. The only problem is that she is unhappy with her ''under sea life'', since she always dreamed to live in the human's world and to have legs to walk.Things only get worst when Ariel starts to fall in love with Eric, a beautiful brunet prince that she rescues one day. Decided to become a human, she makes a pact with the evil Ursula and sells her voice as a payment to be with Eric: If after some days, Eric kisses her with true love, she can be a human for eternity. But if the opposite happens, she will be Ursula's slave. The only ones who knows her secret besides Ursula is Sebastian and Flounder.<br/><br/>I think this movie is very worthwhile. The only thing to mention, is that is loosely based upon the story by Hans Christian Andersen."
"Spleen","10","53","69","23 August 1999"," Among the best fantasy films of all time
","The mermaid herself is charming.  She is animated with real passion - and voiced with real passion too, by Jodi Benson, who provides a powerful argument that whoever provides the speaking voice should also provide the singing voice.  She is an innocent heroine but by no means a colourless one. That the prince should fall in love with her, on just seeing her and hearing her voice, is entirely credible.<br/><br/>The same could not be said for Andersen's original mermaid, who is a very cold fish indeed, solely concerned with grabbing immortality, considering the prince as no more than a handy means to it.  It's this (and the high value placed on Christianity at the expense of decency) that makes Andersen's ending so insufferable.  Obviously, another ending had to be found; and while it must be said that the big ending Musker and Clements came up with is a weak one, it must also be said that it's an improvement.<br/><br/>Musker and Clements still have a problem with their finales (witness `Aladdin' and `Hercules'), but they have countervailing strengths, and those strengths are most apparent here.  The songs are all exceptionally staged (the well-known `Under the Sea' actually being the least effective), the comedy is sharp and well-timed, and - more obviously here than anywhere else - they really believe in what they're doing.  They give credit to Howard Ashman for this and they could be right; whatever the reason, an air of innocence and sincerity pervades `The Little Mermaid' which makes it - and her - utterly irresistible."
"thomvic","9","7","7","1 May 2011"," Loved this film when I was younger and still love it now
","The Little Mermaid is one of those films I grew up with when I was a kid - something that the whole family can watch and never really get sick of. The imagination brought into this fairy tale (despite the fact that the ending is vastly changed from the original to please the kids) is simply superb. Songs, music, characters are all terrific.<br/><br/>While I think Beauty and the Beast stands as Disney's best animated film, The Little Mermaid is still one of the top ones to check out. A story about Aeriel - the young mermaid curious about the human world who ends up falling for Prince Eric of the human race.<br/><br/>And all the other cute characters such as Sebastian, Flounder, not to mention a very sinister villain with the Sea Witch. It all makes for a great time and has a good deal of emotion in it too.<br/><br/>I really miss Disney films made in this era - they were done so well and I will always be a huge fan of them. The ones nowadays - while they aren't horrible, just seem to be a bit too modern and hence don't have that magic as the old ones - probably because they focus more on doing references to other things rather than coming up with original ideas that felt fresh."

","The Little Mermaid harkens back to the simple, straightforward qualities of Disney's golden era. A classic celebrating the impulsivity of youthful love and the search for a new identity. It's a faithful and brilliant showcase for animation as an enchanting, lively medium; and ushered in a new era of masterpieces from Disney. There's certainly some nostalgia attached to my love for this film but I don't even care...it's a wonderful little movie."

"Llamas Rule","Null","42","63","5 August 2002"," Great movie for little kids
","I saw this movie when I was very young and I loved it. It had a perfect fairy-tale ending and totally followed the formula for Disney movies in a great way. It really got it's message across with catchy tunes and fun characters.<br/><br/>On the down side, while it had a great message, it didn't stay true to what Hans Christian Andersen wrote. I hadn't read Andersen's version until very recently, but I loved it. I thought it had a much better and far more realistic message than the Disney movie. Andersen said that if you're a good person, while you may not get your reward in life, being good is it's own reward. Disney, on the other hand, said that if you risk everything for the one you love, things will work out in the end. While that's a nice message for little kids that is very unrealistic. Good people are hurt all the time.<br/><br/>I've heard people say that if girls grow up watching this, they will learn that big breasts, a small waist, and having a man by your side are what's important in life. This movie was made the year I was born, so naturally, I grew up on it. I don't hold myself to unrealistic standards or feel like I must have a man to go on. So, while I don't know about all the other little girls out there, but Disney didn't corrupt me."

I really don't have much to say on this film at the moment, but if anything is going to be said about this movie, let me say this: If you haven't yet seen this wonderful movie, see it now!

"OllieSuave-007","10","9","11","25 October 2013"," One of the greater classics beyond Walt Disney himself.
","This is one of the greater full length animated feature films that was made after Walt Disney. A story about Ariel the Little Mermaid, who yearns to be part of the human world and who fell in love with human Prince Eric in the process. She makes a deal with Ursula the Sea Witch and traded her voice for legs so she could rise to the surface of the waters. What follows is a romantic story in how Ariel tries to win Eric's heart without her voice and an exciting race against time to ensure Ariel remains human, otherwise, returning back to the ocean and into the evil Ursula's custody.<br/><br/>Ron Clements and John Musker did an outstanding job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention at the start of the film with a musical sequence on the Prince's ship, and then a spectacular entry under the sea when we are introduced to the mermaids, helped by a powerful music score. The solid plot quickly identifies the story's main issue, Ariel, who is tired of being treated like a child by her father King Triton. The issue is then expanded as Ariel struggles to win Eric's heart when she goes to the human world while, at the same time, not knowing that Ursula has devious plans of her own to control the sea. All these plot elements and twists make this a very exciting Disney movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>The characters are very lovable and memorable, especially Flounder, Sebastian (my favorite) and Scuttles. They added humor and spirit in the movie as they help Ariel with her issues. The music score and songs are some of cinema's best work - Alan Menken and Howard Ashman did a marvelous job. ""Under the Sea"" is a very lively and dynamic Calyso-type song and ""Part of your World"" is a moving and commanding song; Jodi Benson had the perfect voice for Ariel - very soothing and serene. And, the artwork and graphics are some of the best I have seen in an animated film.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the best movies from Disney and remains a timeless fairytale for all ages.<br/><br/>Grade A"

","A good family film with a cute version the story. As it is written so it is said, Disney's movie is *loosely* based on Hans Christian Andersen's story - so you cannot compare Andersen's story with Disney's film. Disney's film is a colorful tale with quite a few comical characters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film quite a bit but I would have liked to have seen this movie a bit ""darker"" in tone (animation and story). Under ocean is a mysterious place - so I would have preferred this movie with more of a ""gloomy"" atmosphere and story instead of being mainly a bright place to live. Of course it's just a matter of personal preference.<br/><br/>Yes The Little Mermaid is a wonderful film. You could make this a double feature with movies like: ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"".<br/><br/>8/10"
"ferguson-6","10","4","4","23 January 2014"," What's that word ... Excellence
","Greetings again from the darkness. The first of three true classics from the ""middle era"" of Disney animation ... along with Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) ... this 1989 version of Hans Christian Anderson's 1837 story brought musical theatre to an animated children's fairy tale. It was also the 28th Disney film, and the final to utilize hand-painted cel animation.<br/><br/>The Blu-Ray release to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary is truly stunning in color, brightness, clarity and sound. An explosion of sight and sound occurs during the incredible cacophony of joy and cheer better known as the Best Song Oscar winner ""Under the Sea"". The calypso style was a very creative choice by musical directors Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.<br/><br/>Of course, the star of the show is Ariel, the rebellious 16 year old mermaid who dreams of walking on the beach and dancing with the Prince. Ariel's remarkable vocals (""Part of Your World"") are provided by Jodi Benson, who beautifully captures the innocence and longing necessary for the character. Samuel E Wright is the smooth voiced Jamaican crab Sebastian, who not only takes lead on ""Under the Sea"", but also on ""Kiss the Girl"". The other standout is Pat Carroll as Ursula the Sea Witch. She is the perfect villain vs Ariel, and is quite a commentary on the actions of those who are power hungry.<br/><br/>Written and directed by John Clements and Ron Musker, the film was a bit different for its time because of the depth of Ariel's character. This was a typical teenager going against her strict parent and dreaming of a better life. Ariel has a mind of her own and is willing to chase her dreams ... even if it's a boy from the proverbial ""other side of the tracks"" and with a Faustian negotiation. From a technical perspective, the artwork is spectacular and movements are full and fluid (sorry for the pun). This came 5 years after Ron Howard's live action Splash with Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah. If you ever doubt the power that expert animation can possess, just compare the emotion and charm in those two.<br/><br/>This latest Blu-Ray release has some very interesting special features. We are treated to interviews with the film's animators as well as a peek inside the Disney Animation studios, now on its third generation of animators. Much reverence is provided to The Nine Old Men ... the original group of animators hand picked by Walt Disney. The last of the nine men died in 2008, and their trainees are now mentoring the most excited new group that is kicking out some new classics like Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph. What's that word ... circle of life."

"bts1984","10","4","4","28 December 2010"," The best Disney animated classic since 'The Rescuers'!
","'The Little Mermaid' brought back Disney firmly into the map after a period of crisis and less successful movies, even if not all of them were that bad. For instance, 'The Fox and the Hound' and 'The Great Mouse Detective' are not bad. The horrifying 'The Black Cauldron' and the frankly poor 'Oliver & Company' belong to a dark age at Disney, though, and were made during that period.<br/><br/>'The Little Mermaid' came precisely after 'Oliver & Company'. And what a difference comparing to that one! You can say that Disney went from one extreme to another. That is, from a deplorable and very cheap-looking movie they went to this which happens to be one of their finest.<br/><br/>This film is fresh, lively, charming, humorous, romantic and artistic. It has beautiful artwork and colors, made to a quality level comparable to 'The Rescuers'. Besides, it isn't just a movie about merpeople, it has a story. And it isn't too girly. The idea of a movie about merpeople might sound too feminine for males's tastes, but men and women can be pleased with it in the same way. Take it from me.<br/><br/>Since I was a child this has been one of Disney's best to me. And yet somehow it seems to improve with time. My explanation to this is that it ages better than you might think at some point in your life.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is always nice, but variable in genre and temperament. There are jolly songs (""Under the Sea"" and ""Les Poissons""), a love song (""Kiss the Girl""), a song of hope, anxiety, dreams and optimism (""Part of your world"") and a dark-spirited song (""Poor Unfortunate Souls"").<br/><br/>Ursula is one of Disney's big villains. Strangely she was never scary to me as a kid and I even used to find her funny, particularly when she puts lipstick and the kiss she simulates next. Also, her figure used to amuse me: half fat woman, half octopus. Now as an adult, she doesn't scare me but I can see how pure evil she is and I've gotta admit that there are some pretty disturbing and creepy scenes with her.<br/><br/>Scuttle is hilarious. He's a self-claimed ""expert"" on human stuff and makes up funny names for objects (in his language, a fork is a ""dinglehopper"" and he says people use it to comb their hair; a pipe is a ""snarfblatt"" and he tells people use it to play music like a trumpet).<br/><br/>Ariel (nice name, by the way) is one of my Disney princesses of election. She looks pretty as a mermaid, but I prefer her as a human. She is simply hot as a human. Plus, as a human she is more shy and adorable, looks more cute and even more innocent, as her face and those expressive, enormous blue eyes suggest. Like the movie itself gets better with time, Ariel looks more attractive with time. Her looks grow on you - at least they did on me. Ariel has qualities I highly appreciate on a woman.<br/><br/>Title in Portugal: 'A Pequena Sereia'."
"neil-476","10","4","4","4 October 2007"," Pure brilliance
","There is (in my view) only one criticism which can be levelled against this film, and that is that it plays fast and loose with Andersen's original in terms of the ending. I first read Andersen's stories as a child, and The Little Mermaid had a fairly typical unhappy ending. Personally, I thought the Mermaid deserved better and, on taking my kids to see this movie when it was first released, I was delighted to see that the people at Disney had given her the ending I always wanted for her.<br/><br/>The very first sequence, of Prince Eric's ship looming out of the mist, took my breath away.<br/><br/>I can understand Under The Sea getting all the attention - it is, after all, very jolly and colourful. But, to me, it pales into insignificance next to Kiss The Girl (soulful, and with a far better vocal performance), Poor Unfortunate Souls (where sinister turns into nightmare, with a sensational vocal performance from Pat Carroll delivering clever lyrics) and, most of all Part Of Your World.<br/><br/>I think this may be the most perfect song sequence ever committed to celluloid - the song itself intertwines several plot elements, teenage angst and the generation gap, and bucketloads of emotion in a complex rhyming scheme loaded with clever wordplay. Jodi Benson's vocal is sublime and so are the visuals - it still brings tears to my eyes after repeated viewings. And the reprise... choreographing the final ""world"" to an orchestral crescendo and the crashing of the wave behind Ariel in Copenhagen mode may be corny but, by heaven, it certainly works! Howard Ashman is sadly missed!"
"ccthemovieman-1","8","28","43","17 May 2006"," Color Animated Film Brought Disney Back
","This animated film brought the Disney company out of its long slump and you can see why it spurred a comeback: there is a lot to like in this movie.<br/><br/>It features outstanding animation: brilliant colors and beautiful scenes, along with interesting characters and pretty good songs. Frankly, I didn't care that much for the lead character, the young girl, but the little crab was the show- stealer, at least for me. He spoke with a West Indies accent and did a couple of cool musical numbers....and was easily the funniest and most-entertaining of all the characters.<br/><br/>I have only one major complaint about this story. The message that ""parents should let the kids go,"" inferring they know best, that if you let them decide what is best, they'll live happily ever after....is irresponsible and just plain wrong. Hollywood loves to show little kids are smarter than their parents, which might sound nice to the young audience but it is a very dangerous message. Too bad, because than that this would have been a super film for all ages. It's still pretty darn good."
"aesgaard41","10","8","10","5 September 2001"," Enchanting Myth Movie
","I'm a big mythology buff, and there is enough to hold my interest in this movie.I have to also leave it Disney to make a movie that both child and adult. Ariel has the cartoonish qualities that makes little girls want to be her, and a bit of Marilyn Monroe-like sexual innocence that attracts male fans. For mythology buffs, the figure of Triton, son of Poseidon, has been inserted along with several outlandishly named daughters from the sea-god's numerous wives. Even Ursula from a long line of successful Disney villains seems to fit in. While Scylla or Thetis might have fit it, Ursula could have easily come from the pantheon of Russian sea witches. At times in the movie though, it almost forgets it's underwater as these figures talk and move with little or no distubance, but the weightless look of the figures from odd angles augments the look at other times. I also love the repeated images that give homage to Denmark's Little Mermaid statue. The voice to role comparison also is excellant and Jodi Benson excells in her songs. This movie produced a great soundtrack and a great retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale by simultaneosly updating the myths of the Greeks."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","6","7","11 November 2013"," So simple, yet so good
","""The Little Mermaid"" takes us on an animated journey into the life of ginger mermaid Ariel and her dream of becoming human. It's sensory overload for Ariel and for the viewer from start to finish, but in the most positive way. It's a bit sad that some of the voice actors here (Flotsam & Jetsam, Triton, Scuttle) are dead now, but as it's almost 25 years since this film was made just shows what a timeless classic it has become. My favorite moment was Ariel singing in the film early ""Part of Your World"" and swimming up to the moonlight. Such a beautifully mesmerizing song and scene. While it was IMHO the best song of the movie and I'm pretty surprised it did not get the Oscar nomination, all the other songs are really good as well. ""Under the Sea"", maybe my least favorite, won the Oscar. I see it more as a ""Hakuna Matata"", a great fun song with little depth, so it's a bit surprising it was chosen as the best song at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards. ""Kiss the Girl"" is an amazing love song about taking the initiative and is very much worth listening to, just like ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", one of Disney's best villain songs ever. The latter is sung by Ursula, the main antagonist here and, long before she becomes a giant monster, already an epic villain here that may have changed the way we perceive octopuses forever to the negative.<br/><br/>Ariel's best friend is a yellow-blue fish with the voice of a child, who rarely speaks, but is always loyal to her, even if he's scared quickly and it certainly doesn't help that there's always sharks around under the sea. Another friend is a bird who teaches Ariel about the human world and always knows what it is used for when Ariel shows him another item from the human world. Sadly, these descriptions are never accurate, which Ariel doesn't know of course, so she uses a fork for combing her hair at some point for example. Story-wise Ariel happens to rescue a Prince from drowning. Her father, however, doesn't want her to have any contact with humans, so he destroys her cavern which includes a giant collection of human things. Desperate and disappointed Ariel goes to see the sea witch Ursula and makes a deal with her. When she seems to be winning the deal, Ursula appears and tricks the prince into thinking she's the real Ariel. But of course, there's a happy ending as in pretty much every Disney film.<br/><br/>One character I haven't mentioned so far, is Sebastian, who in my opinion is a definite contender for best supporting character in a Disney movie. He really leaves nothing to be desired. Initially loyal to Triton and instructed to look after Ariel, he's quickly captivated by her charm more and more as the film progresses and the very moment he realizes how Ariel will be unhappy for the rest of her life if she stays under the sea is just so much filled with excellence. Oh did I mention, he's also the royal court composer and a crab? Besides that, he's probably also the character who will provide the most comic relief and be the children's favorite. His chase scenes with the cook are simply hilarious. And when he assembles the orchestra, it's a win-win for everybody as we see ducks playing drums on turtle's bellies and the wildest ways music and performances can take by all the sea creatures involved.<br/><br/>This animated version of Hans Christian Andersen's tale is simply a thing of beauty. It certainly is my new favorite film from 1989. The underwater world they created is pure movie magic, a feast for eyes and ears. Watch it with the one you love and you'll have a great time. It's also a great watch for fathers with their daughters thanks to the Triton-Ariel storyline. Most animated films these days are funny and stunning to look at, but hardly any reach the level of ""The Little Mermaid"" especially in terms of emotional impact: the longing for love, the longing for freedom, even if you have to make sacrifices for it, or just the way all kinds of human relationships are displayed metaphorically with the help of mermaids, fish and all kinds of other sea animals. Very much recommended."

The Little Mermaid ushered in an entire new era of Disney movies,yet took us back to the golden age of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. What makes this movie so great is its simplicity. It is entertaining to both children and adults. It is a timeless love between two unlikely heroes. The songs in the movie are beautiful and truly enhance the story. Not to metion, they get stuck in your head for days. As a child I remember walking out of the theater and singing the songs all the way home. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are the modern-day Rodgers and Hammerstein of movie scores. As the last Disney movie to be entirely drawn by hand, it holds a special place in Disney history. The animation is truly breathtaking. The characters have the wonderful combination of both depth and lovability. There are so many elements that make this movie a classic, i would be here for days if I went into any more detail. Bottom line, this is a must see movie for all ages.

","I love ""The Little Mermaid"" and it's a brilliantly made film. It also represents the rebirth of Disney Studio--a film that firmly announced that they were once again a great producer of family full-length cartoons. This being said, I have one very minor quibble about the movie--very minor. The meta-message seems to be that parents are a bit stupid and kids should be encouraged to make their own choices. While this is sometimes true, it's a message too often found in films of the 1980s. Now I am NOT attacking Disney for this--too often Steven Spielberg and others promoted this message during this time, so why shouldn't the studio hop on the bandwagon? This is the sole reason the film only gets a 9 from me, not a 10. And, this is why I adored their followup film, ""Beauty and the Beast"", as it had a marvelous message from start to finish. Still, ""Little Mermaid"" has GREAT music, a fun story and some wonderful animation--and only a real curmudgeon could hate it."

","I also recommend the TV series, but not the sequel. I still think that Tarzan is the last great Disney movie, but pretty much everything else after lacks the magic that Disney once had, as far as I'm concerned.(with the exception of the surprisingly good Fantasia 2000, Bambi 2 and Emperor's New Groove) 10 years ago, this was one of my all-time favourites. I remember, every time I went swimming, I felt really inspired to be a mermaid. That's the effect this movie and the TV series had on me. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, especially the underwater scenes, and the storm. The script is intelligent and witty, and everyone involved did a marvellous job putting it across. The songs are fantastic, as always with Alan Menken. In fact, the only score of Alan Menken's I don't like is ""Home on the Range"". My favourites are ""Part of your World""(my sister is always singing it around the house) and the wonderfully energetic ""Under the Sea"". The characters are probably the most memorable in a Disney movie, especially Ariel, a beautiful and feisty mermaid, with a dream of being a human. She has a beautiful voice also, well we have the talented Jodi Benson to thank for that. Sebastian is so funny here, a he was in the series, but as well as Flounder(another great character)he was ruined in the sequel. Kenneth Mars's Triton is an inspiring father-figure, who reminds me of my grandfather. The best character is without question, Ursula, who scarred me for life after watching her. Likewise with The Evil Manta from the series. Whilst her song is probably the least memorable song of the movie, it still works. Flotsam and Jetsam are also really creepy. Miles better than Ursula's really bland sister Morgana at any rate.To round off, I can't forget Louis the chef. He is so funny here, unlike in the sequel, where the same joke was repeated but badly underplayed. I can't believe some people hate this movie. It is one of Disney's best along with ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Lion King"", ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"". Highly recommended for all ages. 10/10. Bethany Cox"

"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","2","2","27 January 2020"," The Little Mermaid
","If you were to ask me what my favorite Disney canon film was, ""The Little Mermaid"" would be a strong contender for the title, because I seriously adore this movie. Growing up, I never had much of an exposure to the big four of the Disney renaissance. ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" have been in the Disney vault for much of my life. I'm partly annoyed by that and partly okay with it, because it's allowed to me scrutinize Disney's most popular films and decide if they live up to the hype around them or not without having to worry about a filter of nostalgia. For the most part, I'd say that they do, especially this one. ""The Little Mermaid"" is one of those rare Disney movies and one of those rare musicals where you know it'll be something unique and inventive right from the opening sequence, taking us from Eric's raucous ship to the undersea city of Atlantica with Alan Menken's theme for Ariel firing up for the first time.<br/><br/>Due to it's ambitious plot, the film moves along at a brisk pace through it's three acts. Ariel's actions and the consequences of her decisions (along with that of other supporting characters) carry her neatly from one scene to another, and the movie is never once allowed to drag (though the ending does seem to wrap up a bit quickly, like the filmmakers realized the movie was running long and they wanted to nip things in the bud). I've talked a lot in the past about how a strong ensemble cast can make or break a movie and while the animation is great and the soundtrack is stellar, it's the characters in ""The Little Mermaid"" and the way the character relationships shine through in the second half of the movie that really elevate the film. There's Ariel's euphoric chemistry with Eric; Flounder, Sebastian and Scuttle's devotion to their little mermaid friend; Triton's guilt and concern over his lost daughter; Grimsby offering Eric sincere relationship advice because he doesn't just want the prince to be wed, he also wants his psuedo-son to be happy; and in a twisted sort of way, there's even Ursula trying her best to kill Ariel to avenge the only real friends the sea witch had in exile. It all makes this film's universe feel thoroughly lived in.<br/><br/>""The Little Mermaid's"" lead character, Ariel, is the youngest of seven royal daughters, as well as the most passionate and outspoken one. Instead of lying around the palace without purpose, Ariel spends her days poking around shipwrecks and chatting up seagulls, rarely staying still for a moment, learning more about human inventions and human society. For years now, Ariel has taken an interest in the world above her head, romanticizing it as a land where seemingly anything is possible, and she'd love to see it all. She'd love nothing more than to cross the human / mermaid divide, live a life of adventure and excitement and exploration on land with endless, endless potential, and do something meaningful with her life. But she knows it'll never happen. One, because it's impossible, and two, her father, the king, despises humans. Ariel, in general, likes to try to understand and appreciate the beauty in everything, and she doesn't feel comfortable accepting and internalizing her family's harsh prejudices just because they're her family. But by the start of the film, she's starting to lose faith in her instincts and her intuition, and she's starting to consider that maybe her father is right, maybe she is just a fool. Still, an eventful encounter with an admirable human prince, who proves her right about humans being more than mindless monsters (that they can be brave and noble and self-sacrificing), convinces her not to let the dream die so soon and leaves her with quite a crush. She learns the importance of staying true to herself and sticking up for what she believes in. When her father finds out, the king becomes terrifyingly abusive towards her, destroying her collection of human objects, and a pissed-off Ariel decides to cut a deal with Ursula the sea witch to try to become human.<br/><br/>I've touched on this before on this blog, but Ariel is one of my favorite female characters from Disney. As far as Disney princesses go, she's a pretty big deal. She's the first truly proactive princess of the lot, who not only dreams of a more fulfilling life, but actively pursues it at every turn (not to mention, saves a dude's life from drowning), finding acceptance on land and the space to pursue her interests. You can't help but take a shine to her for her kindness, courage and personal convictions. She's also the first princess that's allowed to be more than just a role model figure. Ariel is a fundamentally flawed person, and her flaws drive the conflict of the story forward (if you've read my reviews of ""Brother Bear"" and ""Frozen"" you know those are my favorite sorts of characters). To elaborate, Ariel is a kind, brave, fun-loving and open-minded individual, but she can also be very stubborn and shortsighted. Throughout the film, she ignores Flounder and Sebastian's warnings and keeps putting herself into dangerous situations for the sake of discovery, all too cavalier about the risks (a trait she shares with Remy from Pixar's ""Ratatouille""), which usually winds up stressing out her friends. This eventually catches up to her when she loses her bet with Ursula, and the sea witch not only betrays her (since she was just using her) but also almost kills her and her friends and family. While Ariel wasn't wrong to want a human life or pursue it, she does learn the hard way that her actions have consequences that can affect more than just herself. Nearly every Disney renaissance film was a coming-of-age story, and all of them contained a growing-up lesson: this one was Ariel's. Ultimately, Ariel is one of my favorite Disney characters because despite being a mermaid, she's one of the ones that feels the most human, relatable and well-rounded.<br/><br/>Ariel is a lucky girl, because it's pretty clear she has some of the best guy friends a mermaid could ask for. Ariel does most of the work attaining her goals in this movie, but she wouldn't have gotten as far as she did without Flounder, Sebastian and Scuttle helping her. Sebastian the crustacean is Atlantica's esteemed court composer and the king's personal adviser / right-hand man. He's clearly a grumpy middle-aged man, but he has a good heart and he's scrappy; he endures quite a bit of slapstick in this movie (especially during ""Les Poissons""), but he never lets it slow him down. For the first half of the film, Sebastian is only concerned with maintaining the usual status quo, keeping Ariel in line and keeping the king happy, so he doesn't invoke the man's anger. It's not until he sees how badly Triton hurts her and he knows his own part in that that Sebastian realizes Ariel is more than just the king's daughter, she's her own person. She deserves a life of her own and a chance to be happy, so he decides to 'switch sides' so to speak and help her brave the human world to make that happen, despite knowing it will probably only lead to trouble. During their adventures on land, the crab's greater understanding of the teen and the mermaid's appreciation of his friendship leads to the two bonding some, and Sebastian surprisingly becomes an uncle figure to Ariel, or at least a stand-in guardian. It's quite an improvement on their previous relationship and makes for some amusing visuals (in fact, ""Kiss The Girl"" might be my favorite scene in the movie because of the surreal but adorable sight of a mermaid's guy friends trying to set her up with a boy).<br/><br/>Flounder is one of the few figures in this movie that's a wholly static character. He starts the film as Ariel's timid, supportive friend who often gets dragged along on adventures and by the end he is still exactly that. I guess you could say he becomes more of an action fish than he ever thought he would be: braving storms, moving huge statues by himself, creating romantic atmospheres, and taking on Flotsam and Jetsam to save Eric's life. With so many characters in this movie, not all of them can be developed. Out of Ariel's three friends / sidekicks, Scuttle the seagull is the one that's often forgotten about - including by Disney themselves - and that is not okay. Scuttle does the best he can y'all. Scuttle is Ariel's consultant on human objects, and it's pretty clear his information is not correct. It's actually not clear if Scuttle believes it all himself or if he's just straight up making things up to tell her. In any case, Scuttle is the loudest, most scatter-brained member of Ariel's friend group and something of a screw-up, but incredibly friendly, well-meaning and supportive, as well as surprisingly invested in sea business that doesn't really pertain to him. He also retains some of the spirit from the last film in the Disney canon by being a fast-talking, softhearted New Yorker type among the ensemble cast; the goofy everyman acting opposite to the more serious, straight man Sebastian. Scuttle finally gets a chance to prove himself when he brings Ursula's treachery to light and calls in reinforcements for the gang's final fight with the sea witch.<br/><br/>Worldly, seafaring Prince Eric is the male protagonist of this film and Ariel's love interest. It's pretty easy to see how she got smitten so easily. The dude is humble (despite coming from a regal background, he never treats the people around him as being lesser than him), brave (never asking anything of his subjects that he wouldn't do himself), handsome, kind to animals (he's ultimately willing to die for his pet, Max), he loves the sea (which means he has a wanderlust like Ariel does), and most importantly, he's single. He's pretty much her dream guy, and as soon as she realizes he's looking for a lady and he's already glimpsed her, she knows she wants a shot with him. Ariel is also Prince Eric's love interest. Eric is a hopeless romantic and a bit of a daydreamer. His manservant and"
"elicopperman","8","2","2","17 November 2019"," The Disney Movie that Remains Part of Our World
","30 years ago, the Walt Disney Company released their feature-film adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Little Mermaid. Made at a time when the animation studio was in a huge rut, this along with Roger Rabbit and the boost of morale brought them back to their glory days with a whole decade known as their Renaissance era. To this day, it remains one of their most recognizable commodities, spawning a TV series, a sequel, a prequel and even a live-action remake currently in development. But one question remains...does it still hold any water now?<br/><br/>The story follows a young mermaid named Ariel, who wants to become part of the human world after falling in love with a prince named Eric, but learns the tough challenges of steering away from her own undersea life. While this story sounds weak on paper, the execution more than makes up for it. Due to the film being told in the style of a Broadway musical, its emotional core feels incredibly strong and personal with its characters. The musical numbers by the great Howard Ashman and Alan Menken come in all shapes and sizes, from Part of Your World telling us everything we need to know about Ariel's inner desires, to Under the Sea providing us with enough proof as to why the grass is always greener on one side, to Poor Unfortunate Souls being a cautionary reminder of the consequences to your actions, and Kiss the Girl being a harmonious love song on getting with your partner. These songs, along with the wonderful performances from Jodi Benson, Samuel E. Wright and Pat Carroll, help give the story an identity that no Disney film prior had in years: musical narrative.<br/><br/>In addition, this film is a tour de force of luscious animation and sound design. The characters have the usual Disney style but with a more cartoony flair that utilizes a good amount of squash and stretch. The special effects are a nice touch too, with a lot of magic, water, electricity, fire and even smoke practically popping out of the screen with striking detail and horrific imagery (helps too that airbrushes, CGI and superimposing were used to great effect). The backgrounds as well display the necessary depth needed for a film set both under water and on the land, with only a few locations needed to make the story feel contained without going all over the place. As for the sound work, this had at the time way more sound effects than any other Disney film, and it shows considering all the mixing and editing needing to be done. Of course there are quiet moments, but the scenes with a lot of suspense feel all the more thrilling with the overwhelming noise flooding (no pun intended) the screens. It's almost as if the film wouldn't have sounded quite as epic without the foley work.<br/><br/>But now it's time to comment on what people to this day criticize the film for: its moral. Many have argued that Ariel gets what she wants at the end without learning much of anything and just runs of with a man she barely knows. While I do find those critiques valid in their own right, the one thing many of us have forgot about is that the point of the film is to let your children grow up in their own way. King Triton wants what's best for his daughter without truly understanding, which in turn led Ariel to do whatever it took to be on the land she wanted to explore from the beginning. This resulted in her having to form a connection with Eric voiceless, and even when the tables turned against her, Eric still selflessly fought back against the villainous Ursula to be with the one who he felt was made for her. And that's the key element to remember: the one made for you. Ariel still could have become a human through magic just to be on the surface, but it was the man she fell in love with that gave her journey a true purpose, and from then on, her real story had only just begun.<br/><br/>With highly memorable songs, magical animation and a message on finding your purpose that anyone can relate to, Disney's The Little Mermaid holds up just as well as its big splash in 1989. There are many films that changed cinema forever, and this was one of them for putting the House of Mouse back in the spotlight that they've kept since then. Even if it's not their real crowning achievement in filmmaking and storytelling, it set the bar that most of their movies since then would keep trying to get up to for over three decades, and we have the magic of Broadway and emotional resonance to thank for that."

"dbpirate","8","2","2","28 October 2018"," The film that began animation's best era to date
","Disney was struggling to say the least during the 70s and 80s. The films released during this era are somewhat obscure today and most did only decent (in some cases, awful) at the box office. The Little Mermaid was practically the studio's last hurrah. I'm very thankful it's as good as it is or we may never have experienced the best era of animation, in my opinion -- the Disney Renaissance.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is not one of Disney's best, as I don't believe that Ariel (who, granted, is still a likable main character) goes through much of a character arc. It's the cast and the score that really take this film to its greatest heights. Prince Eric was probably my favorite character in the movie as he is the first real compelling Disney prince. Sebastian and Flounder, Ariel's crab and fish companion respectively, are also quite good, though I found that Sebastian's comedy to land more often than Flounder's. The main villain, Ursula, is the most entertaining character in the movie, and is played brilliantly by Pat Carroll.<br/><br/>All of the songs in the movie are great, with Under the Sea, Part of Your World, and Poor Unfortunate Souls being the most recognized (and for good reason). I think that my favorite of the bunch is Part of Your World but it attests to the quality of the music that I'm really not sure. The animation in the film is very good but most of the other movies in the Disney Renaissance do it better.<br/><br/>Despite my previous comment on the plot, The Little Mermaid is still a very entertaining film, if a bit predictable. The storm scene around the middle of the movie was executed spectacularly as was the opening sequence. In my opinion, the movie starts really finding its footing once Ariel gets on land but the very end (which features a battle with Ursula) is far too rushed.<br/><br/>Overall, The Little Mermaid is a great film with some minor faults. I tend to think of it as the one that set the stage for Disney's greatest films as I wouldn't consider it one of my personal favorites from their library. Still, it should definitely be remembered for practically saving Disney's animation division.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.3/10

","This was the final film my aunt and I viewed today, again on VHS. I was really elated from this morning to see this, as it begun what many people my brother's age proclaim as the best Disney era. So here lie my thoughts on it.<br/><br/>While the story doesn't adapt everything in the Andersen tale, it pulled off some really great humor and magic that made Disney glorious again back in 1989. Almost every scene in this movie ended up taking my mind to places of fascination, which I would say even rival some films I consider a 10. The character development was absurdly strong, providing with it the lessons of knowing the implications of selfishness, and I do think Ursula is one of the better Disney Villains from her complex motives and just being all around awesome. The animation is of a quality I cannot describe; I could say that it conveys vivid environments and character designs, and I could say that it really does upgrade the occasional slapstick and sight gags, but that wouldn't scratch the surface of what Disney has achieved here. I will say right now that only Mary Poppins has a better overall score among all the Disney films I have seen; in the animated canon, though, this takes the cake. The 3 main songs of this movie all deserve to be remembered for years and really do serve as a foreshadowing to the career of the amazing Alan Menken.<br/><br/>Any Disney fan or animation historian will want to view this movie for the impact it has made. While I still stand by that the Renaissance actually started with The Great Mouse Detective, this solidified its existence and brought complete stability to the company. Just for that, I want to give this film a special place in my heart. I possess optimism that many of you out there reading this will find at least 2 things to enjoy. For a Disney film, that's well above a compliment, but I feel it meritorious of such."

","A favorite since early childhood, The Little Mermaid is truly one of Disney's most distinguished classics. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson story of the same name, this movie is a timely and fun almost-masterpiece.<br/><br/>We meet Ariel, a rebellious and passionate teenage mermaid, who is the daughter of the ruler of the sea, King Triton. While at first she seems happy we soon learn that she has a yearning for another world - the human world, above the sea. She is obsessed with humans to the point that in a mad desperation she strikes a deal with Ursula, a sea witch, who will give her human legs in exchange for her voice. Ariel has three days to kiss a human prince or else she will belong to Ursula.<br/><br/>The songs are catchy and memorable; tunes such as 'Under the Sea' and 'Part of Your World' are instantly recognizable and you can't help but sing (albeit badly) along to the irresistible melodies. The music itself is also rather grand, too.<br/><br/>The characters are fantastic, the main character Ariel is impassioned and surprisingly (for Disney) realistic teenage girl. You completely relate to her problems, and in hindsight her decisions are understandable given her situation (Yes I disagree with complaints about her character - I think she's great). Also, Ursula is one of Disney's finest baddies. Her control over the story and elegant charisma create one of their greatest villains. My only issue is that perhaps if Ariel had shown more remorse for her actions, she would have been more of a good character (she doesn't really learn a lesson).<br/><br/>All in all, while not their best film, The Little Mermaid truly ranks up with some of Disney's highest classics, a personal, fun and dramatic animated adventure. Filled with sing-along songs, beautiful animation, spritely and memorable characters and an intriguing plot, The Little Mermaid is not to be missed :)"

For example: Aladdin, Princess and the Frog, Hercules, and Disney's new princess movie Mona.<br/><br/>In their film The Little Mermaid, the main character is Ariel (Jodi Benson), who is a curious and adventurous young girl just waiting to embark on a life changing journey. Ariel is always forgetting big events and doing things she knows she isn't supposed to do, but in this she discovers a prince, Eric, (Christopher Barnes) at sea. One night while she is swimming along she hears a ruckus at sea level and swims up to find the princes' boat on fire. In the end of this dramatic, nail biting scene She winds up saving his life and taking him to shore. This is where their unique love story begins. Ariel ends up selling her soul to a wicked sea witch, Ursula, (Pat Carroll) in order to become human. Ariel faces many trials after this and almost doesn't recover, but her father and all her friends come together and everything works out for the better in the end.<br/><br/>This movie takes place under the sea off the coast of Denmark. The underwater sea village is called Atlantica. Which is a beautiful city of mer-people who live in peace with the ocean.<br/><br/>This film is a digital master piece, it was created well with great effects and animation for its time. In this movie there are a plethora of wonderfully composed songs, formed by Alan Menken. So many iconic songs that are referenced to children and people every day are derived from this movie. Part of Your World, Under the Sea, Poor Unfortunate Souls, Les Possions, and Kiss the Girl are all well-known songs that are from The Little Mermaid. The music and lyrics of this film help evoke emotion is the audience and really add to the plot of the story. For example, when Ariel and Eric are in the river on a romantic date the song, Kiss the Girl, builds up the feeling of true love. <br/><br/>This movie has a specific genre and honestly it is Disney. Disney falls under the children and family category. Most all Disney films are made based on magic, fun, and happiness which are all family friendly characteristics. This movie has a rating of G, and that stands for ""all ages admitted."" The only part of this movie that is even remotely questionable are the scenes with Ursula, the end scene where she morphs into a giant creature. <br/><br/>Overall, I believe that this is a wonderful, well developed, kid friendly movie. It has such a wonderful moral and message to share with kids and families and I would recommend it to all young children."

","The Little Mermaid is stunning. It's absolutely beautiful. This is a movie that I liked and couldn't place my finger on why. I found it bothering that it seemed to give the message that looks are more important than personality... but as the story progresses I think it becomes obvious that Ariel isn't a hero and has been making childish decisions the whole time and that to me is what makes this so spectacular. Throughout, you buy Ariel as a character in such a beautiful story. This movie so perfectly portrays innocence. It also shows her father have a great arc about learning to let go. Aside from having a well told story, the music is some of the best Disney has to offer. Every one I could listen to on repeat. Lastly, the art Disney offers in the Golden Age is breathtaking. The Little Mermaid has such beautiful visuals (especially Ariel ;)) that put you ""Under the sea."" Definitely see this masterpiece!"

","The Little Mermaid (1989): Dir: Ron Clements, John Musker / Cast: Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, Samuel E. Wright, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Buddy Hackett: One of the very best Disney animations ever made. The fact that the title describes the mermaid as little indicates that she will accomplish great things. Her name is Ariel and she is sixteen and the daughter of a sea ruler. Like any teenager she is rebellious yet fun loving. When she takes a forbidden swim to the surface and rescues a Prince from drowning. When he awakens he remembers only her voice. Ariel dreams of becoming human so when she encounters the evil sea witch Ursula she exchanges her tail for legs but Ursula obtains her voice. The Prince must kiss her within three days or she becomes Ursula's slave. Other characters include a crab named Sebastian who sings, ""Under the Sea."" Directors Ron Clements and John Musker visualize her wondrous sea world with great colorful detail. Voice talents include Jodi Benson whom provides the voice of Ariel. Christopher Daniel Barnes voices the Prince. Pat Carroll voices the evil sea Queen Ursula as one of the very best of Disney villains. Samuel E. Wright voices Sebastian the crab. Buddy Hackett even lends his legendary voice to this extravagant, glorious adventure. Strong theme about raising rebellious inexperienced teens. Score: 10 / 10"

","THE LITTLE MERMAID<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite Disney films.<br/><br/>The movie is about a mermaid princess who dreams of exploring outside of the ocean. One day she saves a human prince from drowning and she falls in love. The problem is, she is a mermaid... so she signs a deal with an evil witch to change her into a human for 3 days. She now has a race against timer and has 3 days to make the prince fall in love with her, otherwise she becomes one of the witches weeds.<br/><br/>The story is great and there are so many great characters in this film. Ariel is the main mermaid that falls in love with Prince Eric. Her friends are there to help her through her adventure though. Flounder is her little fishy friend, Sebastian is her crab friend and Scuttle is her seagull friend. Sebastian is my favourite character in the whole film. He is so funny... but then so is Scuttle.<br/><br/>This is pretty much what you would expect from a Disney cartoon. It is a complete classic and is up near the top of the list in my mind near Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.<br/><br/>What I liked about this too is they didn't use famous names to sell it. I have never heard of any of the people who did voices for this movie. Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jason Marin, Buddy Hackett, Samuel E. Wright and Pat Carroll do the voices of the main characters.<br/><br/>This film is full of adventure, love and music. The songs are very catchy and you can't help but tap your feet along to the classic songs Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl.<br/><br/>This really is one of the best, and it is made even better because it was drawn and not computer animated. I always did prefer the drawn cartoons.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","When I first saw this film as a little kid, I wasn't really all that interested. I just thought that it was another stupid princess love story, which I hated. Because of that I never really gave this movie a chance. <br/><br/>Watching this movie as an adult, I realize that I could not have been more wrong. This film is a must see for all children, not only for the beautiful story of true love, but for the catchy songs, fun humor, and tear jerking moments. As an adult watching this film, I realize that this movie is not just a love story. In fact, the film isn't really about that. This film is about the father-daughter relationship between Ariel and King Triton. <br/><br/>When Ariel falls in love with a human, Triton becomes angry and destroys her things because he is afraid of her being hurt. Ariel does not realize this, so she goes to the sea witch Ursula and exchanges her voice to be able to walk on land and be with her prince. The love story in this film, sweet as it may be, is only a bonus to this film. The story is really about Ariel and Triton, and Triton's love for his daughter, so proved when he sacrifices himself and control over the ocean to protect her. <br/><br/>This film is for all of the daughters who have had trouble with their fathers,and all of the fathers who love their daughters more than anything."

","I love The Little Mermaid! I used to watch this movie on VCR everyday when I was a child, sometimes I even rewind it and watched it again on the same day; we had to re-buy it a couple of times since it was watched so many times it broke! I always dreamed to become a mermaid when I grew up. The songs are fun and will be stuck in your head forever, the characters are funny and Ariel is someone to really relate to. Wanting more out of life than what is handed to you and that your parents won't always support you in what you do but will love you anyway is a really beautiful thing to grow up with. Some jokes are even funnier when you grow up. I am now 20 years old and I still watch it very often and I know all the words and can sing along with all the songs."

","Singing sea animals+mermaids+humans=The Little Mermaid!<br/><br/>I enjoyed The Little Mermaid, like a lot when I was a young girl. When I went swimming, I pretend to be Ariel and sing ""Part of Your World"" with my horrendous singing voice (yes, my singing voice is very off key, monotone, or too pitchy). But I did it so YOSO (you only swim once). Ariel (Jodi Benson) has a voice like an angel and Ariel is my favorite princess EVER- she may be stubborn and spoiled, but she's determined, curious, and adventurous! I Love Ariel; she's just like me in some ways (I wanted to be a mermaid when I was younger!) So let's get back to the movie<br/><br/>The songs are freakin' awesome! When Sebastian and his animal friends sing ""Under the Sea,"" I want to be in the sea singing along and be with my sisters down there. That would be awesome! ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" sung by the fantastic villainess Ursula blew me away! It's just how she presented the song is so memorizing and freaky especially if you are part of that situation. ""Part of Your World"" is a showstopper, it's brilliant! All hail Jodi! She should be my singing coach if I had all of the money in the world. ""Kiss the Girl"" is cute, not as strong as the other 3, but I'll take it. The songs are some of the best that Disney has ever done, nuff said.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid has great and lively animation, Ursula is one of Disney's best villains (she and Scar from TLK are my favorite Disney villains of all time!!!!), Flounder is the cutest fish ever, it has a great plot, plus Jodi Benson as Ariel! How awesome is that?<br/><br/>I wish I could give this an 11/10 because this movie deserves that 11/10! Watch The Little Mermaid, it won't disappoint! So grab your ancient VHS player and watch the damn movie!"

","One of my favorite Disney classics of all time, I must have seen it about 100 times or more. This movie is about the sweet little mermaid Ariel who is dreaming about becoming a human so that she can be with her dream prince.<br/><br/>This has got to be one of the best animated movies ever made by Walt Disney Studios. I know the original novel of Hans Christian Andersen and the movie does not follow the novel completely. This doesn't affect the movie and the magic in a bad way, it just makes the story more dreaming and sweet.<br/><br/>Jodi Benson is the voice talent behind Ariel and she really does bring adventure and charm into the character. She has a very characteristic voice and sings beautifully, no doubt about that.<br/><br/>This movie is probably cherished and loved by all the little girls around the world. It has great music, sweet characters and a fabulous storyline. Simply fantastic."

","Despite being already a teenager I decided to watch The Little Mermaid and was pleasantly surprised how much I loved it. Not only does it have a compelling story, it contains tension, drama, action and of course lots of humor and catchy songs. It's hard to stand still whenever crab Sebastian makes all the sea animals sing ""Under the sea"". Sebastian was for me the real star of the movie and made me want to see the movie over and over again. It's not only what he does but also his expressions and the way he talks making him my favorite all time Disney character. Especially his scene with chef Louis is hilarious. That Disney actually produced a very different and more happy ending than the original fairy tale didn't bother me one bit. I love happy endings. I could find no errors in this animation and have to rate it maximum."

","What a magnificent achievement. I went to see this film in a theater in 1989 after seeing all the critical praise it had received, and was blown away by Alan Menken's score, its stunning visuals, talented voice cast and energetic musical numbers. Today we may take its adventurous nature for granted, but back then it was very different and new. Ariel was the first Disney heroine to take some action and drive the plot, instead of being dragged through it. More than 20 years later and it's still the best. No subsequent Disney film managed to be as original and heartwarming. The Little Mermaid goes straight to your heart, and stays there forever."

","A whole new era of Disney classics was made possible due to the success of this film. And 21 years later, it's still the best. The tired formula that ""The Little Mermaid"" inspired hit some highs (Beauty and the Beast) and some lows (Hercules) but it was never quite as fresh and magical as it was here. The story is also told very well. Disney later tried to pull off more complex stories and that almost turned out too complicated and confused (Pocahontas). The movie owes a great deal of its success to its music which is superb, cause top-notch animation and great characters can only take you so far in a musical. I am so grateful to have experienced this film way back in its original theatrical release. It is a genuinely first rate Disney classic."
"lisafordeay","10","2","2","21 September 2010"," My all time favourite childhood movie since I was a kid
","When I was a little girl I loved mermaids and fairy tales. I was so fascinated with this movie as a kid and here is why.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid is directed by John Musker & Ron Clement who also directed Aladdin and most recent The Princess & the Frog. The story is about a 16 year old mermaid who is best friends with a fish named Flounder and a funny crab called Sebastian. Ariel is a very lovestruck/optimistic girl who dreams of being part of the human world. Her father doesn't want that as he has something against humans and thinks that they are barbarians. One evening Ariel hears fireworks which is the Prince's ship and as she sees him she begins to fall in love with him despite the fact she knows nothing about him. So when she goes to the sea witch she turns her into a human for 3 days,problem is she can't talk as she gives up her singing/speaking voice to Ursula(who is the villianess in this movie). Packed with great music and a nice story not to mention the colourful charcthers, The Little Mermaid will always be an instant classic in my heart as I grew up watching it in the late 90's. I recommend this to all the Disney lovers out there.<br/><br/>10/10 for me as I loved it so much,i've got the merchandise(well I used to have an Ariel doll but she broke)and I will always love it."

","The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a classic. The animation is wonderful, the characters are likable, the music is some of Disney's best, and you feel the romance very well. Things like the animation of Ariel's hair floating in the water must have amazed audiences when it first came out. It doesn't have as many likable characters as some other Disney movies, but the ones that are likable are very likable. The music is fantastic. ""Under the Sea"" is one of Disney's best, and most famous songs. It is just so catchy. Then there are a few other great songs. Ursula's song ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" is really cool. Then there is ""Kiss the Girl"" which I think may be just as good as ""Under the Sea"". The romance is very well done, and you feel a lot of happiness from it. I'm a guy, and I'm willing to admit that I think this film is fantastic.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"
"Pilsung89","10","2","2","17 February 2010"," A definite Disney classic for the ages
","This movie is a classic. Everything about it is great. The story is interesting, the characters are nicely developed, the animation looks wonderful, the directing is good, the music is enjoyable, and the acting is great. It's easy to see how the movie revived interest in Disney animation at the time. And this is from a guy's perspective.<br/><br/>The story is about the mermaid named Ariel who is the daughter of King Triton, ruler of the ocean. Ariel is intrigued with the human world but Triton has forbidden contact with the surface. Eventually Ariel makes a deal with a sea-witch to become human, unaware of the real price she has to pay. That's the main idea of the plot without giving too much away.<br/><br/>The movie may be considered girly but that doesn't stop me from loving it. Ariel is one of my favorite Disney characters. She actually has a similar yet different personality than other Disney females of the time. Like others, she's interested in what she's not supposed to have. However, unlike others, she's not sour on guys. The movie is just plain awesome, plain and simple. If you've never seen it, Look it up."

Originally Disney wanted Joan Collins to voice Ursula but i'm glad they chose pat Carroll instead because she was a perfect for the role and what everyone must remember is that Ursula is not half an octopus but is half squid because it's less expensive to draw! Overall a wonderful Disney masterpiece that's way better than it's sequels. Gotta give it 10!"

","I've watched this movie since I was born basically, and I've loved it since I first saw it. The storyline, while not too complex, is captivating in a way, and the colors and scenery breathtaking. I couldn't get over the chemistry between characters and the catchy tunes when I was young.<br/><br/>Recently, at 16, I saw the movie again, for the first time in MANY years. Even still, I loved this movie. I was again captivated by these same things, and learned to love the awkwardly adorable character of Eric (he makes me laugh n.n) I still find myself knowing the words to the songs, and singing along with them. The chemistry between him and Ariel when she can't speak is charming, and sweet to watch. I believe this is one of the last good Disney movies, and it will always be my favorite.<br/><br/>With Disney releasing all of the classics on DVD, I hope to acquire all of my favorites, and raise my children on movies such as this, just as I was raised. These movies always had something beneficial to the children, and this is my favorite by far."

","I love the fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen, and ""The Little Mermaid"" is one of my favorite fairy tales from him.

The animation and backgrounds are very beautiful and the characters are appealing. Also I thought the casting is very good too. I love Ariel, she's one of my favorite Disney Princesses along with Aurora from ""Sleeping Beauty."" Ariel's voice actress Jodi Benson is an excellent singing voice for the film; also suits her character. And you know, it's kind of hard to choose which film version of the story is the best. But I would say that this version and the Japanese animated version made fourteen years ago are the best versions; I'm not one to take sides you know."

This new generation of Disney movies was far from the old-fashioned Disney films of yesteryear - Snow White, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Alice In Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty and so forth. Prior to 1989, Disney attempted to make hit movies for a new crowd but the popularity of those films were never as great as the films after Little Mermaid. These films ""The Black Cauldron"", ""Oliver And Company"" and ""The Great Mouse Detective"" went straight to video and were never as big a hit as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, etc. Directors Ron Clements and John Muskers teamed up with musical lyricist and composer Howard Ashman and a talented cast of voice-over actors/singers to make this remarkable and fresh new version of the old Danish fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson. The film was a blockbuster, Disney had risen itself from a long dormant period and Disney movies were once again ""in"".<br/><br/>Ariel (Jodi Benson) is one of the many mermaid daughters of King Triton (Kenneth Mars), a merman who looks a lot like the ancient Greek sea god Poseidon, but she stands out from the rest of the merfolk by her passion for all things human. Bored of life under the sea, she admires humans and their creative abilities (art, objects) as her collection of human-made treasures attest. Before long, she falls for a human, Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) and her life is changed forever. Rebelling against her father who forbids humans and mermaids to have anything to do with each other, she consults the sea witch Ursula (Pat Carroll) an octopus woman who was banished from Triton's realm. Ursula has a vendetta against Triton for having banished her from court and craves his power as ruler of the ocean. She uses Ariel as a pawn in her revenge plot. Ariel signs a contract and basically sells her soul to Ursula in exchange for a human body, tricked by Ursula into thinking that as a human female she can marry the Prince. But there's a catch - the loss of her beautiful voice, the very thing which Eric associates with Ariel who had once saved his life after a shipwreck. He remembers her singing voice. Her experience as a human girl, her attempt to get the Prince to kiss her and love her and her and the evil schemes of Ursula is the focus of the rest of the film, though it all happens pretty quickly. With the help of Jamaican crab/symphonic conductor Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) guppy fish Flounder (Jason Marin) and the confused, scatterbrained seagull Scuttle (Buddy Hackett), Ursula is defeated and she is even able to convince her father that Prince Eric is the right man for her after all. Sure, this plot which ultimately boils down to good versus evil and true love conquers all in classic Disney style is not true to the original tale by Hans Christian Anderson, whose story is darker and more tragic, about Ariel's frustrated attempt to gain the Prince's love, even after the sacrifices she's made, resulting in her suicide. Still Disney had a real winner here in many levels you have to analyze.The look of the film was innovative at the time. David Towns, a creative force behind production design/art, made this movie very realistic looking, like we're watching a drama unfold in the 19th century in an unidentified European seaport kingdom. The actors commit themselves to really fleshing out their characters, particularly Jodi Benson's Ariel, Kenneth Mar's Triton (the father/daughter relationship was a theme here) and Pat Carroll's devilish Ursula. Alan Menken's music was another attraction. ""Under The Sea"" ""Kiss The Girl"" and ""Part Of Your World"" are all signature Disney songs. This film was animated and made to sound like it's a live-action film and this was a very inspiring and new technique at the time (fire looks like real fire, the ocean sounds are realistic, and so forth). Perhaps the only minor quibbles are the poorer characterizations of Prince Eric and to a degree, Ursula, whose threat is not as great when you really think about it. Otherwise, this is a superb film, the one that made Disney movies exciting again. From 1989 to 1999 with the Disney film ""Tarzan"" a new decade of Disney was set. The Little Mermaid is about wanting something with all your heart, defying the impossible and going far to get it."

Youngsters will love it for the appealing story of the Mermaid and the human prince, and young and old will succumb to the charm of the animation and the humor.<br/><br/>The songs are a sprightly bunch, written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, and the background score deserved its Oscar too. In addition to the aforementioned ""Under the Sea"", ""Kiss the Girl"" is given inspired treatment and ""Part of Your World"" has a charm of its own.<br/><br/>Inspired moments of comedy, romance and drama, THE LITTLE MERMAID restored respectability to the Disney studio for its artistic worth and lay the groundwork for the future success of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and TARZAN."

Watching The Little Mermaid again at 17 years, I don't love it quite so much, but I can still say it's a very good movie.<br/><br/>Ariel is the youngest daughter of the king of the mermen. She dreams of walking as a human and when she meets a prince named Eric, she falls in love and trades her voice with a sea-witch in order to become human.<br/><br/>A plot summary like that makes this movie sound incredibly boring. Memorable songs and hilarious characters like Sebastian, a crabby crab that Ariel's father assigns to keep her in check, and Scuttle, a bird who thinks he knows everything but clearly does not, keep the story lively and entertaining.<br/><br/>This Disney movie doesn't inspire me with as many feelings of praise as the Pixar films or Beauty and the Beast or the Lion King. But it's a fun movie, and I have to say it has some of the best music Disney's ever put to film. Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl, and Under the Sea are great songs and make the movie worth seeing in themselves. Luckily, the rest of the movie is worth seeing too."

The movie set the standards and raised the bar for the later and most classic Diseny movies, such as ""Beauty and the Beast, ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"". After this movie a decade of successes follow for Walt Disney Pictures. <br/><br/>The movie is perhaps not as childish and simple as the earliest Disney works. It makes this movie more accessible and enjoyable for people of all ages, although it of course will be the kids that will enjoy this movie still the most.<br/><br/>Main thing that makes this movie such a great and memorable one are its classic characters. They are all memorable and entertaining in their own way. Ariel is a great main and likable main character that I'll bet many little girls admire. The comical reliefs of the movie are Scuttle, Flounder and Sebastian the crab. They mostly make the movie entertaining, although the movie lies its emphasis on the love-story between the mermaid Ariel and the human prince Eric, that is well developed and written in the movie. The love-story is very pleasant to watch, which without kidding makes this one of the very best romantic movies ever made, that never gets too sappy or not believable. But also the villain is a great and memorable. Ursula the sea witch is perfectly villainous that works of course as an entertaining one as well.<br/><br/>Also a reason why this is a classic are it's great memorable sing along songs. This movie features some of the very best and most memorable songs out of all Disney movies. <br/><br/>The imaginative underwater world is well made and works perfectly entertaining as the backdrop for the movie its story. The best sequences of the movie are also set underwater. The animations are superb.<br/><br/>The voice cast is great. It doesn't feature any big names, with perhaps the exception of Rene Auberjonois but he plays a very, very little part in the movie. Ariel has a perfect girlie and signing voice, both provided by Jodi Benson. Pat Carroll is also perfect as the villain Ursula but perhaps the best piece of casting is Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian. His voice is what makes the character interesting and is the reason why his character works entertaining as well.<br/><br/>The movie is of course not without its flaws. The movie is quite short with means that some things are too rushed and the story doesn't always get developed to the max. Some of the characters are underused in the movie as well, such as King Triton and the villain Ursula, who perhaps appears a bit too late and too sudden in the movie. The movie is also perhaps not as humorous as most other Disney movies but it really is the wonderful well written love-story that compensates for this.<br/><br/>A great and wonderful bar raising animated picture, that marked the beginning of the decade of perhaps the greatest full length Disney animated pictures. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","When I was a kid, I used to think this was just the tiniest bit more aimed at girls, but I do like all the music and the story. This story is about a troublesome mermaid, Ariel, who has always been interested in being like a human. She one day sees a ship and sees the man of her dreams, she even rescues him from a storm. When her Dad finds out he is furious. Ariel goes to the witch Ursula (with octopus tentacles) who turns her into a human for three days. She has to kiss his love, Eric, before the sun sets on the third day. The Caribbean accent and fun Sebastian may steal the show, but I agree with what Jim from American Pie says about Ariel, ""she's so hot"", for a cartoon character. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Alan Menken and Best Song for the great ""Under the Sea"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Song for ""Kiss the Girl"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"

","The Little Mermaid is a spectacular movie, and it saved Disney Animation from going under. It ushered in the second Rennassaince. Perfect songs, magical vocal performances, spectacular animation all in the highest Disney tradition.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid is the tale of a beautiful young mermaid named Ariel who longs for something more than what she has in her life, namely to live on land and to 'be where the people are'. She saves a young prince from drowning, and falls in love at first sight. It is her beautiful voice that wakes him. After her father finds out, and smashes all of her precious human finds in her grotto, she sets out to get Prince Eric, by making a deal with an evil sea witch. What follows is a frantic race against time, before the sun sets on the third day.<br/><br/>Somewhere under the sea and beyond your imagination lies an adventure in fantasy...........This sums up the whole film really. Winner of two very deserving Oscars, and two Golden Globes, it was a winner with both critics and the box office. Ariel was the first immediately popular Disney heroine, and she has become an iconic figure with Disney. Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel) is still doing voice work for Disney now, as part of the new Disney Princess line.<br/><br/>This film has been loved since it was first released, and is a true Disney Classic in every sense of the word."
"Chessack","10","2","2","27 September 2000"," Highest possible recommendation.
","This film was the first of the ""new generation"" (i.e. post-Michael-Eisner) of Disney animated classics, and remains the best of the new breed. Jodi Benson's voice as Ariel the Mermaid is unmatched in vocal quality -- she's literally the best singer I've ever heard. The animation is Disney-quality (i.e. wonderful), and there are lots and lots of little ""underwater touches"" in the movie, such as when Triton says, ""I consider myself a reasonable merman"" instead of ""reasonable man."" You don't notice them overtly, but they slip their way into your subconscious, so that you really believe you are watching what goes on ""under the sea"". Add to that a fabulous Allen Menken score and witty Howard Ashman lyrics, sung by Jodi's voice, and you've got what I consider to be the greatest musical film (of any type, including those with live actors) ever made. Highest possible recommendation."

"Atreyu_II","9","3","4","7 July 2007"," A triumphant Disney gem
","The 28th animated Disney classic is said to be responsible for Disney's renaissance after a dark period during the 1980's decade. Back then Disney was in a delicate situation. I wonder what would have happened to Disney if ""The Little Mermaid"" hadn't been made or if it hadn't been a success.<br/><br/>""The Little Mermaid"" is one of the greatest animated films from Disney. It has fine artwork and palette colors, classic humor, adventure, darkness, great animation, awesome songs, enjoyable characters, romance... in other words, the crucial gradients that make Disney classics. Some mythology is here either, considering it's a movie about merpeople.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fresh, with jaunty songs such as ""Under the Sea"" and ""Les Poissons"", the romantic song ""Kiss the Girl"" and the somewhat sad song ""Part of your world"". Even Ursula's song, ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", is good.<br/><br/>As for the characters, the goofy seagull Scuttle and the Chef Louis can be perfectly considered a comic relief, although Sebastian is often hilarious too, especially in the kitchen where Chef Louis is (Sebastian's facial expressions of horror and panic are priceless).<br/><br/>Scuttle has a comical way to teach things about human artifacts and respective cultures. For example, he refers to a fork as a ""dinglehopper"" and says that it is used as a comb. He also calls a smoking pipe a ""snarfblatt"", telling it is used to play music as if it was a trumpet. Scuttle also sings terribly, but he sings much better than many self-claimed artists in the world of music. Although goofy, Scuttle is smarter than he seems. He discovers, for example, the true identity of ""Vanessa"" and he does a hilarious destruction of the wedding (with the help of other birds and animals).<br/><br/>Prince Eric is one of Disney's coolest and most charming princes. He's handsome too. Grimsby is funny at times. Ariel is a pretty mermaid and she looks even better as human. Ariel is one of my favorite Disney princesses, for her sexy looks and feminine personality. Ursula, the evil sea witch, is one of Disney's biggest villains and one of the most eccentric too. Max, Eric's Old English Sheepdog, is a cute fellow.<br/><br/>I wonder what kind of fish Flounder is. Maybe he is not a particular kind of fish. Perhaps he was just drawn that way, fruit of the artists's imagination. He is a cute little fish, friendly and cool. He is also very nervous, shy and gets frightened easily.<br/><br/>I don't know where or when this movie takes place, but I suppose it is somewhere in Denmark.<br/><br/>As for the cast, there are many talented voices here: the inimitable comedian Buddy Hackett aka ""Tennessee Steinmetz"", Ben Wright, Rene Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Jason Marin, Samuel E. Wright, Kenneth Mars and Pat Carroll.<br/><br/>This should definitely be on Top 250."

In all honesty, I prefer Atlantis to this one, but that does not mean this was not a superior film.<br/><br/>The story is a love story. Oh, there is adventure, betrayal, bravery, dancing, songs, high sea action, and some pivotal father/daughter moments, but all these elements come together to create one fine love story in pure Disney Romantic Comedy Adventure fashion.<br/><br/>This film is probably one of the sweetest love stories in the Disney vaults, and a must have in any Disney collection.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","I love The Little Mermaid. It happens to be my favorite Disney movie even though I'm a boy in 11th grade. I love the characters. My favorite being Scuttle the forgetful but funney Seaqull. I loved it when he sticked the fork thinking it was a dingle hopper into his hair and it made his hair stick up! I also liked it when he tried to sing during Kiss the Girl song but his singing sounded awful! Those were both hilarious scenes! John Musker and Ron Clements were smart to cast comedian Buddy Hackett in that role! I'm also a fan of Ursula the seawitch because I think she looks like my Aunt Pat. The one scene where I see my aunt as Ursula is when Ursula says to Ariel You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the importance of body language! That's where I say that's definitely my Aunt Pat! I also like the songs written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. I love Part of Your World. It's probably the best song in the movie! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, songs, and story Little Mermaid in my opinion is the best Disney movie ever! It will always be my favorite even though I'm a boy. I'm sure Walt would of liked it if he could of seen it! He'd probably call it the Snow White of the 1980s. 10/10."
"Lord-of-Altair","2","22","53","16 April 2011"," Dysfunctional relationships are just so sweet and touching
","I know I'm going to get death threats for this review from die hard Disney fans, but I don't care. The Little Mermaid is not my favorite Disney film. Sure, the animation is great and there are a few good songs in there, but that's all I have to say that is good about this film. <br/><br/>Before you harp on me saying ""But Disney sells smiles and had to give this story a happy ending compared to the original tragic story"", that is not the reason why I don't like this film. I think giving stories like The Little Mermaid a happy ending is hard to pull off, but it can be done. Just too bad the execution and lack of morals made this film hard to swallow.<br/><br/>The big beef I have with this film is the protagonist. Seriously, I really cannot stand Ariel. She's so much like Bella Swan from Twilight, that it's sickening. Ariel is superficial, spoiled, self centered, whiny, ungrateful and well, she's just about as smart as a door knob. Her dream is to have legs, but why? Because, having legs is cool and awesome and the new trend among mermaids. I know this is a family film, but that is not an excuse for cop out writing. If Disney gave her a more heartfelt reason why she wanted to be human, I would have liked this film some more. <br/><br/>As for Ariel being superficial, the only reason why she loves Eric is because he's handsome and a prince. Never mind that he's lazy, self-centered, vain, cocky, egotistical and downright idiotic, he's handsome, rich and famous, and that's all that matters. She even goes as far as giving everything up in life, so she can stalk him and be possessive of him, to the point where she throws a tizzy when he looks at people other than her. You know, if I were Eric, I wouldn't care if she lost her voice. I would ditch her if I were him. Partners who force themselves on you and get possessive of you aren't the good type of lovers. I don't care what Disney has to say about that.<br/><br/>As for Ariel being spoiled and ungrateful, she's rude to her family and friends, and treats her own family like a pile of garbage, yet her family and friends love her back. ""But she's a teenager"" isn't a valid excuse. Even teenagers who treat their family and friends like trash end up facing some punishment for their actions and mistakes. Hell, if I acted anything like Ariel to my family, they would have disowned me and send me to live on the streets. Well, Triton does try to punish her, but he regrets it later and lets her live out her wet fantasy of having a lazy and useless trophy husband.<br/><br/>Ariel's not being smart for selling her soul...I mean voice to the so-called ""evil"" sea witch Ursula. And why does she want this? Because her ""cruel family"" won't let her have a trophy husband from another world. Give me a break... <br/><br/>So to make the long story short, Ariel gets her wish, but then, Ursula makes herself pretty and seduces Eric. Instead of getting over it, Ariel gets possessive of Eric and stalls the wedding. But as she gains her voice, she becomes a mermaid and Ursula tries to turn her into a barnacle. But instead, Triton takes her place and a big battle ensures. Eric gets to do all the work while Ariel just cowers in a corner whimpering and crying. How sexist is that? I can see if this movie was made back in the 1940's, I'd be more understanding, but it was made in 1989. The same era She-Ra, Jem and other girl heroes came out. There's no excuse for Ariel to be a doormat. <br/><br/>So in the end, Ariel doesn't apologize to her family and friends, but they still give into her dream and she gets married right off the bat. They don't talk to her saying that she needs to know him better, because that would make sense. So Ariel gets married to Eric and has a child with him, at the age of 16! And he's an adult! No, that's not pedophilia at all. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, I can't believe this movie beat All Dogs go to Heaven and Little Nemo in the animation war of the 1980's. A film about a creepy, unhealthy and borderline dysfunctional relationship beating a couple cute, yet dark films about redeeming yourself (All Dogs go to Heaven) and conquering your fears (Little Nemo). The parental watchdog groups boycotted all Dogs and Little Nemo for being too dark and creepy, yet don't bat an eyelash to the diseased values in TLM?<br/><br/>Watch Little Nemo, All Dogs go to Heaven and The Dark Crystal to see what real family films are about. Sure, they have their dark and creepy moments, but they have likable characters and don't promote dysfunctional relationships.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of *****"
"avsroxbronxfan","6","6","11","11 December 2012"," Not bad, but overrated
","People say that The Little Mermaid was a classic, and a great way to start off the Disney Renaissance. While I think that it had a good setup, has many good things in it, and it could've ended up as one of my favorites, I say that this film has 2 flaws, and they're huge ones.<br/><br/>First problem is our main character, Ariel. She's just a bratty teenage girl who does the teenage clichés. She has a big motive, but disobeys her father and makes a deal with the sea witch, Ursula, to get what she wants. And in the end, she doesn't learn anything and still gets what she wants. If your main character is not likable, that's not a good sign.<br/><br/>My second problem is the morals. Like I said before, Ariel doesn't learn anything, but her father does. King Triton, at first, is an overprotective father who has the ""My way or the highway"" type of personality, but changes as the film goes along. At the end of the movie, he gives Ariel exactly what she wants. He learns to let his daughter go and not be so overprotective. Kind of a botched message, but I'm over analyzing here. I think this would work great if Triton was the main character, not Ariel. It's the main character that's supposed to learn in a movie, not someone else.<br/><br/>These are huge flaws indeed, but it doesn't make The Little Mermaid a bad film. There's tons of things to like, such as the songs, the animation, Ursula, some of the comedy, etc. Those flaws, for me, stop the film from being good. But the things to like in this movie stops it from being bad, in my opinion. 6/10."

","In the original H.C. Andersen story, the Little Mermaid dies. But because she learned to love unconditionally, she did not turn into sea foam (as mermaids do).

What struck me was how the Mermaid didn't get what she thought she wanted, but ended up with something much more important/valuable. It was probably one of my earliest spiritual experiences. <br/><br/>Thanks Disney! Take out everything special and put in some singing animals.

"TheUnknown837-1","10","3","5","4 December 2010"," Everything that makes a great animated movie can be found in this endlessly enjoyable masterpiece
","Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" is a case study of a great, classic animated masterpiece. Everything that makes a great animated movie can be found in the endlessly joyful eighty-three minutes of its running time. Gorgeous drawings, a smart and witty screenplay, instantly memorable characters, and a soundtrack which is packed with some of the most enthralling ear-worm pieces in motion picture history. ""The Little Mermaid"" was a favorite of mine as a kid. I hadn't seen it in a long time (I'm guessing at least half a decade) until just now and now that I have, I realize that span of time was far too long a one.<br/><br/>The story is based on the classic fable by Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen about a mermaid who falls in love with a human prince and longs, for more than anything, to become a human herself. Her name here is Ariel - one of the more lovably rebellious movie heroines - and despite the fact that her father commands her to stay away from ""fish-eaters"" she makes a Faustian bargain with a sea witch. Trading her voice for a pair of legs, she struggles to make the prince fall in love with her before her time runs out. Unlike the story, however, she has some friends in the form of a gullible, misinformed seagull, a skittishly fearful fish, and an ostentatious (in a good way) crab.<br/><br/>""The Little Mermaid"" is rich in every detail. It ranks alongside the other Disney classics such as ""Pinocchio"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Fantasia"" and ""The Jungle Book"" for this very reason. Everything about the picture was developed to the pinnacle of the creative potential. First of all, the drawing style. The movie is gorgeous to look at and admire. The oceans, the skies, the backgrounds both under the sea and on the land are not blank walls or phony backdrops, but a maze of captivating detail. The bubbles that form beneath the water and drift in and out of frame are a wonderful touch that makes you greatly appreciate the patience and enthusiasm of the artists. The characters are not sketched out, but also richly outline and hued with a plethora of colors. King Triton and Ursula the sea witch are two especially wonderful animation marvels as their expenditures (the wavy beard for the king and the tentacles for the witch) glide and motion with the water around them. And Ariel is one of the most beautiful Disney heartthrobs.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also what never fails to grab me in ""The Little Mermaid."" First of all, the musical score by Alan Menken is absolutely wonderful. Then there comes his rich and captivating songs. Although ""Under the Sea"" stole the Academy Award, but personal favorite is ""Part of that World"" where Ariel sings about her wishes to shed her fins and become human. Ursula has her own number and so do the crab Sebastian. These are not hack-job songs thrown together overnight. These were thought-out and rewritten again and again so that not one lyric seems misplaced or out of order.<br/><br/>But of course, the most important aesthetic qualities are the story and the characters. Ariel is a winner from the beginning for her rebellious, yet lovable attitude in which she does not come across as a brat, but as a visionist with a hopeful dream that forces us to follow her. King Triton is also a marvelously-written character with his conflicts both inner and outer. Ursula is one of the more gleefully enjoyable villains in recent movie history - as are her two minions, a pair of moray eels - and much attention must be paid to Sebastian the crab, who steals every scene that he's in. Then there are the humans. Prince Eric, despite his relative lack of screen time, is more memorable than Prince Charming was in ""Cinderella"" or the prince in ""Snow White."" There's a comical butler, a lovable maiden, and a gut-busting interlude with a chef wanting to serve Sebastian on a platter. Rich, wonderful characters in this rich, wonderful movie.<br/><br/>I'm a real sucker for love stories, but you don't have to be to be moved or touched by ""The Little Mermaid."" Even if you do not buy into the concept of true love...well, this movie might revision your outlook. And if not, well, it's just a darn good motion picture. It seals the attention of the younger generation and continues to work wonders on them as an adult. To me, it's even more admirable now because I'm older and wise enough to pick out the other really great things about it. In the early 90s, I would claw for it whenever we visited my aunt and uncle's house. Now that access to it is easier for me, it will be more frequent. What a wonderful movie!"

And I, for one, am getting a little sick of seeing the same old thing over and over.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the one major critisism I have about this movie, this is a reasonably good nostalgia buzz.

"ElMaruecan82","10","2","3","29 October 2014"," If greatness was made of waves, ""The Little Mermaid"" is a tsunami ...
","""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was a first step for Disney and a giant leap for animation. No other movie would share the same historical significance, until 1989, the year of ""The Little Mermaid"", less a giant leap than a big dive that would splash the audience and create a new wave of animated movies, a new age known now as 'Disney Renaissance'.<br/><br/>And 'Renaissance' is the word because it's truly a rebirth of animation after thirty years during which cost-cutting, Xerox processes and images-recycling lowered the very standards of perfectionism that forged Disney's legend. ""Little Mermaid"" put an end to that period, starting with the story. Adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's most famous work, it is the first Disney movie based on a fairy tale after ""Sleeping Beauty"", 30 years before, which means a whole generation of kids was deprived from princesses and magical stories, and it was time to make a change.<br/><br/>A darling for trivia fans, ""The Little Mermaid"" is the most expensive Disney movie made after Pinocchio and the first Oscar-nominated one since ""The Rescuers"" in 1977. It's also the film that reintroduced a new craving for musicals thanks to the fantastic Calypso numbers lead by Sebastian, the crab maestro, and the unforgettable ""Part of your world"". ""Mermaid"" would become the first Disney Golden Globe nominated for Best Musical / Comedy, a feat only surpassed by ""Beauty and the Beast"" two years later, not only nominated for a Golden Globe, but also an Oscar for Best Picture. Yet had ""The Little Mermaid"" failed at the box-office, we probably wouldn't have ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"".<br/><br/>But how could ""The Little Mermaid"" ever fail? It's infinitely superior to whatever was made after ""Sleeping Beauty"", the final masterpiece of an era where Disney had already pushed the envelope. ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and its millions of dark spots was still an impressive work but then, ""The Sword and the Stone"" started recycling images, and Disney buffs know all about the dancing sequences from ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Aristocrats"". Don't get me wrong, Disney never made a really bad film, and my favorite, ""The Jungle Book"" happens to be from the 60's. However, as far as animation was concerned, there was no new Disney milestone, and most movies were made of sketchy images and stories lacking that universal appeal.<br/><br/>The first serious attempt to recreate the old-school magic was ""The Fox and the Hound"" in 1981 but the film had a vague homely feeling that didn't bring the expected amount of escapism, there were no appealing songs and no risky moves à la Mufasa in ""The Lion King"". No matter how good the previous films were, something was missing, songs, animation, escapism, a sense of perfectionism on the form and universal appeal on the content, something that only exotic fairy tales could provide, ""The Little Mermaid"" awaited forty years in Disney's drawers, but it was worth it, the film was a tailor-made project to give animation its letters of nobility back. The film's success would multiply by 10 the working staff and would regularly bring home the two Oscars for Best Song and best Score.<br/><br/>To think that the Studios were reluctant about including the 'boring' ""Part of your world"" or thought about Sebastian as an English butler, see, the film also had that sparkle of luck, projects-that-must-succeed all have. But it's not just luck, animation, music or special effects, the film had to prove its value on the storytelling department and for that, Disney designed one of their most endearing heroines, Princess Ariel, King Triton's youngest daughter, a rebellious red-head without that bankable bad-assness. In Ariel, we have a teenager, to which any kid or adult can relate, with a thirst for discovery and adventures, a hobby (she collects human's items), a dream (to visit land) and a poignant mix of vulnerability and courage. She's not supposed to be a feminist model, but she's not submissive either so whoever finds her desire to change for a man, something insulting, doesn't know the effect love has on someone, regardless of any gender consideration.<br/><br/>I had –by the way- a huge crush on Ariel, and on Alyssa Milano from ""Who's the Boss"" so I was pleasantly surprised that she was modeled after her, she's simply sublime, and for a Disney heroine, the animators sure knew how to make her look subtly erotic, from my kid's perspective. And a figure like Ariel allows the film to explore so many cherished universal themes : coming-of-age, impossible love and the famous Faustian bargain. Ariel must trade her voice with the devilish Ursula, the octopus-like sea witch, to become a human and be in love with Eric. And what a Divine (from the original model) villain Ursula is. No other villain impacted viewers since ""Maleficent"" and ""Cruella"", with her body language, her voice and her smile, we wouldn't believe how evil she is, until the exciting and heart-pounding climax where she shows what a larger-than-life villain (literally) she is.<br/><br/>""The Little Mermaid"" is great on every single department, it's full of colorful and unforgettable creatures, there's also the late Kenneth Mars voicing King Triton, Ariel's patient father, there's the two villainous eels, a buffoonish French cook and there's Sebastian who sings the film's signature songs, ""Under the Sea"" that would inspire one of ""The Simpsons"" most hilarious musical numbers, and the atmospheric and subtly erotic ""Kiss the Girl"", to which I would have given the Oscar. Never had a princess been so expressive with her facial expressions than Ariel in that short segment, more than a plot device, her muteness inspired some of the best drawing from any Disney movie.<br/><br/>Thanks for Disney animators for giving another milestone in Disney movies and on its own, all trivia put apart, one of the greatest animated movies and musicals ever."
"raulfaust","10","2","3","21 April 2014"," Life as it is
","Well, as my parents tell me, ""The Little Mermaid"" used to be my favorite childhood movie. For some moments I doubted it, since I couldn't remember anything from it. Watching it now, I ended up out of words to express how much I enjoyed it. The main idea of Ariel trying to discover the whole world that there would be outside the sea is really intelligent, and encouraging for the kids. Writers involved in such storyline are VERY talented and surely deserve my sincere congratulations. The villain is well characterized, and scary as any other Disney one. One interesting thing to have in mind is that parents usually tend to teach their children what they know and think about the world, but sometimes they don't allow the kid discovering himself how things work. ""The Little Mermaid"" makes you wonder about the world you live in, revealing a philosophically smart plot that should be seen in much more animated films. The love at first sight thing surely feels over in nowadays society-- mainly when you have Disney animations admitting it, like 2013's ""Frozen""--, but it is completely understandable to be seen in such old picture as this one. Also, there are some funny scenes to entertain the spectator, such as Sebastian's panic when he saw the cook decapitating all the fishes in the kitchen.

","I loved it it's much better than sleeping beauty and ALaddin. this cartoon is awarding cartoon long before lion King and Hercules. man, i wish I could see this movie. it's more thrill ride than Jurassic park. but this catoon is the hottest cartoon than any Disney cartoon. it's the most impressive cartoon like a beauty and the beast and lion king. for me this movie is hotter than hot cheetos. it's more real than Sleeping beauty. jam packed fun and joy. what more do you want from little mermaid? if you see the atlantis it is the story that is very similar than little mermaid.I would give this movie A+. but I feel comfortable with this movie and I feel love from her heart. I like ariel more than Aladdin just as i like simba and Hercules. so what do you want more from this hottest classic cartoon? what cartoon can be match to little mermaid. I say No Aladdin and sleeping beauty can be match to little mermaid. which cartoon movie do you want more Aladdin or little mermaid. make your choice!"
"Stompgal_87","9","2","3","4 September 2013"," My first Disney film that still holds up well today
","I fondly remember watching this film as a child alongside other Disney Classics such as 'Peter Pan' and 'Cinderella' and it is still one of my favourites to this day. I will also give it some credit for the first Disney film I remember seeing. I have recently purchased the Diamond Edition of this film on DVD in a triple pack with its sequel and prequel.<br/><br/>The animation is not quite as flat or sketchy as it was in earlier Disney Classics such as 'The Jungle Book,' 'The Aristocats,' and 'The Rescuers' since there must have been a slight improvement to it since 'Oliver and Company' (another favourite of mine) and I generally like animated films and TV shows set underwater (this one, the spin-off TV series, 'SpongeBob SquarePants' and 'Finding Nemo' especially) because I find them rather therapeutic. While some of its elements may differ from those in the original Hans Christian Andersen story (for example Ursula's rules regarding Ariel's transformation as a human differing from those in the original story), it has a happy ending that isn't rushed like the one in 'Cinderella.' Other parts of the film that hold up well are the majority of songs, especially 'Part of Your World,' 'Under the Sea,' 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' and 'Kiss the Girl' but the other songs are not quite as memorable. Nevertheless I liked the use of the Can-Can music while Chef Louis chases Sebastian through the kitchen. Despite the song 'Daughters of Triton' being brief and rather forgettable, I can still remember the shock of Ariel's six older sisters discovering that she is not in her giant clam shell as part of the concert and instead collecting human odds and ends. One iconic scene in this film is the one where Ariel leans on a rock with the waves splashing behind her while she sings another portion of 'POYW' after having rescued Eric from the shipwreck. It reminds me very much of the Little Mermaid statue in Denmark.Ursula is one of the most menacing villains I've ever come across while her eel assistants Flotsam and Jetsam are creepy.One slight difference I noticed between the Diamond Edition and the version I remember as a child is that during the first wedding between Eric and 'Vanessa,' the vicar's knobbly knees were removed because they were mistaken for something else that I'd rather not mention...<br/><br/>Overall this Disney Classic holds up today as well as 'Peter Pan' did. 9/10."

","I absolutely adore this movie. It's been my favorite Disney movie since it came out. No wonder it's still selling heaps of copies. It's an absolute classic that has aged so well. It's got great music, beautiful artwork and a witty script. I miss those days when an animated movie actually looked like an animated movie and not like some cheap video game. I miss that hand drawn artwork that graced films like ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", where you could actually appreciate the visuals. Credit for Disney, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a big step in the right direction. Anyway, ""The Little Mermaid"" would probably always remain my favorite."

","The Little Mermaid revitalized animation and Disney. The art form had vacillated quite badly in the 80's but this film came along and once again proved that an animated film can be fun, entertaining and worthy of critical acclaim all the same time.<br/><br/>A film in this genre needs to be judged by the characters, songs and imagery. Here we have them all at peak form. ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Under the Sea"" are two of the best Disney Songs ever. Sebastian and Flounder and the lovable, timeless comic relief sidekicks. And the images - Disney still has not and may never top the sequence to the two aforementioned songs.<br/><br/>But no animated film is can be great without a great villain, and Ursula the Sea Witch is one of the greats. Smarmy, sarcastic, evil, vengeful, arrogant, funny and everything else she needs to be, the character is brilliantly voiced by Pat Carroll and sings the single best ever Disney Villain song - ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"".<br/><br/>Recently watching Shrek, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2, I found it amazing that the most recognizable name in the credits for Little Mermaid is Buddy Hackett. Voice-over has been come hotly sought after work for A-list actors (just look at Shrek!) and they have this movie to thank.<br/><br/>I love The Little Mermaid. My wife and I saw it when we were dating and then I got to go again on the re-release with my daughter. It is a treat to be enjoyed over and over again.<br/><br/>**** out of ****."

","My now grown-up daughters wore out only 2 VHS movies when they were children: This movie and the original movie version of ""Annie"". (It takes between 60 to 100+ ""runs"" through a typical good-quality VCR to do this.) Their favorite song was ""Part of Your World"" which my (at the time) 11 year-old daughter sang on stage in full costume, at school. I still have this on a VHS ""home movie"". Truly amazing in every respect: Animation, adaptation. original story, songs and orchestration. Great voice actors. Still a favorite to this day; now with my grandkids. Is it a ""girl's movie""? Yes and no. As a (male) adult I thoroughly enjoy viewing it, even today. Their grandmother enjoys it as well. It was somewhat controversial in 1989, with the exaggerated-impossible ""teen-age figure"" of Ariel. Buddy Hackett as the seagull and Sebastian the Crab (Samuel E. Wright) steal every scene they appear in. Pat Carroll is deliriously evil as Ursula the Sea-Witch who comes to an explosive end (which some critics deemed too violent.) Entertaining and fun with a beautiful, happy ""Disney Ending"", which is far superior to the Hans Christian Anderson tale, which doesn't end well at all."

","Just reading some reviews on here for this and to be perfectly honest in this day and age it's so easy to get offended by things.

That's right the music is what stuck with me. It wasn't the message I was interested in after watching it was the singing and songs.
Plus my favourite animals have always been Dolphins/Whales, so therefore I loved this film straightaway.
As for the film itself as a 40 year old woman I still do not see why people are still getting offended it's just an animated film. I still love this film now as much as I did 31 years ago. It's a fun colourful film to enjoy any day of the year and if I do ever have children I'd definitely would show this them. My 6 year old niece loves it as much as I do"

","This Disney classic, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, tells the story of Ariel. She is a sixteen year old mermaid princess who has always been fascinated with humans and the surface world despite rules forbidding their interaction. One day she swims to a ship and observes the crew. Here she first sees Prince Eric and immediately falls in love. The ship is then wrecked but she saves him; he doesn't see her but when he wakes on a beach he remembers her beautiful voice as she sang to him. Triton, Ariel's father, forbids her from ever going to the surface again but when Ursula, the devious Sea Witch, offers her an opportunity to see Eric again she accepts. There are catches of course; firstly if she doesn't make him fall in love and kiss her within three days she will belong to Ursula and secondly it will cost her voice so she can neither speak nor sing. She is reunited with Eric but getting to love her will be hard; especially as Ursula will use many tricks to prevent it. Along the way she is joined by her friends Flounder, Sebastian the crab and a gull named Scuttle.<br/><br/>I found this film to be a real delight; the story may be fairly simple but it provides thrills, laughs, enjoyable songs, a few scary moments and of course romance... all in a film that is suitable for viewers of all ages. The animation is of a high quality with character designs that are quintessential Disney... a pretty princess, a handsome prince, animal sidekicks and a villainess nobody will mistake for one of the good guys! The characters are nicely expressive; even when Ariel can' speak a work it is clear what she is thinking. The story plays out nicely with no scene outstaying its welcome; all leading to an impressive finale. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of animated movies whatever your age... it is a delight."

","Credited with really starting Disney's animated Renaissance, my wife was determined to make me watch this with her over the festive holiday. How could I resist?<br/><br/>Adapted from the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale, it's excellent family entertainment, with a suitably sympathetic pair of young lovers at the heart of its story, a disagreeably bad villain in the guise of the wicked witch of the sea and a fine soundtrack of catchy songs perfectly in simpatico with the plot.<br/><br/>Of course the under-the-sea settings with its exotic creatures give the animators plenty of scope for colour, imagination and flair and they don't let us down. I wasn't sure the story required that Ariel actually lose her voice for a significant period of time, but if it's in the original story (and I haven't checked) then fair enough, I suppose.<br/><br/>There's nothing earth-shatteringly original in this movie which looks backward to Disney's glorious fairy-tale legacy of youthful innocence being corrupted by some evil menace going all the way back to Snow White, but modernised as here with some good jokes and today's music, it happily updates the studio's legacy and of course set the path for the great successes the studio and its PIXAR affiliate has enjoyed ever since."
"lizzieejohnson","8","1","1","5 August 2016"," Magical <3
","This movie is a classic that everyone has heard about. It is an original concept, combining both the worlds of the mythical sea and the magical kingdom off-shore. This story follows Ariel, a 16 year old willing to explore, who has seen her magical one true love. He is however a human, which is forbidden by her father, King Triton. She then makes a deal with Princess Ursula that she can become a human for three days, giving up her voice and her ownership of herself if she does kiss Prince Eric before the end of the third day. This movie is a classic Disney movie with a refreshing plot. The musical score is amazing in this film and I must admit, I caught myself humming to the music. It is definitely simple to understand, and more geared towards young girls, however is plausible as long as you like Disney films. A must see for Disney lovers."
"thesar-2","10","1","1","20 January 2016"," A Cut Above
","(I present to you: My 1,500th review. And I just *had* to pick a movie that has been Part of my World for almost 30 yearsCheers!)<br/><br/>It won't cost muchJust my blood.<br/><br/>Starting with 1988 and deep into 1989 I began my love affair with cinema. To date, that last year of the 80s is my favorite twelve months of movies of any year. I saw everything, anything I could use my little cash on. Some repeatedly and some I would cherish for life. Of all the ones I loved so much: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and (my first ever James Bond feature) Licence to Kill, late in the year would come a movie that would mold me, bring me joy, heart and love: The Little Mermaid.<br/><br/>It would do so much to my life, but for starters, it would get me hooked on Disney. I never really grew up on Disney and at 15, in 1989, I had seen some Disney ""cartoons,"" but never was the biggest fan. Until November 1989. <br/><br/>I loved this movie. Everysinglesecond of it. For the time, it was inventive, explosive and offered both a fantastic script and daring visuals. I was captivated and sang along to the words of the songs that would stay with me for nearly 30 years.<br/><br/>To date, today, on January 20, 2016, watching this movie for the first time in a decade or more and probably the 100th time, all the same feelings, joy, tears, smiles and laughter were all the same. As if I was watching this masterpiece for the first time.<br/><br/>Yes, I sang right along with each musical segment. But, I also laughed out loud, even as an adult at the classic and harmless humor. (They didn't need to make this PG-13 for adults to partake like they do nowadays.) I still loved every bit of it, even after almost three decades had passed since my first viewing.<br/><br/>Teen Mermaid Ariel dreams of something more, a grass-is-greener scenario, and with her father inadvertently pushing her into the magic of the witch, she gets her wish. Butwith a price. <br/><br/>It's easy now to see how this inspired many more Disney animated features and attractions. And it's almost forgotten with great efforts since, including the follow-ups like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King and pretty much all of Pixar's films. Too bad. Ariel started it all and will always hold the biggest portion of my heart from anything Disney can throw at me.<br/><br/>FunnyI have barely mentioned the music above. The music. The MAGNIFICENT MUSIC. The incredible songs that I cannot help but sing out- loud and even dance with as if I were a child even younger than when I first saw this. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the top two are definitely ""Part of Your World"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls."" That's not to diminish the excellent other tracks that I still sing with the top of my lungs, but those mean the most to me for both heart and cleverness. <br/><br/>So, the music's great. So is the score, the dialogue, screenplay, cinematography and heart. In fact, there isn't a flaw here and no child or adultshould be denieddown where it's wettertake it from me.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Hilarious, but not really at the time, but the viewing in theatres I remember the most was 10 years after the film's initial run. In classic Disney fashion, they re-released The Little Mermaid back in the theatres for its 10th Anniversary and I just had to go back to seait again on the big screen. That day, sometime in 1999, I was working on my homemade computer and cut my right, middle finger. Pretty bad – tons of blood lost, more than I'd ever see leave my body before or since. Though a pretty deep cut in my fingerprint, I chose just to let it bleed, bandage it – multiple times – and go see The Little Mermaid again with hopes it would stop bleeding before the feature began that Sunday. <br/><br/>Rarely will I recall that experience, nor look directly at my middle, right finger, but when I do see that scar left, 17½ years ago, I will always be reminded of The Little Mermaid. She might not have actually cut me, but Ariel became a part of me for life."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","1","5 January 2016"," As Good as You Remembered It
","Just got the Diamond Edition and watched this in Blu-Ray, so what better time to review it than now.<br/><br/>For the maybe one of you reading this who hasn't seen The Little Mermaid: it is the tale of Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid who falls in love with the dashing Prince Eric, much to the dismay of her father, King Triton, who forbids her from going up on land. So what is she to do but make a deal with the sea witch, Ursula? Having three days to- without her voice- make Eric fall in love with her or join Ursula's posse of poor, unfortunate souls, she tries her hardest and is helped by the King's hand, Sebastian the crab, and her friend, Flounder the... um, flounder. But Ursula does not play fair, and has a sleeve full of tricks.<br/><br/>I won't spoil what happens, but again, you already know.<br/><br/>This is the film that kickstarted the Disney Renaissance, that brought The Studio That Walt Built back from the brink of oblivion and to artistic and financial prominence. Imaginative to the core, it was a major step forward for Western animation. All modern Disney movies are built off the Little Mermaid as much as the Bambi or Snow White, perhaps more.<br/><br/>I'd go into the songs, but what's the point: you all know how good they are. My personal favorite is Part of Your World (also Ariel's leitmotif, if you listen) but everyone has their own favorite. They have become cultural touchstones for everyone over a certain age, a light in a pit of darkness. Alan Menken is one of the greatest composers of modern times, and I will hear no word to the contrary.<br/><br/>Ariel is my favorite Disney princess of all time, and certainly my favorite of the 2-D era. They do not try to make her too much of a role model for girls and thus too perfect. She is imperfect and there is nothing wrong with that. She has so much personality, so much energy, so much curiosity. Anyone who doesn't like here has always struck me as someone that I want to stay far, far away from.<br/><br/>If you were wondering, the Diamond edition is definitely worth it. The animation was beautiful for its time, and it still holds up today, but with the boost of digital restoration, it pops. The water is so blue, Ariel's hair is so red, Flounder is so yellow, and so on and so forth. If nothing else, it's worth buying just for that ten-second clip on the menu screen, of Ariel bathed in the light of a full moon. This movie is eighty-five minutes long. I could stare at that clip for that long and then some.<br/><br/>If you expected me to say something negative about this, sorry to disappoint you. It doesn't quite have the awe factor of The Lion King, but it is a starkly innovative film that has impressed generations already, and will continue to impress more generations in the coming years."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","17 September 2015"," Something's starting right now
","The end of the 80s was a good time for Disney Studios. They had managed to avoid closing down with The Great Mouse Detective, Oliver & Company had beaten The Land Before Time at the box office, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit had been a huge success. And it's that last movie that would lead directly to the creation of this one, and the beginning of Disney Renaissance, the undisputed Golden Age of Disney Animation. And the reason is that they managed to bring over a lot of the animators that had worked on Roger, thus bringing a lot of new blood and energy into their animation team. Add in the musical virtuoso Alan Menken and you had all the right ingredients for something magical.<br/><br/>And this is the first result of all that labour, love and effort. Adapting a story of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, it tells about a little mermaid - what a twist - named Ariel, the youngest daughter of the sea king. Ariel is the loveliest of the daughters and the one with the most beautiful voice. Nevertheless she's a problematic child to raise, for she's endlessly fascinated by the human world above the waves, which has long been the source of misery for the sea folk. Things start to unravel as Ariel saves a drowning prince from a storm, naturally falling head over heels for this tall, dark stranger. As Disney princesses do.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid is the source and well of a lot of things we have come to accept as Disney hallmarks. The Broadway musical style of songs, the fairy tale structure and source materials, the lavishly lush animation, the humorous side characters, the romance, the prince and the princess, the themes of yearning, acceptance, hope and dreams. Naturally other Disney films had had these things before, but in this film they all came together and took the shape and form we all recognize today.<br/><br/>And it's a very good example of that classic Disney formula. Especially on the musical side of things. This film has one of the best soundtracks out of all the Disney films. All the songs are classics, they're all catchy beyond belief and instantly recognizable by any member of modern society. Kiss the Girl is probably my favourite, closely followed by Poor Unfortunate Souls, but they're all great.<br/><br/>It's more than likely that you've all already seen this film, but if by some miracle you haven't What are you waiting for?"

The deal allows her to be human for three days but she must make the man she loves love her in return.<br/><br/>THE LITTLE MERMAID was an incredibly important picture for Disney because they animated features were really lacking any classics but this film came along and put them on the map and it would kick off a tremendous run of titles that would include BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN and THE LION KING. This here was certainly a return to the highest form for the studio and it's easy to see why this was such a hit back in the day and continues to gather new fans with each passing year.<br/><br/>All of the classic Disney things can be found here. You've got a good story. You've got a beautiful princess who wishes for something more. You've got a terrific villain. You've got a great group of supporting characters. Then there's the beautiful animation, the wonderful songs and of course there's just a good-nature that runs throughout the picture. The fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen certainly fits in well with Disney as it contains a story that's easy to follow and the studio just gave us characters to like and care for.<br/><br/>The Ariel character is just so sweet-natured that you can't help but hope she gets her dreams. Then there's the crab and Flounder who are both funny in their own way and of course there's a rather dumb seagull who can't really do anything right. The animation is some of the best stuff the studio did since their films in the 1940s as it's just so colorful that it really does creature a terrific world and the ""Under the Sea"" song really captures a certain spirit that makes it one of the best songs from the studio."
"rcolgan","9","1","1","22 May 2015"," One of the Best Disney Classics
","The Disney Renaissance is one of the best recognised periods of the Disney animation studios, where Disney released many of its most creative, successful and all round incredible films. Whilst the start of this renaissance could arguably have its roots in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the Little Mermaid is definitely the film that led Disney towards its focus on a Broadway musical style and brought Disney animation back to the high quality that it had been lacking in previous years. It brought to life an incredible fantasy world though a mixture of great characters, stunning animation and quite possibly the best soundtrack that Disney has ever had. <br/><br/>We get to follow Ariel, the youngest daughter of king Triton, who has become enamoured with the creativity of the human world and set her eyes on the dashing prince Eric. Whilst she longs to be part of the human world she becomes forbidden by her father to ever make contact with them. However in defiance of her father, she turns to the evil sea witch Ursula who creates a spell where she may walk on land to find her true love, but on the condition that if she fails to get the kiss of true love will become a slave to Ursula. <br/><br/>Ariel is well above any Disney Princess that had come before her, with a genuine desire for adventure and her willingness to defy her father making her a very endearing and lovable figure. Just watching her childlike innocence and wonder as she discovers more of the human world makes her a real delight to watch. Similarly, Ursula is also up there with some of the best Disney villains. She comes over as being such a sinister Machiavellian character who manipulates emotions exploiting Ariel's youthful recklessness and longing for love in Poor unfortunate Souls. There's also a lot of great supporting characters like Flounder and Sebastian that keep the laughs coming in fast and strong. <br/><br/>All of the animation in the film is nothing short of Disney magic. Every painstaking detail that must have taken countless hours to draw the stunning underwater environments was truly worth it creating something superior to anything that had come before it. From the small details of bubbles floating up to the sight of the sunlight hitting the ocean floor, no expense was spared and a true thing of beauty was created because of it. Beyond this the way in which the characters move throughout is also something to behold. The lifelike movements of Ariel as she gracefully flows through the ocean is wonderfully detailed with incredible touches of how her body sways through the water to her hair floating as she moves. <br/><br/>Then there's the soundtrack and from the jig score you hear when Ariel first sees Eric to the big song pieces, the entire film is packed with some of Disney's most memorable and enjoyable songs. One highlight is obviously Under the Sea, being one of the catchiest tunes for kids to sing and working as a lively upbeat reggae tune. Though as great as Under the Sea is, Part of Your World is quite possibly one of the most stunning musical sequences put to film. It is quite possibly my favourite Disney moment as every emotional beat of the song really hits its mark and is a great song to showcase the stunning animation the film has to offer with the image of Ariel reaching to the surface being given a special place in my memory.<br/><br/>I loved this film as a child and I have only grown to appreciate it even more with age. It's music and imagery are worthy of all the acclaim it receives, being just as strong today as it ever was."

","When I recently rewatched this film after 20 years, it struck me that I enjoyed it every bit as much, if not more, than when I was a child.<br/><br/>Disney created in Ariel, one of their greatest princesses. Yes, she was impulsive and headstrong, but she was also, inquisitive, loving and kindhearted.<br/><br/>One of the great pleasures of this movie, was remembering how great animation looked before the days of Pixar(although Disney films still look great too!).

I highly recommend you see this Movie, it is one of the top 10 best Disney movies ever made and this is a film that everyone should see because it is so perfect and a legendary film that everyone will enjoy every time they see it! 10/10"

(not because of the ""hot"" guy he just was the point of no return she was into humanity before he entered her life) Why could Eric not become a merman?

","I think that this Mermaid guy is a pretty good picture. It is very beautiful with many colors. I really like colors. And this picture has many. Characters also have colors. Like Flumbri. That is my favorite character, He is like blue and yellow. That are my favorite colors to. He is also a table in my school. Many people have colors on table. I like colors. I like Flumbri. These picture should have a sequel with more Flumbri. These picture also have drag people. Like the bad coal-crab witch. I do not like these guy. Him made me cry. But Mermaid is good man. Him save the ocean and everyone be happy. I also like Flumbri. What a great guy. He is also a table. Table is brown, not very colorful but happy like Flumbri.

"g-bodyl","9","1","1","21 March 2014"," Classic Disney Film!
","The Little Mermaid is the very beginning of the Disney Renaissance that began in the late 80's. This film is a heartfelt film that is pure magic and one for the entire family to enjoy. It has some beautiful, magical songs such as the much-heralded ""Under the Sea."" The animation is light and actually pretty clear for an 80's animation film. This film is going to be impossible to resist and is one of the better Disney animated films ever made.<br/><br/>Based of the fairytale by Hans Christensen Anderson, Ron Clements film is about how a mermaid named Ariel makes a pact with the evil sea witch, Ursula to become human and she has three days to kiss her true love or else she will turn back into a mermaid and endure being her servant for eternity.<br/><br/>This film really has no famous voice-cast but I truly must single out Jodi Benson for her exceptional voice work. This is her first big voice role and she hits it spot on. She truly has a voice and proves it singing all these magical songs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a classic Disney film that harks back to the olden days of Disney. This begins the classics that were spawned out in the 1990's. A film of pure magic and a family delight. It's funny, romantic, and more emotional than one would expect. A very good film indeed. I rate this film 9/10."
"cavs09","8","1","1","31 July 2013"," So Delightful... The Best Disney Movie
","A tough claim to make, but there are just so many reasons why I believe this to be true. I loved it as a four year old in the theater when it first came out and I still love it. I just re-watched with my niece and can't believe anyone would rate this film poorly. I find it to be unique compared to the other ""princess"" Disney films - something about it is a little edgier, a little funnier. The music is fantastic (Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl have to be my favorite Disney songs of all time - love that little Calypso singing crab). It lacks potentially offensive cultural stereotypes and traumatic moments that might scar a child for life (thanks a lot, Bambi and Lion King). Even the antagonists are fun (just look at Ursula's LBD) There's just nothing not to like. <br/><br/>LOVE."

","Title The Little Mermaid Setting Under the ocean where mermaids and mermen live. But at the depths in the ocean there's the evil sea witch, Ursula. Plot Ariel,king Triton's youngest daughter,is fascinated by humans so she goes to the sea witch and asks to grant her wish of being human. So the sea witch makes her human for 3 days and in those 3 days she must get the prince to kiss her but sea witch asked for Ariel's voice,so she had to get the prince to kiss her without even talking to him! Favourite part My favourite part was when the sea witch dies. The cook was really funny when he tried to chop Sebastian(a crab)and ended up making a huge mess and he got scolded by the servant mistress! Ariel combed her hair with a fork in the dining room in front of the prince and sir Grimsby (the prince's royal servant)and the prince! Ariel pulls a puppet out of the wheel cart and a grumpy man pokes his head out and looks at her! Recommendation I think someone else will like this movie because it has a lot of songs,funny bits and all sorts of stuff. It is really active and fun. There's a really big storm. Everything is so new for Ariel! S. Age 7 This movie review was submitted as part of a class project where we learnt about writing book reviews and movie reviews. We hope it is useful for you."
"morphricky","9","1","1","8 July 2012"," My favorite Disney movie
","I used to watch this movie all the time as a girl, in Sweden we also got treated to the magical singing voice of Sissel for Ariel. A lot of great voices for the Swedish dub made this very enjoyable, most of the lyrics I remember even today.<br/><br/>I won't give it a full ten stars, because I wish there had been more development between Ariel and Eric. He is heroic, kind and considerate, but much more than that isn't known about him. He remains pretty much out of the spotlight to make more room for Ariel. At least the movie did good by making him so caring about the dog Max, and that the dog isn't just there for a comedic value.<br/><br/>The movie is fun, magical, frightening at times and the songs really lift up the movie. Even the instrumental music in the background are gorgeous to listen to."
"robert-710-767167","8","1","1","17 December 2011"," Wow... this was amazing!
","Most of the Disney classics seemed to sort of follow the same story. Good person, good intentions, gets intro trouble. Bad guy, is envious, good person somehow gets involved with the bad guy, things happen and in the end the bad guy is stopped and the good person lives.<br/><br/>This happened in this movie as well, however the plot was very unique for me. I just saw it for the first time and I was amazed by midway through. Sure the first true love kiss and all that is cheesy to some. Sure the mermaid falling in love with a prince (non-coincidentally hmmm?) seems cheesy as well. But the way the story went was very interesting.<br/><br/>Plus the songs. Got. to. love. them. AMAZING like Under the Sea and the others as well. Loved them!<br/><br/>The ending seemed to almost reach the same level as the rest of the movie, which is why it loses a point, unfortunately. From what I saw, a simple poke from a boat is what got rid of the giant evil witch. But whatever, the movie was great anyway!<br/><br/>Rated 8/10."
"RitikaS","9","1","1","7 February 2011"," A tail of never giving up hope
","The iconic scene of Ariel sitting on a rock, looking out at Eric and singing 'Part of Your World', obviously sums up what the film is all about- reaching your goals and never giving up, whatever the circumstances. A modernised adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's classic, truly speaks for itself. With the production stylings of Howard Ashman and John Musker, they have truly achieved this beautifully and really makes anyone emotional, every time they see it.<br/><br/>A story of a daring, sixteen year old mermaid, Ariel, who is fascinated by humans and what is beyond the water. When going against her father's rule that no-one was supposed to go above the surface, she sees the most beautiful thing ever- Prince Eric. With her side-kick, Flounder and the 'party pooper' Sebastian she goes to the sea witch, Ursula to get Prince Eric. However Ursula has other plans, that may ruin Ariel's chance with the Prince.<br/><br/>With the vision of producers, Howard Ashman and John Muskar and the crew behind them, they have captured this epic tale in such a way, that is true poetry- no lie. True, they have changed the ending from the original, all they want is that everyone goes home relieved that Ariel gets her happy ending, as opposed to the Hans Christian Anderson version, in which the feisty mermaid doesn't get her happy ending.<br/><br/>With a all-star cast, consisting of voices from: Jodi Benson (Ariel/Vanessa), Christopher Daniel Barnes (Eric), Pat Carroll (Ursula), Kenneth Mars (Triton), Jason Marin (Flounder), Samuel. E. Wright (Sebastian), Ben Wright (Grimsby), Buddy Hackett (Scuttle), Edie McClurd (Carlotta), Paddi Edwards (Flotsem and Jetsem) and Will Ryan (The Sea-horse), they have come together to make this creation come alive.<br/><br/>Overall, I do not think there is any fault with this film, as with the other films Disney has made. Just one word- AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
"moccos","10","1","1","25 July 2010"," The Little Mermaid
","This glorious Disney take on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale is one of the company's most successful and beloved films. It was an instant smash right from the start and is equally popular today. It's easy to see why. The music is top-notch Disney: including Sebastian's two show stoppers (Under The Sea and Kiss The Girl) and Ariel's now-legendary ballad, Part Of Your World). The artwork direction is spectacular: beautifully animated characters against detailed backgrounds of mainly deep blues and aquamarine. Ariel is the first Disney princess who actually helps move the plot forward and Ursula is the ultimate Disney villain. We own this film in 3 editions (1990 and 1998 VHS; 2006 DVD) as this has been a favorite of ours from the get-go. The Little Mermaid is excellent entertainment which I recommend to everyone. A definite 10/10."
"johnstonjames","9","1","1","18 July 2010"," Still Awesome After All These Years!
","i've always thought that 'The little Mermaid' was the last really, really great hand animated feature from Disney. i still love the hand drawn features, especially the recent 'Princess and the Frog' which i thought was the best they've done since 'Mermaid'. 'Mermaid' was the last animated feature that had a true ""feel"" of the old school Disney cartoons. not that i didn't like 'Beauty and the Beast','Aladdin','The Lion King' or 'Pocahontas', but those films just left me a little bit cold. they didn't seem to have the same funny, quirky, quality the old school stuff did. they felt sort of heartless and over produced. more emphasis on money and polished high tech looks than on charm.<br/><br/>'Mermaid' is not like that at all. it has an abundance of heart and charm and good old fashioned sincerity. everything about the movie clicks, is so much fun and it connects on an emotional level. 'Little Mermaid' is such a great film, very cinematic and a classic worthy of comparison with the Disney films from it's golden age. i wish i could say the same for the subsequent sequels and the popular television show which did nothing for the characters or added anything worthwhile to the memory of the original film.<br/><br/>despite the fact that 'Little Mermaid' has been so over exposed in the media with numerous sequels and product tie-ins, the original film still retains it's impact and survives all the hard driven ubiquitousness of recent years. i hope this delightful film is always remembered well despite the over exposure."

","Sixteen year old mermaid princess Ariel dreams of becoming part of the forbidden human world. When she falls in love with the handsome (and human) Prince Eric, Ariel makes a bargain with the wicked sea witch Ursula  in exchange for Ariel's voice she is made human for three days during which time she must make the prince fall in love with her and seal the deal with a kiss. Unfortunately for Ariel the path to true love doesn't exactly run smoothly.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid rescued Disney at a time when animated films were a dying breed. The movie is beautifully drawn, the characters brought to life by a team of talented animators. Aside from head-strong yet lovable Ariel the audience will fall in love with her naïve sidekick Flounder, her scatter-brained seagull friend Scuttle and the ever-watchful Jamaican crab Sebastian. The sea witch Ursula is a brilliantly evil, slimy squid who should strike terror in the hearts of children everywhere and on land gallant Prince Eric is surrounded by a bevy of colourful characters to keep everyone amused, from his stuffy adviser Grims to the insane French cook Louis.<br/><br/>The story is fresh and constantly exciting, helped along by the amazing and catchy musical numbers. Songs such as Part of Your World and Under The Sea have become timeless Disney classics and the score is beautifully executed.<br/><br/>With enough double entendre humour to keep the adults amused and enough colour and magic to keep the kids entertained, this is a true Disney classic  a gem that paved the way for more Disney animations such as Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. The Little Mermaid is a visual treat and a wonderful film, enjoyable for all ages."

","The Little Mermaid was a good film. The plot (You probably know the plot by now, if not, there's something wrong with you) there's a mermaid named Ariel... yada yada yada... she falls in love with a prince... yada yada yada... she sells her voice to a morbidly obese sea-witch named Ursula... yada yada yada... stuff happens; basically in the end everything works out fine. The songs are good; Jodi Benson has a nice voice. It's bizarre that Under the Sea won an Oscar. It's good, yes, but part of Your World was better. Anyway, this is a Disney classic. Without this film, you wouldn't have Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King. The Little Mermaid brought Disney back from the gutter. Man, this is a good movie.

","Before 1989, Disney had not had a successful animated film since the Rescuers in 1977. Disney entered a dark age in which I knew they would escape. But prospects seemed grim. Failures continued with Fox and the Hound and the Black Cauldron. In 1985, The animation staff began production on Hans Christian Anderson's, The Little Mermaid. They decided to turn Mermaid into a Broadway like musical. I think they began to build on to Mermaid by releasing the successful Great Mouse Detective, and Oliver and Company. The songs in Mermaid including Part of Your World, Under the Sea, and Kiss the Girl will never be forgotten. Mermaid was released in November of 1989 and became one of the most successful films of the year. I own both the 1990 VHS and the 2006 DVD. Mermaid is the foundation in which an entire renniscance was built. Soon Disney would release the Huge hits, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King all that might not have existed without the musical 1989 smash hit of The Little Mermaid."

","Once Upon A Time there was a group of animators who were in a pickle of mysteries after the previous pieces were second-rate. Night after night these animators would spend hours and hours of brainstorming. They came to no conclusion. Then a Disney Guardian Angel appeared and presented them with a story a very sad story. It was the tragic fairy tale of The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Anderson. So many of them caught on but some were iffy about how parents and children would act to the end. So as they had done to previous fairy tales, they adapted it to a happy ending. But as Disney does with all there fairy tales they put together an ensemble of songs and scores to make it work. For that they asked two Dukes of Music: Howard Ashman and Alan Menken to make that magic happen. Four years went bye with casting, editing, singing, compilation, and final drafting it was November 17th of 1989 and the movie was finished and was shown to the world. Surprised at the critics reviews The Little Mermaid was an instant hit with the edited storyline, songs, music, and characters it was great. As the pickle of mystery wore off as other classic were made after that it was not only a movie that changed Disney it inspired Disney to make more. And They Lived Happily Ever After. The End"
"wildanimals","10","1","1","27 December 2007"," Excellent Disney Classic
","I was never a fan of The Little Mermaid when I was a child, but after re-watching it, I find it to be a very funny, sweet and charming Disney film. It has everything that's typical of a good Disney movie - great music, a cool villain, likable protagonists, amusing sidekicks and a gripping plot.<br/><br/>I like Ariel's headstrong nature. She's rebellious and passionate without being 'bratty' like the 'adolescents' we see in cheap direct-to-video sequels. There is not a single sidekick that I found annoying. They all had their fair share in the story, and weren't just there for the sake of it. Ursula is one of Disney's best villains. She has a fabulous song and believable motives. I think she's pretty much the standard that many Disney villains are judged by.<br/><br/>The music is fun to listen to. The songs are unforgettable (if a bit too numerous for my liking). 'under the Sea' is especially catchy, but my favourite would have to be 'Kiss the Girl.' It's atmospheric without being over the top.<br/><br/>The animation is a little dated, but aside from that this is a must see Disney movie. It brought Disney back up to the top and revived animation. Too bad Disney made a crappy sequel (and a third one is coming soon)."

","Ariel is a bright, fiery young mermaid princess, who loves to explore with her friends Flounder, a fish, and Sebastian, a bossy crab, the adviser of her father King Triton. Exploring often gets Ariel into trouble, and she must sneak around on the sly. Ariel is hugely fascinated by the human world - and she secretly visits old shipwrecks and other places, and collects old human possessions. Despite knowing that humans are ""dangerous"", Ariel cannot stop herself, and is enchanted by this different world. She ends up saving the life of a Prince named Eric, after his ship as destroyed by a hurricane as she was watching it.After taking Eric to shore, Ariel sings to him with her beautiful voice. As Eric opens his eyes, Ariel flees, as she does not want to be seen, afraid of scaring him. Ariel falls for Eric, and he too, for her, just by her singing. When King Triton finds out Ariel loves a human, he is furious and forbids her anything to do with him, and smashes all her secret human possessions. Hurt, and very angry, Ariel visits the sea witch Ursula, and exchanges her beautiful voice, in return for human legs. Ursula's magic allows Ariel to be human for 3 days, and if Ariel can make the Prince kiss her before the sun sets on the 3rd day, she will be human forever...<br/><br/>I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and it has been my favourite Disney movie ever since. It was my first Disney film, and is still my all time favourite. I grew up singing the songs, talking like Ariel, I craved to be a real mermaid for years! The story, direction, animation, and character portrayal in this movie absolutely amazing - I loved every second. The best part I would have to say, is the music. My favourite song is ""Part Of Your World"", followed by ""Under The Sea"" and ""Kiss The Girl"". All songs are melodious and catchy, and tug at your heartstrings. Even ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" sung by Ursula was great. Even watching today, my opinion is the same. And I still remember all those memories I grew up with, thanks to this one film.<br/><br/>One of the best Disney has ever produced. Thank you."

","Of all Disney's animated movie, I think Mermaid is one of the best. Clemens and Musker really followed Walt Disney genius regarding story telling and adaptation of classic fairy tale. It is fun, charming, adorable, sweet, funny, and great. The characters are all very strong and unmemorable, especially Ursulla and Sebastian. The animation is beautiful. The score is THE best of all Disney's movie so far, and Menken had really been inspired. How many times i heard with great pleasure and smile ""under the sea"" ? The action is nearly non stop.

","Having seen this in Spanish and English, this movie is a great movie. Even if I watch this in a language I don't understand, I will still watch the movie. The movie is wonderful and magical. It's what I saw another user say, ""healthy to a child's spirit."" It's true. This movie has basically started the era of girls wanting to be princesses. The Little Mermaid probably made one hundred million in merchandising because so many children loved the movie.<br/><br/>I loved the music in this animated cartoon. They make up most of the movie and make it even more wonderful. ""Under the Sea"" has been a favorite to many since this movie has came out. Also, Ariel's song and voice. Jodi Benson did a good job on Ariel. Also, Kenneth Mars did a good job on King Triton. Both of those voices are one of my favorite. Actually, the crab being above King Triton.<br/><br/>Since this movie is so old, I do not remember this movie much but I will try my best to describe the plot. Although, that is only an option. Ariel wishes to be human. She seen a prince on a ship, and she suddenly falls inlove with him. When his ship crashes, she comes and rescues him while he is knocked out and places him on an island with the rest of his crew. He sees her for a second and her voice but she leaves in one blink. Ariel makes a deal with Ursula, which I wouldn't recommend doing, to make her human if Ursula takes her voice. By a week, I think, if she doesn't get kissed on the lips by someone beautiful, she turns back into a mermaid. She takes the deal because she thinks the prince will kiss her. Ursula turns into a human with Ariel's voice, and the prince was more inlove with the voice than Ariel's looks. He decides to marry Ursula. Ariel tries to stop it, it doesn't work and she is turned back into a mermaid and Ursula transforms herself back to the evil witch of the sea she was. She has the tridant and King Triton is no longer.. king and mighty. In the end, she is killed by the prince. Ariel's father turns her into a human because he loves her. Everyone lives happily ever after. Also, Ariel has her voice this time.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for everyone. This was a wonderful movie and I recommend you to watch it as much as you can before someone remakes it and it will be hard to find this version that you all know and love. I know my plot above isn't all great and maybe not much correct, but I did my best."

","This is one of those important cartoon movies that people from my generation, when it first hit the theaters, will share with their own children and grandchildren.<br/><br/>The fun part about seeing an old childhood favorite is seeing it differently when you are an adult. King Triton is moreso a father figure than a monarch. However, his given title implies that he represents a political figure heading a monarchy. Ursula's first lines indicate she formerly held a government job under Triton and then was discharged for who knows what, and now she wants revenge. Ariel clearly represents the average teenager, adventurous and rebellious. King Triton is not very good with foreign affairs concerning the Human kingdom. Ariel becomes the ambassador for the humans and mermaids, through her love for one human.<br/><br/>At the end, King Triton shows up !alone! to save Ariel from the sea witch. As a king, he should show up with an army and bodyguards, considering Ursula is a dangerous outlaw. Plus, Ursula pulls out the contract that Ariel signed. Ariel is a minor, therefore that contract is not legally binding. She says, ""Ya see? This contract is legal, binding, and unbreakable...even for you!"" King Triton could easily counter that, stating, ""Legal? Under what kingdom? I never authorized this sort of document under your establishment. Plus my daughter is under 18! She can not sign contracts yet!"" Since he didn't think about these ideas, he signed the contract to free his daughter, being the father figure that he is. Ursula seized the crown and the trident, both equivalent to the gold standard in the mermaid treasury. She grows 500 feet and wages marine based war to overthrow the government.<br/><br/>This is why it is such a great movie, because you can watch it again as an adult and enjoy it with a totally new perspective."

On the other hand, Ariel (voice of Jodi Benson) could truly sing. Well, despite the fact that everyone in this film could sing, Ariel was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in this film did very well.

""The Little Mermaid"" shows that if you truly believe in something and work at it, there is a good chance it will come true just like it did for Ariel. For some girls, it's like a dream come true.I also like how it's got somewhat of a love story in it. Ariel was willing to do anything in order to be with the man she so quickly fell in love with.

I remember being so obsessed with it, that sometimes it would be the ONLY animated/Disney movie I would willing to see over and over again. I still love it to this day. I could care less if it's geared to ''little girls'' or anything like that, I proudly admit that I love it to death the same way I love 'Aladdin', 'Beauty and The Beast' and 'The Lion King' as well! I love almost every single thing about it. Ursula is one of my favorite Disney villains and love her personality in the film, especially her sarcasm. This movie is what saved Disney from falling off in the end of the 1980s and I'm glad they made this film. I cannot for its release this October 2006 when it comes out in a 2-disc platinum edition, let alone a gift set as well!<br/><br/>A 10/10 for me."
"april-87","10","1","1","18 September 2005"," The best!
","This is, by FAR, my all-time favourite movie. I think it might have to do with the fact that it was the first movie I ever saw in a theatre. I had JUST turned 7 years old! I've wanted to be Ariel ever since then. April is close. My signature is even similar to hers! It is a requirement to watch it if you even KNOW me! I used to come home everyday after school and watch it.... and I was in HIGH SCHOOL!!! I even convinced one of my teachers to watch it in class instead of doing work. It was a half day, so our classes were only 90 minutes long. And as the movie is 84, I had 6 minutes to convince her. It took 3. :) We did end up righting an essay about it. It was a lot of fun! People were GRADED on this movie! How cool is that?! Ahh, I hope my daughter loves this movie as much as I do.<br/><br/>(Oh, and I'm NOT fond of the sequel AT ALL.)"

","This movie is a stirling piece of work. It stands watcihng and re-watching, both by adults and kids, for its' glorious mixture of fairy tale, gentle but laugh out loud humour, amazing songwriting and downright energy.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid stands as an everlasting monument to the greatness that was oh, such a short time ago, Disney Studios. <br/><br/>The films of Disney may continue their descent into mediocrity and perhaps in time cease all together, but what they will be remembered for is their glory days that this wonderful, wonderful movie is a part of, and not a sad downfall.<br/><br/>One criticism- fire whoever named the Prince."

","*May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>""The Little Mermaid"" is a great Disney movie. I first saw it in theaters when I was two years old and I loved it then and I still love it now. The animation is great, the plot is good, and the music is beautiful. I love all the songs in this movie, especially ""Part of Your World"" and ""Kiss the Girl"". Those songs are great.<br/><br/>""The Little Mermaid"" tells the story of a teenage mermaid named Ariel who wants to live on land. One day she makes a deal with Ursula, the Sea Witch, that she can have legs in return for her voice. On land Ariel meets a human man and falls in love with him. Ariel thinks that everything is perfect now meanwhile Ursula has a plan that will harm Ariel and her family.<br/><br/>I think everyone should see this movie because it really is a great movie. I give this movie 10/10 stars."

Even after nine ten years, I continue to throw the tape in, when I need a good story and some great songs to hum too.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid, is by far the greatest Disney film of all time!"

","I first saw this movie when I was 5 and have loved it ever since.  Even at 13 I watch it every time I get the chance.  The Little Mermaid is one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen it before you still want to see and again and most often do.  It has great character development and a wonderful plot line.  The musical scenes always set the right mood for the situation and the words are well thought and added to a catchy tune.  The movie makes you feel what the main character, a young mermaid who longs to be human, is going through.  All in all it's a timeless classic for all ages."
"jodikane","10","1","1","29 August 2001"," Best film ever made!
","Ariel is the best ever character created by Disney. Glen Keane has surpassed himself. Ariel is beautiful, headstrong, and has the most enchanting voice (both singing and speaking). She is so brave as to stand up to her father and make a pact with Ursula, basically the devil to get her prince (who is very cute). The movie is filled with the best songs, written by the classic duo Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (1950-1991), and it's no wonder they won an Academy Award for 'Under the Sea.' Jodi Benson is brilliant as Ariel, and in my opinion has the most beautiful voice in the world. Jodi is a great actress! The Little Mermaid is the best film in the world, and I would recommend it to everyone."

","But what do I know, I'm not a kid anymore.<br/><br/>As an adult viewer, I have to say I was dissapointed with this movie when I saw it recently on video. If I had kids, I wouldn't be overeager to share this with them - but kids like what they like. What stuck in my craw the most was the storyline of Ariel thinking she needed to give up her family, home under the sea, and a part of her body for this guy (okay, he's a Prince and ""The Love of Her Life"", yadda, yadda, yadda...). Maybe it's just the millenium talking, but it's not a message that needs to be promoted to all the little girls out there.<br/><br/>Feminist rant aside, it wasn't as funny and magical as say, Beauty and the Beast. I really enjoy the humour in Disney animated films. Mulan was entertaining in that way. All in all, The Little Mermaid is, by now, a little dated for my taste."
"mfisher452","3","14","44","10 November 2004"," Bright and cheerful, and that's the problem
","Let's just hope that the Disney people never decide to do to Shakespeare or Sophocles what they've done to Hans Christian Andersen and Victor Hugo (I'm alluding to The Hunchback of Notre Dame), among others. Romeo and Juliet? Just a misunderstanding. They live happily ever after and so do Montagues and the Capulets. Hamlet? He marries Ophelia and then we get 'Hamlet II: Back to Elsinore.' Oedipus? It's all a mistake; he didn't really kill his father and marry his mother, he was really an orphan adopted by the Queen, everything's okay, and the Sphinx was really just unhappy because she was misunderstood; she moves into the palace with Oedipus and they become great friends, and then comes 'Oedipus II: Sphinx's Pride.'<br/><br/>There's always seemed to be a cinematic schizophrenia at the Disney studios: Amid all the saccharine goo, there were moments that were darker, even shocking. In particular, I'm thinking of the death of Bambi's mother, and more recently the death of Mufasa, Simba's father, in The Lion King. But there seems to be this rule at Disney that even if a major character dies halfway through, the ending has to be all smiles. I mean, what is the point of doing a story with a sad ending like 'The Little Mermaid' or 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' if you trivialize the entire point of the story by changing it from dark to light and fluffy? Oh dear, Andersen's rather bleak Nordic vision is just too much of a downer; let's have fun with it! Let's move the story to the bright, happy Caribbean. Ariel sacrifices her life for love at the end? Oh dear, we can't have that; instead, let's let her have it all; typical childish wish-fulfillment, right?<br/><br/>After my 7-year-old daughter saw this version of Mermaid, as an irritated consumer, I obtained for her a more faithful adaptation, with an ending more true to Andersen's original. It didn't damage her delicate little psyche. Who can use that as an excuse these days? Have you checked out the video game shelf at your local computer store lately? Not to mention REAL LIFE? Three thousand American children a year die violent deaths. And that's only in this country. In this age of drive-by shootings, when parents, unlike in my ever more distant childhood, are afraid to leave their kids unguarded on their front lawns, much less roaming unchaperoned either in or outside of their own neighborhoods, does it make sense to sweeten (and thereby render meaningless) the ending of a fairy tale? Only if you're venal enough to be planning a sequel."
"phonenumberofthebeast","5","9","26","7 April 2005"," Hans Christian Andersen must be rolling in his grave
","There are many things I like about ""The Little Mermaid""; the beautiful music, the lush colour and pageantry, the excellent voicework (though all would eventually be outclassed by later, better Disney efforts), and there's no denying that Ariel is someone your average adolescent girl can identify with. Indeed I could almost say it is great were it not for one simple (and catastrophic) error: a happy ending! The story of the Little Mermaid is a tragedy; she sacrifices her life to save the man she loves, even though he doesn't love her. It's a simple, cathartic tale, meant to raise a tear and redeem its audience. By giving the story a happy ending, the filmmakers have undone the very purpose for which it was originally written!"

","A Disney pacifier for children. Perky mermaid Ariel longs for life outside the ocean, acquires legs and ventures forth on land to meet a boy. The swirling colors and Broadway-styled musical numbers are pleasant and upbeat for the first half of the picture, yet even they take on a chintzy/glitzy ambiance that nullifies the old-fashioned tale, bowling the audience over yet numbing them at the same time. It is not ""the greatest thing ever put out by Disney"", although the film's creators would like you to think so. As cloying as the Disney output could be while Walt was alive and overseeing product, the worse everything got once he passed away. ""The Little Mermaid"" is hectic and mildewy, with a ready-made villainess and non-dialogue spouted by the vocal actors as if they were truly underwater. ** from ****"
"jfarms1956","5","4","10","11 December 2013"," The musical numbers in this movie are very good
","The Little Mermaid is a great family movie that the younger children will get a kick out of -- even mom and dad might enjoy it too. The musical numbers in this movie are very good, including my favorite song ""Under the Sea."" Even the villainess has a good number to sing and perform. Romantics will get a kick out of the movie as well. The colorful underwater scenes are fabulous to watch, a real treat for the eye. The little mermaid herself has a stunning voice. The underwater creatures are adorable to watch and each presents unique personalities. My son had me read him the story several times until he was about 6 years old. So go ahead and pop some popcorn and get everyone a soda or a glass of milk for some good old fashioned musical and family entertainment."

","This movie was wonderful I watched it when I was younger in 1998 and I loved it but when I was even younger my dad bought a different earlier anime version that was so much better than the singing and dancing and happy endings in Disneys version of The Little Mermaid. This version of Hans Christian Andersen The Little Mermaid is about a young beautiful mermaid named Marina with her sisters, grandmother, father and her best friend Fritz the dolphin and she gives her voice to a sea witch to have legs so she can be with her beloved prince that she saved in a huge storm. But the cost was she had to give the sea witch her beautiful voice and if she did not marry him she would die and turn to sea foam of his wedding night. Well at sunrise she drinks the potion and painfully gets her human legs and she stays with the prince for a little bit over a month and he thinks that some other girl saved him well he cannot find her so he falls in love with Marina but his parents are forcing the prince to get married to another princess (which is the black haired girl that he thought saved him) He soon finds out that she is the princess he is forced to marry and he is happy and she realizes there is no hope for her and then her best friend Fritz the dolphin tells Marinas sisters and they went to the sea witch to help Marina and in exchange for their long beautiful hair they got a magical knife that was to be used to kill the prince in his sleep and when the blood touched Marinas feet they would turn back into fins and she could return to the sea but she stops because she says if her prince is happy she is happy and this sweet girl throws the knife into the sea and she dives over the boat into the water and drowns herself as she turns into sea foam while her prince stands there too late watching with a scale that she gave him and a pearl shell hairpiece of Marinas. At the end Marina turns into sea foam while her friend Fritz chases her while yelling Marina! But she is sea foam and in the Disney version there is a happy ending which I think is wrong that they copied this beautiful anime version of the little mermaid and made it into a happy movie instead of the original one.

","The Little Mermaid is quite simply the crown jewel of Disney's animated classics. 30 years after the studio's last ambitious project (with ""Sleeping Beauty""), it seemed like all the right elements came together in perfect unison, that 20 years after its original release, has become even more popular. The artwork style approached here is of beautifully detailed backgrounds and visually stunning underwater backdrops. Some of the scenes, especially underwater, would take your breath away (most notably the ""Main Titles"" and ""Under the Sea"" sequences). The two storms are also very well animated. The soundtrack for the movie is possibly the best and most memorable one for any Disney feature. It includes the calypso-flavored ""Under The Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" and the beautiful ballad ""Part of Your World"". The score is haunting as well, especially effective in the main titles scene which really sets the mood for the rest of the film. As for the characters, Ariel, Sebastian and Ursula have taken on a life of their own. They're iconic and highly recognizable characters. Don't miss out on ""The Little Mermaid"". It's worth every penny. 10/10!"

","Sweet, straightforward Disney concoction set under the sea about a lovely and rebellious young mermaid named Ariel who, though forbidden by her father (a strict ruler who despises humans), is fascinated by life on the surface and falls for a human prince.

","'The Little Mermaid (1989)' pretty much acts as a blueprint for all the Disney musicals that follow it, establishing the studio's 'modern day' formula from its story structure to its song choices. There's no denying how influential the picture is, really. Having said that, its own influences are equally as evident and it's clearly an extension of its predecessors. The film tells the tale of a young mermaid princess who longs to be on land and so, in a moment of pure face-palming naïveté, makes a deal with a soul-collecting sea-witch. Along the way, there are several catchy songs and plenty of water-logged chuckles. The thing has oodles of charm, which mostly mitigate its few story issues and typically predictable nature. It's vibrant, well-animated and lively, as fun to look at as it is to listen to. I mean, 'Under The Sea' is an absolute bop, and Sebastian's face-off against an angry chef is almost just as enjoyable. As a whole, the flick is constantly entertaining. It sits in the upper tier of Disney's catalogue, for sure. 7/10"

Jodi Benson does very well in the lead role of Ariel, while Pat Carroll (Ursula) and, most so, Samuel E. Wright (Sebastian) both give unforgettable voice performances.

Now before you say anything, let me say that Ariel, our main protagonist, is still quite spunky and actually has a sense of adventure, but she actually gives up her beautiful, lovely voice for a prince she barely knows! If I were her, I'd listen to my father some of the time, and I wouldn't so dangerously naive. I'd still tell my father that all humans aren't bad, and even if he doesn't listen, I won't care. I'd still run away, but I would not be fooled by Ursula. I'd just roam the seas, and I'd be able to get resources on my own. Ursula is still a good villain.

Her sagacious father ""King Triton"" forbids her from seeing him again and so, like any resourceful teenager, she enters a pact with evil sea witch ""Ursula"" that allows her to become human for three days and go ashore to seek out her new love - but at what cost... The support characters are so good in this - especially Samuel Wright as the long-suffering chancellor/lobster ""Sebastian"" and Pat Carroll as the evil ""Ursula"" aided and abetted by her slippery eel sidekicks ""Flotsam"" & ""Jetsam"" and Alan Menken's songs, including, ""Under the Sea"" & ""Kiss the Girl"" jauntily carry it all along apace. 20-odd years later, it's still well worth a watch."

This was a film of it's time in production, character and acclaim. It set the stage for a resurgent series of highly successful animated features from the Disney Studios with it's beautiful animation and it's lively tone. It reflected a ""princess"" culture that would be a hard sell in our 2019 understanding of the hopes and aspirations of young girls. It introduced some unforgettable characters and was a template for future Disney characterization mixes (princesses, larger than life villians, loveable sidekicks, scene stealing attendants). And, it garnered a lot of critical acclaim, winning Oscars for Original Song ""Under the Sea"" and Original Score for Alan Menken (""Kiss the Girl"" was also nominated in Best Song category). On my first viewing in 1989, I probably would have given the film a 9 (superb) out of 10, but it didn't weather well, for me (it just hit some cultural dissonance with me).

","This is a masterwork for Disney Studios. The story alone would be enough to carry this. We have great undersea characters whose level of knowledge is restricted to their environment, naturally. We have a nasty villain, Ursula, who is jealous and pained by her own appearance and awful voice. We have a longing for something that is not easily understood by the other characters. Take a really neat plot and throw in some amazing songs. I mean Broadway songs. Animation has become its own Broadway with very little tweaking. Ariel is a fully developed character with wants and needs. She is a strong ""woman."" One may find the need for a man a bit sexist at times, but it is more of a longing. We then have a willingness to give up everything (her voice in particular) to experience what it would be like to be a woman.

","The Little Mermaid is the start of Disney's renaissance era which would continue throughout the 90's. It established tropes that would stay with the majority of the company's film there on out: Don't isolate yourself to your own kind ; Go out and meet new different kind of people ; Don't always obey your overprotective family ; True love conquers all ; Princes and princesses are cool. <br/><br/>It's a great kids movie that I enjoy watching to this day. Sebastian the crab is one of the better side kicks. The action scenes in the third act are energetic. It has the classic songs like ""Under the Sea"". Ursula is one of the more unique Disney villains. She, unlike later Disney's villains, doesn't invade by force, but rather manipulates and persuades Ariel with a Faustian bargain. Some will find Ariel's character, who puts the pursuit of a man over her own voice, dated - I understand. But it's nonetheless a really entertaining watch."

","Yes I know Ariel wasn't a very good role model for young girls. She did nothing compared to Mulan and Pocahontas, but honestly as a little girl it's hard to feel passion for girls achievements the way you do when you're actually old enough to understand how much of an impact they really made. Ariel was honestly kind of whiny, but she acted just as a head-over-heels 16 y/o girl would. I know I would've acted that way at least. The more notable characters in this film such as Sebastian and the chef are what really made the movie. ""Les Poisson's"" was such a catchy song, even if the message itself was a little dark. Ursula is one of the best Disney villains hands down."

","Ill be honest, i didn't have much enthusiasm for this movie, not that i didn't like it, but just that i hadn't seen it, and the premise didn't really interest me. of course, that was 5 years ago, and ever since then, i decided to watch it. i acquired it, but kept putting it off for time. then my best friend strongly recommended it to me and i decided to give It a go. i had the exact same reaction as when i watched Frozen. i didn't mind it very much the first time. i fell i missed something so i watch it a 2nd time. i watch it about 4 more times and i adore it almost as much as Frozen. The characters are all memorable and lovable, there are some kickass musical numbers and there are too many great visuals in this movie to simply ignore it. to think this started the Disney renaissance is not a surprise, although it is a surprise that like frozen, Disney was reinvigorated by Hans Christian Anderson. The story is that Ariel, the titular Little mermaid, is aching to go the the surface against the desires of her father, king Triton. she has a collection of human memorabilia and even is in love with a human, prince Eric. the evil sea witch Ursula finds out, and after a truly awful scene where Kig triton destroys everything she owns, she manipulates Ariel by asking for her voice in exchange for legs, as well as a contract that she must kiss Eric in three days, or be her property forever. simple story, but its the execution that truly sells it for me.<br/><br/>why did i love it? well, unlike most movies i love, there is very little actually wrong with this movie. this is a kind of movie that can only be appreciated once you see it several times, so u can understand all the hidden underlying messages that get covered by unfair assumptions. most people hate this film for being a bad example on little girls. on one hand , i could understand that, seeing as Ariel wants to leave her family for a man. however, Ariel actually does NOT do this...yes, she does love him, but her primary interest is getting to the surface. she wants to explore and see the sights, find a way to her happiness. other people criticize the prince. he simply falls in love with a mute girl on the beach. i disagree. he subconsciously knows that this is the girl that saved her life, and even from her looks, she is quite expressive and plenty can be taken about her character from her mute scenes alone. also, he actually helps Ariel defeat Ursula at the end. he doesn't just do it himself like prince Phillip, or just sit down and do nothing like prince..uhh...whatever the princes name in Cinderella was. every detail of this movie is something that i can tell was chosen carefully and lovingly, to create this magnificent product. i think its blatantly obvious, but this is why i give a perfect ten to this perfect film."

","""The Little Mermaid"" is said to have kicked off a period for Disney known as the Disney Renaissance period, starting with this movie and ending with ""Tarzan"" a decade later. It is also said to be the first movie of the Disney Renaissance that started the incline of good movies before dropping with the release of ""Pocahontas"". I agree with the point that there was a decade long span of a Disney Renaissance period, but I have a little bit of a different view on this movie being one of the greats. While the last half of the movie is definitely deserving of that level of praise, the first half, while good, is not as well done, in my opinion.<br/><br/>After missing her father's celebration because she was searching a sunken human ship looking for artifacts, Ariel (Jodi Benson) is warned by her father King Triton (Kenneth Mars) end her interest with the human world. Ariel does not listen and ends up saving a human, Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) from drowning after his ship catches fire and sinks. Triton forbids Ariel from going to the surface again, resulting in her making a deal with the sea witch Ursula (Pat Carroll) to become human for three days and to have a kiss of true love in exchange for Ariel's voice. If Ariel fails, Ursula will claim her.<br/><br/>While the first half of the film with Ariel's life underwater is good, it is not very original. Ariel wants to do something but everyone else tells her it's a bad idea. The only refreshing thing done with this is that Ariel comes off less as a cliché breaking traditions kind of character and instead like a teenage girl who just isn't listening to her father all the time. The part where Ariel and Eric first meet and fall in love is the most rushed romance of any Disney film. He just hears her voice and sees her and he's in love. She just sees him and she's in love. I know it's Disney, but even by their standards it is rushed and unbelievable. <br/><br/>The second half of the film is handled much better. When Ariel is unable to speak, a lot has to be conveyed in her facial expression and actions, which is always nice to see. The fish-out-of-water element (no pun intended) also really works here because it is not just that she has come from a different world, but that she has been given the wrong information on certain things in the human world, like forks and pipes, which allows for some good comedy. <br/><br/>The thing that really makes the movie shine, in my opinion, are the side characters, who are for the most part very memorable. King Triton comes off like a father who is worried about his daughter's well-being. Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) is the first Disney character, I think, to actually have some sort of background with music that he uses at different points in the movie. Flounder (Jason Marin) serves as the timid, but still helpful friend to Ariel, and Scuttle (Buddy Hackett) works as the comic relief who thinks he understands things better than he really does. Ursula is a villain who, while what she's doing is evil, actually has some right to do certain things because of Ariel's contract, so she is not just evil. The same, however, can not be said about Prince Eric, who is pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>The animation of the film is spectacular, though the animation sometimes does not meet up with the voice work. The musical numbers aren't very memorable, with the exception of Sebastian's 'Under the Sea' and 'Kiss the Girl'. While tiny, something that bothered me is that while all of the sea creatures talked, Eric's dog Max didn't.<br/><br/>As I said, the first half of the film is good, but I don't view it as great, though the second half is. I can see why it is said that this film started the Disney Renaissance period, but I don't think that ""The Little Mermaid"" is as good and deserves to be mentioned with the movies people label as the greats, namely ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", and ""The Lion King""."

","The fairy-tale which began Disney's Renaissance Era must have been a classic flick of its time but looking back now, The Little Mermaid doesn't feel as impressive as it did years ago. The story is a typical fairy tale, this time set in the ocean & concerning a young mermaid who falls in love at first sight with a human prince on board a ship & aspires to become human so that she can spend her life with him. The sea witch offers to fulfill her wish but it's part of her big evil plan to become the new ruler.<br/><br/>The 2D animation still looks fantastic & makes striking use of colours in portraying the underwater world of Atlantica. The now memorable characters of Ariel, Sebastian, Ursula & others are wonderfully drawn & rendered on the screen, the story is a let down to be honest & there is nothing special about it. Same goes for the music in my case & the only song I liked is the beautifully composed & magnificently executed 'Under the Sea' track.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Little Mermaid will always be remembered for it marked the beginning of a new era that took Disney to new creative heights & commercial success and also resurrected some of the elements this studio had given up long ago.

","The Disney blockbuster that started a remarkable winning streak, which would stretch through an entire decade. The Little Mermaid has all the familiar ingredients you've come to expect from Disney. But keep in mind, this is the one that established that formula: a spunky heroine (she's by no means the first Disney heroine but she's the first to take action), a Broadway-style musical with showstopping numbers (this time it's ""Under the Sea"") and state-of-the-art animation. <br/><br/>The film is well known for its musical score and songs, and rightly so. The theme music in the main titles still sends shivers down my spine. And so is the rest of the score. <br/><br/>Clearly, the Disney artists went to great lengths to create a believable underwater environment. Notice the bubbles, light reflection, light and shadow effects, etc. <br/><br/>I know some people criticize the character of Ariel and that she didn't learn her lesson in the end. Or maybe she did? I always though (and still do) that she realized what she had done when she saw what happened to her father and Ursula taking over the ocean. The scene where she's sitting on a rock watching Eric is one of the best moments in the film. <br/><br/>I can't wait to watch it in 3D in September and get the Blu-ray."

","The Little Mermaid is Walt Disney's 28th Animated masterpiece released in 1989 and has been hailed by many as ""The movie that saved Disney"" and began a new era in Disney animation known to Disney fans as the Disney Renaissance. This, like many other Disney movies is based off of a classic story. It's the story of Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson), a beautiful, fun-loving, adventurous mermaid who dreams of living life on land even though her father, King Triton (voiced by Kenneth Mars), forbids her of having any contact with the human world. But one night a fierce sea storm destroys the ship that the man of her dreams Prince Eric (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) is on and he falls underwater and Ariel has no choice but to save him. She fell in love with him at first sight and in order to see him again, she makes a deal with the evil sea-witch Ursula (voiced by Pat Carroll) and gives up her voice for a pair of human legs. In order to regain her voice and break Ursula's spell, she must kiss Eric within three days and if she doesn't, she'll remain a mermaid. This movie has everything a Disney movie should have: great story, memorable characters such as Flounder (voiced by Jason Marin), Sebastian (voiced by Samuel E. Wright), and Scuttle (voiced by Buddy Hackett), a great villain (Ursula is by far one of Disney's greatest villains), and an Academy Award winning music score composed by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman with songs such as ""Under the Sea"", ""Part of Your World"", ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", and ""Kiss the Girl."" If you haven't by any chance seen this movie in the last 20+ years it's been out, please watch it. It in my opinion is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, boy or girl. This, like many Disney Classics is one I own and is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies.

I know it doesn't follow the original, but TLM is still a beautiful story that i can still relate to. Growing up with arguing with your father I could relate to Ariel and her longing to be treated like an adult and wanting to explore unknown lands. Put that angst together with the wonderful music and excellent voices you get a timeless classic the whole family can enjoy. I also applaud Jodi Benson for doing her own singing. I read that they almost cut Part of Your World which to me has always been my favorite and also is important to show how much Ariel wants to be out of the water and with Eric.

And it is quite easy to see why. From the gorgeous animation to the wonderful characters (Sebastian, the rasta crab is one of my favourite characters ever as is Ursula one of the most charismatic and funniest villains). There is also the delightful story. Its hard to beliece that a film which is slightly longer than an hour can pack so much story in.

","Here we are, 20 years after its original release, and The Little Mermaid remains one of the studio's best works. This was, hands down, the best film to come out of the Disney studio in the 1980s and is definitely in the top ten of all time. The Little Mermaid works on almost every level: aesthetically pleasing, wonderful pacing, perfectly cast, wonderful score, and terrific musical numbers. The only minor complaint that I have is the inconsistency with Ariel. The studio had several animators contribute to her character, depending on the sequence within the story, and it shows. At certain points throughout the feature, such as her first encounter with Eric on the beach and their carriage ride through town, she looks, well, different; she has smaller eyes, frizzier hair, and sharper features. This is, however, more than forgivable, given the superbness of the rest of the production. This movie is awesome in virtually every aspect and still tugs at the heartstrings, even having seen it many, many times. Wonderful entertainment."

","Hans Christian Andersen The Little Mermaid has invited people into an imaginary world, a sea world is more charming, enchanting, and fascinating than people could imagine. Andersen's tale has been loved by readers all over the world for years. Disney transformed the book into an animated film which is full of rich music. Both are a 'love story' between a pure little mermaid and a good looking warmhearted prince. However, the film departs from its book version in its characters in the nature of the conflict between goodness and evil, and their endings to reveal another world of creativity.<br/><br/>The film approaches its supporting characters differently than the original. The film introduces more a dynamic sea witch called Ursula as another main character. While the sea witch plays only a minor in the book, Disney's Ursula uses Ariel, the little mermaid, as bait to catch her father in a plot for revenge. Moreover, the animated movie invents attractive supporting characters such as Sebastian, the crab who always enjoys giving advice, Flouder, who is a close friend of Ariel, and Scuttle, who is considered a clumsy expert in the world of human. In addition, Max and Grimsby are the faithful supporters of Eric, the prince whom Ariel saves from the wrecked ship and falls in love with. These charming characters help audience numbers to enjoy the film. <br/><br/>Both versions also differ in the nature of the conflict between the main characters. While the book explores the conflict of the little mermaid with herself, the movie focuses on the conflict between goodness and evil to reveal the meaning of justice. In the film, Ursula represents evil, taking any cruel action to gain whatever she wants. She is portrayed as a half-human and half-octopus witch banished by Triton, like Satan was banished by God. Ursula seduces the little mermaid in a spell for her revenge and takes away her voice. She even disguises herself as a pretty lady to hold back Ariel's love. On the other hand, Eric, King Triton and Ariel's friends represent goodness. For example, Eric realizes Ariel was the one who rescued him and loves her with all his heart. So he fights against the sea witch to keep his pure love. In the case of Triton, he is willing to sacrifice his life for his headstrong daughter, showing an unconditional parents' love. In addition, Ariel's friends understand Ariel's pure love and help her. These symbols such as pure love, unconditional sacrifice and deep friendship are always supposed to win at the end and overcome any obstacle. Disney wants to give the audience of a valuable lesson. <br/><br/>There is also a different ending story in the film. While the book has a sad ending, the film concludes its happy ending: ""They live happily ever after."" For instance, in the book, the little mermaid is willing to give her life up for her unrequited love and becomes foam in spite of her sibling's earnest request. Her love story is gloomy and melancholy. It gives the message to readers to adopt fate and not to defy it. On the other hand, the movie reveals a different vision at the end. The film works toward its happy ending, encouraging audience members to have courage and be willing to fulfill whatever they really desire instead of warning us not to dream about what we don't possess. In the long run, both versions have their own different visions of fate. One tells that fate is given; the other tells that fate is made by people themselves.<br/><br/>The Disney film is willing to change the well-known fairy tale to conclude with a happy ending with its own point of view. In this respect, it is meaningful that the Disney film shows entertainment of changing the old-fashioned fairy tale into a new dynamic film filled with unforgettable music. Furthermore, the differences in characters, conflicts and endings in both versions explore that an imaginary world is always unlimited and changeable. Thus, when people read books or watch movies, if they give full play to their imagination instead of accepting the story itself literally, they can gain more abundant pleasure and enjoy their own exploration in the story. Now, it is time to spread a stretch of imagination and enjoy another fairy tale."
"fifth-elephant","9","0","0","7 May 2008"," Disney's defibrillator
","In 1979, while Disney's unremarkable Bambi-retread The Fox and the Hound was under production, Don Bluth quit his job in righteous indignation at the then 37-year slump in Disney's animated features and, with eleven talented young animators in tow, hared off to MGM and created a near-masterpiece, The Secret of NIMH, in little over two years. Although the movie-going public ignored the film at the time, Bluth's subsequent films, An American Tail and the marginally superior The Land Before Time both broke box-office records for animation and routed Disney competition.<br/><br/>In 1989, Bluth's fourth, All Dogs Go to Heaven, was released on the same weekend as Disney's latest, The Little Mermaid, a musical in the style of the Golden Age cartoons. Bluth's new film boasted an interesting and original premise, whilst Disney's was yet another sweetened fairy tale. Bluth and his cohorts could hardly be blamed to maybe shoot for fifty million this time around, and Disney fans would have been either in denial or omniscient to expect The Little Mermaid to be other than lackluster.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid raked in $84,000,000. People tell you that the business a film does doesn't matter, but it does: it matters a helluva lot to the films a studio makes after it. Without The Little Mermaid's extravagant success, the resurgence in American animation might never have taken place, and we have audiences' uncharacteristic discernment to thank.<br/><br/>Above all, what is important about The Little Mermaid is what a superlative film it is. A penny saved might well be a penny earned, but a few billion pennies spent wisely can be millions and millions of dollars earned. This is The Little Mermaid's approach, and but one of many ways in which it returned to the Disney philosophy of the Thirties and Forties, when art was exalted above immediate financial gain, when no expense was spared in the pursuit of excellence, and when animation was considered a medium and not a genre, when an animated film was more than a 'kiddie movie'.<br/><br/>Computers eased the burden on the animators and the studio's pockets, making the sort of dazzling imagery that characterized the early Disney films practical again, also enabling certain wildly impressive sequences to be brought to the screen in a manner that would have had Uncle Walt selling his multi-plane camera for scrap.<br/><br/>And then there was the duo of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. The pair made The Little Mermaid's score Disney's best since Dumbo, and truly animated Broadway for the first time. The songs are longer, better placed and more important to the plot than ever before, and not a dud among them. ""Part of Your World"" is the obligatory ballad, but, refreshingly, it's not a love song--even more refreshingly, The Little Mermaid doesn't really have one of those; ""Kiss the Girl"" is far too witty and entertaining to be one, and is more concerned with making out than love anyway. ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" is deliciously wicked, and ""Under the Sea"" is pure entertainment, a showcase for Samuel E. Wright's magnificent crab, Sebastian, and a virtuoso display of animated choreography. The use of song might seem unsubtle as compared to the great animated films of the Nineties, like The Iron Giant and the Toy Story films, but it is never less than enjoyable. And by the way, it was co-producer Ashman's idea to make Sebastian a Jamaican-vizier-crab as opposed to an English-butler-crab. Masterstroke, that.<br/><br/>Remember how scary Pinocchio was? (The movie, not the puppet.) While The Little Mermaid does not quite plumb those depths, it is bold in its occasional darkness: Ursula's grisly garden and many forms, the seriousness of Ariel's situation and the despair that accompanies it, ensure that, for all its humor, the film never suffers from the childlike levity that Disney films, for time out of mind, had been trying to make adults take seriously. When it means to be funny, the film is funny; when not, not.<br/><br/>Certainly Disney's finest villain since Cruella De Vil, and perhaps even before, Ursula, a half-octopus half-purple-human, voiced by Pat Carroll, is darkly funny while never letting one forget that she cannot be trifled with. Ursula, like most of the great Disney villains, manages to be funny as well as intimidating by being rather aristocratic in her manner, a la Cruella, Shere Khan and Scar.<br/><br/>Another unprecedented quality of The Little Mermaid was the presence of an excellent main character as well as an excellent villain. Ariel, voice of Jodi Benson, remains the studio's most endearing heroine. Rebellious and often foolhardy, she thinks for herself and makes mistakes--she is no passenger. She is, in fact, the catalyst for the events of the film instead of the antagonist. She is also funny and makes you want to actually listen when she speaks, which Disney had always seemed to think could never work in a main character.<br/><br/>Even Prince Eric isn't relegated to automaton status--for a Disney movie, the central conflict seems to almost have an excess of character. A rather frustrating love interest he may be, but he is, at least, a character, and always a likable one. Kenneth Mars' King Triton is another excellent supporting character, and Buddy Hackett steals the show entirely as worldly seagull Scuttle.<br/><br/>I need say no more than that the film is about a mermaid princess who falls in love with a human and strikes a deal with a witch for a pair of legs. The Disney version of The Little Mermaid is so different from Hans Christian Andersen's tortuously Christian parable as to be an entirely different story that happens to share some plot points with the fairy tale. Disney's version is better. I state this without compunction, and do not feel the need to list my reasons. Read the story, then watch this film, and tell me which you like better.<br/><br/>Or don't read it. But do watch the film. It is a remarkable experience."

","This is a very good movie, it has really good people doing all of the voices for all of the people. It is kind of romantic, and at the same time has a lot of problems brewing. I think this is a very good movie for anybody who has ever had a dream, went for it, came across a problem, but then everything turned out all good. This had a very good ending. This is one of those movies where there is a very happy ending and you are really happy you stayed to watch the whole thing.

","I was 7 years old when ""The Little Mermaid"" was released in 1989, and it became an overnight classic. I never got to see it in the theaters, but once it was released on video, I mooched off the opportunity to see from anyone who happened own it. I was caught up the aesthetic trappings: the dazzling bright colors, hummable songs (Under the Sea won the Oscar for best song who knew?), and the refreshingly spunky heroine Ariel, a nice antidote to the more passive Disney princesses of yesteryear. And you should have heard all the off-key renditions of ""Part of Your World"" that every girl under the age of 15 were belting (raises hand guiltily).<br/><br/>Now that I'm 24, older and more cynical, I recently watched the brand new 2-disc DVD of ""The Little Mermaid"" and must say that it does look better than ever. The older side of me appreciates the mechanics of the animation. Hand drawn animation is becoming a rarity these days and ""The Little Mermaid"" is easily right up there with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""An American in Paris"" as one of the best-looking and most colorful films ever made. The character animation is also superb, especially on Ariel. She spends a good portion of the movie silent, so the animators really live up to the challenge of giving her face emotion. I especially love how they dare to allow her to look silly with her facial expressions from time to time (unlike Botox-faced Cinderella or Aurora). <br/><br/>I especially love the villain Ursula: lusty, histrionic, and bad to the bone, she's the most entertaining Disney villain in many a moon. Not to mention the most competent: she has henchmen who actually do her bidding correctly, and Ursula is so resourceful and calculating, she practically wins at the end! Pretty impressive, I must say! Pat Carroll deserves special praise as Ursula, whose croaky voice brings to mind Lauren Bacall in a particularly foul mood. <br/><br/>The North Carolina-born Samuel E. Wright gives Sebastian a delightful Caribbean accent that never becomes too stereotypical. The late Buddy Hackett, with his decidedly grating voice, as a seagull; c'mon, casting doesn't get any better than that! Yet the real star is Jodi Benson as Ariel. Her sweet, Broadway-friendly voice is packed with feisty innocence and wistful longing. Like Judy Garland and ""Over the Rainbow"", you can't picture anyone else warbling ""Part of Your World"".<br/><br/>Now for the cynical side of my review: It's understandable that the good folks at Disney wanted to make a happy ending. After all, in the Hans Christian Anderson tale, the mermaid not only trades her voice for legs (by having her tongue cut out ouch!), but also loses the prince to another woman, so she throws herself into the sea and dies (but at least she goes to heaven). Yet the ending goes out of its way to be happy and it borders on downright saccharine, ending not only with a wedding but also with a parting shot of a rainbow. While I appreciate how the character of Ariel paved the way for the more modern, headstrong Disney female characters (especially my favorites, Belle and Mulan), she's hardly the exemplary ""Woman of the '90s"" critics make her out to be. Let's not forget that our spunky heroine essentially sells her soul to the evil Ursula just so she can hook up with some guy she's never had so much as a conversation with. And Prince Eric just never seemed worth it to me, he's so vapid and void of personality. I always root for Ariel, at least up to that point, and then I can't help but think, ""what an idiot!"" <br/><br/>All in all, ""The Little Mermaid"" is a guilty pleasure and is a perfectly good addition to your Disney library."

There is only one problem- it is forbidden to go to the surface and Ariel's father thinks all humans and ""barbarians"" and just doesn't understand Ariel. This film features a wonderful array of music, and a beautiful plot line. It will make you laugh out loud with the humour created by Scuttle, the sea-gull, and Sebastian, the crab, in their attempts to help Ariel receive the kiss of true love in three days.

","The first of Disney's 'renniacanse' films. And arguably the best Disney film of the 1980's. The Disney execs took great lengths to up the ante' on this film's look, the quality of it's songs. And bring more of a human element to a film series that had been swimming in stories about mice and dogs and other-worldly tales for 10 years.<br/><br/>Like all good Disney films, this one has an extensive and hilarious supporting cast. Everyone from the eccentric Skuttle, to the serious Sebastian and fearful Flounder seem to care about what's going on around them, instead of just being goofy caricatures that are only good for a laugh.<br/><br/>Though the whole idea behind 'love at first sight' is a little far-fetched. The characters and their vocal performances make it more believable. Ariel, Eric and Ursula's ambitions guide the story along, as opposed to the three of them being victims of what happens.<br/><br/>The character of Grimsby is one of my personal favourites from any Disney movie. He provides a nice grounding for Eric. (Particularily his line ""Far better than any dream girl... is one of flesh and blood."") The songs themselves are catchy, and with the exception of Under the Sea move the plot along well (particularily Poor Unfortunate Souls).<br/><br/>A movie that is not only a lot of fun, but has layers and deeper meaning behind everything that happens in it."

","Disney's Classic retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson Fairy Tale is not only one of the greatest animated films in history, but one of the greatest films period. But this movie is also bittersweet when taking into consideration that it was the last Hand painted animated film to come out of Disney (films from that point on were colored using computers)- but it ushered Disney into it's second Golden Age. In the 80's, besides going through many changes in business, and technology (VHS was big business for Disney films)- Disney was struggling with it's animated films. In 1989, with the release of ""The Little Mermaid"" Disney pulled out the highest grossing animated film to date, and started a new era of Disney Masterpieces from Beauty and the Beast to Aladdin to the Lion King and on through the end of the 90's But the animation, the characters, and Oscar winning music, Disney created one of the most unforgettable and most loved Disney films ranking with Cinderella and Snow White. Although the moral of this version can be misinterpreted, it is meant to convey the classic Disney message of not giving up on your dreams, it follows Ariel, a 16 year old Mermaid Princess obsessed with the human world, and dreams of one day being on land. One fateful day, Ariel saves the life of a handsome prince from a shipwreck and is determined to get her heart's desire. When the sea witch, Ursula is more than happy to help, Ariel, so happy to be able to have her dream lived out, is unaware of Ursula's true intentions, and trades her voice for legs, and sets out to win her prince.<br/><br/>Although the story strays a bit from the original story, opting for a less tragic ending, the film still (after 15 years) brings back that childish happiness I felt when I first saw the movie (having seen the original story, I was more than pleased to have a Happy ending.<br/><br/>I can't wait to have children of my own and be able to see their faces as they discover this movie for the first time."

Everything about it is gorgeous. I remember seeing it for the first time and being blown away by the opening sequence. The appearance of the first merman against Alan Menkens score is beautifully done and the film just goes uphill from there.<br/><br/>The art, the songs, the characters, the music. Everything is perfectly done in this film.<br/><br/>Ursula is by far the scariest villain ever to cross the big screen. Based on a drag queen she really does completely freak out all audiences, I remember being terrified of her when I was little and I still feel the same way. The whole Poor Unfortunate Souls sequence is the scariest 'villain scene' I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. The rather bouncy song along with a haunting setting and shadows Hitchcock would be proud of is amazingly done and is only beaten by Ursula's terrifying performance later on in the film crawling along the ships deck after Ariel.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is spectacular. The score as I have mentioned before is superb and each of the songs is an instant classic, Part of Your World, Under the Sea, Kiss the Girl and Poor Unfortunate Souls are all songs everyone can recognise and sing-along too.<br/><br/>One last thing I have to give credit to is Sebastian the crab. He is one of the main reasons I love this film so much. The reggae crab will win you over. He is the perfect support to our heroine, dishing out lovely songs and providing us with may comic moments.<br/><br/>Disney really hit a high point with this film, and it totally deserves its status as one of the best animated films of all time. 10 out of 10."

The Little Mermaid, however, managed to avoid this trap by making the characters, including the villain, larger than life. Sebastion, particularly, is a brilliant little fellow and I defy anyone not to warm to Ariel, probably the loveliest creation Disney has ever made. I loved the songs, all of which added to the films charm and stood on their own as good compositions. I first saw this film two years after its release and for weeks after I couldn't stop singing ""Part of your world"" It's not an exaggeration to say that Ariel became part of mine and remains my favourite screen heroine.

","A film I recently saw was the The Little Mermaid. The movie is about a rebels teenager name Ariel. Ariel's father is King Triton who is the king of the sea. She always wanted to be living on the surface, but she was a mermaid. Her father was against the idea of his daughter becoming a human and was told that she was not allowed to travel to the surface. Disobeying her father's rules, Ariel swims to the surface. When on the surface, she falls in love with Prince Eric, who is a human. An evil sea witch, Ursula, came to an agreement to trade what they both wanted but couldn't have. Ariel becomes a human, but not without many troubles in her way.<br/><br/>Walt Disney was trying to show the audience, of all ages, a different way to look on life. The movie shows a young, verbally female looking for a better life then what she already has. Ariel represents any young teenager that wants to experience life but, can not because of restrictions. Walt Disney wanted to show adults but, also make it understandable for children how life is when you want to be apart of something and belong to it as well.<br/><br/>As a reader, you are probably thinking on why I choose this movie. It showed many different stages of a young child's life. I liked how the movie showed Ariel as a 'wild child'. All kids of the age of sixteen want to disobey their parents. Ariel reminded me a lot of myself when I was a child. The crab, named Sebastian, was like Ariel's self concision, telling you what was right and wrong. This movie can teach many people a lesson no matter what age you are."

","NOTE: The following is the opinion of a very tired person at work.  He has a horrible head cold and has been 'doped up' on Nyquil for three days now. Please keep all of these things in mind while reading this review.<br/><br/>I love Disney films.  I always have.  When I was a kid, my family used to go to every Disney film when it was released.  I was in awe of the animation and the songs. Even now as I watch the Disney Classics over & over & over again with my daughters, I still think they are some of the best movies ever made...even after watching them five times in one day, like my daughters like to do at times.<br/><br/>But, sad to say, during the 1980's, Disney released some movies that I would not even try to call 'Classics'.  Movies like 'Fox & The Hound', 'The Black Couldron' and 'The Great Mouse Detective' had some redeeming moments, and I still feel are decent movies, but they lacked most of the things I expected from a Disney movie.<br/><br/>Then there was 'Oliver & Company'.  To be totally honest with you, the only reason I even saw 'Oliver & Company' is because Billy Joel's voice was in it.  That's it!  I still enjoyed it, but did it deserve to wear the Disney name?  Not in my opinion.<br/><br/>Along comes one of the greatest years of my life...1989. I'm a Senior in High School, a 'Batman' movie had been released earlier that Summer and I happened to be playing Orin Scrivello, the Dentist in the school musical 'Little Shop of Horrors'.  <br/><br/>We hear that Howard Ashman, the man who wrote the music for 'Little Shop of Horrors' wrote the songs for Disney's 'The Little Mermaid', so we decide to go see it for that reason alone. <br/><br/>When I left the movie theater on a cold winter night in December 1989, I realized that the Disney that I grew up loving was back in a big way.  'The Little Mermaid' had everything I have grown to love about Disney films.  A princess, beautiful colors, singing and dancing animals and a really evil villain.  I loved it!<br/><br/>'The Little Mermaid' is my favorite Disney film and ranked in my personal Top Ten of All-Time Movies.  It was the beginning of a bunch of Classic Disney films that are worthy of wearing the Disney name.<br/><br/>FUN FACT: The song ""Part of Your World"" is very similar to the 'Little Shop of Horrors' song ""Somewhere That's Green"".  When you see 'The Little Mermaid' with most of the cast from 'Little Shop', you catch things like this."

The musical score that accompanies this film is pure genius and is performed to perfection. Now, I love most Disney films I have to admit, and I am not going to pretend that this is THE best but it's certainly one of them, up there with Beauty and The Beast and The Lion King, so anyone who says that this film is no good, has obviously not seen it! The despair that we see in Ariel's face as she watches her beloved Eric announce his engagement to Ursula (of all people) just shows why this film has stood the test of time, and I can guarantee that any child who likes Disney now, if shown The Little Mermaid, will go the swimming pool twice as often as before and start trying to swim like Ariel, or sing like Ariel, or dream of finding their very own Eric! I could sit here and compliment the animation, and the direction, and the voices, and the music of this film until I am blue in the face but I would still not account for the most important thing that gives this film that little extra........and that's the magic of Disney. The magic of make believe and wonder, and that feeling you get when you are a child of how anything can happen. You really get this feeling from The Little Mermaid, a feeling you don't get from other Disney films, like Bedknobs and Broomsticks, or (to some extent) Mary Poppins. Finally, I know I can vouch for all my family when I say that the ending, is masterfully done the way only Disney know how, there was not a dry eye in the house, honest! Now I am 15 years old and I am not a mother, and I don't have any little siblings, so I haven't seen this film in quite a while, but it has stuck with me for this long, and I am not ashamed to say this, but I can still sing along to all the songs, and I do sometimes, when I am alone and I feel happy - 'I Want To Be Where The People Are' suddenly pops in my head.

With his words still stinging her, Ariel accepts the offer of sea-hag Ursula to become human for three days and either a) make the prince love her and thus stay human or b) fail and return to the ocean and belong to Ursula.<br/><br/>Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However, having greatly enjoyed Beauty and the Beast the other night, I decided to give this film a try as well but must admit that I didn't take to it as much as I had hoped. The story is good enough to provide a narrative flow but I didn't buy into it emotionally as much as I had expected. The story didn't quite have enough of a sense of maturity or wonder as I needed and I didn't find enough else to distract from me. I was never bored you understand, but it was more that I could watch it with kids rather than really enjoy it and get something from it on my level.<br/><br/>The songs are quite good and featured one or two that are pretty catchy and stuck in my mind. The animation is good but is very big and colourful, full of soft edges and non-threatening shapes; this results in the film having feel that it is really for kids rather than adults  an impression not really helped by the story that never goes deep enough into the emotional aspect for adults. The voice work is reasonably good and doesn't feature many famous voices  a practice that is not so common now but maybe helps from distracting from the material by spotting the stars. Benson is quite nice, Mars is firm and warm, Wright is good and the choice of accent in this film but it was quite nice. None of them are that distinctive and it is only really the late Buddy Hackett that stuck in my mind.<br/><br/>Overall this is a colourful and enjoyable film but one that didn't do enough in terms of material and emotional content to really engage me. The film will be great for kids and provide more than basic laughs and I did enjoy it for what it did well but I did want it to do more  perhaps watching it in the same week as the much classier Beauty and the Beast was a mistake but this is a good film, not a great one."

","Often considered the birth of the animation ""renaissance,"" The Little Mermaid is less the initiator than the point at which the renaissance model was perfected (seeing as films like An American Tale and Who Framed Roger Rabbit already showed the public was hungry for classical animation). Seeing as this was the first commercial and aesthetic success for Disney in years, it makes sense that Disney would take this movie's tropes and recycle them (for reasons other than the themes they explored). With its logically arranged songs and archetypes, it became something like the purest example of Disney's approach.<br/><br/>Beyond this, though, it's quite a solid and entertaining piece of animation. By keeping the narrative simple and digestible, and letting the animators finally have some leeway where the characters were concerned, the studio took a huge risk that paid off. It's the most lavishly and cleanly animated Disney picture since the sixties, and finally marked a return to the animator driven environment of the golden age of Disney. That period's experimentation was dead and buried, unfortunately, and The Little Mermaid is too safe and inoffensive to be another Pinocchio, but by the standards of American studio animation it remains quite satisfying.<br/><br/>As a Hans Christian Anderson adaptation, it's been well documented that this adaptation screws with the source material, but for all the sunshiny Barbie Doll-ness of Ariel and the dancing sea creatures there is an appealing naive sense of yearning to her character. She sees something she wants that reminds her of the world she ultimately yearns for, and she does anything to attain it. Hungry sharks or her very identity be damned. As cliché as the ""I want"" song has become, this particular rendition has a surprisingly haunting quality to it that's more melancholy than cheerful. It's easy to be a snark and point at the stupid things she does for a guy she doesn't know, but considering he simply exemplifies her desires it makes perfect sense that she would take such a route as to give up her voice and identity.<br/><br/>This is why I hate the ending. I don't demand that Disney use the same ending as the source material, but I would expect some sort of sacrifice to be made to at least preserve some literary integrity. By giving Ariel back everything she desired, it seems to deny that there are any consequences to her behavior.<br/><br/>Snobby nitpicking over a damn children's movie aside, The Little Mermaid is mostly very charming and fun to watch. Alan Menken's score and songs are iconic, catchy, and always have a character point to them (most of Menken's imitators seem to leave out the fact that songs have to actually communicate things relevant to the story). Not all of the side characters endear (I struggle to remember all of them) but a few are good fun, if recycled to the point of nausea since then.<br/><br/>It's clear that the animation here is a huge step up from the Saturday Morning quality of their last few films (perhaps owing partly to the influence of Richard Williams on the team during Who Framed Roger Rabbit). Their inexperience shows, but it's such a major advancement that certain nitpicks aren't a huge deal. Mark Henn's Ariel is a bit amorphous, but Glen Kean's has a strong sense of weight and emotion. Andreas Deja tends to show off his ability to draw a nose in perspective a bit too much on King Trident, but this is testament to his skill in sculpting his masses to project a strong sense of presence. Once more, however, the spotlight is stolen by the villain, as Ruben Aquino handles Ursula's many writhing slimy tentacles and sheer evil glee with the adeptness of a Milt Kahl or a Bill Tytla. Disney's animators improved in strides over the next few films, but for once it's a joy to see a Disney product that prides character animation over cost cutting.<br/><br/>I have issues with the fact that The Little Mermaid set a precedent that the entire industry would adhere blindly to out of fear. I can't fault this on the original movie however, and I enjoy it for what it is. Unlike, say, Princess and the Frog or (God forbid) Quest for Camelot it's not insulting, and it's completely satisfying. It's not my favorite Disney movie by any means, but if I ever have daughters I won't mind picking this up for them to experience themselves (along with superior female coming of age stories like Kiki's Delivery Service). For once, this mermaid's earned herself a soul.<br/><br/>Also, the fact that Ariel's in a clamshell bra and we see her pantsless is testament to the fact that children's animators are all perverts. Pubescent children all over the world thank them for it."

From a story point of view this is now thoroughly familiar fare with the main character and couple of comedy support characters having to overcome adversity before finding solace in the arms of the other main character. What is fascinating here is seeing the shaping of the modern Disney movie from some of the song themes that are re-used more successfully in later Disney movies to the beginning to experiment with 3D animation that was used to great effect in the next Disney movie 'Beauty and the Beast' . The film is itself I feel could be slightly better paces and for a Disney movie this is unusual as they are normally so tightly paced. But this is still good and great for children."

","The question to ask with any post-Walt Disney animated film is:  W.W.W.D? (What Would Walt Do?)  Having seen this with my goddaughter recently, I can safely say that Walt would have done  *The Little Mermaid*, and he would have done it in much the same way that director John Musker does it here. (Though ole Walt may have looked askance at Ariel's flirty seashell bra, to say nothing of her frank sensuality.)  So how did this film save the Disney Studio?  By going Back to Basics:  tirelessly detailed animation; Hans Christian Andersen; clearly delineated heroes and villains; hilariously inadequate male love interests; amusing sidekicks.  It is no accident that this movie resembles  *Snow White*  more than any other  ""modern""  Disney cartoon:  it is clearly attempting to mine, once again, the Old Stuff, the Classic Motherlode.  It was a triumphant return to form, after two decades of forgettable attempts to be more  ""relevant""  (*Black Hole*, anyone?)  to post-Sixties audiences.<br/><br/>Every one of the 84 minutes counts in this picture.  Not a scene is wasted, not even the musical numbers, which -- for once -- build character or advance the plot.  Lean, mean, and to the point.  Doubtless, the hand-drawn animation provided the incentive for brevity and clarity.  More recent Disney films, relying on cheaper and easier computer graphics, have shown a marked tendency of bloat.  The story's  ""deadline""  of 3 days -- during which Ariel is magically granted legs in order to pass as human and hence make the Prince give her a true love's kiss, thereby making her human forever -- also tightens things up.  More suspense is added when the evil sea-witch Ursula, as a further condition for granting Ariel's wish to be human, removes the mermaid's magical voice -- the one thing that the Prince would recognize about her.  It should be added that evil Ursula is truly nasty as well as comical, providing just the right foil for the sweet mermaid.  Simple Good vs. Evil, here -- no  ""Golden Bough""  moral complexity of, say, *The Lion King*, in which the animals worship the birth of the very creature who will likely grow up to eat them.  *The Little Mermaid*  keeps it simple, stupid -- Walt would've approved."

"kshr","10","1","2","31 March 2000"," This one is one of the best
","The Little Mermaid will always be remembered as the film which saved animation industry. Though the quality of animation had declined in the 60's, except for The Jungle Book, the real low quality and unsuccessful films came in the 70's and 80's. While 101 Dalmatians was still successful, something that I can't understand after such a breathtaking film as Sleeping Beauty, features like Robin Hood, The Aristocats, The Rescuers, The Black Cauldron and Oliver & Company did not fare as well, actually they are the last ones in the box office grosses. Simply because the animation was unextraordinary and sorry to say, disgusting, and the songs lacked the magic of earlier  films. The only one which really stands out is The Fox and The Hound which is visually very good and the songs are OK. The Little Mermaid was a quick return to Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Featuring breathtaking classic animation, top-notch songs and emotionally haunting characters. The investment in Mermaid can easily be seen in such moments as the Main Titles scene and the storm, and actually every other scene. The songs Under the Sea, Kiss the Girl, Part of Your World and Fathoms Below are outstanding while Les Poissons gives a comic relief. The movie's greatness is its big critical acclaim, not to talk about the public one. While today's features, even Tarzan and 1992's Aladdin were mediocre critical successes (from what I have read and heard), Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast were a huge critical successes.<br/><br/>The film is never disappointing. we own both versions and enjoy everyone of them. I recommend The Little Mermaid to everyone!"
"Yonhap S","9","1","2","5 September 1999"," The one that started it all
","I had the opportunity to see this again.  This is said to be the last of Disney's animation to be completely hand drawn.  Watching it now, I could just imagine how the movie would look like had it been made and released today.  Anyway, this movie helped spark Disney's annual full-quality animated feature in the 90's.<br/><br/>Anyway, Ariel, the little mermaid, sports the largest eyes I've seen in Disney human heroines.  It seems to me this is the first time Disney used such large eyes on such a character (usually it's anyone but the heroine). The animators make full use of that as a window to her soul.  Though this is nothing new (in Japanese animation), it really brought out her character here.  The songs are very memorable without the benefit of hot artists singing their own versions. I just wish the tv series made more use of Ariel's many sisters.  They didn't serve much purpose here.<br/><br/>The verdict: 4.5 of 5 stars."
"onurkara1212","3","2","7","21 July 2016"," Good Idea, but...
","Well as your read in the summary of the review, the concept of this movie is actually not bad, however there is one very big flaw in my opinion.I cannot stress this enough the flaw I have with the movie is completely subjective and also not one that most people seem to have, since this movie has a good rating of 7.6 as of now.<br/><br/>Now the flaw is: Ariel. Yes that is right I really haven no idea exactly what it is that makes me dislike her character. Probably since she goes completely against her fathers instructions, especially since he has a point. Humans tend to fear the unknown, and her existence would cause a riot and would not only endanger her life but also the life of everyone in that city( I don't know the name, because I just couldn't sit through this movie), which makes her completely selfish. Finally it is funny to me that she wants to live in our world, which is hell compared to hers. I know that she eventually marries the prince, which makes this point invalid, but she wanted to live in our world before she even met Eric.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about the positive the concept of a mermaid falling in love with a human is definitely interesting and the execution in my opinion is also good. For this reason I would award around seven to ten stars, and I tend to be rather lenient on animations, so it would get 10 stars, next there is the animation itself, which was really good as expected from Disney, and finally the music was superb, which was also expected back in those days from Disney.<br/><br/>However this does not change the fact that characters are more important than any element, since a good story, such as this was spoiled, because of Ariel's character, while a bad story can still be saved by good characters. In this case that bad character also happened to be the one that got most screen time considering she was the story's main protagonist. Which is why my final review is 3/10 stars."

I decided to watch it again because I had nothing else to do at the time. I really didn't expect myself to like it as much as I did. The movie was an amazing piece of work. It has some of the best Disney songs ever made. It also has some great characters, prefect animation and an amazing storyline. The movie is based on Han Christian Anderson's fairy tale and Roger Allers, Ron Clements & John Musker has fitted it all nicely into a movie. Although I recommend who liked this movie to read the original tale which I liked just as much as the movie although it doesn't end the same way. The story is interesting, romantic, funny and very entertaining. The characters are excellent with their own personalities and everything including the villain who isn't brainless like some other villains you see. Some people say that's Ariel a brat but if you where in her situation I think you would do the same. The characters voices are prefect and really fit into their roles and appearance. I can easily say that Jodi Benson (Ariel's voice) has the greatest voice I have ever heard. Howard Ashman has created some of the greatest songs also. Under The Sea is my favourite which is sung by Samuel E. Wright (Sebastian's voice) but all the others are great too. This movie won and was nominated for plenty of songs in it. The animation is breathtaking which also won an award for it. Glen Keane (Ariel's main animator) is one of the greatest animators ever to walk the earth. He has worked on many of the Disney films before and after this movie. Anyway the bottom line is that it is one great movie that almost anyone should love. It is by far one of the greatest Disney movies ever, if not the greatest. I highly recommend everyone to see it if they haven't already. I must admit this wasn't 100% prefect thought (although very close to it). I didn't like the ending too much but everything else was beyond prefect.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>P.S. There was a TV series for this movie which was very good. It was based before she had meet Eric and she meets Scuttle and a few other characters in the episodes. It was very well written and seemed as if it was created by the exact same people. There was also a sequel but it was nothing compared to this movie."

","The big three that I am referring to are the three films that sparked the revival of Disney after a 20-year dry spell following Walt Disney's death: Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and the very first of the Renaissance, The Little Mermaid. Mermaid is a wonderful film, with a great feel-good story, lovely artwork, fun characters, and some of the best music in Disney history.<br/><br/>Why then do I think it to be the weakest of the big three? There's nothing inherently wrong with it. What makes great Disney films great is that besides all their technical aspects (in which this film is perfect), they have a certain spunk, an unexplainable phenomena that makes you admire them all the more. This film definitely has that. In fact it has a lot of it. Unfortunately, as much great spunk as Mermaid has, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast have even more.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is Disney's third best film ever. Also, I could not agree with nbachris2788 more...it is extremely irritating hearing feminists complain about Ariel. I know many girls who watched this film as children, and none of them have turned out the way these extreme feminists would like one to believe.

","The Little Mermaid is considered by many one of the best films by Disney. I was looking forward to see this movie because I respect Disney's earlier movies very much.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid is a disappointment. The story is based on a wonderful text by danish writer H.C. Andersen. I must warn all who are interested in this movie because of Andersen's text. It is by no means a strict screen adaption. The story is only loosely based on the original text and has lost almost all of its charm. Of course Disney has always treated its stories in its own way. Before the Little Mermaid however it has succeeded much better with its Americanizations, even with Robin Hood and Jungle Book.<br/><br/>For my taste the animation style of the movie is another annoyance. Compared to almost any other Disney Classic The Little Mermaid's animation art is inferior. It is somehow ironic how clear the lack of legendary Disney artists in this movie is. The parameters which define almost every other Disney Classic up to and including The Fox and the Hound are gone: The Little Mermaid looks flat and lame. It's colors look artificial and characters are somehow unsympathetic, uninteresting and superficial. It all reminds me of a terrible animated series from the 90's: The Biker Mice from Mars. (Ok, I exaggerated - It is not THAT terrible.) To sum up: The Little Mermaid may be a nice movie for little kids, but is not artistically ambitious anyhow and its storyline is flawed."

The things Ariel does to find happiness are a bit strange, such as her selling her voice to a complete stranger or her falling in love with someone who falls in love with her just for her voice. I also thought this movie was a bit too derivative of earlier classics like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. It's the same old fairy tale formula with nothing new added except better animation and bigger, but not necessarily better, songs. But don't let all this stop you from enjoying this movie. Practically everybody else has."
"naomielsanders","6","1","5","11 October 2013"," Umm...
","This is movie that I'm a little ""hmm"" with. It's a famous fairytale that's been 'Disney-fied' as I call it. One of the reasons is that the mermaid lives in the end (this is why I put the spoiler thing on). If you leave it where the wedding boat goes off and leave Ariel to cry, then that would be closer to the book. But no, we need a third act! Speaking of Ariel, *sigh*, I HATE her. She's all like ""I've sold my soul for legs. LEGS!!!"" Gosh, she's selfish! Even though she did wrong (even apologized, but for only 10 seconds), she still GETS WHAT SHE WANTS! Typical though, she is a Disney Princess.<br/><br/>So, you're probably wondering, if I hate the changes to the plot and the main character, why did I give it a 6? Because of 3 things; the music, the villain and the animation. This was made after Oliver & Co. so comparing the two is like comparing cheese and a marble statue. Second, the music is amazing. I even like 'Part of Your World', even though it's just a wine, but a pretty wine. I definitely LOVE 'Poor Unfortunate Souls'! That songs just rocks! And speaking of villains, Ursula is one of the best villains EVER! Being cunning and clever, but also manipulative and snarky! Definitely not someone I want to meet on a cold dark night when I'm swimming.<br/><br/>On the whole, it's an enjoyable movie. Sure the plot is a bit whimsical, but it makes up for it with the musical accompaniment. The main character has as much of a character as a wasp, but the villain is developed so well. So I would say go see it, but mostly just to say you've seen it. Another treasure trove to add to Disney's collection of thingamabobs."
"ikrani","6","1","6","20 February 2014"," It's... Eh, alright.
","While this IS the movie that started the Disney Renaissance, I feel that it was more due to the animation than the riveting story or characters.<br/><br/>First, the Good: the animation is spectacular. Why they switched from this to whatever was used in Pocahontas and Hunchback will always be a mystery to me because it is BEAUTIFUL. The songs are pretty good, though I've always found Part of Your World to be a bit, um, ""whiney"". Under the Sea is good, and Poor Unfortunate Souls is also good. Kiss the Girl WAS good until it was bastardized by female pop singers like Selena Gomez. Since then, it just hasn't been the same.<br/><br/>Then the Bad: a lot of scenes in this movie are rather boring. Maybe it's because I have a Y-chromosome, but I never found Ariel fawning over Eric or King Triton blowing his top to be that enjoyable. Again, the musical numbers are fun, but the scenes between them aren't very memorable in terms of dialogue and events, excluding the climax and that one scene of Ariel combing her hair with a fork.<br/><br/>Now, the Ugly: I never realized it before, but I can totally sympathize with people who hate Ariel. Why? Because she essentially sells her ""voice"" to the underwater version of the Devil in exchange for a shot at a getting guy. She does nothing to really help anyone else throughout the movie and doesn't spend much time thinking about things other than herself, boys, and human trinkets. At the end she gets her father turned into a... plant-fish-thing? And, despite all the trouble her raging teenage hormones have caused, she still gets what she wants.<br/><br/>THAT'S not a harmful message at all! If you enjoy the movie, fine, I can easily see why: it's a very colorful, very beautiful film. But in my opinion, it doesn't hold up against other Disney films like Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, or The Great Mouse Detective, who may lack stunning visuals but more than make up for it in story and characters, especially the latter."
"Rosabel","Null","1","7","19 December 1999"," Least objectionable of the new Disney movies
","This movie has a lot of enjoyable features to it, and is not too badly tainted by Disney's now omnipresent anti-male, anti-tradition bias.  Ariel is for the most part a genuinely appealing character, and only occasionally falls into the California brat style that Disney movies usually present as their ideal.  The anti-male bias comes out in the treatment of her father, King Triton, who is presented as a bigoted blowhard, but he also is allowed to be a popular and kind-hearted ruler, and genuinely fond of his children, which balances the picture to some extent.  On the other hand, he is the one who has to learn that he is wrong, not Ariel, whose foolishness puts everyone in peril.  When she disappears to pursue Prince Eric, it is her father who is left worried and regretting what he has done, while she is having a carefree adventure on dry land.  The handsome prince is a bore, as is usually the case in these movies, but Sebastian and Ursula are presented with a lot of energy and provide the funniest moments in the film."

Ariel's voice actress, Jodi Benson does have a nice singing voice, and the characters are well done and funny. However, the main issue with The Little Mermaid is that the heroine, Ariel is willing to stop seeing her father and sisters and underwater friends forever just to be with an unknown man she hasn't even spoken to. Falling in love with someone on looks when you're giving up your voice for a pair of human legs when you don't even know the guy's name is pretty dumb. Now I know this takes place in that old time, but Ariel focused a whole three days to fall in love with someone and get him to kiss her because they were ""handsome"". It takes more than a few minutes or three days to fall in love. In the scene where she doesn't hesitate to say the famous love story line ""Daddy, I love him!"" when she hasn't spoken one word to him.<br/><br/>Now overall this is a good movie, but I wouldn't make it one if my all time Disney favorites considering that most princess movies are about love, when The Little Mermaid makes it good over the top some."

"tomgillespie2002","6","0","1","20 February 2015"," The first sign of that old Disney magic
","Kicking off what is now known as the Disney Renaissance (following a brutal decade of flops and underachievers), The Little Mermaid reignited some of that old Disney magic, with some beautiful and lovingly-drawn animation and a good old-fashioned, yet familiar, story. Based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, it's a tale of a beautiful princess who falls in love with a dashing prince, with the snag being that the girl, Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) has a flipper, lives under the sea, and is best friends with a Rastafarian crab and a cowardly tropical fish.<br/><br/>King of the sea Triton (Kenneth Mars) is obeyed by all in his realm, with the exception of the most important person in his life, his daughter Ariel. She has bigger dreams and is obsessed with the deadly world of ships and brutal men above the sea surface. One day, she swims to the world above and spots dashing prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes), who she instantly falls in love with. Desperate to escape her father who forbids her wild adventures, she is taken by two eels, Flotsam and Jetsam (both voiced by Paddi Edwards) to Ursula (Pat Carroll), a sea witch with tentacles like an octopus. In exchange for Ariel's beautiful voice, Ursula transforms her into a human, but she must receive true love's kiss within three days or else she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula's garden of creepy souls.<br/><br/>The fact that The Little Mermaid is very much in the style of 'classic' Disney works both for and against the film. On one hand, it's beautifully drawn with memorable songs ('Under the Sea' is a particular stand-out), but it also treads the overly familiar fairytale tropes of princes, princesses, witches and the kiss of 'true love'. However, it brought Disney into the modern era. Ariel is not just a la-di-da maiden who enjoys cleaning whilst singing sickly tunes; she is independent and slightly wild, eager to explore the mysterious world she does not belong to. Her companions are also welcome, with crab Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) providing many laughs, especially in his efforts to escape a pompous chef who wants to cook and serve him. It's perfectly likable throughout, but Disney wouldn't find it's true magic again until two years later.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"makayla-vigil13","8","0","1","1 December 2014"," Searching For a Whole New World
","Searching For a Whole New World<br/><br/>Just imagine falling in love with someone from a completely different world. Would you try and make it work? In the Disney movie, The Little Mermaid, a young mermaid did everything that she could to live happily ever after with a young human prince. This movie is an animated fantasy and would generally be for young children and more aimed at the girls, but I think it's a great for everyone. As you would expect for all movies like this one, there are certain expectations that should be met: good character introduction and role, underlying life lessons, and music as well as talking. The Little Mermaid is worth watching it: follows expectations, its entertaining, and has a great story line—easy to follow and fun for everyone—with life lessons within the movie.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid has several characters; the main characters are introduced well and there is never question on who is who. They all have their own role in the movie and there is just enough to keep track of but not so many that you lose track of them. Ariel is the main character and is s strong girl who takes risks to get attain what she strives to achieve. Some may argue that the bad character, Ursula, is too scary for young children and that the ending was changed making it not as good. But the ending was changed to make it more kid friendly and many people don't know the original version in the first place. Also it may be a bit frightening and make kids jump, but there is nothing bad that happens to main characters.<br/><br/>The movie has many underlying lessons that are portrayed as well as common issues that young girls come across in their life time. First of all, Ariel and her father don't get along to well, and he is against her falling in love with a human. They argue and after giving her a little trust and legs to walk on land, Ariel proves the love between her and the prince is real. Another part that is displaying a common problem with young girls is their looks and worry about looking good. Ariel mentions her beauty and her looks in several scenes throughout the movie hoping the prince is happy with them; she later realizes this is not as important as true love.<br/><br/>Lastly, the story line and music along with the movie is well put together. This movie is similar to a musical because all of the songs and music played goes along with the story line and the lyrics either support the story or add on to it. When she is striving to be with the prince and hoping one day she will be able to, she breaks out into a song that supports what she is trying to do. Some of the lyrics say, ""I don't know when/ I don't know how/ But I know something's starting right now/ Watch and you'll see/ Someday I'll be/ Part of Your World."" She wants so badly to be part of the prince's world on land rather than her world in the water. The music ties everything together and keeps you focused on the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie for kids and families to watch. Ariel takes risks and is strong as she changes from the underwater world to the on land world. I would give it 8 out of 10 stars and would recommend those who haven't seen it to watch it if they get a chance."
"bblack1-699-968577","3","0","4","15 June 2014"," Where the Crud Do I Begin?
","It's summer time, which means MORE REVIEWS! I'm starting out the season by reviewing Disney animated films, beginning with the Renaissance from the late '80s/early '90s. With that, let's talk about ""The Little Mermaid!""<br/><br/>ANIMATION: The animation is really spectacular! I can see why this film sparked the Disney Renaissance - it just looks amazing! I love the colors, the lighting, the fluent movement of the people - but you're always reminded that it's animated. It's a stylized art, and it's animation at its best.<br/><br/>SONGS/MUSIC: Obviously, this movie has some really impressive and memorable songs. Everybody remembers ""Under the Sea,"" and, I have to admit, I like the song as well. The song I enjoy more than that is ""Part of Your World."" I love the music, I love the way it sounds. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken definitely knew how to make these songs sound like they were taken straight from Broadway! I don't know if I like the lyrics though, but we'll get to that later. My favorite song from the movie, though, is ""POOR UNFORTUNATE SOUL!!!!"" This song kicks butt! I don't want to talk too much about it now, but my goodness! The lyrics, the music, the singer - the song is just unbelievable! You can tell so much energy and passion was thrown into this!<br/><br/>ROMANCE: I'll be honest, this movie has a nice romantic element. I don't think it's Disney's best, but you do believe these characters are in love. They're willing to risk anything to be together, they can't stop thinking about each other, and, unlike Disney's earlier romances, Eric and Ariel actually have to work to fall in love; it's not necessarily love at first sight...not necessarily. I'll give it a pass here.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: -URSULA - Good grief, I FRICKIN' LOVE URSULA!! One of the main reasons I love the ""Poor Unfortunate Soul"" number is because of her! Yes she's diabolical, manipulative, and menacing - and she's crudded awesome at being all those things! - but the real reason I love her is her character! She has a great character in this movie! She's not bland and boring - she has attitude! She has sass! She's a hard cold, lay-the-truth-out-for-you-nice-and-easy, get-what-she-wants type of character! If she were real...and human...and Saved...and not evil...I would totally marry her!<br/><br/>-SEBASTIAN/SCUTTLE - These guys are OK. There are a few times I find them a little annoying, but even then they're not THAT annoying. They have some nice moments, and overall they are some good guys.<br/><br/>ERIC – Who the crud is this guy? Aside from his name and being nice, I don't remember too much from him. He's like the earlier Disney princes...but he talks.<br/><br/>-FLOUNDER - I don't like Flounder! I know he's cute and all, but he's not that good of a character to me. He's Ariel's closest friend, right? Then why doesn't he ever tell her that maybe she shouldn't disobey her father? He's a supportive friend - no question about it. But he should have told her, ""Ariel...Stop it.""<br/><br/>-KING TRITON - Before I saw this movie, I heard what a strong, powerful father he is. I was expecting him to be a sort of pre-Mufasa. What do we get instead? He's the stereotypical parent who doesn't understand and doesn't want to listen to his child. When he warned Ariel about going near humans, I was expecting there to be a reason for it. Was there a reason? Not at all! He just has a prejudice against land for some unknown reason, and we never figure out why. He's not that bad of a character; in fact, I really like him. He loves his daughter, he's a strong parent, and he has great power. But from a dramatic standpoint, his lack of reason for why Ariel can't go to land makes him look unfair and cruel. To be fair, that's fine. She's your daughter and should do what you say. But if you reward her for doing what she shouldn't despite the fact that you forbade her from doing it in the first place, you look kind of weird.<br/><br/>FINALLY...<br/><br/>-ARIEL - ...Where the crud do I begin? She's selfish! If she had an option to take anything back, I don't think she would! Why? Because not only did she know what she was doing (deliberately going behind her father's back and disobeying him), but she got everything she wanted! Yes, despite her rebellion and causing so much trouble for everyone around her, she still got her precious Happily Ever After! What the crud? Her song ""Part of Your World,"" though it sounds nice, is basically her just whining about her not being content with anything she has; and she won't be satisfied until she has more! It wouldn't bother me as much if it weren't for the fact that Ariel is the main character - the character we're supposed to learn from and identify with? What does she teach us? ""Hey kids! If you do the opposite of what your parents say, you'll live happily ever after! They're just parents! Just because they're older than you doesn't mean they're smarter and wiser and more experienced than you!"" I'm not asking for her to be perfect, but I don't think she learned a lesson in this film. When she apologizes to her father towards the end, I think she was saying that because Ursula caught her. If she didn't mean any of the trouble she caused, she wouldn't have caused it.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: There are things I'm passionately against in this movie, but I can't just up and say I hate it. I still think the things I mentioned earlier are great. If some of the characters and the moral wasn't so ethically flawed, I'd enjoy this movie a lot more. As is, it's OK. Take what I said and see if you agree or disagree. BOOYIKA!"
"sholic","6","0","1","21 July 2013"," Still magical
","Rewatching this as a 26 year old, some of the classic Disney wonders can be lost on you. As much as you've mentally prepared yourself to take things at face value, you still can't help to wonder the more realistic aspect of things. Forget the improbability of mermaids turning into people. Forget even the mere existence of mermaids and mermen for the sake of beliefs being suspended. We can still draw some of the plots unto our own stories. The biggest one personally for me is Ariel's eagerness as a teen (was it common for 16 year olds to get married back in '89?) and interests in a world different from her own, then having not so much as qualms to leave the only world she has known behind for her one true love.<br/><br/>This may seem a bit crass but I found it quite amusing that Disney proposed a mute heroine for the first time (I'm a female in case that's a merit for such finding). Maybe some men would find a very attractive red head who can't speak as the perfect package but Eric prefer his princess to be the singing kind. This point was totally lost on me as a 10 year old but one thing I vividly remember from the film was the heroine as 'she is big eyes, she is nice hair, I sure like that and wouldn't mind to look like her when I grow up'.<br/><br/>Putting all that aside, the film proved to be just as enjoyable as the last time I saw it (at least 16 years ago). A little backstory with Ariel and her sisters seem to have some potentials but I guess Disney has already explored that with Cinderella. Ursula still came across as intimidating especially after she did her voodoo and took over the crown and the All Power Holding Spear.<br/><br/>I've always thought the biggest part of Disney's charm is its unique ability to turn saccharine lyrics and arrangements into something magical and this is no exception to the general rule. Part Of Your World manage to sound appealing despite it being suited to a younger audience. As far as the voice talents are concerned, Disney has the trick down to a knack. This is what The Little Mermaid is all about - a Disney classy classic class."
"rumblinglove","Null","0","1","22 August 2009"," Too Many Songs
","The Disney version of the little mermaid is 10 times better then the original Hans Christain version. The plot is about a little mermaid called Ariel who one day falls in love with a prince and saves him from drawning. Despite to be with the prince the poor mermaid makes a deal with the evil sea witch Ursula to transform her into a human and stay in that form for three days if she (Ariel) doesn't win the kiss of true love with her man.<br/><br/>I also think that the movie would've been better often without so many songs. One thing i'm shocked about, how in the world was this movie rated G for general audience. In the scene of Ariel's transformation, it's implied that she's totally nude except for the breasts; bare buttocks were briefly shown. Also there's a scene where Ursula is cursing Ariel and we see that she's topless. Isn't the way Ursula was killed too violent for young viewers. The MPAA should really becareful with the ratings."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","1","19 April 2009"," A slightly overrated but overall impressive Disney flick
","I was only three years old at the time of this animated Disney movie's release, and can remember seeing a lot of it quite a few times back in the early 90's, but don't recall ever actually seeing the whole thing from start to finish. I don't think I ever watched any of ""The Little Mermaid"" after the early 90's, until this month, when I finally decided to rent it. (Before that, I didn't even know how the film ended, and the last bit of it didn't ring any bells.) Although I hadn't seen any of it since I was a little kid, and there are obviously many things which entertained me then but wouldn't now, I knew it was a popular Disney effort, so I had relatively high expectations. These expectations weren't quite met, but it has enough for me to give it a good review.<br/><br/>Ariel is a sixteen-year-old mermaid and one of the daughters of King Triton, the Sea King. Her best friend is a yellow and blue fish named Flounder. The teenage mermaid is not happy with life underwater, and wishes to be a human, living up on the land. However, her father believes that all humans are ""barbarians,"" and forbids Ariel to ever go up to the surface, though she sometimes does. He assigns his assistant, a crab named Sebastian, to keep an eye on her, but this doesn't turn out to be easy. When Ariel sees a ship at the surface, she goes up to observe the human activity. She sees Prince Eric, and immediately falls in love. When a storm comes and destroys the ship, the young prince nearly drowns, but Ariel rescues him and takes him back to shore. After more conflict with her father, Ariel goes to see Ursula, the Sea Witch, and makes a deal with her, but doesn't realize that the evil Sea Witch intends to use her to try and take King Triton's place as the ruler of the sea! <br/><br/>There are reasons why this particular Disney effort failed to absolutely blow me away, and one of them is the main character. Sometimes, Ariel's naivety can be excessive, and sometimes, thanks to her, the story doesn't seem quite right. It's certainly not the greatest love story ever told. ""The Little Mermaid"" doesn't have the greatest bunch of characters ever featured in a Disney film, and the script might sometimes be a problem as well. Fortunately, despite these flaws, there are quite a few things to like in this film. As usual with animated Disney films, there's humour here, provided by the likes of Scuttle, Ariel's seagull friend who tells her things about the human world (even though they are incorrect), as well as Sebastian, and sometimes other characters. There are also several memorable songs in this film (I can remember them from my childhood), which aren't bad, plus there's some excitement and nicely colourful animation, as usual for Disney.<br/><br/>It seems many people absolutely adore this 1989 Disney flick, and apparently, it turned out to be the most successful film Disney had made in quite a while. I think I've made it clear that I'm not one of the film's strongest admirers. In fact, around the beginning, I might have even been a tad puzzled about all the hype. Nonetheless, it is pretty good family entertainment. I'm unfamiliar with the original fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, which this movie is based on, so I don't know how good this Disney effort is in comparison. As an animated feature from the Walt Disney Company, it's weaker than quite a few others in this category, but if you're a Disney fan, it can be very entertaining. It's definitely a lot better than ""High School Musical"", and probably certain other recent trash from the Disney Channel, which I haven't seen, and probably don't want to."

","I wish I could be a part of Ariel's world! The animation in the movie is so breathtaking. If you just look at the backgrounds, or even just the characters themselves, it's amazing. I love the story. It's so creative. One thing I love about this movie is that it scared to no end. When King Triton came in a destroyed Ariel's trove (is that a spoiler? That's why it's marked...) it scared me. Also, I like Ursula and her sneaky ways. She is very, very evil..... She is one of my favorite Disney villains. And I love, LOVE LOVE LOVE Ariel's red hair. I have dark skin and yet I always wanted to have Ariel's red hair when I was little.... all in all a FABULOUS movie!"
"zlyoung9","Null","0","1","20 February 2006"," A good movie, but there are some problems with it
","Let me start by saying that I do complain of sexual references in this movie. I don't however complain about the alleged wedding scene. On one hand it could certainly be as it's described, but then I've seen less phallic looking knees.<br/><br/>The movie starts pretty well, but when Ariel first enters the movie (exploring sunken ships with her guppy friend) you almost cringe thinking about what will happen next. Who was Disney targeting when the main character was a curvy adolescent in a skimpy sea-shell bra? The movie remains pretty good until Ariel sees Eric. Maybe love at first sight happens, maybe it doesn't. I won't advocate either way, but in truth what does Eric have going for him other than good looks, or in Ariel's case, a pair of legs as well? The movie really gets going when Ariel meets Ursula, and though the idea of an evil octopus in a night dress is intriguing I'd rather not contemplate it too closely. Ursula has style and is perhaps one of the best Disney villains ever although Rattigan is at least her equal, but it cannot be denied that the blandishments with which she convinces Ariel to do as she says are a little suggestive.<br/><br/>On the subject of Ariel, she's not all that objectionable. Her breasts, are heavily emphasized by her bra and when she's a human hardly noticeable. Unless you just look for such things right away. And having long hair and a tiny waist isn't a criminal offense. If you want to attack someone for their body structure wait for a different character to take the scene.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie doesn't get terrible until it's close to it's conclusion and Urusla transforms into Vanessa. Ariel isn't really built like a sex-toy, but I'd go far enough to say that Vanessa is. She's much more buxom, has wider hips, and a possibly slimmer waist. Why was Disney trying to hit me over the head with her sexuality? All of the scenes Vanessa was in were a bit too heavy like that, but that wedding scene debacle was just too much to handle. That drew attention to sexuality much more than Ariel's bra did.<br/><br/>All of that said, I still enjoyed the movie. It had a nice fluffy story, good characters, and if it wasn't for Ursula being Vanessa, one of the best Disney villains I've ever known."

","Okay so I really liked this movie. Yes, I saw it when I was probably 4 or 5 years old. That was several years ago. But it's still pretty good. It has its highs and its lows really.<br/><br/>Basically it's the story of a teenage mermaid who wants to live on land. She collects treasures from land such as a 'dinglehopper' (a fork, but she thinks it's a comb) and a statue of a handsome prince. She rescues this prince one night when he drowns and sings to him, deciding she's in love. Her father has told her time and time again not to go above the surface, but what does she care? He tells Sebastian, his lobster or crab or whatever, to watch her, but he gets dragged into the drama. In the end, she makes a bet with Ursuala the sea witch, where Ursula takes her voice and gives her legs. She has three days to kiss him or Ursula gets her 'Poor Unfortunate Soul.' Of course, she kisses him, they fall in love and get married, and her dad approves in the end.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the music. I'm listening to it now. It puts out that you should risk EVERYTHING for a guy you've never really met, and little girls shouldn't think that. The thing is, that's not what kids get out of the movie, no matter what some people say! One thing I really don't get is how she can get married. She's a teenager (I've heard 13, I've heard 16, it really doesn't matter which is true) so how does she marry?? Anyways, this movie has great music and awesome characters, and you can easily fall in love with it."

","Spoilers, I think! This film is my favorite movie of all time. I first saw it when I was two, and it was the first movie I ever saw in theaters. It has changed my life. In fact, my little brother is named Eric because of this movie. I have seen it probably a hundred times, not kidding, and can recite almost the whole thing. But it is only a movie. It's a story, meant to entertain and take you away from reality. It is not supposed to be realistic, in events or characters or anything else. She's a mermaid with talking animals for friends! It's not going to make girls become airheads, which Ariel is not by the way, or make them marry young or anything else, any more than it will make crabs sing and dance. It's a fairy tale, most of which are silly and full of unrealistic characters anyways. That said, Ariel is a very intelligent and strong character. She and Eric are in love because it's meant to be. If you think three days is a short time to wait before marriage try reading other fairy tales where they wed ten minuets after they meet. Besides which, there is no indication that weeks or months didn't pass between the kiss on the beach and the wedding. Anyhoo, the movie is spectacular in its animation, music, voices, and characters. And my last two points are that Eric does not go for Vanessa because he is a twit, but because he is bewitched. She's a witch, he's under a spell, see the glowy yellow eyes. Lastly, for the thousandth time, the supposed sexual content in the movie is a misunderstanding. E-mail me and I will explain it to you."

","In the animated world, mermaid's have seldom if ever been portrayed like this.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>The back of the box reads ""somewhere under the sea, and far beyond your imagination..."", but I can't help but think about how close to reality t.v. this film is. With Ariel's fiery red hair and headstrong, rebellious attitude, this had to take place somewhere near Ireland. Her father, King Triton, has a bad temper. So does the antagonist, Ursula. OK, the chef is french, but nevertheless he tries twice to murder Sebastian, a reggae singing crab. (Who can be pretty vocal in his own right). Is this family dysfunctional? Well, if Triton fathered seven daughters, where's his wife? They all seem to be about the same age. The poor woman probably left the marraige due to stress. Triton also hates humans, which in these days would be perfect fodder for ""The Jerry Springer Show"".<br/><br/>It's no wonder, given this current state of affairs, that Ariel wants to be a part of the human world. Unfortunately, this is forbidden in the mer-world. But Ariel's thirst (no pun intended) for knowledge has driven her to the surface several times to collect treasure's in a secret trove. But, this isn't enough. So after a falling out with Triton, she turns to Ursula the sea witch and gets a 72 hour stay with her true love, Eric. But, the price is high. Ariel signs away her life and gives up her voice in exchange. So, what's a woman to do? Well, she obviously knows how to write, since she signed the contract. They simply could've exchanged love letters and kissed. But, Ariel is so taken with Eric she must not have thought about this as an option.<br/><br/>After a close brush with fate in a blue lagoon, Ursula realizes Ariel's craftier then she thought. She turns into a mysterious enchantress who casts a spell on Eric. One would think at this point that Ariel would see him as a player who falls for any woman that comes along. But, as is the case in real life, he stands dumbfounded on the altar, rushing into a quick marriage with little or no thoughts of the consequences. In the end, Ursula's spell is broken, but she isn't about to go down easy. Her transformation into a giant near the end is one of the best moments ever captured in an animated film. Eric and Ariel marry, and live happily ever after, even though they've only been together for three days. It is a wonderful film, but after thinking it through this also could have taken place off the California coast..."
"kshr-1","10","0","1","2 March 2004"," Disney Animation At Its Best
","Released in late 1989, this Disney classic instantly became a huge hit with everyone, critics and audiences, breathing a whole new life in the animation genre, which up to that point (since the early 1970's) was considered poison in the movie industry. ""The Jungle Book"" (1967) was the last great animated flick to grace the screen; since then, lesser known films were released and though some of them performed nicely with the public, they were a far cry from classics such as ""Bambi"" and ""Cinderella"". That all changed in 1989, with the release of ""The Little Mermaid"". The animation in the film is spectacular. The film looks like no other film before it. The colors are rich and vibrant and the picture is full of detail. The scenes shot underwater are breathtaking but so are the ones on land. Eric's castle looks jaw-dropping. The music is top-notch. You probably know the Oscar-winning ""Under The Sea"", which  in my opinion is the best song in the film. The characters are very memorable and some of Disney's most beloved, with Sebastian the crab providing both a side-kick and an important role. He's actually featured in one of the most memorable scenes in the film: of all the rooms in Eric's castle, he has to fall right into the kitchen, where Louis the chef tries to cook him. All these make ""The Little Mermaid"" the classic it is today. Everyone should be a part of it."

","At first I didn't expect much from this movie. I even thought that the animation was terrible. But halfway throughout the movie, I had a change of heart. Even though the ending was twisted -- it's a happy ending, unlike the original sad one -- I think this movie is one of Disney's greatest animations.<br/><br/>The characters are likable, especially Sebastian the crab! The songs are nice and catchy, and I like ""Part of Your World"" the most. Jodi Benson is simply wonderful in singing the songs.<br/><br/>This heartwarming twisted fairy tale is much better than the original. Sorry, Mr. Andersen, but that's the truth... :-)"

","Movies for the most part are entertainment.  That is all they are meant to be.  A few times in your life, just at the right time, just when you are at a turning point --- a movie comes along that mirrors your own emotions, your own angst, and your own sense of self.  if this movie comes along just at the right moment, then the movie transcends entertainment and becomes an experience.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid, was an experience for me.  I sometimes think I may have been a little older than most people who it was meant for. But it's idea, of finding a place where you belong, of being part of something special, whether be it love, or something else was in line with my particular growing pains at the time.<br/><br/>The movie's characters, both Ariel and Prince Eric had a common bond, in that they wanted to surpass everyone's expectations of them, and they did. When I saw the movie, I was also going through that.<br/><br/>Never mind that this film is a CLASSIC. Perhaps one of the top 10 animated films ever made, I find it has a much deeper heart than Beauty and the Beast, and although it signified the beginning of a brand new Disney Empire, I find that it also signified the end of it.  A film like this, can be imitated but it can never be duplicated.  And animation has grown into a magnificence and technologically superior story telling medium.  But what the Little Mermaid had, it's still to be re-captured, and that's a heart as big and as deep as the ocean."

","I have always loved fish, and underwater scenes ever since I saw The Little Mermaid. it Opens up a new world for kids and shows you what the ocean really contains and how the fish really act. The animation was very cool, too. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes the ocean or likes disney movies. The Little Mermaid was probably the best disney movie in my opinion, anyway.

","This is probably one of the greatest Disney cartoons ever made. The soundtrack is great. The character and their personalities were great too.

I recommend this movie for little kids and also for older people who just wants to relax."

","This is such a pleasant romp from ""Under the Sea"" to being a ""Part of that World"".  While the end is certainly scary for those under 5, for those 5 and over the movie has much to offer.  Parents will also be engaged with the quick pacing and catchy tunes.  I like Disney, despite the tendency for sappy, whitewashed, masculine-based fantasy.  This one clearly stands out above the rest."
"Lady Jasmine","Null","0","2","14 June 2002"," A rebirth and a classic in it's own right
","This, in my opinion, is the movie that saved Disney from fading out of existence, as we know it. Before the Little Mermaid there had not been a blockbuster Disney animated feature for years (specifically not since the Great Mouse Detective) while Oliver and Company was released the year prior to this it was following the old formula and was not, to my knowledge, particularly successful.<br/><br/>The Little Mermaid revived the breathtaking beauty of the classic Disney films like Sleeping Beauty and the classic Snow White with it's tale of innocence pursued by evil, and true love conquering all.<br/><br/>
With something for the whole family this gem of a film is really a classic in it's own right. It stands alone as one of Disney's most enchanting modern creations for a new generation. It bears repeated viewing remarkably well, and the musical score is both original and entertaining with many different styles included throughout.<br/><br/>Rent it today and enter the true magic of what Disney should really be!"
"nbachris2788","Null","0","2","13 April 2002"," Undeniably one of Disney's best
","*I only recommend you read this review if you have viewed the movie and are reading reviews to observe other people's opinions and thoughts, because it does contain spoilers*<br/><br/><br/><br/>Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Cinderella... Before 1989, these were the crown jewels of Disney. Pure classics that no one could desecrate or destroy. Unfortunately, for a long stretch, Disney lost its touch with the viewers. They released uninteresting full length features featuring short stories about Mickey and Co. Entertaining, but certainly not deep enough to become classics.<br/><br/>Then came The Little Mermaid in 1989. There were some good Disney movies in the eighties, most notably the heart-breaking yet uplifting Fox and the Hound, and the animal translation of Sherlock Holmes called The Great Mouse Detective. There were some dunders too. The Black Cauldron was suppose to reinvigorate Disney, but instead, from what I've heard, it was dark and unfit for the target audience, children. It ranks up with Atlantis: The Lost Empire as the only Disney animated features to receive a PG rating. Anyways, The Little Mermaid burst onto the screen with such life, energy, beauty, and heart that it just turned the studio around. The fantasy tale of a growing mermaid who risks it all for love captured the hearts of all. Why shouldn't it? It was romantic, funny, and very optimistic of the world we live in. Most famously, it had some of the greatest music in movie history. Under The Sea, Part of Your World, and Kiss The Girl were the best, while the supporting numbers were good as well. Lovable characters like Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder gave the heart to the story.<br/><br/>It's 2002 now, and The Little Mermaid is 13 years old now, or 12. However old it is, it has aged remarkably well, showing the timelessness of the film. Disney is in a rut much like it was in before The Little Mermaid was released. So all the more people appreciate this movie. I was 12 when I first saw it, on The Wonderful World of Disney. I recorded it, and fell in love with it. I saw it every day after school for days. It became my favorite Disney film, and among my favorite-est movies ever.<br/><br/>But I must say, at the age of fourteen now, The Little Mermaid is not my favorite Disney movie anymore. It has to do with the lack of depth in the story, a little over-cuteness feel to it. Make no mistake, I still love it, but some other richer films that the Mouse House released has impressed me more. With the way I'm going on here, you'd think I dislike this movie. That's wrong. I LOVE it. Starting with the music. My favorite is Part of Your World. I never really got into Under The Sea, and Kiss The Girl is a sap song, in the best way possible, but still, a sap song. Yeah, Part of Your World is a sap song too, but I just love the voice and the melody, and the longing.  Secondly, all the characters are just lovable. Even the villain, with a nasty wit and a look that just screams EVIL. Ariel is beautifully drawn, with her sexy red hair. The very thin waist and fish tail is not very appealing, but you can't help but get a crush on Ariel. Her father, Triton, comes off as an over-strict father, but it's easy to see how much love he has. Ariel's sidekicks, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle, are lifelong friends who never stop fighting for her. The only bad major character is Eric. He's a prince, but never seems to have any active role. Just kinda sits around playing his recorder and wrestling his dog, the also lovable Max.<br/><br/>The animation is pretty dated compared to latest offerings like the amazing Tarzan and Atlantis. But that's hardly the matter. The beauty of the film is its radiance, not in its drawings and colors.<br/><br/>As an extra note of personal opinion, I cannot tell you how sick I am of feminists and over-worried mothers that think that letting their young daughters watch this classic movie will turn them into ""doomed airheads like Ariel"". They claim that Ariel gets Eric's love because she loses her voice and gets legs. Excuse me? Eric was about to marry Vanessa, the sea witch in disguise, and only when Ariel got her voice back did he fully love her. And when he lost her legs, he risked his life to get her back. Another claim is that Ariel's a bad role model because she gives up her family and friends for the affection of a man she hardly knows. Well, her father destroyed all her possessions, she thought Sebastian sold her out... And just after that happened, the sea witch swoons her with promises of true love. Don't you think anybody would've grabbed that chance? Yet another claim is Ariel's tiny waist and big breasts. First of all, she doesn't have much breast to speak of. Second of all, her tiny waist is actually quite small, but who really cares? These over-zealous feminists won't be happy until a Disney movie remakes Cinderella with a Shrek-like ogre taking Cinderelly's place, and the story goes that Cindrella takes her house by force, makes her cruel step sisters and step mother into her servants, marries the prince because of her savvy business skills, and then finally usurps the throne from the king, in the end becoming an asexual single mom queen who brings prosperity to the land. Just a rant. And also, parents should guide their children to enjoy fairy tales, but also make the distinction between reality and fantasy. If they don't do that, that's just lazy parenting.<br/><br/>So in overall, The Little Mermaid gets an 8/10. The story's not as in depth as Beauty and the Beast, Mulan, or Tarzan, but it's just as heart-warming. Arguably the most important movie Disney ever made, excluding Snow White.<br/><br/>

","Where to start?  I have always loved this movie, and like all Disney, it probably had a lot to do with shaping who I am.  Is this why I am vegetarian now? who can say!<br/><br/>I just celebrated my 24th birthday listening to a 3-volume set of Disney music, which I had bought at Disney World years ago, since they didn't have the Little Mermaid soundtrack by itself.<br/><br/>And I gleamed something magical.  I felt like a chimney sweep on the London rooftops gazing into the soul of Disney:  Just as Mickey is the very heart of Disney, Ariel is the very-human voice of us Disney children.<br/><br/>It all started with Mickey Mouse, all endless, innocent antics.  The characters in Disney movies hence became more diverse, but the style and music was fairly consistent.<br/><br/>Now, I quiver at films like Return to Neverland, which make it seem like you HAVE to have rock stars re-hash the old magic since the times are a-changin' and you can't top perfection.<br/><br/>But it isn't so!  Never has a fantasy character been as pure as Snow White and as introspecting as Hamlet, at the same time.  And never has a movie soundtrack been such a captivating symphony of all-to-familiar styles, with new-born heart-melting melodies.<br/><br/>This movie proves that no matter what, Disney has an endless arsenal of pixie dust that can be taken to anybody's living room, ANY time.<br/><br/>The world faces harsh times now, but if you listen, you can hear Ariel singing about the promised land."
