","This was on my to-watch list for quite a while before I gave it a chance. Holy crap this movie is good. Not ten stars good, obviously, but man it throws some curve balls. All of the actors were competent and believable. The tension builds and builds. The ending was stereotypical but didn't detract from the film at all. Wonder how much time Patrick Stewart had to spend in makeup to play a skinhead lol."
"Deimos-remus","10","117","180","12 July 2016"," White Knuckle filmmaking at its best
","First off, want to say R.I.P Anton Yelchin. Such a tragedy for someone so young and promising to pass. He was incredible in this, I felt he was really coming into his own as an actor. --- After watching Saulnier's excellent and understated Blue Ruin, the director immediately became one to watch out for. A director that knows how to direct characters with subtlety and nuance, but with intensity and brutality as well. <br/><br/>Green Room is perhaps the most stressed out I've ever been watching a film, and if I'm not clear, that's actually a good thing. Few films ever get such a visceral reaction out of me, but Green Room managed to do that, and then some, delivering on many fronts as a contender for my favorite film of the year. Since the beginning of the year, A24 has been unstoppable, putting out some of the most unique and incredible genre movies to be released in quite some time.<br/><br/>Green Room is certainly violent and grim. Its sense of dread and brutality is unending and relentless, yet never overstays its welcome or becomes cartoonish or fetishistic. It could've very easily gone into Saw, Hostel or Martyrs territory, letting the bloodshed become the most memorable aspect of the experience, but it did something much more. Not only does the brutality feel real and impactful, unlike the aforementioned films, the characters feel totally believable and genuine, completely immersed in their roles. The protagonists are naive and brash, yet fresh and relatable delinquents. The antagonists are subdued, quiet and strategic, yet animalistic and complex. From a character standpoint, it is such a welcome and ultimately more human change of pace.<br/><br/>For a movie so steeped in violence, it's a very humanistic movie, filled with rich and complex characters that feel like they're apart of something completely real and also very intimate and small-scale. The story is not a black and white 'good vs evil' kind of thing, all characters have their own shortcomings and sympathetic sides, making for an incredibly dynamic cast. It's a debilitatingly horrifying film, yet done with the same amount of care and understatement as Blue Ruin. It's a white knuckle thrillfest, and one that pits a lump in your stomach from the intensity witnessed on screen."

","I've heard people rave about this film and seen the high reviews. I'm not sure what I missed... I'd assumed there'd be something beneath the surface that would add substance to a gorey B-Movie, but I just don't see it. Patrick Stewart as a Neo Nazi is the only reason I won't rate it lower. Sub par slasher with delusions of grandeur. Nowhere near the cultish status it strives for."
"WalterSoprano","8","118","195","1 May 2016"," Violence at its most chilling and effective!
","I have seen some crazy violent films from cannibal holocaust to a Serbian film but no other film that comes to mind executes violence as un settling as this. For me I mean this in a positive way for others the violence could be the very thing to turn them off to it and possibly ruin the movie. May this be a forewarning for some and a recommendation for those who might be interested.<br/><br/>To start with the usual things to look at as far as acting and writing I would say this film does an excellent job. The acting from all is believable and extremely convincing. The writing is good with some humor and plenty of good dialogue. What the film masters completely is tension. Jeremy has truly shown his talent as a director with this one. The tension and situations that spawn violence are all very believable and realistic only adding to the tension and overall tone. Speaking of tone they set it incredibly well with one of the first acts of violence which will stick with me for a long long time. <br/><br/>Funny thing about this movie is that it's considered a thriller. What I mean by funny is that as a thriller (which it really is) it is more chilling and horrifying than most if not all the other horror movies I've seen recently. There are jump scares but they're done properly. This isn't a scary due to monsters and ghouls though, it's scary because of how realistic and effective the violence is to where it really sticks with you.<br/><br/>As you probably already know this is a film best going in knowing little to nothing to get the full experience, personally I went in knowing more than I should have, however, it didn't matter. I was on the edge of my seat with sweaty palms due to how tense and unpredictable it is. There is a lot to talk about with this film but a lot of it cant be discussed without spoilers so all I can say is see it yourself. If you can't handle violence then I am strongly telling you to avoid this film. On the other hand this is among the best films I've seen this year no doubt. As a display of well executed violence and tension this film will definitely make a name for itself. I hope this is useful thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the movie."
"nitro999","8","7","8","1 December 2018"," A must watch if you have any appreciation of indie efforts
","I watched this movie because I so enjoyed Jeremy Saulnier's ""Blue Ruin"" in which I thought all the characters were 'real' people and the action believable. If you want a brief respite from Hollywood's high-dollar, high-tech gloss then you will probably enjoy this depiction of a nitty gritty, down and dirty, all out, no holds barred fight for survival. Set aside a couple of hours and give this movie a watch. The acting was good, particularly from Patrick Stewart whose appearance in this Indie effort lent it some Hollywood 'depth'. The movie would have been just fine without him, but it was good to see him playing a cool part in a low budget show. Okay, there were a couple of 'oh-I-wish-I'd-had-my-eyes-closed-when-that-happened' moments but nothing too far out. As in ""Blue Ruin"", all the characters had a 'real people' feel. Highly recommended - by me anyway. On my 0 to 9 scale an 8."
"dragonempress-16006","4","27","40","4 June 2019"," What did I just watch?
","I came into this movie with high hopes. I love Patrick Stewart, and hearing his wife call this 'the scariest role he's ever played' was very intriguing. I had heard about the gore, and the intense atmosphere, and I even managed to go into the movie without seeing any trailers or reading any spoilers. I was pretty hype for a movie that could keep me up at night and make me see Stewart in a whole new light.
That is certainly not what I got.
It started a little slow, but that's to be expected with a lot of thriller/horror pieces so I gave it a break at the beginning. Things picked up a little once everyone was trapped in the green room, and I was still on edge for the moment when crap would hit the fan. The gore was as impressive and subtle as promised, the setup was nice and smooth, and the acting was actually pretty good too. Still had some high hopes at this point.
Patrick Stewart shows up. I'm ready to be intimidated and menaced. He comes in to sleaze his way into disarming the protagonists and dips. Good start. Still waiting for some real action, but we're getting there. At one point I paused the film to grab a drink, still anticipating a breaking point or moment of clarity for some character or another, and lo and behold, I'm halfway through the movie already!
I know what this means, and the disappointment sets in quick, but I manage to sit through the next half of the film. Literally nothing happens. Patrick Stewart has almost no presence, and to be honest neither does anyone else. We don't learn anything that would endear us to the characters or make us identify with them, so it's not much of a big deal when they die. Or when they win. The ending so anti-climactic that I actually rolled my eyes when the credits finally ran.
There are some good things about this film. The premise is good, the acting is believable, and the effects are fantastic. The way they presented and used the gore in this film is almost tasteful in a way; graphic, but not super gratuitous. Also the dog. The dog is really the best thing about this movie, and *SPOILER* I'm glad he lived at least to the end, though he is more than likely to die later.
After all the hype and positivity around this, I really wonder if I watched the wrong movie. I don't see any of the suspense, intensity, or masterful direction that so many other reviews rave about. Maybe I'm just not the audience this movie was made for? As a horror fanatic and lowkey gorehound, I wouldn't think that was the case. Maybe I need another watch to ""get"" it? Possibly, but I really don't see myself rewatching this one ever again. Oh, well. ¯\_(-.-)_/¯"

","A punk rock band is brought into playing at skinhead club. After their set, whilst hey are leaving the club, by mistake they end up in the wrong room and witness a murder. Tension rises between the club managers and the band who are forced into a room and trapped in there whilst Darcy (Patrick Stewart), the head of the skinhead fellowship as well as the owner of the club, tries to put together a plan before things go too south.<br/><br/>Written and directed by one of the most promising rising directors of this time, Jeremy Saulnier, ""Green Room"" is one of those perfectly packaged thrillers, with originality of premise and style, perfect pacing and tight well-knit editing and whilst it may be a little chaotic it never looses the investment in character.<br/><br/>One of the big surprises of 2016, after all the buzz I simply couldn't wait to check this movie out, its intriguing premise and unique cast were fascinating and I can confidently say that the film delivers on both.<br/><br/>Whilst we have had many thrillers in the past where people get locked into a room and have to find a way to escape, we haven't yet had one with this unique voice behind it. Saulnier manages to spin around with the premise and deliver a thriller that is stylish without being noisy or overdone. The catalyst of the whole plot works perfectly and the characters who are set up brilliantly in the first ten minutes work wonderfully in this environment.<br/><br/>The instant world building the director manages to convey through visuals is absorbing, it places the viewer right in the middle of the chaos and manages to never loose the geography of the setting. The cinematography of the film early on delivers some beautiful and insightful shots that perfectly serve the story and set up, but once sh*t starts hitting the fan the editing of the film comes majorly into play and does a superb job. The tense atmosphere conveyed through color and pace never leaves the screen and pervades the audience in every second of the movie until the end.<br/><br/>Just as deserving is definitely the make up department which has a couple of really key moments that hit the viewer like a brick and contribute in giving a sense of anxiety and fear that once again is appended to the audience for the whole duration. Ultimately it also comes down to the three central performances by Yelchin, Poots and Stewart, whom are all remarkably great, the highlight definitely being Poots for me who manages to totally disappear in the role to the point that I didn't know she was in the film until I read the cast list. I have been a big supporter of her and can't wait to see what she gives us in the future.<br/><br/>Where the movie slightly looses its flow is in clarity of motivations and the logistical movements where I found myself repeatedly uncertain. As I said before, you never loose the thrill nor the location and empathy for the characters, you are always behind them and want them to get the fu*k out of that hell. The problem resides in the fact that too many times I was unclear on why what was happening was happening, why were the skinheads acting the way they were and why were they going batsh*t crazy. This also takes something away from Stewart's performance which on its own stands as great, yet never really plays into the big picture because of the chaos which ensues not being ever understandable by the audience.<br/><br/>""Green Room"" still remains a more than worthy effort, a great thriller, a fantastic lesson in editing and a magnificent does of anxiety and adrenaline."
"Screen_Blitz","9","43","73","26 September 2016"," Extremely violent, gory but wildly exhilarating from beginning to end
","Director Jeremy Saulnier exercises high pressure suspense and astonishing realism in this white-knuckle thriller following his surprising success with the ultra-violent 'Blue Ruins'. Though it doesn't fall deep in the category of originality or even groundbreaking in any sense, the intriguing fashion in which Saulnier executes this film and the immersive cinematography by Sean Porter used to capture the harrowing intensity and gloomy visuals result in a highly effective slasher treat; and even labeling the results effective feels like an understatement. While the shocking level of bloody violence and gore more than not make this tough sit-through, especially for the weak stomach; Saulnier pervades a true sense of realism in a way in which the film never feels exploitative, but wildly authentic. So this film follows a punk rock band consisting of twenty-something year olds including lead singer Tiger (played by Callum Turner), guitarist Sam (played by Alia Shawkat), bassist Pat (played by Anton Yelchin), and drummer Reece (played by Joe Cole). When the band is offered a gig by a radio host named Tad, they find themselves performing at nowhere other than an old bar run by neo-Nazi skinheads. After a successful performance, the band and their friend Amber (played by Imogen Poots) rushes out to their green room where they witness a murder by the hands of a sadistic skinhead. In fear of being held responsible for the murders, skinhead leader Darcy Banker (played by Patrick Stewart) arrives an orders his gangs to eliminate the witnesses, leading the band to a bloody fight for survival.<br/><br/>Jeremy Saulnier grants this intensely violent thriller with a gift to not only leave viewers shocked and squirming in their seats, but present an atmosphere so visceral to the point of giving viewers the feeling of not watching a gruesome slasher, but a real-life event unfolding on camera; and the scariest aspect of this film how brutally realistic it turns out on screen. Saulnier does such an amazing job on capturing the brutal intensity of each moment as the characters desperately battle their way through a violent bloodbath against a gang of white supremacists that threaten their young lives, and the camera work done by Sean Porter makes for great use to capture these dreadful moments. At various moments, the film intensifies to the point where you may constantly remind have to yourself you are not trapped inside the bar with the characters. While Saulnier's execution and Sean Porter's cinematography do justice, they only make up the half of the equation. The latter half is successfully achieved by Saulnier's screenplay. Instead of relying on the usual slasher horror stereotypes like the jock, the pot smoker, or the hot chick, Saulnier populated the film with characters that feel very believable and the dialogue these characters deliver more often than not feels typical to real-life college kids, thus adding to the insane realism. While the performances the actors are decent, the biggest stand out by far is Patrick Stewart, suiting the role of the main antagonist. Stewart gives a truly haunting performance as what is a major departure from his usual typecast. Though his character is limited to do nothing but giving orders, the portrayal Stewart lands as this character truly hits hard.<br/><br/>Green Room is an exhilarating slasher-horror thriller with a constant sense of fright and thrills, making it one of the most spine-chilling horror films to be released in recent years. Though the extreme violent and realistic depiction of gore can may make this one a difficult sit-through, it is a must-see for all horror fans."
"horrorinpureform","9","97","181","17 September 2015"," The Green Room may not be the best movie I've seen this year (although it also may be). It is the most entertaining and thrilling one by far though, that's for certain.
","A punk band made up of poor friends tours in a broken van, playing their songs at hole-in-the-wall places. They unknowingly are sent to play a gig at a neo-nazi commune. It goes ""OK"" until they accidentally enter a room where a girl has just been murdered, and are locked inside by the neo-Nazis. A mostly-enclosed game of cat- and-mouse ensues between the band members and the skinheads. <br/><br/>I liked so many things about this film, I will probably forget to mention half of them. The slow beginning which really lets you get a feel for the characters, the progression into an enclosed-location movie for a lot of its running time (I love one-location movies), the ""opening a can of worms"" moment that just makes everything descend into chaos, and the very funny one-liners which are fortunately very infrequent so they don't hinder the serious mood one bit (quality over quantity). It tried to circumvent some genre conventions and expectations, while still staying true to itself, with thrill scene after thrill scene. It was just flat out entertaining but also very well-made, with unconventional editing between scenes, very interesting sound design, and amazing acting by every cast member. They were all so likable!<br/><br/>I can't really complain about anything on display here, just see this film, it deserves it."

"Boristhemoggy","3","63","120","10 July 2016"," Sorry, B movie if ever there was one.
","I'm flabbergasted with some of the reviews on here, and especially when someone stated that Patrick Stewart had said he had to set his security before he went to bed as the film was that horrific. I think that's marketing because it's not the horrific at all. <br/><br/>It's utterly unrealistic in terms of plat, scenes, injuries, peoples' actions and overall story. The violence is just violence porn and not tense or horrifying. Think Saw on a lesser budget. <br/><br/>The acting is appalling but I think that's partly because the dialogue is so bad and the scenes so ridiculous that it's difficult to consider the acting alone. I am amazed Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart put their names to this: they've both gone down in my estimation. Patrick Stewart's performance isn't that good anyway. If you're a Star Trek fan don't watch this because it will ruin the captain's persona forever.<br/><br/>Imogen Poots gets worse with every movie she does. I think the problem is in the movies she chooses, they're usually bad choices. As far as B movies goes this isn't too bad although I have seen better B movies. If you're utterly bored and have nothing better to do with 90 minutes watch it if only to see how awful it is. If you like movies, don't waste your time at all, it really isn't worth 90 minutes."

","I never really heard of this movie until I saw it a Redbox. With the reviews I read online, I was led to believe that it would be a good movie, but honestly, I wasn't even close to hooked. The story is about a punk rock band simply trying to find a good paying gig but end up being trapped with murderous skinheads after seeing a dead body. Honestly, from the concept alone, it scores points in being more original than other horror movies, assuming we're all tired of stereotypical teenagers fleeing from a murderous psychopath, but that's about the most good I can find out of this movie.<br/><br/>The story was just too boring, and the voice acting is hard to love. Not saying it's mostly bad acting, Patrick Stewart done a decent job as the owner of a skinhead bar, but the others just sound so monotone to me that sometimes I wonder if they're just not high throughout the whole movie. What also hurts the movie is that there wasn't much of a reason to care about these characters, and there was hardly any character development. Heck, I couldn't remember which of the characters were in the movie in the beginning, so that tells you how badly written the characters are. All this is also bundled with a story that turns out to be a drag. Other than the ways some of the characters were killed, I can hardly remember anything of it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's just flat out forgettable and was not even worth the rental. I didn't see why this movie had so much praise, and I SURELY don't recommend it."

"johnwiltshireauthor","3","61","121","2 July 2016"," Disappointing
","Like a lot of people I suspect I was hooked by the trailer. This purported to be a lot of gory fun. Initially I was quite impressed with the set up - a no-hope punk band touring deadend bars for little or no money, still hoping to make it in the music scene. Hence accepting a slightly dubious gig at a remote bar for white supremacists. There are quite nice little bits which really kept my interest--like when they arrive at the bar to set up in rural hicksville with Neo-Nazis all roaming around with their skinheads and they're told not to leave their gear in the hallway because of the strict fire code the bar has. Heh. But from that point on the whole thing went badly wrong. One of them witnesses a ""horrific"" crime. ? He walks into the ""Green Room"" to find a girl stabbed on the floor. Given the place they are in, the free- flow of drugs, the hideous (imo) music blasted at intolerable levels in the dark, the smashed bottles, the knives, the violence all natural at such a gig, why would finding one stabbed girl be such a shock that the whole band goes into meltdown from that moment on? I didn't get it. Anyway, they do and so they have to be contained until the situation can be resolved. Again, I was totally lost by this time. Why did the Nazis not just kill them and hide the bodies? Feed them to the pigs? Dogs? Skinheads? Whatever. No, an elaborate plot had to be invented that didn't involve them being damaged by human means so they could be set up as having trespassed at another place and attacked by the dogs? Err... yeah. Overly complex and ridiculous. This could have been really good. It wasn't. I was rooting for the dog. He was sort of cute, if you can get over him tearing out a punk-rocker's throat. But it did pass a wet afternoon. I suspect more beer might have been needed to truly get this movie."

","""Green Room"" follows a vagabond punk band traveling through Oregon, where they book a show at what they come to find out is a neo-nazi skinhead punk club. The show goes well enough, but after they become witnesses to a murder, the group—along with a female regular at the club— are held hostage at the instruction of the community's head honcho.<br/><br/>I went into ""Green Room"" with little expectations, unsure of what exactly to expect; I'd heard good things about it, and the fact that it was filmed in the area I grew up in further piqued my interest. The film undoubtedly deserves the critical and public attention it's gotten, especially from horror fans, though I'm hesitant to necessarily label it a ""horror"" film. It's more a suspense-thriller akin to something like ""Panic Room,"" except with a starkly different setting and a group of twenty-something punksters in place of the family home invasion prototype. <br/><br/>What is perhaps most jarring about the film is that its entire premise springs out of a wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time scenario that spirals entirely out of control. The script and direction lend an increasing oppressiveness that comes on like a vice grip; the audience can easily sympathize with the arbitrariness of the entire premise, and the claustrophobic sense of inescapability is well-drawn out on screen. The film is nicely shot with emphasis on darkness and its titular color, and the photography of the landscapes effectively capture the ominousness of rainy Oregon backcountry.<br/><br/>Solid performances from all involved further elevate the film. For a film that's plot is so constricted, the material demands solid performers, and we get that from the young cast, with Patrick Stewart effectively playing counterpoint as the aloof villain-in-charge with an army of intimidating henchmen. The film's finale is extremely effective, and, barring a few convenient plot devices, is more or less believable.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Green Room"" was one of more tense experiences I've had at the movies in quite awhile. The way writer/director Jeremy Saulnier is able to spin such an arbitrary, unfortunate situation into an oppressive, character-driven splatter thriller is remarkable. It may not be enough to turn off punks from their waking-up-in-urine-and-beer lifestyle, but it's enough to make any prospective venues in the Pacific Northwest backwoods seem at the very least questionable. A recommended nailbiter. 9/10."

","So, i finally got the time to watch the movies so far in 2016. I read an article that said this movie is one of the best movie so far this year, and i agree.<br/><br/>'Green Room' is about a struggling punk band that got into a wrong place at wrong time when one of them, Pat, witness a murder after the show they got into at secluded part of the Pacific Northwest. They, then play a mouse-and-cat game with group of maniacal skinheads.<br/><br/>The story might move slowly, but it's still well developed. What really stands out to me is the cinematography and the score. the dark cinematography actually helps the audience to feel the dark and tense tone of the movie. and the score complete some moments at the movie. <br/><br/>Newcomer director Jeremy Saulnier did a pretty good job, and i actually looking forward to see his next works. The performances of the movie is also great, Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots did a wonderful job, and so is the rest, except Patrick Stewart. His performance here is really weak and actually defeated by the plot. The character might written to be the silent yet deadly villain, but he just do the silent part and leave the deadly, leaving his character, as i said before, really weak. <br/><br/>the ending is simple, and actually predictable, but left me satisfied. <br/><br/>I really recommend the movie, if you're looking for an enjoyable thriller. but, if you're looking for a horror, i actually don't recommend you since this movie is actually far from what horror is."
"JontheLobsterLover","4","94","202","22 April 2016"," Good premise poorly executed
","Green Room combines both a used idea and a fresh one, and even though I think the concept is very interesting, the movie itself was not. <br/><br/>The premise following a group of ""survivors"", who must survive a night as monsters of every kind continuously try to kill them, is the used idea. A lot of horror/thriller movies use that concept in one variation of another. It's a great idea, and it definitely works for most movies. The fresh idea is that the survivors are members of a punk band, who are fighting their way out of a run-down punk venue in the middle of nowhere, while be hunted by white supremacists led by Patrick Stewart. <br/><br/>The movie's problems begin with the characters themselves. In horror/thriller movies some sort sympathy for the victim(s) needs to be there, because if you don't care about them, why would you care if they die? The band members were so unlikable that I actually found myself hoping they would die. <br/><br/>Aside from a handful of people, the acting was pretty bad. Patrick Stewart did a good job as the leader of the skinheads, and Imojen Poots did a fair job as well, even though I was trying to figure out if her character was stoned or in shock. Some of the actors had their moments, but for the most part the talent in the movie was scarce. On a related note, Anton Yelchin has one of the worst cries/screams ever. <br/><br/>Parts of the story either didn't make sense, or didn't lead to anything. The sharpie camouflage scene was one scene in particular that just seemed to add nothing. All it managed to accomplish was make the characters look mentally challenged, and not in the way I think they were going for. <br/><br/>The characters also die way too quick in this movie for me.

Sure they're plucky, but you're given very few reasons to care about any of them when one of them dies, other than the fact that they're not methhead nazis?

","When I first heard of the movie Green Room the story instantly hooked me in. This might have been one my most hyped movie this year. I have been waiting forever and now I finally got to see it. Was it any good? I was extremely disappointed. The first 30 minute of the movie was actually pretty good, it all turned sideways when the character are trapped and have to find their way out. I have to say the characters make the dumbest decision ever, also every time they try to run a minute later they run back into the same room and hide and have stupid conversations. That is basically the last hour of the movie. The only reason I gave this movie a 5 is Patrick Stewart. He was great in this movie and I wished they included more of him and had a better role for him. I was disappointed in how little screen time he had. Also there were some good dialogue throughout this movie. Other than that I was bored out of my mind. Really. I give this movie a 5/10."

But neither group is particularly likable.<br/><br/>1. The sound recording and mix was so terrible I had to watch with subtitles. My hearing is fine.

","Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, this is the most abysmal, confusing, and vapid film I've ever seen. There isn't one single redeemable quality about it, nor is there any form of recommendation from me to see it. I want to write this review with the hopes that I can spare as many people as I can from viewing this awful dreck.<br/><br/>From the critics' point of view, this film fails on every single metric that's used to gauge what comprises ""good cinema"". Let's run through it, point by point.<br/><br/>The sound editing is muddled to the point where dialogue is vastly inaudible.<br/><br/>The cinematography is hazy and dark, and NOT in a good way that would give the supposition that we are seeing a ""disturbing"" film with a grittiness to it.<br/><br/>Every character is unlikeable to the extreme!! The acting is horrid! The movie is factually incorrect. There were so many negative and misleading stereotypes about punk culture that it made me fume on the inside. This movie conveys the fallacy that punks are all about being hateful and self-loathing, and bashing in peoples' skulls. I'd expect this from the Hollywood propaganda machine, but not from an indie project such as this that aims to tell us a tale with some kind of meaning behind its subject matter. That's part of the reason why I went to see this movie in the first place. But instead, all I see are a bunch of biased and anecdotal generalizations of a subculture that's meant to establish peace and anti-authoritarian mentalities. <br/><br/>And most importantly, there is absolutely ZERO plot. Don't let any other positive reviews here fool you on this point - they are lying through their teeth and quite frankly, I think it's a marketing ploy to get you to spend the money to see this film! The ""story"" is incomprehensible. From the first minute until the last, I was completely lost. It's cliché to say this, but I kept trekking along, hoping.......hoping......that there would be some kind of revelation at the end or a climax that would make me question and rethink everything I had just seen in the previous 90 minute runtime. But nope! As you get further into a film, that window of hope gets smaller and smaller. After all, if you don't care about the characters or the story within the first half an hour, you NEVER will. No matter how decent the ending might be.<br/><br/>I'm seeing all the good reviews praising this movie's concept of ""gore"". If that's what passes for ""entertainment"" nowadays, then I will never set foot in a movie theatre again. You can absolutely incorporate gore into a movie and make it highly watchable, a la ""Saw"". But Saw actually has a plot... and a point! It had horror, drama, thrills, and on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense.<br/><br/>Green Room had none of that - just one mundane scene after another, culminating into a collage of worthlessness and nothing to make heads or tails of once the end credits started rolling.<br/><br/>Save your money....

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","27","56","27 October 2015"," Thrives on a sense of dread rather than subversive tension like Blue Ruin.
","Besides the notable cast, Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is most likely closer to his 2007 horror comedy Murder Party than his sleeper 2014 thriller Blue Ruin. One of the most pleasant surprises of last year, it was very nice to see that Saulnier managed to gather up a follow-up in a relatively quick time – the gap from festival run to general release date notwithstanding. Green Room continues the vein of comically inept people in violent situations, but it's too crowded and lacks the subversiveness that made Blue Ruin so riveting. More characters means more bloodshed, but it uses that a crutch to get easy thrills rather than spending time getting us invested. Nevertheless, on concept alone it's destined for cult status, but lets hope Saulnier has a better idea up his sleeve next. <br/><br/>Set in a day or two on the frugal tour of a punk band – they appear to be entirely fueled on stealing gas from other cars – including Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner and Joe Coe, they're very young, semi-talented, with a modest following but very little prospects. They're just in it for the thrill of the moment onstage. From a tip of a journalist after a gig is cancelled, they play a show at a neo-nazi venue just to get by. They tease the crowd with anti- white-supremacist lyrics, but they're in no real danger until one of the band members accidentally stumbles upon a murder in the bar's green room. They're held hostage, helped by a friend of the deceased played by Imogen Poots, until it becomes clear that the supremacist's only option – lead by Patrick Stewart – is to leave no witnesses and frame the band for everything. Cue a relentless bloodbath and a grudging cleanup. <br/><br/>While the first gore scene is certainly stomach churning, the film regrettably relies on a palpable sense of dread over taunt tension. Its ultimate payoffs just have shock value rather than anything more gratifying, thereby drowning out its small comic elements. This is a very familiar brand of storytelling, and Saulnier definitely raises it from feeling pedestrian but it doesn't go much further than that. For one, I really wish he had shot it himself. While Blue Ruin has much more patience, Saulnier's own photography in his hands boasted more cinematic shots than the most expensive and lavish blockbusters. It was vivid and atmospheric. Instead of atmosphere, we get noise in Green Room. He trades the camera to Sean Porter, who did an otherwise great job with this year's Kumiko the Treasure Hunter, but it lacks the contrasts and focus to make it as effective despite the abundance of opportunities. <br/><br/>The film makes a wise choice to give every character a hint of humanity, including the supremacists, as this could have otherwise been a very unsympathetic batch of characters to follow. However, muddy motivations make it difficult to latch onto anybody when a few odd decisions are made. Their mutual efforts to outwit aren't too witty. The dialogue needed a lot of work, since it wasn't interested in getting deep under the character's skin, or mostly shredded to give the actors more breathing room. It's still an engaging film at least. Blue Ruin's lead Macon Blair is an understated highlight, while Patrick Stewart clearly channels Heisenberg without forcing it. Anton Yelchin and Alia Shawkat are the least likely punk rockers, but the latter makes it work by being the entrepreneurial boss while Yelchin's vulnerability makes him a natural underdog. Imogen Poots is usually irritating, but is only mildly irritating here. Unfortunately, Green Room runs thin the further it goes along, and severely lacks the potency that made Blue Ruin a treat. It's an average thriller, but an above average horror film.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ThomasDrufke","9","23","47","16 August 2016"," Jeremy Saulnier Does it Again
","Green Room is full of visceral thrills, gritty violence, and real characters forced into situations where they have to do despicable things. And to be quite honest, that's absolutely terrifying to watch for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Jeremy Saulnier is back directing after his brilliant, Blue Ruin, which unfortunately no one saw. His job on Green Room is just as impressive, if not more. While the former is a much more personal story about one man on a revenge mission, Green Room covers a band who is accidentally thrust into a life or death situation at a skinhead bar after they come across a horrible crime. Both are extremely disturbing takes on violence, I found Green Room to have a few more thrills and ideas being explored.<br/><br/>Joining Saulnier is the late-great Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole (from Peaky Blinders fame), Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner, and Patrick Stewart. Stewart is as terrifying as I've ever seen him as he plays the diabolical bar owner who takes matters into his own hands. It's difficult to watch Charles Xavier do the things he does to innocent band members, but with Saulnier's direction, it works.<br/><br/>But I think the band's innocence may be what I found to be most compelling about this story. They aren't a clean cut or crime free group of young-adults, they have their own shortcomings as well. Of course, they aren't as horrible as the skinheads who spend time at the neo-nazi level of bad, but they aren't completely innocent either. Saulnier paints them as inexperienced and terrified which gives the action scenes more weight.<br/><br/>It's not for everyone as the violence is more brutal than something you would find in a Scorsese film, but it's one of the most impressive thrillers of 2016 with creativity and grittiness that is up there with the best of them.<br/><br/>+Performances are grounded with realism<br/><br/>+Saulnier's relentless direction<br/><br/>+Shocking<br/><br/>9.0/10"

","This wasn't a home run IMO. Only heard about this because buzzfeed (I know right?) suggested I should after taking one of their many quizzes, thought hey what harm could it do?

Y were the skinheads so upset about Emily and Daniel (think those were their names) leaving? Is there some sort of gang mentality, the only way out is a body bag? Like if they were stealing the $ or drugs, could definitely understand the skins killing them. In real life the entire situation would've been over in 5 minutes with skinheads overtaking the band. Many of the negative reviews claim the violence was gratuitous yet no one mentioned the overuse of the N word; which was Completely unnecessary. Honestly the Nazi characters were only important to the plot when it came to Amber recognizing the shoe strings; other than that they could've just been regular bad people.

","I came into the movie knowing basically nothing about it. All I read about it was the summary here on IMDb, and I was not disappointed. The movie is rather violent, so I would suggest it not for the squeamish, because the violence is not only copious, but also realistic. It doesn't have the ever-common loud sound effects in movies that occurs when someone is hit with a knife or likewise. They instead provide a more realistic, quiet sound. Not only are the sounds incredibly realistic, but the actual visual gore can be pretty great in this one. Screenshots of it could be easily passed as legitimate gore to someone who didn't know this was a movie, with little rebuttal. Realism aside, it also is a rather creative concept that I haven't really seen before in a movie. It provided a pretty great story, and was executed perfectly. I would not have made this movie any other way. For what the movie was and what it wanted, I'd say it's a perfect 10/10 in my book, but that's just me. Also, the ending really makes the film. I'm not going to spoil it, but it was actually one of my favorite parts, and it cuts out at just the right time. Once again, I would not make any changes to this movie.

You will be stunned at the utter lack of substance. I don't know what the ""Green Room"" in the title meant. Where I saw it, the very thin audience shuffled out speechless. I guarantee no one had a good time watching this garbage. Patrick Stewart is billed as a lead. Paulie Shore could have played his role just as effectively. Stewart clearly took this role to make a quick buck. The movie starts with modest character build up. The plot then devolves into the main characters getting cornered and killed one by one. While it is a common plot line, many movies have pulled it off much more effectively and in an entertaining fashion. The gore in the movie is gratuitous and disgusting. A man is slit from neck to belly after one of the ""heroes"" deliberately breaks his arm. A guy has his hand almost cut off and huge cuts to his arm. He goes on to fight like he has no injuries. A dog chews a guy's throat. I think there was some kind of sport to how the people were supposed to be killed but I am not sure.

The bad guys would repeatedly send in 1 or 2 people at a time that meant there wasn't really a sense of real peril or terror.<br/><br/>Mark Kermode said this was worth checking out but his stock has certainly dipped now. It just really felt like the kind of film put together by some pretentious chin rubbers who think they know what tension and violence is but ultimately don't have a clue.<br/><br/>The kind of people that would look down their nose at other more mainstream films yet think their poorly constructed and uninvolving movie was the height of art and edge of the seat excitement.<br/><br/>Believe me you'll get more reward stumbling upon a gem on Netflix than making the same mistake I did and buying this.<br/><br/>Utterly woeful."

","Saulnier's Blue Ruin was a shotgun blast to the chest of intense thrills from an unknown director. I had no idea what to expect from Blue Ruin, but when it was over my wife simply turned to me and said, ""That was intense"". So I was excited to see his next film get some big name recognition on board. The late Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shaukat and Picard himself, Patrick Stewart showcase their talents in this nail bitter of a follow-up.<br/><br/>A down on their luck punk rock band take a gig at a neo-nazi club. Reluctant at first, but in desperate need for cash, they accept and play a decent gig. Just as they are about to leave, they see a dead body in the green room and bad decision are made after that. Now it's skinheads versus the punk rockers for survival. <br/><br/>Green Room is not for the faint of heart, I'm a horror lover and I found myself cringing every so often at the shock and awe that Saulnier throws at the screen. He's not afraid to get things going fast and when he does, he turns Green Room up to eleven. I found myself asking, how are they going to get out of this? Multiple times even. Each time an attempt was made to leave, something terrible happens and Saulnier is not one for cheap gore tricks. He is restrained and holds back until you least expect it. Then the terror unleashes on the screen and it's too late to look away. Blue Ruin was about suspense, this is about terror. <br/><br/>Locked up in one location, Green Room is a no holds barred 'us versus them' flick that surprises the viewer at a few turns. Most of the cast serve their purpose of being terrified for their lives and having to fight when needed. It's Stewart, known for his roles as courageous and commanding men (Picard, Professor X) that turns in a subtle and low-key performance. The man is the leader of skinheads and has the opportunity to unleash terror, but he holds back and almost has adds a fatherly figure to it. He mentors these young men so full of hate and he has to immediately take control of an out of control situation. Something about the calmness he has makes it even more terrifying. Men like this exist in the world."

I don't understand why people talk about it like a selling point. He wasn't developed at all and was a pretty boring antagonist truthfully.<br/><br/>All of the characters are completely flat and there is virtually no development. We have no reason to care for them. I realized that we really weren't going to get any development after about 15 minutes and thought that maybe there would be some cool deaths for them since that must have been the only reason why they were taking up screentime. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The gore in this movie is honestly average for a rated R movie. Nothing is groundbreaking here. It's certainly not like Saw. Countless movies have more gore and do it better than this movie. Again, I don't understand people talking about how this is a gory movie. It's not. Every time you think you're going to see a really gory sequence, the camera cuts away and you wind up seeing nothing that wouldn't be able to air on cable for an R rated movie. It's stupid and frustrating for the viewer. Another problem is that most of the gore will also be shrouded in darkness, so you can't see anything.<br/><br/>This movie has virtually no tension. It attempts to build it in some places, quickly to be destroyed. As a thriller, I expected psychological challenges and that style of horror, which would have made a supremely better film.

It is so well done that you cant stop watching even though your body tells you to stop.<br/><br/>Something I personally consider to define a good movie vs a great one is how well they can hold a tone. A movie can have a lot of flaws, but if they can find a tone and stick with it or mold it as needed, then they know how to write a good movie. A movie can be fantastic in every way, but if the tone of the movie ever sidetracks, you can tell that they arent the best writers.<br/><br/>This is tonally one of the best films ive ever seen. They kept the intensity there at the right pacing the entire time. It never lost its tone. It never fizzled out or sidetracked. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. <br/><br/>Theres no traditional corny horror aspects whatsoever. Its a thriller to the utmost degree. No sound-driven jumpscares. Although there are some jumpscares, they arent the stupid sound-driven jumpscares. These are actually scary and well done, and not just meant to surprise you with a loud noise.<br/><br/>About the gruesome parts: Do not watch this movie if you can't take gore. The gore is well done though. Its as tastefully done as gore can be. Not corny and in your face. Its very realistic and they often use cinematography and lighting to hide it some so its not constantly overwhelming you. I personally am not a fan of gore, but it worked in this movie.

","This is a fine example of crisis horror, and groundbreaking, much in the way Wolf Creek was groundbreaking when it came out. Like Wolf Creek, it introduces us to a diabolical baddie, this time played by an unrecognisable Patrick Steward. He's a million miles from Star Trek in this, and magnificent. His performance was intoxicating, and together with the wandering and constantly surprising story and script, hard to look away. In many, many horror stories we are used to a group of young people being picked off one by one. Green Room's originality is that although that's the case here as well, it is presented in such a way that you really won't be able to see around any corner. It's much more real than your average teen horror, in that no-one falls to pieces, although clearly terrified, and in that things actually happen as you'd expect them to in real life, chaotically and usually with everyone (baddies included) fumbling badly. No-one is really a hero, another brilliant aspect. Patrick is not the only baddie, here they come in all shapes and temperaments, and their scheming is diabolical. Everything is just so unexpected. All the performances are terrific, perfectly cast, and although nothing is groundbreaking in any of the film techniques themselves, they were obviously all professional and competent, as all you'll ever notice is the strange tale being told and being spellbound as to what the hell might happen next. It's full of classic new shivers this one, and Jeremy Saulnier deserves to be on people's watch list for creating a truly original against the odds piece of genius."

Green Room takes the place of safety, and rips it apart during the 94 minutes of pure terrifying ecstasy.

If you like wincing at movies and watching them through your fingers, this is definitely for you! A nobody punk band calling themselves The Ain't Rights (Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole and Callum Turner) is a long way from home and their ""tour"" has hardly given them enough money to live, let alone buy gas (they siphon). A fan sets them up with a gig at a secret skinhead bar, and it would hardly be punk to turn such a thing down. They quickly find themselves over their heads when they witness a horrific crime and try to call the cops. Cops aren't welcome, and soon the band finds themselves locked up in the club's green room, along with the murder victim's best friend (Imogen Poots) awaiting probably murder. They're smart, though, and attempt a defense, but they're hopelessly outnumbered. Patrick Stewart plays the skinhead ringleader. Other recognizable actors include Macon Blair (star of Blue Ruin) and Mark Webber. It's always great to see real talent behind genre films, and I deeply hope Saulnier keeps it up."

"freeofavia","3","10","21","16 June 2017"," A Well Made Film, Doomed From the Start with an Awful Script
","Horror is a genre I often steer away from. Yet I'm always intrigued when a horror movie comes out that receives critical acclaim. See, I love horror. It is the most visceral and natural form of film making. This is why it's such a tragedy that the genre has been neglected by talent, and is often a cheap thrill cooked up as a quick cash grab. Like pornography. In fact horror is often a lot like pornography in the way that characters act in ways, not that advance their own agenda or reveal something meaningful about their character, but to allow further scenes of senseless pain and anguish to befall characters that, often, we are meant to hate. <br/><br/>So naturally, when people I respect highly are attached to a project that sounds very different for a horror film, I can get pretty excited. <br/><br/>Green room is about a band (spoilers ahead) on tour in their van. The movie starts out with some slice of life bits, that set up the characters and world nicely. They are not necessarily care free, but they are free. And the scenes are at least competently shot, directed and scored. They are broke. So broke they can't afford gas. They meet a mohawk touting punk rocker about a gig they drove here to play. It's canceled. They are screwed. So they end up getting scheduled for a gig at some place in the middle of nowhere with some far left and far right people.<br/><br/>Well when they get there, it's a bunch of Nazi's. Scary freaking Nazis. Not a ""he was wearing a make America great again hat"" kind of Nazi. No, the actual kind of Nazi. So what do they do? They play their extremely original song ""Nazi Punch"" (I think that's what they said).<br/><br/>I hate these kids. And as we've already discussed, that's a very bad sign.<br/><br/>Anyways, they play their set and go back to the green room. A girl has been stabbed, they're all witnesses now. They're all told to wait. Patrick Stewart finally shows up, and he is a lot like Jean Luc Picard as a Nazi. The kids overpower and kidnap the guy watching them and take his gun, and they lock the door. Things are looking bleak, but Patrick Stewart will let the kids go if they just let him have the gun.<br/><br/>Dumb.<br/><br/>So they give up the gun (of course) and Anton Yelchin gets his hand mangled, and we get to listen to his very authentic and painful sounding cries throughout the entire scene. Now I knew this was not going to be an easy film to watch. And I was prepared for just this sort of thing. But to have it be from something so stupid, it undercut any emotional underpinning or deeper feeling I could have, other than visceral empathy. Horrible, wicked empathy. And I will congratulate everyone involved in this movie for helping highlight Anton's amazing work. But frankly, although it may have been difficult to watch, there was absolutely no payoff for doing so. Immediately, any tension the movie may have had was deflated. I understand that films sometimes require us to endure tragic things vicariously, but understand that tapping only the centers of pain in a film is like creating a dish that is all salt and no other flavor or substance. It's just gross, and unpalatable. Maybe it's unfair to this film, but losing Anton so recently has left a fresh wound, and I suppose hearing him cry like that may have rubbed where it was still raw. Full disclosure. But I will try not to let it affect my scoring of the film.<br/><br/>I did sit through the entire movie, just to confirm it was bad from beginning to end. It was. Now a lot of people worked on the movie, and I don't see any flaws with how the movie is made. Maybe the actors could have been directed more strongly. I don't know, honestly I think it all just comes down to bad writing. Why Patrick Stewart and Anton Yelchin signed on to this script is a mystery to me."

","So there's this punk band who get a gig at a club for white supremacists and Nazis. After one of them witnesses a murder the whole band is locked in a room and have to survive attacks from lunatics led by Patrick Stewart. There are several members of this group and sundry others who are locked in with them. One by one they are bludgeoned, hacked, disembowelled etc often more than once each.<br/><br/>Other ex-members of the band may be joining them from time to time. This bit is unclear but there does seem to be more bludgeoned bodies than band members so I think that has to be the explanation.<br/><br/>Rather than do something simple to cover up the initial murder, the Nazis decide to make everything worse by killing everyone and, just to be sporting, they set about this in the most inefficient way possible. Despite having the opportunity to kill everyone easily at the outset they instead opt for a series of increasingly byzantine attacks giving everyone in their gang the opportunity to do more bludgeoning etc before having their heads shot off.<br/><br/>In the end two people and a dog survive. They may have been members of the band but by this time I neither knew nor cared. I may have missed something in the middle when I dozed off but there was still bludgeoning, faulty decision making and people who may or may not have been in the band running around the screen when I came to.<br/><br/>You might like it if you are a fan of a good bludgeoning and hacking. If not you will come away confused as to why anyone could think the plot was believable or indeed whether the film made any sense whatsoever. (Hint: it didn't)."

","'GREEN ROOM': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A crime-thriller/horror flick, written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier (the man who brought us the outstanding 'BLUE RUIN', 2 years ago). The film is about a punk band, touring through the Pacific Northwest, that's terrorized by neo-Nazi skinheads (at a remote Oregon club). It stars Anton Yelchin (in one of his final film roles) and Patrick Stewart (Chekov and Picard, together in a movie!). The film also costars Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole, Callum Turner, Mark Webber and Macon Blair (who also starred in 'BLUE RUIN'). It's gotten rave reviews from critics (91% positive on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans alike (including director Quentin Tarantino). I loved it as well.<br/><br/>Pat (Yelchin), Sam (Shawkat), Reece (Cole) and Tiger (Turner) are members of the punk rock band 'The Ain't Rights'. As the movie opens, they're traveling to a show in Seaside, Oregon. When they get there, they find out that the gig has been canceled. The radio host, that set them up with the show (David W. Thompson), sets them up with another gig instead; at a secluded club outside of Portland. The band soon learns that the club is a neo-Nazi skinhead hangout. After Pat witnesses a crime there, the establishment's owner (Patrick) won't let them leave.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of 'BLUE RUIN', when it came out. I've been eagerly awaiting Saulnier's next movie, ever since (especially after seeing Tarantino's review for it, and every other critic's). I definitely wasn't disappointed in it! It's involving, from the opening scene to the very last shot, and it's beautifully filmed as well. It's also unbelievably intense (like one of the most intense movies I've ever seen). It's gory, and graphically brutal, but all in a very realistic (yet disturbing) way. It's touching seeing Yelchin again, and he's amazing in the film too. Stewart also makes a very memorable villain. The film is sure to become a cult classic, it's a must see!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg"

","empty room<br/><br/>Like the frozen yogurt and the noodle business, the industrial film thrives on playing out endless variations of the same plot. Green Room is no more than a video game movie in which a posh English actress with the gun and box cutter is allowed (scripted) to win.<br/><br/>Saulnier's Green Room works out with the format of teenage entrapment by forces of evil â€“ bogie men. The bogie men in the cupboard decked out as proto white supremacist, but basically just plain old bogie men in the cupboard. Saulnier's movie lacks any idiosyncratic or cultist distinction: Chainsaw massacre it is not. Green Room lacks the imaginative stylisation and deep black comedic rituals of the cult slaughter movie. <br/><br/>It also lacks even the social cultural themes of the movie such Carpenter's Escape from New York or Scott Cooper's Out of the Furnace. The latter film which although violently formulaic and lurching into parody, nevertheless in its title and in its expressive characterisation calls up the dark forces worming through the flesh of United States of America, psychically legitimising the corruption of violence in the name of an enraged 'id'. Cooper's film crudely but effectively anticipates the politics of Donald Trump, both as parody and as expression of the infantilised rage that defines contemporary politics. Woody Harrelson's performance as Harlan is the film's psychopathic core. In the film's opening sequence, set in a drive-in movie theatre, Harrelson maps out the film's territory, as he defines and demonstrates his visceral understanding of human relations. In comparison, Patrick Steward's playing of Green Room's villain, Darcy, is something of a pussy cat. Darcy is motivated more by the banality of money than any deeper gloomier psychic intolerance. Harrelson and Steward both do the 'hard eye' thing, but Harrelson does it to the greater effect.<br/><br/>Set against the idea of a situation in which a touring punk band gets slammed up in a venue for seeing something they didn't ought to have seen, Saulnier as director/writer simply spins together some punk dialogue, some bad-ass backwoodsmen, guns machetes, couple of adorable bull terriers called Brownie and Grimm, and like a pot-pourri cocktale shakes them all about. The result is a movie without an idea or even the notion of an idea, a feeble attempt to pitch the forces of good and evil against each other. It is a structure without a concept that ends up as a mechanised combinational tryst that is not a movie but a video game."

","The blueprint for this one is laid out early in the scene with the interview; not the form, but the energy of shared experience that pumps blood on the inside, or so it goes. So let me chuck away the form. Plotwise it's about a band who witnessed what they shouldn't have, holed up in a club. No matter, good things can be made from anything. The form is a bit more polished than most horror films but hardly anything worth noting.<br/><br/>It's the energy of shared experience that is a complete waste. Angst, inescapability, punctured by gorings here and there. This is my least favorite type on the horror rack; 'realistic' violence heaped on people to elicit winces. It's all this and that here. Go here, run from there, close that door before. Who cares? You have to be able to transcend with the camera. They're stuck with having these characters and moving them around."

There's just so much junk out there with a relatively high rating of 7 or more, and when you watch it, it's just a total letdown.<br/><br/>Take this movie for example. It's billed as a thriller/horror, yet at no moment is it ever scary or gory. The characters are bland and one-dimensional and you don't care if they live or die.<br/><br/>The plot is just a joke. In the middle of nowhere in Oregon, there's a bar, where all the yokels, racists and neo-Nazis congregate. What, I guess BLM or Al Qaeda were too busy to take part in the shoot? Or was it just more convenient to make white males the bad guys again, because you know they won't complain, unlike if they were to cast one of the previous two groups... even though white male supremacists commit what, 0.0001% of the violent crime the latter two do? So yeah, once you see who's cast as the ""bad guys,"" you know there was no real interest in making a semi-realistic thriller. This is just another hit piece from leftist Hollywood.<br/><br/>The movie itself is slow. A band is locked up on a room backstage. Ooooh. Scary! Are you scared yet? No? OK, wait, a handful of neo-Nazis then tries to kill them. OOOOH!! Now you're scared, right? Yeah, I knew it! Yawn.... There are, oh, 7 deaths on both sides, before the laughable ending. Total letdown.<br/><br/>The only redeeming value is in the cinematography, as the guys holding a camera and doing the lighting knew how to film in the dark, and they had the wherewithal to not use the shaky cam fad that so many other movies do. Too bad they're dragged down by a stupid story and a snoozefest masquerading as a thriller."

","What do I even say about this movie? It blew me away. It's the best horror movie I've seen this year, and my only regret is how long it took me to see it. This is the movie that ""Don't Breathe"" was trying to be; a survival horror that was unpredictable, intense, and just the right amount of shocking. I know survival horror isn't everyone's cup of tea, but for those of you who like the genre, put this on your list. The gore is done in just the right amount, never too much, but enough to keep you watching and invested. It is well-written, and acted perfectly, which is to be expected from Patrick Stewart and the late Great Anton Yelchin. The filmmakers know how to build atmosphere, so before the action even starts, you are already sucked into the world of the film, and you care about the characters you are watching. It doesn't go for shock value, but has a very real feel to it that makes it get under your skin in the best way. I'm sad to say I found it in a bargain bin of Blu-ray Discs, which is a crying shame as it deserves to be celebrated more than that, but which turned out to be a stroke of luck for me. I got it home, watched it with the BF, and found my heart racing almost the entire time, despite the fact that I was safe in my bed in front of our small TV. I am so glad I purchased it, and I will be telling everyone I can to do the same. It's one of the better horror offerings of recent years and I can't recommend it highly enough."

For example, Patrick Stewart kept saying things like ""we need to sprint now"" and things to that effect, implying that they need to kill them quickly, but at the same time, he would only send in like 1 or 2 guys to go do it, and didn't learn from the fact that they would come back without killing everyone each time. The script was awful, and things just didn't make sense, especially the blonde girl. She went from the character of a crying, scared girl to the character of a capable, slow walking killer in just a few minutes. They also kept returning to the ""desert island band"" line which was neither funny or symbolic of anything. The reason it's a 3 for me and not a 1 is because of the exposition."

Perfect.<br/><br/>If you don't, you're an idiot, but give this movie a shot anyway, because if nothing else, any plot line featuring skinheads getting killed is A-OK with me.<br/><br/>This website we're on is forcing me to write more lines but I swear you don't need them. Reading about a movie is like trying to listen to a painting or something. Just go watch it, it's much easier.

","If you've seen the Blue Ruin then you'll know to expect the unexpected, something different and surprising. The genius of this film was that it never does anything you see coming and is an utterly gripping thriller/gory horror which will shock the best of us. A young punk band who have to syphon gas to afford to play gigs wind up being offered $300 to play a gig in an old farmhouse where they'll be headlining the afternoon festival - but are warned not to mention politics as it's a boots and braces crowd.... things do not go smoothly and they have to pit their wits against the leader of the neo-nazi group, a cold, understated Patrick Stewart. I'm taking everyone I know to go see it when it gets a general UK release - utterly brilliant film."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>A group of aspiring grunge singers unwittingly accept a gig at an event where a Neo-Nazi element is likely to be present. They soldier through it, and make it out in one piece, until they stumble on a murder and find themselves held against their will while the perpetrators figure out what to do. A battle for survival ensues, while the group await the arrival of Darcy (Patrick Stewart), their chief in command.<br/><br/>It's still a very effective formula in horror films to have characters who start off in fairly controlled situations where something happens, and events spiral out of control, leaving them in a terrifying predicament that they never even dreamed of. And from this angle, Green Room had as much potential as any other, but Jeremy Saulnier's deathly drained piece is sadly an uninvolving, totally unsuspenseful thriller that you will struggle with to the end.<br/><br/>It's as if the cast can sense how bad the screenplay and dialogue are, and most of it is barely audible, with all of them mumbling everything at a really low murmur, where you almost can't hear a word. This is complimented by an overly drained camera lens that adds nothing to the atmosphere. Performances wise, the late Anton Yelchin fails to stand out any more than any of the other charisma free young cast, and you know things must be bad when even the accomplished Stewart turns in a terrible performance, doing an unconvincing American accent.<br/><br/>Not so much the Green Room, this one should have just been left on the Cutting Room floor. *"

","Out of an interesting premise the producers have realized one of the worst movies I have seen in years, and I am used to watch bad flicks in scores.<br/><br/>The plot is devoid of the slightest common sense as it is full of scenes leading to nothing. There is not a single action performed by the bad guys that makes any sense at all. They take the decision to kill the rockers, yet they don't do so when they have an easy chance. After that, instead of doing the obvious thing and mount a concerted assault, they start sending in one or two guys at a time, just to let the movie drag on a little longer. These guys behave in a totally unrealistic, illogical manner. They even forget to set a watch at the door of the green room where the rocker band is trapped and let them roam the complex at will!<br/><br/>In another unlikely turn we suddenly discover that one of the naziskins sent to grease the rockers is in fact a traitor who starts helping them out of the blue. He gets immediately killed by another assaulter, who instead of keep firing starts bragging some stupid s**t giving the rockers the time to kill him in turn.<br/><br/>I am used to foolish films, yet this one's stupidity succeeded in the arduous task of amazing me at every silly un-turn of its preposterous un-plot."

","... not for his acting, mind you, but for the ""this is a movement, not a party"" line he spits out almost against his own dollar-shaped will. I had pretty high expectations of this movie, 7.3 on IMDb (yeah, I still fall for that), and the whole premise of a potentially highly entertaining shenanigans between a punk band and a bunch white supremacists, hurrah. But oh mien Gott, what a sorry mess this film turned out to be. The acting for starters, deader than Jesus on the cross, except the bearded guy managed to resurrect himself off in the end... the Green Room actors? Not so much. It appeared they only ever delivered their lines when prompted into action by a way offside prompter (fluffer?), or maybe the filming coincided with the Union strike, so they had to act as if under duress...In which case, the Oscar goes to......... er, it's got to be the dog again. As for the dialogue, well let's say there was 2000 lines in the script (I don't know this, I'm just making up the numbers here okay), then imagine that each of those lines was written by 2000 different people from 2000 different places in the world, no connection whatsoever. Yet somehow they get the story to move in a semblance of a direction. Which, as every quantum physicist knows, is totally possible, maybe even inevitable, but still incapable of delivering a story, let alone a good one. Like, wtf, doh, yeah, double wtf, the end.

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","8","19","11 July 2016"," One hell of a great thriller
","Green Room has the same vicious, simplistic edge to it that director Jeremy Saulnier's 2011 thriller Blue Ruin had, but sharpened and honed to near perfection this time around. This is one grim thriller, a claustrophobic little odyssey of desperate violence that's thick with a sick, overwhelming atmosphere that isn't for the faint of anything. A big part of what makes it work so well is the fact that it makes sense, in terms of scene to scene actions and character motivations. These aren't cardboard horror protagonists darting through a predetermined rat maze of a narrative, these are real humans in a deadly situation who act accordingly, with both purpouse and realism. Atmosphere was a huge part of Blue Ruin, and now again Saulnier weaves a tense auditory cloak that puts the characters in the hot seat of danger and the audience in conniptions of suspense. It's a situation straight out of a seething nightmare: a down and out punk band led by Anton Yelchin are on a dead end tour, severely strapped for cash and getting desperate. When a vague buddy hooks them up with a rural gig, they jump at the chance, until they find out they're playing for a clubhouse full of angry neo nazi skinheads in a backwoods bar. Everything is going marginally well (as well as coexisting with Nazis for a set could go, I suppose) until a member of their group accidentally witnesses one of these freaks brutally slaughter a girl, suddenly branding them all as witnesses. With nowhere to go, the band barricades themselves into the green room and descends into a collective panic as the reality of their situation sets in. Outside, an armada of furious Aryan psychopaths prepares to siege the bar and kill them, led by the clubhouse owner, Darcy (a wicked, malevolent Patrick Stewart, loving every second of a rare villain role). The film clocks in at a scalpel sliced 90 minutes, with not a second wasted on anything that doesn't propel the story forward with the momentum of a machete ripping through bone. These dudes are out to get them at any cost, and the band in turn are whipped into an adrenaline overdrive of base survival instinct, using anything they can to dispatch their tormentors and escape. Yelchin does an excellent job of making their plight feel uncannily real, the terror emanating from every pore until there's none left, and empty, deadly resolve sets in. Imogen Poots is great as one of the clubhouse girls, a no nonsense spitfire with revenge on the brain and the will to make it happen. Stewart chomps at the bit with an eerie calm and articulate, insidious presence, a genius casting decision and a joy to see in menacing action. I'm curious to see how much farther Saulnier can push the envelope with his next film, which I've heard will be the last entry in this episodic trilogy. This one shows us what a real thriller is, one that pumps your pulse to a boiling point and makes you glad there are filmmakers out there with the balls and creative know-how to make something like this happen. Just bring a thick skin, there's a ton of graphic and very realistic looking violence. Unbelievably terrific stuff."

","I never write movie reviews on this site. Now, I feel obligated to do so after seeing the Meta and User scores of this particular one.<br/><br/>So, I've tried to decipher the reason behind the scores. Is it because Patrick Stewart stars? Am I missing something that makes this movie highly appealing to fans of metal? If i were to clutch at straws, was the marketing on point? Are the reviews from attendees of one or more of the many film festivals that also praised it in the form of awards? And this would at least explain the User scores; did raters watching the film post-death of Anton Yelchin allow their sympathy to override their logic?<br/><br/>I am absolutely baffled. This film is SO similar to SO many mediocre- to-poor (of which this is the latter) horror/thriller films of the past that I almost feel personally insulted to see it receive feedback movies ten times greater in quality didn't even come close to reaching in the mediasphere.<br/><br/>So shall we start on why this movie is such a common, run-of-the-mill substandard product that you'd rightly think of as just another cheap, formulaic horror movie the first time you laid eyes on it when browsing on-demand movie service collections? Let's.<br/><br/>From the get-go, no effort is made to build or present the characters as likable; not helped by the dull, bored acting of the typical group of DUMB kids the movie focuses on. The plot, featuring heavy mention of the neo- Nazi cult the group of dumbasses fall 'victim' to breaks absolutely no ground, rather your attention span or desire to even care. A cast that would have benefited more from anonymity yet is filled by high-profile names such as the aforementioned Stewart, Imogen Poots, and Anton Yelchin? (Many people act like he was a Hollywood dynamo since his passing, like they always do). Deaths of key characters that had far less innovation than the remake of Cabin Fever, which has Meta and User score ratings of 14 and 3.7 (even though it was more entertaining to watch). A villain (and actor, most likely; I can't imagine this role was made his for anything other than a favour to a friend. If not, then boy did he need to remain in X-Men) that excludes blandness. The neo-Nazi angle was interchangeable. Rewrite the setting as a club and the antagonists as drug dealers then not only would the back story and culture of the group be just as non- fleshed out and unexplored, it probably would have been better to watch. Nothing else is worth mentioning as the movie is just that common and mediocre. We've seen this done better numerous times before in films like Red State, a decent movie that actually incorporated the identity of the antagonists, yet that movie is sitting at a Meta and User score of 50 and 6.2. <br/><br/>Me caring too much is what I've been told, but as a passionate film fan, I'm meant to care. I hate seeing movies receive recognition they don't deserve. I'll use The Wolf of Wall Street as an example. Is it not obvious to every watcher of movies and their mother why that film received great acclaim despite being more on the crappy side? Everybody knows why that film and others like it are successful. But what one reason is there for Green Room to receive the scores it has? Truly, I have never been more perplexed.<br/><br/>This whole review could have been avoided had this movie slotted into the 40 max and 4.5 max Metacritic and User score category it deserved. Or, perhaps I'm just over-analyzing it. Maybe critics were paid off and a high-percentage of raters really did rate this movie after Anton Yelchin died. I have no f'ing idea. Anyone with a clue, please contact me. This is a genuine mind****."

","GREEN ROOM is intense and terrifying. It's like 'American History X' and 'Deliverance' gave birth to a messed up up baby. Patrick Stewart is absolutely scary. Whatever previous ideas of Patrick Stewart you may have either from his ""Star Trek"" or ""X-Men"" years immediately goes out the window once you see his performance in this film, I really didn't think he had it in him, what an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier, the story is pretty simple, it's about a struggling punk rock band in the Pacific Northwest, they do a small concert in a small white power bar, and what's supposed to be a quick gig turns into a nightmare when they stumble upon a murder. At the wrong place at the wrong time is where they are and so now they're forced to bust their way out of the bar that's been surrounded by the lethal skinheads who want to eliminate any trace of evidence and witnesses.<br/><br/>The minute the terror kicks in, GREEN ROOM's level of tension shoots up and remains there throughout the entire film, the violence keeps on humming, you just never know what sort of maniacal actions or retaliations that may occur, this is one of those films that consistently shocks you, leaving you to wonder who among the characters would survive because your guess is as good as the next person's. I think what Jeremy Saulnier has crafted here is a survival story within confined spaces, despite what you may or may not think about neo-Nazis, your stance on that becomes irrelevant when it all boils down to just a matter of escaping.

"tomgillespie2002","8","8","20","20 July 2016"," Stunning exercise in survival horror
","At the time of writing this review, it's been just over a month since the shocking and tragic news of gifted Russian-born actor Anton Yelchin's death in a freak car accident. He left behind a trail of films in his wake, and a few more to come (including his role as Chekov in Justin Lin's Star Trek Beyond), and it's quite astounding just how prolific an actor he was during his short career. One of his final films, released not long before his death, is also one of his best. Writer/director Jeremy Saulnier's follow-up to his critically- acclaimed Blue Ruin (2013) is a stunning exercise in survival horror.<br/><br/>It begins with the Ain't Rights, a punk band on their way to a gig that turns out to be a waste of time. After an uncomfortable social media interview, the band - consisting of Pat (Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Peaky Blinders' Joe Cole) and Tiger (Callum Turner) - are thrown a gig at a dingy bar in small-town Oregon. It's the type of place adorned with Confederate flags and fascist graffiti on the walls, and, in true punk style, the band introduce themselves with a rendition of Dead Kennedy's Nazi Punks F**k Off. After the gig, the group find themselves locked in a room holding an unlicensed gun after accidentally witnessing a brutal murder. The situation worsens when club owner and neo-Nazi party leader Darcy (Patrick Stewart) turns up to deal with the situation.<br/><br/>The events that follow are pure horror stripped down to the bone, sometimes literally. There's nothing supernatural or indeed unbelievable about the situation, just a group of inept youngsters facing off against a small army of bruising, well-organised skinheads armed with weapons designed to inflict grisly damage and a pack of trained pit-bulls. The violence is ugly and wince-inducing, with the awkwardness of the ones often inflicting the pain only heightening the sense of desperation and utter dread of the situation. The tension is only broken by the ramblings of a somewhat confusing sub-plot, which unravels itself through half-heard mumblings, and this only distracts from the immediacy of the central plot thread.<br/><br/>Saulnier asks quite a lot of his cast, as even the heroes of the story aren't the most likable bunch. They steal petrol, drink beer, cause trouble - pretty much what you would expect from a real-life young band trying to make a buck. But Yelchin has always been especially skilled at eliciting sympathy from any character he has played. As he and his companion Amber (Imogen Poots) - a close friend of the murdered girl - fight desperately for their lives, you are willing them all the way, rather than becoming frustrated at their ineptitude. Stewart also makes an impression as the quietly menacing skin-head leader, a role played completely against type, and it's a shame he isn't given more to do. The actor said he knew he wanted to take on the role when he was left terrified at home after finishing the script, and no doubt you'll be making sure the doors are locked once the credits role too."
"valleyjohn","8","8","20","2 July 2016"," Tinged with sadness.
","Although there is absolutely nothing supernatural about Green Room there is no doubt I'm my mind that this film should come under the horror category. This is a film about a punk rock band who , while down on their luck , get offered a gig in a neo Nazi club deep in the backwoods of Oregon and after witnessing an act of violence backstage things go downhill very quickly. To say Green Room is gory is an understatement. It's full on , and in a good way. This isn't just violent for violence sake it has a structure and some really good acting. Patrick Stewart is unlike anything you have seen him do before and Joe Cole ( Peaky Blinders) is good too but the best performance is tinged with sadness. The lead actor is Anton Yelchin who died last week in real life when he was crushed by his own car. I really enjoyed Green Room and if you don't mind a whole heap of blood then I can highly recommend it."

After that, it became excruciating, terrible, etc etc ... plain old monotonous. It is also almost as s...l...o...w as Blue Ruin, though Blue Ruin is a far better movie. A bit of the dialogue between Yelchin & Potts was the main redeeming feature here. One last thing, wasn't it hilarious that Yelchin, who discussed being lousy at paintball, became a true marksman when he got a pistol in his hand? Doh!!! He has a mangled arm. He hasn't slept in 20 - 24 hours. He admits to not being good with a gun. But, DANG, he never misses with that pistol ... clean head-shots at 20 yards. None of the people who carry guns all the time were half as accurate as Yelchin was. Hilarious writing."

When they witness a murder in the Green Room, then the classic Horror/Thriller movie romp ramps up.<br/><br/>The film opened TIFF's 2015 Midnight Madness category to great reactions. The film definitely had a few hearts pumping. People who are fans of 'Blue Ruin' will be quick to compare, but it's important to understand -- and Saulnier clearly indicated this post-show -- that it goes back to Horror film roots that 'Ruin' steered course of, and that's 100% okay. Think of the typical stuck-in-a-room slasher flick. 'Green Room' is plenty more gory, so be prepared. The film garnered a good cast, including Patrick Stewart and Imogen Poots, and of course, Macon Blair.<br/><br/>Well-executed action and horror. Did a good job at leaving people shaking and then eventually applauding.

","This film's rating is just grossly inaccurate, so I'm compelled to write a review.<br/><br/>The first 30 or so minutes are decent enough. There's minor character development (or perhaps it's just introduction); though, all the MC's are vapid jerks who couldn't be cared less about. The setup is somewhat original for a ""horror"" flick, even if it sounds like the premise of a bad bar joke (so, the Neo-Nazis and the punk band walk into a bar...). The most thrilling scene for the entire movie might have been Pat(?) getting his arm sawed into. I can't recall the names of the other characters, and the audio was garbáj. Either the music and feedback were blaring or there were the mumblings of an inaudible dialogue. Tragic.<br/><br/>After Pat's arm got mutilated, the whole production went down in flames. None of the characters were relatable or someone to root for, so each person getting brutalized felt like nothing. I couldn't empathize, and it made for an unbearable viewing. There just wasn't enough emotion (or any at all). No passion from the MC's, a washed out filter for the camera so that everything looked as lifeless as the characters acted, and no reason to care about the people being killed.<br/><br/>I think my favorite part of the film was the mosh pit, to be quite honest. It had me nostalgic for a moment, because I used to love moshing at the local concert venue.<br/><br/>Overall, Green Room sucked and was a waste of time."
"lndultsch","9","4","8","4 May 2017"," Gripping stuff
","Green Room starts out with a quick but pretty accurate portrayal of a small-time punk band on the road, bouncing from bad gigs to worse gigs. One gig has them playing in front of a gathering of backwoods skinheads (opening with a cover of Nazi Punks F**k off, no less.) And while their gig, in spite of its provocative opening, goes well, soon enough events happen that will make the night turn into a nightmare...<br/><br/>And it's probably better not to say more. Green Room is a horror movie without all the hinges and tropes of horror movies. It builds tension at an uneven pace, throwing fits of crude, frontal violence at your face when you expect it less. And that's the horror this movie builds up to. An escalation of violence that leaves nobody intact. The use of space and unassuming direction seal the deal of a tough movie that stays with you. Needless to say, not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart, of course, is the casting's main attraction. And as usual, he does a stellar job, portraying an ordinary, scary monster. A guy that could be your friendly neighbour, if it wasn't for...<br/><br/>So Green Room is a gritty, realistic horror movie, well directed and acted. Its off-kilter pace, while it could be seen as a flaw, serves the purpose of telling a story that doesn't attempt to embelish its violence or make it fun. If you're in for the ride, it might leave you a little punch-drunk."
"Leofwine_draca","9","4","8","3 April 2017"," Saulnier's follow-up to Blue Ruin is every bit as thrilling
","GREEN ROOM is director Jeremy Saulnier's follow-up to the excellent BLUE RUIN, a low key thriller that came out nowhere to become one of my favourite American films of recent times. The good news is that this follow-up, despite being more action-packed and visceral, is every bit as good as BLUE RUIN and even more violent, if that's even possible.<br/><br/>The story is quite standard here and more predictable than in BLUE RUIN, but the emphasis is on visceral thrills instead and on that basis it doesn't disappoint. The characters are somewhat unlikeable although Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots do grow on you as the story progresses, mainly through their refusal to give in to their oppressors. Said bad guys are a pack of Neo-Nazis led by a quietly frightening Patrick Stewart. The first 20 minutes aren't very interesting, but after a plot twist it remains exciting right up until the climax, just like a classic such as Walter Hill's SOUTHERN COMFORT.<br/><br/>The single location setting is brought to the fore here by Saulnier's expert and claustrophobic direction. The violence is intense, extremely graphic, and completely disturbing with it. It's not a big blow 'em up adventure story, it's just as dark, gritty, and realistic as BLUE RUIN was, in which things never go according to plan and innocent people always get hurt. It's a mini-masterpiece of a film, and one of the most suspenseful I've seen in ages."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","8","11 January 2017"," A different kind of (actually) scary movie, one that doesn't fit in any neat box
","Forget mainstream horror movies with possessions, demons and serial killers – ""Green Room"" is what an actually scary movie feels like. Being trapped like fish in a barrel by callous, murderous neo-Nazis? That's legitimately terrifying. <br/><br/>Jeremy Saulnier's third feature film doesn't fall under the standard Hollywood definition of horror, (or thriller, or crime drama), but it's gory and will make your insides sweat with anxiety. Worst of all – the premise is frighteningly plausible. <br/><br/>""Green Room"" follows a punk rock band that's spent every penny between them on their current road trip to the point that they're siphoning gasoline just to get to the next gig. When a show falls through, however, Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole), and Tiger (Callum Turner) reluctantly accept a hookup to play at a remote skinhead bar, which will provide them with enough cash to get home. Just as they're about to leave, however, they witness a murder and things start to head south.<br/><br/>The seemingly mundane decision that leads to their captivity will undoubtedly be one of those movie moments that causes you to shout at the screen to stop it from happening every single time you watch this movie – if you're brazen enough to subject yourself to it multiple times. That's another reason ""Green Room"" is so scary: the razor- thin line between life as usual and horrible trauma.<br/><br/>A cinematographer first, Saulnier is one of those filmmakers who can take a low-budget story that would otherwise be mundane and elevate it with excellent craftsmanship. The darkness levels, the shot framing, the approach to violence and gore – ""Green Room"" could have been a campy horror endeavor, but Saulnier never allows the film to lose its grip on reality. Even when he pushes boundaries a little, the idea that all this could actually happen never dissipates.<br/><br/>The toll this takes on the characters and the way we imagine ourselves in their hapless situation has a lot to do with that grounding. A key negotiation scene between Pat and the club owner, Darcy (Patrick Stewart, whose gravitas only makes the film scarier) in which tensions run high but blood has not yet been shed, works, not for the particular scenario or dialogue, but the way our brains reel in trying to process the best positive outcome despite knowing full well things will get worse for the band. The way Saulnier's script keeps the intentions of the skinheads vague, but does not veil them completely, muddies the line between good and evil long enough to draw out the suspense for maximum effectiveness.<br/><br/>Narratively, there isn't much for Saulnier to work with given the premise. Instead, the real arc is how the main characters go from your average reckless punk rock ""kids"" to needing to do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means employing extreme violence/skills they have no experience with.

","This film is dripping with atmosphere, the cinematography is superb and the characters are realistic and grounded considering the fact the film centers on a punk band and neo Nazis it would be very easy for the writing to fulfill the stereotype that would no doubt be attached to such easily identifiable sub groups.<br/><br/>This movie is fresh as daises, the characters are all believable and their reactions and the actions are all well fitting into the real world. The cat a mouse between Patrick steward and the performs is so tense and exciting I was chomping at the bit.<br/><br/>Patrick Steward is the head of the neo Nazi club who is brutal and efficient and clearly enjoys his role, but he does not steal the lime light from the young leads as there acting chops shine just as bright.<br/><br/>If you want to see a well paced alternative Horror film this is defiantly the one for you."

","After Blue Ruin, we get the Green Room. So something with Red should be coming up next. And while the two movies do not have much in common (apart from the same director and the main actor of the first one being in this one too), they are both mean and gritty. They both will test you in a way, while watching it.<br/><br/>There is so much happening and there are some really good twists that you may not have seen coming. But this Rock and Roll kind of attitude will either entice you or annoy you I guess. And while the violence is there, it's not like this has spectacular action choreography. And still just the mood it creates, the suspense it holds out throughout and everything from set design to sound design is just creating a movie that is able to get to you - if you let it."
"trashgang","8","4","8","17 July 2016"," brutal and in your face effects
","Being at the wrong place at the wrong time that is in fact what this is all about. Would be a mediocre film wasn't it for the fact that this is brutal as hell and comes in your face sometimes. <br/><br/>When a broken punk band is going to headline a gig at a skinhead location things go wrong when one member has to go back to the green room to pick up her cell phone. Entering the room he witnesses a murder. End of story for the punk band. From then on this rather alternative flick turns into a brutal flick. And I can say that it isn't for the easy offended. Even as it has a few names in it that make you think, he really for example Patrick Stewart playing the leader of the skinhead location. But there are more to see like Alia Shawkat and Iogen Poots but sadly also Anton Yelchin who died of blunt traumatic asphyxia aged 27.<br/><br/>What does make this flick brutal is that there isn't any warning with the use of score that something will happen. And when things happen they are really well done. Be prepared for breaking an arm, cuttings, machete's, gun shots and I can go on. Most brutal for many is the dog walking around.<br/><br/>Still, when the flick is over you are left with a bitter feeling like, what the hell I just saw. For me one of the better flicks from this year. No exaggerated effects but a simple story with real looking effects. And you are in the movie from the first minute until the end. <br/><br/>Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"CinemaClown","Null","4","8","12 July 2016"," A Delicious Slice Of Violent, Unapologetic & Breakneck Cinema
","From the writer-director of Murder Party & Blue Ruin, Green Room is a neatly envisioned, extremely effective & unabashedly violent horror thriller that's absolutely remorseless with its content, brims with charged tension & makes excellent use of its foreboding ambiance to finish as a bone-chilling, machete-sharp cinema that offers no respite from the slaughter that ensues once things go south, and will effortlessly manage to keep its viewers on the edge of their seats throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>Set in a remote club in the backwoods, the story of Green Room follows members of a punk rock band who have a gig in the area filled with neo-nazi skinheads. After infuriating the audience with their opening song but managing to win them afterwards, the band members inadvertently stumble on an incident they weren't meant to witness and are ultimately forced to rely on their instincts in order to survive & alter their sealed fate once they figure out that the club owner wants to sweep everything under the rugs.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Jeremy Saulnier in what is only his third feature film, Green Room marks yet another win for the indie filmmaker and is one more quality addition to his short but impressive film career. Just like his previous work, Saulnier relies on the incredibly tense, thoroughly unyielding & steadily elevated atmosphere to deliver the chills and his confident direction plus expert handling of the available resources clearly indicate what a bold, daring & assured talent he is. The script could've used a bit more refinement but it nonetheless gets the job done.<br/><br/>The remote location where all the action unfolds quietly brings the element of claustrophobia into the picture while the inhospitable look of the club adds a layer of bleakness to it. Cinematography exhibits clever use of camera, green tint & low lighting to further enhance its grim aura while tight editing ensures that it remains a nail-biting ride for the entirety of 95 minutes by trimming out the fat & leaving behind nothing but a lean story. The background score has a muted presence in the final print, but it's the effective use of silence that uplifts its tense mood to an unbearable level.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Green Room packs a committed cast in Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawcat, Joe Cole, Callum Turner & Patrick Stewart, with all of them chipping in with sincere inputs. The punk band members aren't a very likable troupe yet their predicament feels both real & relatable. Yelchin & Poots only get better in their given roles as the plot progresses, Stewart is in top form from the get-go, Macon Blair also has a supporting role, at which he does a very convincing job, and last but not the least, there is a pit bull in the movie that pretty much steals every scene it is in.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Green Room is a skilfully directed, finely scripted, deftly photographed, tightly edited, methodically paced, ably performed & calmly scored cinema that doesn't even try to do anything different with its genre(s) yet what turns it into a relentlessly thrilling experience is the way all its elements come together to work in near-perfect harmony. A delicious slice of violent, unapologetic filmmaking that's armed with knives, guns, machetes, box cutters & some good old- fashioned dog mauling, Green Room is definitely amongst the best films to surface on the silver screen this year. Highly recommended."
"TheRedDeath30","9","6","14","16 July 2016"," Intense Thriller that Holds Up to the Hype
","In today's age of social media, movies so often tend to be judged anymore by how they compare to their hype. It's getting harder for us, as an audience, to go into a movie with blind expectation and judge the movie on the merits of its' own artistic or entertainment value. I'm not pointing a finger because I'm just as guilty as the next person. We hear a movie sucks, we go into it expecting it to suck. On the other hand, movies like this come along that get praised all over the internet and it is very hard not to build it onto a pedestal. Naturally, few movies can actually hold up to the hype that surrounds them, so very often the haters come out of the woodwork and do their best to knock the movie back down.<br/><br/>I truly felt that this movie was worth all of the positive things I have heard about it and, indeed, it exceeded my expectations. I will get one comment out of the way, right from the get go. I have heard many sites proclaiming this as one of the best HORROR movies of the year. As a result, I find a lot of people that would consider themselves to be horror fans checking it out. If you are going to base your opinion of this movie solely on whether it met your definition and expectation of horror than many will be disappointed. We can debate all day long on the definition of horror. I find my own definition to be different than a lot of critics, but I wouldn't put this movie into that category. It's a thriller, violent and intense, but a thriller all the same. So, let's just get that out of the way. If you're one of those people that expected ""scary"" and gore filled, then this isn't for you. Don't hate it just because it didn't deliver what you wanted.<br/><br/>The movie starts off a little slow and I've heard a lot of complaints that it lacks character development...blah blah blah. So many reviewers throw around terms they hear from the so called ""professionals"" and don't even understand them in the first place. Do the characters have an arc where something is learned? Probably not, but I feel that the movie does a good job of introducing us to each character's personality, which is important as the action unfolds. This is most important for our main character, played by the late Anton Yelchin, who is non-violent and unpretentious and probably the person in this band the least apt to be able to deal with the circumstances surrounding them.<br/><br/>The band enters a scene they are clearly intimidated by, in the first place, and doing their best to make the best of, when one minor action puts them directly onto a path of destruction and violence. From there, the viewer can debate whether the character's actions led to further violence, or if it was ever avoidable in the first place. The viewer is, then, gripped by a tension that is palpable. The director does a fantastic job of increasing the tension slowly and ratcheting the mood until it's almost so painful we need the release of violence. <br/><br/>Violence there is, in spades. The movie makes good use of blood and some effects shots, without ever going over the top with it. There is just the right amount to make some viewers squirm without descending into cartoonish lunacy. The villains are mostly generic, except for Patrick Stewart. Many have praised the role and I won't go that far. I don't think we ever see enough of him to really say it's a ""great role"", but he's cold and calculating and willing to do what is necessary to protect his own interests with no mercy.<br/><br/>Our heroes are a punk band and a skinhead girl caught up in the wrong place and time. Yelchin is the band's quiet one, the one least willing to reveal himself in the interview with a zine writer. His meekness makes him a natural choice to be the guy the audience will empathize with and fear for through the film. Even in the face of unspeakable violence, he never truly gives in to it. Where many a movie would have resorted to our character going crazy in a fit of rage and enacting justice on the villains, our hero never truly loses himself, though he will do what is needed to survive. I felt that is one of the strong suits of the movie is we never see that ridiculous plot where an ordinary joe suddenly becomes a superhuman psycho with all the right moves and plans. We never really lose sight of who these kids were in the beginning.<br/><br/>This won't be for everyone. Certainly those without the stomach for violence will be turned off. As mentioned before, those looking for a horrific thrill ride are going to be disappointed. If you go into it with an open mind, though, the movie is a tense and exciting thriller that never leaves its' grounding in reality and never resorts to Hollywood clichés. <br/><br/>Oh...one more thing just because it's a pet peeve. There are a few complaints about ""dark scenes"" where you ""can't see anything""......Get a better television with more definition of color. I found the movie to look great on blu-ray."
"Fella_shibby","8","6","14","10 July 2016"," Nice lil survival thriller. A dash of out of furnace, deliverance, straw dogs, frontieres, judgement night.
","The slow beginning which really lets you get a feel for the characters, the progression into a claustrophobic unfamiliar backwoods. The film is nicely shot with emphasis on darkness and its color, and the photography of the landscapes effectively capture the ominousness of rainy Oregon backcountry. Nice cinematography by Sean Porter (Kumiko, The trust). Superb direction by Jeremy Saulnier. Saw Saulnier's debut movie ""Murder Party"" shortly after its release in 2007. Found it to b decent. Loved his second film ""Blue Ruin"". Was highly anticipating his third film, Green room. The direction and cinematography are both fantastic. While watching this flick, the movies which came to my mind are Out of the furnace, Deliverance, Judgement night, Frontieres, Straw dogs. Performances are commendable from Yelchin (Fright night), Poots (Need for speed) and frequent Saulnier collaborator Macon Blair (Blue Ruin). However, an almost unrecognisable Patrick Stewart (X-men) steals the show as the ladder of the Nazis. There is also Mark Webber (13 Sins, Jessabelle) in a small n unrecognizable role. The sad side note is this was Anton Yelchin's final on-screen role."
"jtindahouse","9","6","14","3 July 2016"," So much to like here
","As a rule I try to know as little about a film before watching it as possible. The genre and synopsis are typically all I like to know (with rare exceptions where I'm so pumped for a film I can't help reading every detail months in advance). So going into 'Green Room' I knew very little about what to expect. What I had imagined in my mind, and what it actually was like, were two very different things. The film caught me off guard. Not just how good it was, but the impressive style director Jeremy Saulnier managed to achieve.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen either of Saulnier's previous two films (although I see they are both rated very well and intend to check them out) so I was clueless to just what a talent he is. The film does a tremendous job of creating a low-budget, creepy feeling, horror vibe, using almost unknown actors and a simple (but very effective) plot. There is no better way to do horror than this. There's nothing scary about watching big stars with CGI in every scene and a cliché plot line. Watching unknowns in realistic, yet exaggerated, situations on the other hand can be very unsettling.<br/><br/>There's a lot of gore ('Saw' would be proud) and violence a plenty. The story never stalls and there's some really great dialogue in the mix. The thing that proved to me though that Saulnier has a massive future in the film making business is the final scene with the dog. It's rare to see something so moving and beautiful in any modern film, but to find it in a horror movie is just stunning to me. A wonderful movie that is so much more than just your average horror movie."

","For once, the trailer didn't ruinanything.<br/><br/>A while ago, despite my strong objections, a friend made me watch a Red- band trailer for Green Room. After which, I was p|ssed having felt like I've seen it all, like most trailers do ruin most, if not all surprises and tell me more about the movie that I wanted to know. Thank God, this was the exception to the rule.<br/><br/>(Now, that was months ago since I saw the trailer and I just re-watched it to see if my memory served me well. And, true, it still doesn't give away a tenth of the movie, it's still best just to watch the movie cold.)<br/><br/>This movie was not only incredible, but surpassed my expectations tenfold. I am not going to spend one second here giving a synopsis or what made it great or what surprised me. As mentioned, best to go in cold and you must see this movie.<br/><br/>That said, but still no spoilers, I will reveal it's basically both a thriller and horror and possibly one of the most original of either genre in years. It's small and contained and with or without a large budget, it works perfectly this way.<br/><br/>I hate to not go into what I felt made the movie wonderful or even a small summary. But, suffice to say, if you love thrillers, horrors, get emotional on hot topics and can take the heat, WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW. It's easily one of the best of 2016 and I doubt it will fall out of my top 10 if not my top 5 by year's end.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Probably more horrific that the horror I mentioned in this movie is the incredibly sad news that the lead, Anton Yelchin, just recently passed away abruptly at age 27JUST 10 days ago from this viewing and my review. R.I.P. Anton. Watching you here, giving a great performance and knowing what just happenedcan tear me up. Did tear me up."
"MK_Ultra_","9","6","14","28 June 2016"," Saulnier triumphs, yet again.
","Those not familiar with Jeremy Saulnier's small body of work, he hit his stride with 2013's Blue Ruin (after a very cult film Murder Party), showing his hand when it came to noir coupled with a knack for making a tense and effective revenge film come to life with dark filters and mood altering story telling.<br/><br/>This time around, the gloves come off a bit more with a slightly claustrophobic and effective edge of your seat hybrid of a bloody stand-off and a fight for survival film.<br/><br/>This film takes me back to, not necessarily ""barebones"" film-making, but maybe Saulnier's minimalist touches that he gives off in his latest film purvey into a perfect bit of cinema for the viewer that has grown weary of ""block busters"", overblown sets, massive production and reliance on CGI.<br/><br/>Young punk outfit (The Ain't Rights) gets a tip to play a gig at a backwoods gig. Simple enough preface, but holds your interest.<br/><br/>Character development is minimal yet effective enough to make you give a sh** about the group as they are held after inadvertently witnessing a stabbing.<br/><br/>Elements of dread are not limited to the backwoods, darkly lit club..and certainly don't stop at the Far Right militant skinhead/heroin vibe that culminates with the club owner (Patrick Stewart, in a somewhat surprising, yet effective role) as the leader of the ""group"" holding the Ain't Rights backstage after the unfortunate event takes place.<br/><br/>Macon Blair (Blue Ruin) is back and effective as a actually likable character once he realizes things have gone too far. Anton Yelchin and Stewart are the big names here and hold their own. Some solid acting, extremely tense moments within the constraints of such a small setting are pulled off with ease. The film never feels ""small"". The violence is graphic and paced/edited for maximum effect. It's there, and Saulnier is going to show it to you.<br/><br/>Kudos for the underground scene being used in a film like this, as well as the mentions and shout outs to some of the best of the multi-genres of music mentioned.<br/><br/>Keep making movies on your grounds Jeremy. Solid 9 rating."
"carterlfelix","10","6","14","20 May 2016"," ""Insanely brutal, exhaustingly nasty: Absolutely Excellent!""
","I first watched ""Blue Ruin""(Jeremy Saulnier's second feature ) when it was released and I was blown away. After being immersed in such a movie, I first for wind of""Green Room"" when it was being written and I waited a very long time until it was to be finally released. Now I knew this would be something else so I only allowed myself to see one 50 second trailer and nothing else . It was crucial that I go into this film with little expectations and I must say I was so happy! Green Room is just as nasty and grisly as you think it is. It follows a young punk rock group wind up fighting for there life in a building surrounded by vivacious Neo-Nazis. The leader of which is played by the chilling Patrick Stewart. He is genuinely chilling as he demonstrates complete control over the brutal attacks led against our protagonists. Malcolm Blaire returns from Blue Ruin to play Stewart's right hand man, once again brilliantly brought to life in the most unusual of ways. Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots, among others , lead as our protagonists as they spend all there time during the movie fighting for their life and all do an Excellent job. But the two things that really caught my attention was the Atmosphere and the violence. The films moves in twists and turns so as you can never quite guess what is going to happen next, leading for a very intense and interesting watch. But the most polarising factor to this is the violence. I have seen a lot of brutal films and I would consider myself fairly hardened moviegoer but the very first act of violence is so shocking and so ruthless that I squirmed and gasped in my seat. And the film gets progressively more brutal as it goes on. The realism and unpredictability of such violence gives it the film a very disturbing edge, undercut with extremely dark humour, pulsing through the films black sarcastic heart. After seeing this year's excellent ""The Witch "" I am very happy with how A24 studios are distributing their movies and I look forward to seeing many more in the future. Green Room is intelligent, very intense, insanely violent(seriously sensitive viewers be warned), darkly humouress and very well acted, written and directed. I can't wait to watch it again!"
"arnieiam","9","6","14","1 May 2016"," Who knew that punks vs. Nazis would make for one of the most viscerally intense thrillers ever
","Let's get into a little background here first before discussing the movie itself.<br/><br/>Like the director of this film, I am a huge fan of the hardcore punk (or more simply hardcore) genre. I am a fan of bands like Black Flag, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Agnostic Front, Sick of It All, Cro- Mags, Gorilla Biscuits, Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Kennedys and the more recent metallic incarnations like Madball, Hatebreed, Earth Crisis and Vision of Disorder. In short, it is characterized by frenetic instrumentals and shouted (and later screamed) vocals. It is not a well known genre as I have a very difficult time finding anyone who knows about it let alone be into it. It's a shame because it has come to define modern day rock and metal music as the genre has influenced very well known bands like Metallica and Nirvana.<br/><br/>I have been to hardcore shows. Because of the lack of basic popular support, hardcore bands are pretty poor and perform gigs in small, dark, dingy bars where they are right next to the audience moshing. Hardcore as a genre has attracted a wide array of audiences of differing ideologies: the straight edgers, the skaters, the vegans, Hare Krishnas and even, unfortunately, Neo-Nazis.<br/><br/>And that is the film's premise. A hardcore band that gets booked into a gig for neo-Nazis and they witness a murder which leads to them being held captive in the green room. <br/><br/>As a thriller, the premise is quite original. And its not really a battle of ideologies between the parties. Yes you have punks and skinheads but both sides are just trying to get through an ordeal as we see with Chekove and Picard. But also as a thriller, its pretty clichéd. The so called protagonists don't make the best decisions when dealing with their captors. But that is OK, since the film wasn't trying to be subversive in that manner. Where it was really effective in was its violence and gore. <br/><br/>There was one particular scene that really affected me profoundly. One character gets his arm savagely mutilated and his fingers broken where the makeup was uncanny. It showed all the deep lacerations and the bone sticking out and the camera did not cut away from it, making the audience collectively gasp. Now I've seen enough violent films, but the acting that accompanied that scene of the character reacting to his situation really unnerved me. Usually in hyper- violent films, the violence has an almost comic tone. Here it didn't. And I swear, this is very true, I passed out momentarily. <br/><br/>This is a thriller that is not meant to put you on edge. It is mean to really put you off balance and make you insanely uncomfortable. This movie is not for anyone with a weak stomach, as I figured out the hard way. We as film audiences have become so fascinated with violence but have never seen a film that lets us soak in the realism. Believe me, If I am to watch this film again, I need to down a glass of whiskey or something before doing so. Yea I'm just gonna watch some cartoons to offset this experience.<br/><br/>Well there you have it. This review went from hardcore punk to ultra-violence. I still hope whoever's reading this has a listen to the bands I mentioned at the beginning. Really hardcore is actually very positive music albeit loud and unclean."
"barrelhousegutboy","8","2","3","30 May 2020"," Mystery of one and done bands finally solved?
","No label punk band living out of a van while on the road for shoestring tour wind up in a very bad situation. After the last gig is a bust and short gas money to get back home they get a line on a walk-in that will net them the cash to return home. The off the beaten path country bar for old school skins turns out to be run by an organized 4th Reich gang. The set finished they are on the way out the door when a forgotten phone leads to the night that kills the band.
I initially passed on seeing this based on blurbs that made the movie sound like yet another Hollyweird screed on how inbred racist white hillbillies are killing the world's love with their hate. You have to be pretty thick if that is what you take from this film.
This is a lean and solid thriller about coming afoul of criminal enterprise by happenstance. Characters are fleshed out just enough to set the table, the meal comes in the form of hyper realism of wound FX, believable violence, and an interplay between antagonist and protagonist that is refreshingly smart and gritty. Aside from sticking your arm out the door and splitting up the typical dumbassery that tend to sneak into movies of this type is refreshingly absent. No preaching, no virtue signalling. An organized concealed criminal enterprise with experience staying off the radar vs some fairly streetwise and tactical not going to be your victim targets.
And while the movie is absolutely worth seeing based on merit alone the inclusion of Patrick Stewart as leader of the gang is just the cherry on top not to be missed. If you are a fan of the genre don't let this gem slip by you."

"elicopperman","9","2","3","20 June 2019"," Unapologetic for All the Right Reasons
","Because the horror movie genre has a wide array of themes to tackle, be it supernatural or psychological, it only makes sense that some filmmakers choose to tell down to earth stories with it based on the horrors of our world. In the case of Green Room, it delves into a more realistic tone to reveal just how horrid some parts of the American society can truly be. After it premiered at Cannes in 2015, it got a wider release in 2016 to rave reviews. Even though it didn't perform well financially, it's definitely a flick worth being deemed as a classic in the future just for how little it holds back just to give its own two cents on certain individuals.<br/><br/>The film centers on a punk rock band who get attacked by neo-Nazi skinheads after witnessing a murder performed at a remote club in the Pacific Northwest. The film cleverly lets the uneasiness transition in smoothly, as the band are already aware they're performing for this infamous group. It isn't until the aforementioned murder happens when the stakes really get intense, as the band are all held hostage at the hands of these psychopaths. As for the plot itself, it mainly focuses on both the band members trying to figure a way out of the place and the skin heads figuring out ways to kill them quicker. While the pacing can drag on at points, it still works in service to the unpredictable tension that plagues the fear all around the member's escape tactics. The only legitimate critique on the story's front is that the ending feels somewhat anti climatic, although I imagine it's how most would seek vengeance on others.<br/><br/>As long as you have good characters, they should be worth rooting for in such dire situations, and the film features a successful cast. In terms of the band members, Pat, Sam, Reece and Tiger all have their own disagreements with one another but still do their best as a team to solve any given dilemma that hits them. By thinking ahead around the obstacles in their path, these people are examples as to why logic is necessary for escaping sociopathic slime. Arguably the most sympathetic character in the film is one of the murder witnesses Amber, given that she only became part of the nazi cult as a way of escaping a hellish life, only to go out of her way to get rid of such a past. While most of the skin heads are downright evil, the most sophisticated of them all is the leader Darcy. In addition to Patrick Stewart selling charisma on top of masochism, this guy is a brilliant mastermind to the point of always being on guard to stop any witnesses who may get in his sadistic ways. With a mix of moral and immoral views, all the characters remain memorable for different reasons.<br/><br/>Now while the film was made on a low budget, it made good use of its limitations with fast paced editing, frightening lighting and the overall atmosphere. Given that there isn't a lot of music outside of some rock ballads and a quiet score, the scenes appropriately grate on the nerves with a subtle flow from the relatively calm moments to the inevitable massacring. It's necessary to let the scares come at a natural ease before suckering the viewers with them. Given the film's title, the actual green room area creates a very claustrophobic environment where you can never expect what will come at you, especially with the shadowy spaces where you can't make out anything. The usage of cutting the shots every five to ten seconds helps to heighten up the paranoia of being held hostage by fascist supremacists, as if it's all a reflection of the viewers being in such a psychotic situation. Without cheesy jump scares or obnoxious music, a setting can do all the work to freak people out.<br/><br/>If there could ever be a horror film that can best be described as eye opening, this one would be that. By delivering unapologetic thrills with a surprising amount of intelligence, Green Room is the type of thriller that really opens up people to the real horror of the world: reality. While hate-filled groups have existed in America for centuries (let alone the whole world), we tend to forget just how badly they can affect the lives of others who are unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. Be it fiction or non-fiction, we need media to remind us of how ruthlessly savage certain groups like neo-nazis truly are, because if left unchecked, the more damaged democracy's reputation would become. Unless you can't stand to witness the brutal truth of the world, this film is a must watch for any horror fan or cinephile who wants to experience something out of the ordinary for the genre's typical standards. It may not hold back, but it will still make you think long and hard about our society."

","The story of Green Room directed by Jeremy Saulnier is about a group of punk kids in a band called The Ain't Rights"" endlessly determined but down on their luck, thrown into a situation that is completely out of their element. The cast and band includes Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole, Alia Shawkat, and Callum Turner. They all encapsulate their character very well and all have their own quirks and rebel attitude The movie is always unexpecting and Saulnier takes it to a level of believability with its utter brutalism, character interactions and the routine of a largely neo-Nazi club when a girl is murdered at the club. The characters intensity and impulsiveness during several key moments makes it feel all the more real. The clunky dialogue and clearly strung out disposition of the actors do a great job trying to cope with their current situation shouting out a bit of their personality with every line. But ultimately their band is outnumbered and betrayed to. The performances across the board are great and you get an understanding of what their like even at the very beginning. You can see who stands out and who stays more in the shadows.
Green Room's directing which is my favorite of Saulnier's filmography has slow moving camera-work that usually mirrors the character's movements directly behind them or over-top. There's sweeping shots to show the progression of characters riding to a parking lot to siphon out gas. The camera seems to push through the grass when they lay down the bike down and run up to the car. The bird's eye view of the car driving through a highway along the ocean feels so alive and visceral. Then again towards the end when the characters finally escape from that place it feels like we're getting a breath of fresh air and that vast green landscape that seemed so far away comes flooding back. The way he's able to create such a bleak view of an isolated punk club amongst this vast luscious landscape is a feat. Even similar to Jordan Peel's direction with Us he's able to bring tension to a place like the beach or for Saulnier the forest. He brings this world to such a point of realism that when Alia Shawkat's character Sam leaves her charging phone in the backroom and discovers a dead body the tone and undertones of music bring it crashing down. We are right alongside her and her desperate plants of escaping. She obviously tries to call the cops right away but is stopped by one of the skinheads and trapped with people who they have no idea of what they're capable of. The aspirations of the band and everything we once knew are thrown to the wayside and their forced to deal with the situation right in front of them. Joe Cole's character Reece especially steps up the plate and tries to do what he can to hold a large man down. The other band-mates are losing it. They're stripped of the facade they've been portraying to keep with their punk roots and what they stand for. The overlapping chatter, and the frantic nature of it all is captured extremely well. The directing feels so effortless and continually flowing to the point where I forget there's someone behind the camera. It doesn't needlessly draw attention to certain aspects/characters because the interactions unfold on their own.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart as the lead of this cult has a commanding presence. He's well mannered and vulnerable. His true colors and the frustration he feels comes through.. Stewart's lingo along with the other members of his organization is sometimes alarming but always feels common to the other character. Even when what he's saying is blatantly racist and further delves into a world rarely shown on film. Stewart never has a true moment of completely breaking down when he keeps losing men. Like so many other Hollywood flicks. It separates him from the crowd and becomes unbelievable intimidating even when his more human side is shown. Like when he asks the group trapped in the room to elect one voice to speak and to speak softly because his voice is getting hoarse. It's almost awkwardly funny in a way but that inescapable tension remains.<br/><br/>Anton Yelchin as the eventual lead in one of his last rolls is a trembling, terrified kid. His shaky somewhat raspy voice really personifies the fear that must be rushing through his veins. You feel for these passionate punks who clearly have a message and love what they do. Their facades start to break and that once impenetrable wall crumbles. I've never seen a movie that tackles such an immense topic of adolescents trapped in a room with a dead body with a realistic human element as well. Imogen Poots as well has plenty to offer. Her slick delivery, slouched disposition and slower movement adds to her overall character and ultimately makes her a force to be reckoned with. She knows more about the current situation overtime than anyone involved and it's smartly revealed to us. Plus the recurring theme of ""desert island bands"" that the band jokes about at first and can't come to a conclusion about it, makes for a very satisfying closing scene that I won't spoil. In conclusion. I'm always discovering more about a world that feels so scarily tangible with it's themes, violence and dialogue. I hope that Jeremy Saulnier continues to make films that push the envelope, warrant repeated viewings and delve into worlds/characters that are rarely shown. It's a film that I highly recommend."

","This film is a perfect mixture of Reservoir Dogs and John Wick combined with a slice of Saw, if you like either of these movies, you should take a shot on this one. The main reason that I wanted to see this movie is the cover itself, and the plot summary. It's one of the best covers all time and music genres like, death metal or punk are rarely represented in movies. But in this case, we have a band full of relatable characters and a really cruel society of nazi punks, skinheads. Then I found out, this is one of the last performances of poor Anton Yelchin.

","The current 32 reviews for this movie over-inflate the score falsely, many giving an overly generous 9/10.

This is not Star Wars, nor is it The Shawshank Redemption, and so for anyone to award it with a score higher than 6 suggests fake-voting.<br/><br/>I did not have high expectations prior to watching this movie but from the opening sequences, the impression immediately was that ""it's going to be good"".

","Dreadful. This so-called thriller about a punk band who witness a murder and then have to fight for their survival is irredeemingly awful. It has a plot that makes absolutely no sense and bewilderingly bad performances from an otherwise decent cast. What's worse is that it generates no suspense but a fair amount of gore and a lot of noise and if that isn't bad enough it wastes whatever talent the late Anton Yelchin might have had, (he's totally miscast as a young punk), while Patrick Stewart should be thoroughly ashamed of himself for agreeing to appear in such trash. What's surprising is that writer/directorJeremy Saulnier had already shown his ablities with the excellent ""Blue Ruin"" so this marks a considerable come-down. We can only hope his new film ""Hold the Dark"" is an improvement or Saulnier's career is over before it's really begun."

","We all know that sometimes one thing begets another thing. Hopefully most of the time the outcome is positive. Green Room explores what if a chance decision lead to a horrendous result and in the aftermath of trying to do the right thing lead to the unthinkable. Something worse than you could even imagine just minutes before.<br/><br/>With the premise I've outlined, naturally, there would be many ways to present the problem. Green Room uses youth and a free lifestyle as a great story device. A starving punk band who do not even have enough gas to travel without nicking petrol. In many ways this has the feel of something very real likely experienced more than a few punk bands - most of whom haven't been heard from as they tried and failed. That's not to say they met up with the same fate as the band in Green Room however. This is a bit beyond the everyday and it shows the writers were both grounded in a ugly reality and, thus, inspired.<br/><br/>It's a really tight movie after the initial part where the viewer meets the band and becomes aware of how hopeless it is for a fledgling band to make it. It uses unbridled youth and the eternal hope of some kind of serendipitous good fortune pulls off a small miracle, that being the band may pull itself out of poverty and obscurity. Alas, in the case of our story here everything goes about as bad as it possibly can. The fact the viewer hasn't seen another story quite like this helps tremendously. Once Green Room has you in it's tense grip it just keeps up the pressure.<br/><br/>It comes down to a chance encounter and a kind of knee-jerk reaction. From that decision the unbelievable begins to crush the viewer masterfully. It's the time from this to the final scene that Green Room shines. I'm not going to say any one actor, or actress, gave a fantastic performance other than to say the casting served the story. However, it's the story and how it was played out that really kept this viewer rapt and totally in an edge of the seat mode. That's effective storytelling, and, in this case, creative filmmaking. Very good, thus recommended. The sad side note is this may be Anton Yelchin's final on-screen role. If so he did an excellent job that telegraphs this young man would have been destined for a much higher profile in the industry."

The guy that booked them felt bad and made some calls. His cousin who hangs out at this Neo-Nazi club said they could play for 350 . They jump at the job. When they show up they are told that they have sound check in 15 minutes and go on in 20. until then they are escorted to the Green Room. (The Green room in entertainment is nothing more than a waiting room which does not have to be green in color what so ever.) When they get back to the room after the gig they stumble upon some nefarious things going. Now they can't leave and must be taken care of . This is where the movie takes off. I must say that the way this movie was written and put together was very smart. We are introduced to the characters and they are all well developed before anything really starts to happen. So we have no one really to root for the band is made up some screw up and the people at the club are screw ups.

"horitaj","9","5","12","10 May 2016"," ""Green Room"" (2016). Directed by Jeremy Saulnier.
","'Green Room' is one of my most anticipated films of the year due to the return of director Jeremy Saulnier, Patrick Stewart as a leader of a Neo Nazi group, and a punk band fighting Neo Nazis. Saulnier is the director of the wonderfully crafted 'Blue Ruin' (2014) which is amazing to say the least. <br/><br/>The film starts off with a punk band doing what they can to get noticed, and above all to get money. They take this last minute gig which so happens to be at a Neo Nazi Fascist bar. After rocking the house to ""the Dead Kennedys"" ""Nazi Punks F*** Off"", and some of their original music which we barely get to hear, one of the band members forgets their phone and runs back into the green room where he sees something he shouldn't see and one thing leads to another. <br/><br/>I'm not the first one to say this but 'Green Room' is an off the edge of your seat thriller. After the end of the first act to the rolling of the credits I had my mouth wide open, biting my nails, and even covering my eyes. Saulnier just grabs you and takes you through this tense, grizzly, horror-fest of a movie. This movie is very, very, graphically violent. For those who saw 'Blue Ruin', you know what I'm talking about. You will see things you don't want to see, and it's hard to watch if you're eating popcorn while watching.<br/><br/>Saulnier is very realistic with the violence and the characters, especially the characters. Many people have complained that the band members specifically are very dumb, stupid and make awful decisions throughout the film. After watching this film I flat out disagree. You're taking young people who've never been exposed to violence, who've never had to kill anybody, or even be in a situation like this in that matter. The decisions they made were realistic, and above all believable. I'd even make the decisions these characters made if I was in the situation they were in. <br/><br/>Patrick Stewart blew it out of the park with a completely new turn as this character, and gave a chillingly, subtle performance. Anton Yelchin is great as well he probably gave his best work in this film. Just to save time I'm just going to say that all the performances in the film are strong, powerful, and full of energy, there was no dull performance in the movie. I was very happy to see Macon Blair in a film, especially with Saulnier. I wish he had a bigger part in the film but gave a great performance overall. <br/><br/>One thing I personally love is the music. Throughout most of the film you have punk and heavy metal music playing (SLAYER), you see 'Minor Threat' and 'Dead Kennedys' T-shirts. This film is head to toe punk and metal. Another thing about the film is that it has a slight tad of humor in certain parts of the film which made me laugh. The humor was inserted just at the right time and place, and placed perfectly and didn't feel forced upon which other films tend to do. <br/><br/>I went with my wonderful mother on Friday night where most people were going to see the third Captain America film. There were about ten people in my theater which I didn't mind because it was quiet, but it stinks to see such a beautiful little gem like 'Green Room' get crushed by a much more bigger film that will exceed its budget within the opening weekend.<br/><br/>Overall ""Green Room"" is a gory tense filled adrenaline rush of a film that never lets go of its grip and takes you through this punk and Nazi tale of violence. One of my favorites of the year."

","After stumbling upon the brutal murder of a young woman, the members of a struggling punk rock band (the late Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole and Callum Turner) find themselves fighting for survival against a gang of highly organised, Neo-Nazi skinheads led by cold-blooded, white supremacist heroin dealer Darcy (Patrick Stewart).<br/><br/>A no-frills example of siege thriller/survival horror, Green Room offers very little in the way of surprises, but delivers more than enough tense thrills and bloody brutality to ensure an entertaining time. With the punks locked in the titular 'green room' of a grubby venue deep in the woods, and the skinheads doing their best to break in, the scene is set for some good old-fashioned ultra-violence, handled with aplomb by director Jeremy Saulnier.<br/><br/>As is standard for the genre, the desperate punks are whittled down via gun, machete, and the jaws of some vicious hounds, before finally turning the tables on the skinheads by devising a risky plan. Formulaic, yes, but very satisfying."

","Green Room was without a doubt my favorite horror/thriller since The Babadook. While I enjoyed Get Out, I knew that I could only digest the film as a spectator rather than someone who has let their imagination take hold to what dangers lurk in a predominately white society; the lack of transparency and authenticity that one senses can lead to troublesome thoughts, and Get Out pretty much hit the nail on the head as a darkly comical satire with the format of a Hitchcockian thriller. <br/><br/>Green Room not only brings it's action to live with a heightened sense of realism; developed characters with human-like nuances that make each person on screen feel real, no supervillains, everything being a situationally fight-or-flight scenario etc. it also takes the spirit of the punk scene and caters it throughout the film without missing a beat. While the film is brutally violent and shocking, it never delves into the world of nihilism that slasher films become codependent on (see Eden Lake).<br/><br/>This movie is beautifully shot with no pretenses. There are no ""hidden messages"" and doesn't treat you like some poor sob trying to dissect a poem. It's an in-your- face thriller that takes place in real time and you have barely any room to catch your breath if at all. <br/><br/>Along with The Babadook, The Descent, 28 Days Later, REC and Let the Right One In, Green Room will be held high amongst the movies of the early 21st century that will impress viewers (genre-enthusiasts and regular filmgoers) for decades to come."

","""Green Room"" is a decent enough thriller starring Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole, Alia Shawkat, and Callum Turner as the members of a punk band named The Ain't Rights (or the Aren't Rights, if you prefer). One night, they're the musical act at an isolated night club catering to Neo Nazi skinheads. Before they can leave, they are witness to a murder, and the people running the club have confined them to a room so that they can deal with the problem in their own way. The Ain't Rights will then be forced to deal with the evil club owner, Darcy (the great Patrick Stewart), and his unrelenting minions.<br/><br/>This viewer wasn't as blown away with this movie as some people, feeling that while the situation was reasonably riveting and the pacing very good, the story and the characters are mostly pretty thin. It was hard to care about what would happen to our protagonists or how things would get resolved. In addition, the villains seemed to be pretty sloppy individuals.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat redeemed by acceptable action sequences, and some highly enjoyable violence & gore. Pat, played by Yelchin, gets his arm f'd up badly at one point. There are also some very nice torn throats thanks to the attack dogs employed by the thugs.<br/><br/>The cast does manage to be engaging. The real-life fate of Yelchin was truly sad; he does alright here, and likely had a solid career ahead of him. Imogen Poots is fine as Amber, a bystander who finds herself imperiled along with the band members, but this viewer was particularly taken with Ms. Shawkat. Classing up the joint considerably is the always terrific Stewart, who's an effectively soft spoken criminal mastermind.<br/><br/>Entertaining stuff, although it doesn't really live up to the reputation it has, not for me, anyway.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","Another awesome movie by Jeremy Saulnier. This thing has true grit that you can feel in your teeth, and a true sense of panic you can wipe from your brow. Its beautifully shot and edited.<br/><br/>As a fan of gore, and violence, I am happy to see someone who understands physics, and realism when it comes to wounds, and reactions. When someone gets shot in the head, the physics aren't exaggerated. Its funny. I had a friend who I argued with over bullet physics once. He believed that if you were walking forward, and someone shot you in the stomach with a 9mm pistol, you would be blown backwards. I couldn't get it through his head that you would just continue the way you were moving, and fall forward. The problem was that he had been brainwashed by false movie physics his entire life. Jeremy Saulnier seems to get it.<br/><br/>I love the little twists and upsets that Jeremy Saulnier puts into his movies. It just makes the script that much more interesting, and stalls the story from flowing too fast."

It is a special movie, for the right kind of viewer. It is like ""The Wire"", you don't care which side wins, no team's motivations make them better than the other's.<br/><br/>You just need to be prepared to watch this movie, knowing that all your expectations will be subverted, and then minimally redeemed at the last moment."

","Maybe the grass is not greener on the other side because the indie thriller ""Green Room"" is one of the best movies I will see in 2016. Writer-Director Jeremy Saulnier has delivered with this tense flick about a modern hardcore punk rock band who end up entrapped in a dangerous situation in a neo Nazi skinhead bar. The movie stars the late Anton Yelchin as Pat, the bassist of the band who is trying to string his way out , along with his bandmates, out of the unexpected entrapment ordeal. Imogen Poots co-stars as Amber, a follower of the neo Nazi who ends up being also entrapped with the punk rockers. And I must mention Patrick Stewart, whose deliciously mild-mannered but wicked role as the neo Nazi leader Darcy is magnetically superb and Xcellent I mean excellent; and should garner consideration for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Speaking of Oscar, Saulnier's enigmatic direction and stellar script of ""Green Room"" is worthy of that ""Gold Room"" list of nominations. Yelchin was outstanding as Pat, and as excellent as it was it was also heartbreaking to see due to his unexpected passing. Poots was a hoot as the witty Amber. I also liked many other supporting performances from the film. The ""Green Room"" acting ensemble needs to get the green light for acting ensemble nominations come awards season. So go green and sneak inside the ""Green Room"". ***** Excellent"

","I had high expectations going into this movie considering people called it one of the best horror films of 2015. It also starred Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart, two actors I like watching.<br/><br/>However, about halfway through this film, I started getting pissed off. There was little to no action going on except for some characters talking, or mumbling, and that was about it. When there was action, it didn't last long.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the deaths were incredibly lame. I don't know who sat at the Board of the MPAA when this film got rated, but the MPAA rating explanation isn't too accurate. This film got R for ""strong brutal graphic violence, gory images, language and some drug content.""<br/><br/>Was the violence strong? Not really, no. Was it brutal? Heck no. Was it graphic? A little bit. Was it gory? Kind of. You want strong and brutal violence? Go watch the 2017 superhero movie, Logan. The action in THAT movie was strong and brutal, not this excuse for a horror movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ending was very very unsatisfying. The villain takes a single bullet to the head, which is beyond anticlimactic considering what he and his crew did to the main characters.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you are more into suspense rather than action."

Patrick Stewart is just plain creepy as Darcy, while Macon Blair also does a great job as Gabe the henchman. I have watched this film about 6 times with different friends and family as I find it endlessly watchable, as it is gorgeously shot, with a great soundtrack, gut busting violence and a real bad ass vibe, while like his previous works doesn't glorify revenge or conflict and shows that it really is humanity's dumbest solution to our problems. Violence is messy, unpredictable and despairing, much like our characters unfortunate situation.

"Vikingbyheart","8","3","7","20 July 2016"," A punk rock band living the most hardcore night of their lives!
","A movie with crime, suspense, horror and punk rock: can it still get better? Yes, it can! We are graced with the performances by Patrick Stewart (known for his interpretation of the captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation - 1987-1994 and Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men franchise) and Anton Yelchin (only mentioning some of his latest work: The Driftless Area - 2015, We Don't Belong Here - 2016, Star Trek Beyond - 2016 and Porto - 2016). The film Green Room gains even greater importance as one of the last works in which we see the actor Anton Yelchin, who died on June 19, 2016, at 27 years old, pressed by his own car against a concrete mailbox in the house where he lived.<br/><br/>Directed and written by Jeremy Saulnier (Blue Ruin - 2013), Green Room tells the story of four young musicians, Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Akia Shawkat), Tiger (Callum Turner) and Reece (Joe Cole), members of a punk rock band called A'int Rights. With the tour's failure and the blunder made ​​by the producer with the payment of the show, they will perform for the last time for a neo-Nazi audience at a roadside club around Portland. After the show, by chance, they witness a crime in the dressing room. As the only witnesses, they are prevented by the contractors from leaving the place, being locked in a room. Living the most hardcore night of their lives, can they rely on the promise of the club owner, Darcy (Patrick Stewart), that everything will be fine?<br/><br/>Two key elements that the director uses to make the movie are tension and nervousness, employing the claustrophobic atmosphere of imprisonment to create some disquieting moments. The dark tone of the picture is fundamental in this process, relying on poorly lit and dirty environments, apart from the use of graphic violence to shock the viewer. The soundtrack is very subtle, almost going unnoticed at times.<br/><br/>Another gimmick for fans is all the characterization work of a punk rock band. The members of A'int Rights travel in a van, live with little money and due to the dream of being able to make a living with their music and art. Like every young musician in early career, they play in sh*tholes for a few bucks and participate in the underground scene of the cities. A funny and entertaining moment of the film is when the band plays the cover song Nazi Punks F*ck Off, written by Dead Kennedys, a visible provocation to the neo-Nazis who were there.<br/><br/>The cast was well chosen and here we have to highlight the performances of Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart. Playing two opposing forces, the first is sensitive and intense, while the second is cold, calm and meticulous. Stewart, giving life to the character of Darcy, imposes respect and arouses fear.<br/><br/>Green Room is a film with a simple script: be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even with a low budget, the director was very effective portraying the nightmare of the four young musicians. It's worth following Saulnier's next movies.<br/><br/>Originally posted in: https://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","17 July 2016"," Exceptional Thriller
","Green Room (2015) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>After a disastrous show, a broke punk rock group takes a job out in the woods where they will be playing for some ""political"" people. After the set one member of the group sees something he wasn't supposed to so the owner (Patrick Stewart) sets loose some goons to try and kill the band.<br/><br/>GREEN ROOM might not sound like it has the greatest story ever written but writer-director Jeremy Saulnier actually makes one of the more impressive thrillers in recent years. I'm sure many people will call this a horror movie, which is understandable due to the extremely gory violence but it also works perfectly as a tense thriller. What I enjoyed most is that the story itself is quite simple but the director does wonders with it and proves that as long as something is well-made anything is possible.<br/><br/>The film has become somewhat notorious due to its violence and I think it's going to turn a lot of people off but if you've got the stomach for it then you're going to be in for a treat. Unlike the SAW movies this one here isn't showing violence just for the shock factor but it uses it to keep the viewer off guard and not knowing where the next violent twist is going to come from. There are some pretty brutal deaths here but all of them happen for a reason.<br/><br/>The film's plot certainly keeps you off guard because you're introduced to this band and other supporting characters but you'll never be able to guess who the hero is, who is going to survive until the end and who will make it out alive. In most thrillers you know who will be walking away at the end here but that's not the case here. The level of surprise is a major plus and the director uses this to help build up additional suspense. The entire cast and especially Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole and Alia Shawkat are extremely good. Stewart is also very cold-blooded and sinister as the leader.<br/><br/>GREEN ROOM had a lot of hype as it was released to theaters and it certainly deserved ever bit of it. The film is certainly unpleasant at times but it's so well-made and intense that it really works wonders."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","5","15","21 May 2016"," Need Another Reason to Hate Racists? Here Ya Go!
","Green room - a room where performers ""relax"" when not performing. Growing up in rock bands through-and-past college, I've spent my fair-share of time in green rooms. In the pretense-filled world of underground music, this is often the one place musicians are their un-costumed selves. That vulnerability mixed with anticipation of the performance creates a tension. Green Room amps that tension to 11, replacing stage-fright with death-fright. A contained thriller so palpably desperate, I felt myself trying to break down the poster-plastered walls on screen. In the film, a road-weary punk-rock foursome reluctantly take a gig at a white-supremacist venue in order to make enough money to get home, but things turn bad when they discover a murder on premises. And while it certainly gives us another reason to hate racists, there's more to it than that. While a clear love for the hardcore punk scene is on display here, Saulnier is issuing a warning about groupthink of all kinds. Whether music, religion, trends, scenes, or any other community, we must never let our longing for belonging hinder our humanity. When things go wrong, they go very wrong, with some hard-to-stomach violence that works both narratively and morally, even as you cringe. Like writer/director Saulnier's great Blue Ruin, it uses human flaws in place of genre clichés to amplify its message. Each time we think a character is going to do the dumb thing characters always do in horror-thrillers, it deftly defies that platitude. So while Green Room is, at times, a supremely difficult film, it's largely an engaging and completely rewarding backwoods blood-fest that made me thankful for only the minor jitters I get backstage."
"Rickting","8","4","11","2 June 2016"," A murderously intense thriller
","Green Room sees a punk rock band trapped in a nightclub after witnessing a murder. A group of violent skinheads, led by Patrick Stewart, do all in their power to prevent them getting out alive. GR is a pleasingly small-scale thriller. The budget is small, we don't find out that much about the characters, it's mostly in one location and there's virtually no humour. And that's a very good thing. All of these things add to the film, making it a nightmarishly tense and sadistically hard-hitting thriller that never pauses for breath. Thanks to the claustrophobic direction and deft acting, this really is an intense ride. It is not for the faint of heart features many shocking death scenes. It was pretty upsetting for me seeing Maeby from Arrested Development dying violently. It's not a perfect movie, just like every other film out there has its flaws. It's confusing at times and Patrick Stewart's villain isn't particularly developed, as a result feeling like a wasted character. There is an occasionally repetitive sense to the storyline as well. Overall though, if you like viscerally terrifying and brutal thrillers, this is without a doubt the film for you. A sharp, scary movie overall, which is definitely worth seeing in the cinema.<br/><br/>8/10"

","From the director of low intensity revenge thriller, Blue Ruin, comes a new crime chiller, promising interesting sub cultural battle.<br/><br/>The Washington (or close by) - based punk rock band 'Ain't Rights' get themselves in the middle of neo nazi (white supremacists') club; somewhere in Portland. After underwhelming 'tour' and having no other choice they accept a gig in nazi-punk club, having been promised decent pay, if they can keep a low profile.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the choice they have made off the bat, as their surroundings proved hostile, they chose to cover a Dead Kennedys' song 'nazi punks, f#ck off' and start the gig with the protest. But that proved to be a lesser offense, soon they witness a murder in the club. Of course, the ""dogs"" in charge and the owner of the club himself won't let these witnesses go just like that. They need to cover up the whole thing, and our punks are doomed.<br/><br/>You see, these people have been merely using the club as a cover up for illegal/criminal activities. We know how these ""ubermensch' love to pride themselves in being clean cut and vice - free...but these particular people used the pop cultural thing to push drugs and so on. Now they must protect the investment, and of course, the witnesses need to disappear.<br/><br/>The film is almost a perfect package of tension, conflict, gore, except it takes a while to get going. I thought the pace was one of the major problems here, along with the screenplay which does seem to have some gaping holes, and no solid filler.<br/><br/>As far as cinematography and cast, music, which sets the tone, no complaints (it's wonderful) except for the Anton Yelchin's role, who is the weakest of the bunch, as far as I'm concerned, the least likable of them all. Patrick Stewart, as a ring leader, club owner and ""entrepreneur"", did a marvelous job, I only wish he had a bigger part and more lines, obviously. And his 'yes men' were good too.<br/><br/>Long time has passed since Romper Stomper or American History X, we needed new blood, new stories and new perspective, and why not make it a conflict we can relate to: a musical, but mostly a cultural one, with a side note of what it's really about. A clash between law and lawlessness, between good and evil; love and hate, law-abiding people and criminals. Right and wrong. God, I love punk!"
"Coventry","7","4","11","10 April 2016"," Punk is not dead! But the punk band soon will be
","Since the release of his previous film ""Blue Ruin"" and even more so now with ""Green Room"", literally everyone is glorifying the writing and directing skills of Jeremy Saulnier and refers to him as one of the best young directors of a new generation. But hey, wait a minute I've known his name for much longer. I watched Saulnier's debut movie ""Murder Party"" shortly after its release in 2007  and truly hated it! I dug up my user comment from back then and it even seems that I impolitely described Mr. Saulnier as an untalented and uninspired amateur director who probably shouldn't quit his regular job in order to purchase his dream of becoming a famous horror director. Ha! Well, I have been wrong before many times in my life and don't have any problem whatsoever with admitting that I judged too soon. I still haven't seen ""Blue Ruin"" yet, but ""Green Room"" is definitely a very enjoyable and recommendable action flick/thriller and the progress Saulnier made here in comparison to ""Murder Party"" is downright stupendous. The basic plot is very familiar and derivative of approximately 80% of all action movies ever made, but that's perfectly fine because the setting is original, the main characters are likable and the practically non- stop action footage is exhilarating and intense! The four amiable members of the amateur punk band ""Aren't Rights"" find them severely outnumbered against a whole posse of skinheads when, after an improvised gig in a remote club, they witnessed something they shouldn't have and are subsequently forced to battle for survival. The band is trapped inside the dressing room with just one gun and a very uncooperative hostage, while outside the skinheads are crowding up with whole arsenals of firearms, machetes and especially trained attack dogs. There are a couple of nicely unexpected twists and very ingenious ideas in Saulnier's screenplay, like for example a staged stabbing in order to mislead the police and the sublime choice to cast Patrick Stewart as the ruthless but simultaneously safety-obsessed villainous leader. ""Green Room"" isn't really a horror movie but a very brutal thriller, and there are quite a lot of sequences that will be hard to watch for squeamish folks. The dog attacks, for instance, are gruesome to say the least and then there are also shotgun executions at close range and nasty acts committed with a box cutter. Saulnier surrounded himself with quite an impressive cast, especially for such a violent movie. Apart from the almighty Patrick Stewart, there's also Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots. Macon Blair, who has been working with Jeremy Saulnier since ""Murder Party"" and also played the lead role in ""Blue Ruin"" here receives a very significant supportive role."

"CSVAPOR","5","2","4","30 January 2019"," Severely Overrated
","The Green Room is not a horror movie. It's more of a drama thriller with blood and flashes of gore. I was told this movie was going to be intense but I never really felt it because the pacing was as slow as a M. Night Shyamalan movie and there is no build-up of suspense for each death as they all happen very quickly (and they happen in bunches) so you never have the time to process them. One thing that did not escape my attention was the lack of background music which would have help create suspense and a better sense of dread. While some of the characters do critical thinking in the movie, often times I'm puzzled by their decisions as well, like at the very end when the remaining survivors were traveling with a hostage who they then let go so he can look for cops--the same hostage who was before helping his fellow bad guys clean up and cover their tracks.<br/><br/>I don't know how this movie received such high scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I'm an Asian American and I'm the biggest advocate against racism so it was neat seeing skinheads get the tables turned on them but that is not enough to make a good movie."

"bowmanblue","6","2","4","20 January 2017"," I obviously didn't get it :/
","I've seen pretty much every type of horror movie, meaning I've seen every different type of monster (or mutant=-redneck) stalk pretty much every cliché of teenager across every different type of landscape. It's fair to say that after – roughly – fifty years since the (original) 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' popularised the 'slasher' genre, there isn't really anything new to expect. The best you can hope for is an enjoyable rehash of something you've already seen that brings a sliver of something new to the table.<br/><br/>I looked at the reviews for 'Green Room' and was pleasantly optimistic as it's rated very highly on many websites. I've always been a massive fan of Patrick Stewart and Ashton Yelchen usually turns in a decent performance (still say he was the best part of 'Terminator: Salvation') so, even if it wasn't that original, I was expecting something pretty entertaining. However, I've left it a couple of weeks to write this review and I'm finding it pretty hard to actually remember much of what happened – in short, I found it pretty forgettable! It's about a young, up and coming band who – as hard as it is to believe in this day and age – doesn't use social media to promote themselves. Therefore, they're pretty much unknown, touring up and down America in pretty low-key venues. But, they think their luck is about to change when a contact offers them a gig where they can headline (and earn a bit of decent money in the process). Unfortunately, and this is a lesson to us all, the gig is in front of a group of white-supremacists who are hardly people you want to entertain. But, they almost get away with it if it wasn't for the fact that they witness a murder and their (not particularly adoring) crowd isn't too happy to just let them walk away as witnesses. Therefore, the band are forced to lock themselves backstage in (you may have guessed it) the green room and try and figure a way of escaping before they just get 'disappeared' long before they ever get the chance to win their first Grammy.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a 'siege movie' (think 'Assault on Precinct 13' or something like that) with 'band vs Nazis.' It's an acceptable enough premise, but it's, as I've already mentioned, kind of forgettable. The band are just not that likable (or even memorable!). Without wishing to spoil things too much, one dies and it took me a while to even notice! I must have just blinked and they just vanished. They really were pretty forgettable. Obviously, the extreme ring-wingers were naturally nasty so you'd probably be a bit strange to root for them over the band, but it wasn't as violent as some of the reviews had made out. Yes, it is pretty dark and hardly a 'feel good' movie, but I was expecting even more heads to roll than were on offer! It wasn't' a bad film. It was just nothing I hadn't already seen before. Patrick Stewart is the head bad-guy and he's – naturally – always worth a watch, but, in my opinion, this wasn't the greatest swansong for poor old Ashton Yelchen. If you haven't seen that many siege movies, or are a major fan of any of the leads, you may find this quite good (or shocking!). However, if you're a grizzled veteran to the genre then there's little here you haven't seen before. I've pretty much already forgotten most of it (but then again with my age I could just be getting senile!)."

","This movie captured my interest from the start. It had a dark look and moved right along. The villains as well as the protagonists were very unique and believable. But as the movie progressed, it lost its pace and dragged on. It became less interesting, hard to understand at times, and also very gross. As I mentioned, this movie has a dark look - so dark that it was sometimes hard to see the characters's faces. There was no contrast to this darkness and it became a bit too much. The story ended decently and it definitely fits in with modern day thrillers/horror movies. I'm almost surprised that Blumhouse didn't produce it - that's the kind of picture it was. If you like those kinds of movies, you'll like this. From my perspective, this was a movie that had so much potential early on that I was disappointed that it didn't turn out better."

","This film has so much in favor of it- a fresh take on Indy pop horror featuring The DIY punk scene, a firmly grounded aethestic, gore for those who like gore, Patrick freaking Stewart, and a decent script. There may have been meaningful dialogue, but I couldn't hear it. There may have been fun punk Easter eggs in the background, but every scene was dimly lit to the point of muddiness. I streamed this on a high end PC with professional photographer monitor and speakers, to no avail."
"badoli","8","0","0","21 December 2018"," It was okay.
","The movie seems to split the opinions, but i cannot really understand why. It was a well done thriller with a nice idea, but lacking a little in the details. Not enough to ruin it, but neither enough to make it hugely rememberable.<br/><br/>The actions of the main characters make sense, i wouldn't expect any clever survival tactics from a low-life punk-band, who isn't beneath siphoning gasoline from parked cars. At the same time it's a little hard to sympathize with them for the same reason. Even worse fares the nazi gang, who is out for their blood, but isn't all too smart about how. The threat-level is all over the place. At the beginning it is hinted that the four punks are massively outnumbered, but all confrontations boil down to a handleable two to three nazis at a time.<br/><br/>The best about this movie is the gritty atmosphere of the nazi/punk-club, which is well executed onto the screen. Also the good acting.makes this rather watchable, none of the characters felt cheap and Patrick Steward can shine as a softspoken, but evil villain.<br/><br/>But in the slightly above average story, the plotholes and the luke-warm ending left me unsatisfied."

"coatofsolidgold","6","0","0","22 November 2018"," Entertaining enough, often original, but also fundamental flaws.
","The film opens cleverly both visually and narratively and we are quickly drawn into the current lives of Pat, Reese, Sam, Tiger, and Tad a band of earnest, starving punk performers. Through a series of mishaps they soon find themselves deep in the Northwest woods at a neo-Nazi rock club. And just before they can slip away, they witness a murder and are detained by management awaiting the boss Darcy. That's Patrick Stewart, who I thought did a pretty good Nazi. i'm horrible with faces while my son is quite aware, yet both of us kept thinking Walter White rather than Captain Picard. Which brings me to a point that I think a lot of viewers completely missed. Not surprising since it's mentioned off hand once or twice and never figures in the action for some reason. But it does go a LONG way to explain why Darcy is so intent on constructing a death scene somewhere else. And that is the flaw of the movie. It is so concerned with immersion in the moment - which it does very well - it ignores the basic rules of exposition. I have no idea which one is Pat, Reese, Sam, Tiger, or Tad and I couldn't even tell you which ones lived or died except that I looked it up. And while the 3-4 forays from the green room generally resulting in a furious retreat might be an ironic twist on the conventions, the geography of the place is equally hazy. There is a secret level, which holds and keeps Darcy's secret, and well maybe it's just another ironic dead end. But when the band finds the usual unexpected allie who knows the exits, they still wind up behind the bar for some reason. There is, of course, a cathartic conclusion, but even that leaves the worm unturned. For me, the main measure of a movie is whether it draws me in by avoiding obvious manipulations, clunkly tone, or pacing. And this did and was often clever and original. But it could have been a whole lot better if used some more of the old tricks to make us care about what was happening rather than just watching it unfold. So a six."
"cacebucu","6","0","0","22 November 2018"," Not much
","Decently entertaining, I guess, but it really is just violence. One could argue that that's the most honest way for a horror movie to present itself, but Saulnier is not capable enough to pull off a statement of that kind and make it into an interesting film. The acting is good enough to make the characters somewhat likable, but the writing destroys their efforts by not having even one conversation between them. Maybe most horro movies are hypocritical in the way they try to create endearing characters only to have them die, but if this is the alternative, maybe they should keep making them that way."

","From the reviews that I saw online, it seems that this movie had gotten a lot of hype. So I decided to rent and watch it. And to be frank, it was a disappointment. The characters are one dimensional, boring and stupid. There are barely any character development whatsoever and I cannot feel any pity or care for them, and trust me, I tried. The only characters whom I'm able to tolerate is the blonde girl, and I love the dog but that's it. The plot is extremely predictable, unsurprising and stupid. I don't understand the meltdown that the group have gotten into when they saw that dead girl, I mean considering the place they're in, and all the violence that are pretty much natural in a place like that, why the fact that there is a dead body is shocking!? And why do they have to be contained like that? If the Nazis are planning to kill them, they should've just shoot them all and get rid of the bodies, you know, feed them to the dogs or burn them or something. The movie itself is not even thrilling or scary at all. I know a plenty of horror movies that uses jump scares to their advantage, yet this movie doesn't even use a single jump scare and it had completely failed to scare me. There are a plenty of people who calls this movie violent and brutal, yet most of the violence are pointless and it's not even as brutal as other horror/thriller movies. An the end of the day, this movie is a waste of time and I regret spending my precious money and 95 minutes to watch this."
"moviegeek80","3","3","8","17 August 2016"," Not that good....
","I began the desire to watch this film after reading the stellar reviews regarding it as ""brutal"", ""graphic"", and ""real"". Let me just tell you right now from someone who was numbed by the violence in Nekromantic, and the Guinea Pig series, this movie is just as lame as many new-age horror/thriller films Hollywood is spitting out these days. Now, with that being said...the film does have a good story that is believable at best. There are a few quick scenes of slight gore as a direct result of individual violence; merely enough to wet a gore- hound's appetite and nothing else. I felt the movie lacked in gore with the direction in which it headed and also felt it needed a boost in the character department. The character's did exemplify normal everyday behaviors (reactions) to their stimuli, but fell short with realism for me. The ending was good, but nothing I didn't see coming, so no real twist. I do give props to originality of the story line and the art department for all the damn green coloration....the movie is called ""Green Room"" for Christ's sake...I get it already."
"laurenash-24199","8","3","8","8 August 2016"," Adrenaline fueled chaos that's actually entertaining to watch
","I went into this film without much knowledge regarding its plot, but I'm glad I didn't. It was one hell of a ride and easily a ride I'd take again. I felt the whole thing came from a very fresh perspective and was filmed smartly.All the actors had their part to play and I feel they all lived up to the task, I'd never heard of Imogen Poots until seeing her in this film but I enjoyed her character immensely, she added an air of mystery and darkness that the other protagonists didn't exhibit naturally when the situation called for it, often she was the one attempting to lead them further down the rabbit hole.My only misgivings with the film concerned Patrick Stewart as the uber villain, he just didn't come off as all that terrifying to me.I could imagine a multitude of actors who could've played the role, my personal choice would've been Christopher Waltz, now that's a man who can play evil and play it well, something I feel would've taken the film up a few notches.If you're gonna go dark then I say go all in, and the villain is the glue that holds it all together in this type of film, if he's not believable suddenly every other aspect seems to fall a bit flat.Also it felt like the cast were mumbling their lines quite often, I had to stop and rewind a few times to hear every word that was spoken. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the film and it kept me on the edge of my seat. If you want a good thrill and enjoy the darker variety of film I say go see it."

I closed my eyes often because could not hold some scenes. Suggest that people with weak nerves prepare to see some blood and cuts. Interesting was that at one point half of the characters were killed and I did not have to wait for them fall one by one like in many horror movies with long thrilling pauses with no action. As I am not a fan of X-man,it was really nice to see Patrick Stewart in a serious role, a quiet evil man who rules the modern Nazis. Even though lead characters are young people, this movie will be interesting to watch in any age company."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","3","8","8 July 2016"," An excellent thriller that's fiercely violent and menacingly unnerving.
","Green Room is Jeremy Saulnier's third film (though his first, entitled 'Murder Party', is less well-known and was made on the down-low), one that solidifies him as an excellent writer and director; I can't wait to see what he does next. It's an intense thriller that focuses upon a group of punk musicians after they become trapped in the green room of a neo-Nazi bar. It is unnerving, menacing, fiercely violent and entirely captivating. It's also unpredictable and intensely grotesque; it will keep you on the edge of your seat and likely get under your skin. I really liked the movie, thinking it one of the best of the year (so far.) I was gripped for it's 95-minute run-time, and - if you can stomach the violence - would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are mostly well-rounded, and the script does a good job of making them feel like real people. Although some of them are a little dim, making some questionable decisions that obviously lead to bad outcomes, but the situation is stressful and unusual: the characters have never been a part of something like this before, and so are unaware of the best way to proceed. That's the main issue with the script and characters, but it didn't bother me that much because I don't think anyone would know how best to act if they were involved in these events. The script is also subtly witty and there are some elements of dark-humour peppered throughout the picture. The acting is also great, especially that of Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart. They both turn in excellent, if different, performances. Yelchin is believable as the (inept) protagonist who's initially uncomfortable with violence and constantly scared; he thinks he may die at any moment, and the performance really emphasises this. He's also very good at acting in pain, as his character is subjected to some intense injuries, which is an uncommon skill. Stewart is understated in his role, playing a very calm and matter-of-fact character. He's ruthless, cold and down-right despicable but always maintains his composure; he never even raises his voice, yet is very menacing throughout. These two characters are really the main focus of the film, aside from perhaps the greater situation, and both are compelling to watch - even if they rarely meet face-to-face.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are both fantastic, with the film taking on a literal green colour-tone (applied lightly throughout.) The cuts feel natural and aren't jarring, they're barely even noticeable, with several hidden longer takes. The action is also filmed very well, with no shaky cam or insanely quick editing, with the majority of it on-screen and clear. The film is savagely violent, too. There isn't any torture or overt sadism, but each attack is brutal and wince-inducing. The tone is what sells the gore, as the whole film takes on this seedy and unnerving feeling. It gets under your skin and the tension is almost tangible; you actually start to feel trapped like the characters and the overwhelmingly negative odds start to weigh down on you. The effects are incredibly convincing, each injury seems to be real and the actors do a great job at selling them. The violent acts are realistic in nature, nothing is stylised and the camera rarely cuts away. You're forced to watch just as the characters are forced to endure, which creates the feeling that there's no escape. It isn't over the top, none of it feels glamorised or cartoon-esque, and as such is all the more intense. A shot involving Yelchin's arm and another involving a box-cutter being used on someone's stomach are particularly severe and powerful. I didn't mind the violence, as it was justified by the context and not just gore for gore's sake, but I can see some people being put off by it. The story doesn't centre around the violence and it isn't endorsed at all, but it is an integral part of the thrilling experience.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Green Room to be an excellent and compelling thriller. It's unnerving, nasty, unpredictable, unflinching, seedy, savage and brutal but the experience is arresting and had me on the edge of my seat throughout; it's expertly written, directed, shot and acted. One of my favourite films of the year, I'd highly recommend this - if you can stomach it's violence: 8/10"

"auslucas","8","3","8","7 July 2016"," A bloody talented writer and film maker !
","Finally a movie with (some) smart ass characters that react like people could react in real life ! Though this is not a movie about horror nor violence, it's about survival. They are just normal guys confronted to an extreme situation going out of control. There is doubts, there is pain, there is blood and fear and tears, and deep down there is hope... Add a Punk Rock scene, badass musics, black humor, and shake it for 1h30min. Don't expect your usual movies and try to make it through the night...<br/><br/>That's where my summary end and the director's talent -Jeremy Saulnier- starts. The photography is perfect and set up well the atmosphere, some scenes you just want to look at it, some others could be a great covert for a music band. As for the camera he always try to make the best out of the scenes. Most of the directors nowadays forgot that the Cinema is an Art, but not here. The feelings ( tension, fear, etc ) are not only carried on by the situations or the actors, but also by the camera's position and visual composition. It's mastered.<br/><br/>Overall I realized the rhythm is slow but it doesn't really feels like it as the writing is good and you got completely caught up in the story. Why ? Because it's interesting. Behind all scenes and acts there is the purpose of creating interesting characters, showing their defects, their relationship, bringing their world (punks and skinheads) to our (mostly foreign) eyes. You also end up carrying about them, and that's when Hell break loose. Usually it's the moment where you can expect poor dialogues and shortcuts in the script, but not here. The tension is growing up step by step as the band get trap in this room. But they are not alone, we're also getting trap. Caught by the story and trying to find a way out of this situation. Until we realize there is no way out... just through it.<br/><br/>The writing is extremely well done and it's directed with a great talent. Survival isn't something you can watch, it's something you have to live. Only one thing to say : thank you for this movie."

They retreat to the backstage room afterwards, only to be greeted by the corpse of a young woman on the floor and the neo-Nazis standing above her. <br/><br/>Fearful that the band will contact the authorities, they hold them hostage as their leader, tries to think of a solution. <br/><br/>The band-mates are soon fighting for their lives as they attempt to escape the club.....<br/><br/>Blue Ruin was an absolutely gut punching revenge thriller that came out of nowhere when released. It secured cult status for the director, and star Blair, gave such a lasting impression. <br/><br/>So with the added bonus of Patrick Stewart as chief bad guy,this looked like it had winner written all over it. And while the film is menacing, the high expectations I had, were slightly let down by the end product.<br/><br/>It's menacing from the upstart, with the band playing their decidedly awkward music in some very questionable establishments, and yet they end up in the bar from hell, and sing a derogatory song about the frequenting patrons.<br/><br/>This build up gives us the right amount of tension, but the antagonists up to this point are your nuts and bolts skinheads who have no other aim than to cause a little bit of the old ultra violence on the band.<br/><br/>But then Stewart has this wonderful knack of being the most menacing of all by gently coaxing them from the other side of the door, taunting, yet calming.<br/><br/>The violence is very strong, but like Blue Ruin, it's very scarce. But once it's on screen, it's unflinching and very unsubtle.<br/><br/>The cast are great, especially Yelchin and Poots, but it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>It's very enjoyable stuff, but it had a lot to live up to after the wonder of Blue Ruin.<br/><br/>RIP Anton Yelchin."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","8","3","8","2 May 2016"," One creepy little movie
","Almost unbearably, unwatchably tense. First and foremost, the cinematography was well done, with some gorgeous aerial shots establishing the remoteness of the setting. Never in any scene does it resort to shaky-cam, or quick cut editing, nor are there over saturated colours, like a lot of recent horrors have used lately. The characters were believable and even likable. No generic stock characters or stereotypes. Also liked the opening scenes of the band performing in a Denny's (or something like that) for what turned out to be a $6 payday. This had a funny Spinal Tap vibe to it, and gives us a needed laugh, because when the plot proper kicks in, we're neck- deep in horror, and suspense of really not knowing what will happen next. The soundtrack compliments the action without overpowering it, or just merely trying to sell a soundtrack album. The penultimate scene, of was a beautiful touch. As a dog lover, I found this scene to be very moving. Furthermore it was a well done contrast to the violence and bloodshed shown in the body of the film. Minor complaint: the stupid final line, a poor attempt at humour, marring an otherwise top notch horror/ thriller. The film should have ended with the previous scene."
"MattBirk","8","4","13","15 May 2016"," ''Green Room'' Cuts to the Bone!
","Some movies have over-the-top violence (The Evil Dead), some have excessive violence (Inside), and some have realistic violence, that's 'Green Room'. Following up the out-of-nowhere hit 'Blue Ruin', Saulnier returns with another tension-fueled story with crazy-realistic violence that cuts to the bone. This may not have a complex story like 'Blue Ruin', but it's definitely a step up in terms of tension and trepidation.<br/><br/>'Green Room' isn't just the type of movie that has violence for the sake of violence, this movie earns the violence. It's doled out in small short bursts, but those small bursts are incredibly potent and shocking. Every bit a carnage shown on screen is earned.<br/><br/>Not only does the movie present the audience with the obvious fear of death (specifically by mauling) but it also presents us with the fear of a real, competent antagonist. Patrick Stewart's character is menacing without ever doling out any violence himself, he's smart, calculating, and manipulative. It's not often you see movies where the bad guys actually outsmart the heroes multiple times. And that's the real fear factor here, a formidable bad guy.<br/><br/>The downside of 'Green Room' are the thin characters who receive little-to-no development. I wish we were shown a bit more interactions among the band members to reinforce our emotional connection with them.<br/><br/>Outside of the weak characters, there are plenty of obstacles the characters must go up against which only makes the movie all the more exciting. Saulnier knows exactly what he is doing and creates a ton of tension, which more than makes up for the lack of a complex story.<br/><br/>This is one of the years must see thrillers!"

"bkrauser-81-311064","8","3","9","30 April 2016"," A Strong Visceral Follow-Up to Blue Ruin
","Good Lord, what have we unleashed? For the last few years director Jeremy Saulnier has been haunting the independent movie scene with his idiosyncratic aesthetic. His coup the triumph; Blue Ruin (2013) became a festival darling garnering slow and steady support via home video and late-night HBO reruns. I had the pleasure of seeing Blue Ruin and thinking its subversive tension was the kick in the pants modern cinema needed. But Green Room...well Green Room is an entirely different beast.<br/><br/>The story begins rather pensively. Four band mates of a proudly lo- fi punk band take a gig at a rural ramshackle club somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. They're warned the patrons of the club are Nazi far-right (though really ultra-left) types but the foursome aren't exactly in any position to be picky. The show goes off without a hitch but before they can leave Pat (Yelchin) witnesses a grisly murder thus sealing the band's fate as the next victims of Darcy (Stewart) and his cult of skinheads. Caught in her own story is Amber (Poots) who was friends with the deceased.<br/><br/>What sets Green Room apart from other slasher films is it's economy of narrative. Not a single frame is wasted on unnecessary background, boring exposition dumps or contrived wrap-ups and explanations. Everything that can and should be known about the characters, and the story itself is implied visually. One could put the film on mute and still feel intimately involved with the band and grimly bracing for impending doom.<br/><br/>Green Room wisely trades in Blue Ruin's callous and quirky tension for a corrosive sense of dread that soaks through the story like an open wound. This dread is personified by Patrick Stewart who does a fabulous job playing against type as the club's true-believer owner. Unlike the majority of his underlings, who respond to the adrenaline poisoning their veins, Stewart's Darcy is always collected. It's as if he's done this kind of thing before and has no compunction making a group of washout twenty-somethings disappear. Even if that means losing a couple of hungry pitbulls in the process.<br/><br/>Green Room takes all the familiar elements of a slasher horror film and quietly tinkers with them, bringing it's audience a lean and mean little movie. It'd be hard to pigeonhole this film as a simple and effective horror film or a solid suspense film. It's both and neither. When the story comes to a crossroads, it always veers towards tactile suspense over outright gore (though to be clear gore is clear and abundantly present). Green Room brings to mind the best elements of Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) mixed with the dread of Halloween (1978) and visual leitmotifs that would have made Kieslowski smile.<br/><br/>Like Pandora's box, Prometheus's fire or playing Jumanji (1995) for the first time, the world has been properly introduced to the likes of director Jeremy Saulnier. He's a man of great skill and an obvious fixation with the macabre, though always for the sake of a good story. Here's to hoping Saulnier has a bright future which I have a hunch may include a newly minted Three Colors Trilogy (1993- 1994) for the modern age."

","Green Room was a white knuckle thrill ride for me. It takes hardly no time to really get started, and once it does the suspense barely lets up. This movie has the perfect cast, superb pacing, and characters you root for. It doesn't rely on gore or jump scares to get your heart pounding (although there are a couple instances where you can't help but be shocked). Each character feels like their own individual and they all seem like real people with genuine reactions to what's happening. This is great film making and I wish Hollywood was more into making movies like this. It was heartbreaking to see Anton Yelchin give such a great performance knowing he's gone; he had such talent and this film proves it. Green Room does an excellent job at making you wonder what's going to happen, who's going to make it out alive, and who is trustworthy. I love movies that use genuine human emotion to involve the viewer, and this is one of those movies."
"nick_reynolds2011","8","2","5","29 May 2017"," Imogen Poots stole the show for this viewer
","I just wanted to say -- Imogen Poots, who played the role of Amber - - absolutely stole the show for this viewer. Sifting through other reviews I saw that her role and performance wasn't received all the time quite as highly as her role & performance did for me, to say the least, but if I dare say it her character will go down as one of my favorite film characters...ever. Seriously. Her deadpanned and detached delivery was absolutely classic, and on a few separate occasions during the film had me in absolute stitches. She was freaking great and I thoroughly enjoyed watching her perform in every scene that she participated in. <br/><br/>Anyway, as for the film itself -- I thought the direction bordered on excellent, maybe not quite excellent but it came close to it in spots and I'll certainly be keeping tabs on this director and his projects going forward (Jeremy Saulnier). The cast was really solid and all for the most part delivered plus performances. The suspense was thick and all in all, just a wildly entertaining film from start to finish. And speaking of, they kept it short (clocking in at 95 minutes) so it didn't drag on like so many films tend to do. Rented it on Amazon, which gives you a 48 hour window, and in that window I actually watched it three times. Which is a rarity for me. Heck I'll probably even end up purchasing the Blu-ray. <br/><br/>It's really graphic in its violence so know that going in. Good performances from the cast. Good direction. It's not a perfect film by any stretch but at the end of the day, it was a whole heck of a lot of fun. Which is the point to this entertainment thing, ain't it? <br/><br/>8/10 for me overall, but Poots' memorable turn as Amber, to me, is worth the watch alone."

","Since almost everybody's talking about the upsides of this movie, let me mention a couple of main downsides I found important.<br/><br/>Green Room is a perfect example of how hype can ruin the entire movie experience. Mine expectations had been very high due to unexpectedly high critical approval and user ratings. I felt disappointed half-way through the movie.<br/><br/>First, action is not at all fast paced or ample. From what everybody wrote, I concluded that Green Room must be something like Hardcore Henry; non stop mayhem put together nicely with music. But most of the actions is chopped and delivered in a few tense sequences. That's not necessarily bad but it surely slows everything down.<br/><br/>Second, this movie is not even a horror. Several squeamish bursts of action don't make a horror. Atmosphere is intense as in any other action oriented thriller. When it comes to violence, I have to admit that it didn't feel extremely violent like everybody is making it to be. All of the violence is usually brief and happens as a part of some other occurrence (nothing like in SAW series).<br/><br/>Third, don't expect good soundtrack even if you're into punk music. I looked forward to seeing a horror movie in which music may play some sort of pivotal role. Putting band on a spotlight really does seem like a good starting point. But no. A few screams now and there and that's all you're going to get.<br/><br/>Would I recommend seeing Green Room then? Only if hype didn't already precluded you from having a realistic expectations and if you're looking for a no brain cat vs. mouse game. If you want to see something scary or intelligent, skip it and see something better."

He sees a murdered girl and tries to call the cops. The band and the dead girl's friend Amber (Imogen Poots) overpower their guard. Senior leader Darcy Banker (Patrick Stewart) is called in.<br/><br/>This is a fairly simple horror premise. There are some solid young actors in this. The biggest coup is getting Patrick Stewart to play the big bad. He's a Shakespearian actor throwing his full weight into the role. The young characters are not necessarily the brightest bulb in the lot but that's perfectly fine. Everybody is making mistakes in this chaos.

","I'll admit it – Green Room wasn't so much on my list of movies to screen at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) as it was just a film that fit my schedule. Searching for a film to fill a gap in my schedule after Sicario and before Black Mass, I swept up tickets to the screening more due to convenience than interest.<br/><br/>But that was before I did a little research. Director Jeremy Saulnier would hardly have been a name to which I would have recognized in conversation even though I had both seen and enjoyed his two feature films Murder Party and Blue Ruin. Couple his involvement with a facially recognizable cast that included Patrick Stewart (X-Men), Anton Yelchin (Fright Night) and Imogen Poots (Need for Speed) and I found myself more drawn to a film that I had no knowledge of prior to the delivery of the TIFF Program Guide.<br/><br/>Green Room is not as complicated as Saulnier's Blue Ruin, but it surely is more fun. A punk quartet from Virginia are touring the country when they take a gig at a dive where their booker warns them to not ""talk politics"" during the set. This warning is held in just as much regard as the three rules to owning a Magwai as the band stands in front of an audience of skinheads and neo-Nazi's while belting out the tune ""Nazi Punks F Off"" by the Dead Kennedys.<br/><br/>Miraculously, the group gets through their set with their arms and legs still attached, but it is when one of the members heads backstage to the green room to retrieve a cell phone. A startling revelation turns gig-night into a nightmarish where the group barricades themselves in the green room much to the violent chagrin of the bald and tattooed bar patrons that could care less about the group's survival.<br/><br/>The film quickly takes a grab-a-weapon-and-try-and-survive turn and although this takes Green Room from accepting the final award of the night at this year's Oscars, it makes for some grand entertainment which is surprisingly cut among some smart and snappy dialogue. There are plenty of good kills and surprise jolts and the concluding scenes had our TIFF audience vocal in their glorified acceptance.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart doesn't get to play a bad guy all that often, but much like Ben Kinsley showed us in Sexy Beast, the Brit can turn on the bad when given an out-of-type role and Stewart was a marvel to watch leaving his Captain Picard nice guy persona at the door. He's not 'pure evil' but he is the wheel that turns the gears as the situation bottoms out for our poor survivors.<br/><br/>There is so much to enjoy in Green Room that we don't want to let the dead white supremacist cat out of the bag, but let' just say that the unique use of a confined dingy setting, believable performances and a menacing cast made for a wild ride and puts Green Room squarely in the sights for the Midnight Madness Audience Award at the festival.<br/><br/>http://theintestinalfortitude.com/"

","Alright, here is the premise: a punk rock band signs up to a gig in the middle of nowhere that's full of nasty, hate-filled Neo-Nazis and eventually gets held hostage after their performance goes awry. From then on, it's a bloody, intense horror thriller with many lip service to the Romero-era zombie flicks with skinheads. The film is literally that simple, and yet somehow conjures up more than what we expect. Amidst all the violence and the effective horror sleight of hand, the true center of Green Room lies strictly on the surprisingly solid script and filmmaking. <br/><br/>Under the helm of newcomer Jeremy Saulnier, the film delves into the struggle with these characters and their situation. Even though we like to see a bunch of teens killing off a bunch of skinheads Oldboy style, the band members never come close to being the heroes; some of them are poor, loathing bastards themselves and they strive for is no less different than their swastika-toting adversaries. What matters is what they react to their position they got themselves into, and what can reflect on to us in the slim chance we get into their situations. Even the final boss (a menacing Patrick Stewart) and his henchmen feel more grounded, as they feel as anxious as the band members and unwilling to cause any harm. In a Hollywood horror movie landscape as uninspired and lacking of any investment, here is one fresh out of a Film Festival playbook with more than just jump scares and gratuitous gore. <br/><br/>Even the brilliance of the script out of the equation, Saulnier still manages to craft one hell of a tense movie. I cannot recall a horror movie in the last 10 years that has got me at the edge of my seat and shocked me out of it. Explaining how would be impossible, but just imagine The Conjuring if the camera lingered on that bed scene for a few seconds longer, and the payoff was bloodier. If this is what Jeremy Saulnier can manage, then I am proud of keeping him in y radar. Overall, I recommend this slickly crafted horror movie if for no other reason than you won't experience a more anxiety attack like this. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, check out my blog! https://itachisan125.blogspot.com/"

","Green Room is a 2016 horror thriller film directed by Jeremy Saulnier and starring Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole and Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a punk rock band that play a gig in a neo-nazi skinhead bar, but when they witness something they shouldn't have seen, the skinheads trap them in a room, and so begins a cat and mouse game between the members of the band the skinheads. Jeremy Saulnier directs this movie beautifully, creating a lot of tension and suspense, but also offering a great deal of violence, reminiscent of Tarantino.<br/><br/>All the performances in the movie are very good, especially with great praise for Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots. But the one who really stands out in the movie is Patrick Stewart as Darcy, the leader of the white supremacists. It's great when you see an actor who usually plays wise, good characters turn into such a chilling villain. His performance is great because it never goes over the top, but it's subdued throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The tension in this movie is mostly created by the fact that most of the plot takes place in a single location. You get a sense a dread while witnessing how the members of the band try to survive, especially since they don't really have a place where they can escape to. They don't really have the survival skills necessary when dealing with a pack of maniacal skinheads that want to kill them. Aside from the tension, the movie is also very gory. If you're faint of heart, or simply not used with scenes of graphic violence, you will turn your head away from time to time. Green Room is one of the better horror movies I've seen in a while, mostly because it doesn't focus on easy jump scares or pointless violence. Jeremy Saulnier creates a very unease experience, and the performances work really really well. Green Room deserves a 8.5 out of 10! <br/><br/>Also, in closing, I would like to talk a little about Anton Yelchin. So far, this is his last movie to be released this year, considering his death on the 19th of June. It saddens me so much when I see such promising talent go at such a young age. I won't lie and say he was my favorite actor, but I will always remember him in a movie that I love very much and hold very close to my heart, and that's Hearts in Atlantis, in which he co-starred and held his own with Anthony Hopkins. He was only 12 when he made that movie, showing great talent from such a young age but also evolving in a great adult actor. You will be missed, Rest in Peace!"
"Hawkensian","7","3","10","23 May 2016"," Green Room is light on story but excruciatingly heavy on blood spattered, genre-leading survival thrills,
","Director Jeremy Saulnier knows a thing or two about set pieces. Head shots, too. The harrowing events of Green Room occur in just several rooms, yet Saulnier's stripped- down script and direction creates a veritable white-knuckle ride of desperate reversals of fortune and shocking explosions of violence.<br/><br/>The victims of all this nastiness are The Ain't Rights, a struggling Punk band comprising Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole) and Tiger (Callum Turner). After stealing some petrol for their battered old camper van, they head to Seaside, Oregon, where a local DJ arranges a gig for them at a 'right-wing' venue, an offer which the destitute band cannot afford to decline.<br/><br/>When they arrive at the club – which is in an ominously remote corner of the Pacific Northwest – the shaven heads, tattoos and sketchy, leering glances make it clear that the crowd is not merely right-wing but positively fascist. It is at this moment that a feeling of palpable danger and isolation starts to germinate, a feeling that comes to brutal fruition when Pat is witness to a murder in the club's green room.<br/><br/>In a hail of panic and confusion, the band and Amber (Imogen Poots) are locked in the room under the guard of Big Justin (Eric Edelstein) and his fully loaded Smith & Wesson .500, which he explains has cartridges so large that only five can fit into the cylinder. What ensues is a savagely intense siege that affords both its protagonists and the viewer very few luxuries.<br/><br/>After the first few instances of jarring violence, I feared that the film was going to be ninety minutes of audience punishment in the style of The Loved Ones or Wolf Creek. Thankfully, the fortunes of our besieged protagonists do improve, albeit in a wayward and unpredictable manner. It is all the better for it too – the twists and turns of the band's seemingly insurmountable predicament had me in a choke hold until the very end.<br/><br/>What makes Green Room so engaging is its relatability; it is much like Deliverance in this respect. Both films thrust normal people with little experience of violence into a lethal situation, causing the viewer to wonder 'what would I do?', 'where would I be in this group's dynamic?'.<br/><br/>Similarly, the protagonists of both films have no one to turn to, no outsider that they can fully trust. With his smooth diction and measured disposition, Darcy (a very interestingly cast Patrick Stewart) initially appears to be a mature voice of reason amongst a pack of rabidly aggressive young men. Alas, such hopes do not last as the contrary becomes quickly evident. It is only Gabe, played by Saulnier's childhood friend Macon Blair, who appears to be someone the band can work with. Blair channels much of his performance through an anguished gaze that reveals shades of anxiety, doubt and shame. It seems that Gabe has fallen prey to Darcy's steely manipulation.<br/><br/>This is about as dynamic as the characterisation gets, because although Green Room features fine performances across the board, it is a film that's driven by genre-leading survival thrills rather than plot and characters. If you choose to go and see it – prepare yourself!<br/><br/>75%<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

Pressure mounts after they inadvertently become witnesses to a murder and lock themselves in a room as they plan an escape. This picture made official selection at Sundance.<br/><br/>It's Beaufort meets American History X. Imogen Poots (V for Vendetta, Filth) co-stars as a ""good"" Nazi on the wrong (or right) side of the door, with Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development, Search Party) as a hardcore musician in danger. They piece de resistance was Patrick Stewart (Star Trek, X-Men) as the leader of the neo-Nazi skinheads. That's good casting. Patrick Stewart has an unmistakable voice and a super-Anglo-Saxon way and he's great in everything he's in. <br/><br/>With tragic irony, the late actor was running from death. In real life, Yelchin was Russian Jew, hence the ""Anton,"" which is less of a common name in the United States. It must have been super intense for him to act out being hunted by Nazis during production. <br/><br/>The plot definitely has its holes. The main one is the fact that the skins, who have the kids outnumbered and surrounded, opt to fall back and send in a few wannabe stormtroppers and dogs. There were half-baked subplots that didn't go anywhere. This film could have used a few rewrites. It's a twist on the panic room subgenre. <br/><br/>Places like this exist in real life, especially in the pacific northwest and the north. The best line was ""I want him to die with the taste of meat in his teeth,"" or something like that, of an attack dog. In the ultimate punk rock move, the band opens with ""Nazi Punks F--k Off!"" by the Dead Kennedys in a room full of skinheads. Goons."

"jdconner-66490","6","2","6","7 July 2016"," Green Room Movie Review
","The main theme of this film, shared with Jeremy Saulnier's other movie, Blue Ruin, is about placing characters in high-stakes situations in which they have virtually no experience. In Green Room, this worked at times, when characters figured out solutions to their situations in interesting and entertaining ways, but didn't work in others, when characters made decisions so idiotic that they weren't relatable as fictional people, making certain characters come off as expendable. Since this didn't happen much, this film was still quite entertaining due to the tension of certain situations which, as a respect to the readers who will either mark this review as helpful or unhelpful based on whether they agree or not, I will not spoil. What weighed it way down, unfortunately, was the poor actors who seemingly stuck to one terrified or distraught facial expression and stuck to it for one or two scenes of tension. When the scenes had lower stakes, however, the film became dreadfully boring as the characters took turns saying lines in a very casual way. This could have been improved upon immensely by simply having the actors overlap each others' lines of dialogue. Therefore, Green Room had much more positives than Saulnier's last film, but still an abundant amount of issues."

"spookyrat1","7","1","2","8 April 2020"," White Knuckle, Green Room!
","In the tradition of unexpectedly good siege/survival films such as Assault on Precinct 13 and Straw Dogs comes Green Room from writer/director Jeremy Saulnier. It takes the typical victims being terrorized in a ""cabin in the woods"" and then cleverly keeps pulling the carpet out from under the expected generic tropes set-ups.<br/><br/>Instead of demons/serial killers doing the dirty work, we have a band of skinhead neo-nazis, led by of all people, Patrick Stewart, generally underplaying his role neatly and only occasionally displaying his full evil intent. And instead of your usual mixed bunch of unlikeable teenagers being set upon, Saulnier gives us the four members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the Pacific Northwest. Desperate for money, they take a gig, they would have preferred not to have done, at the neo-nazi bar, situated in a lonely forest venue. Before they can leave after their gig, they find themselves attacked by the skinheads after witnessing a murder in the club's green room. Pretty much totally out of their depth and completely unsure about what to do next, they barricade themselves in the room, whilst desperately hoping to come up with a solution to their predicament.<br/><br/>The major selling point of Green Room is that it definitely has an air of realism about the general scenario. None of the twists and turns that occur appear contrived. It's not spoiling to say that during the hours that follow the discovery of the murder, the band are joined by some resourceful allies, again occuring after a chain of logical happenings. The action and violence that we see occur isn't stylishly choreographed, but rather the sort of stuff we might imagine happening from opponents on both sides, unused to dealing out the rough stuff and then seeing the up-close results.<br/><br/>Green Room serves as a reminder of how much of a loss, we suffered due to the way too premature death of Anton Yelchin. As the quietly spoken sort of leader of the Ain't Rights, he gives us a completely different character from that of his best known and much loved Pavel Chekov in three Star Trek films of the latest franchise and in the process demonstrates he knows his way around a bass guitar.<br/><br/>Stewart and Yelchin get great backing from a veritable ensemble of a support cast with standouts for me being Imogen Poots as Amber, who proves to be extremely resourceful after throwing off her initial shell shock and Saulnier regular Macon Blair as Gabe, a club employee and Stewart's right hand man, who may not be quite so wedded to the cause as his boss.<br/><br/>Both a critical and commercial success, Green Room is a dynamic, occasionally darkly comic, unusual take on a popular film genre and thanks to a gritty no holds barred authenticity, proves to be thoroughly entertaining. Make sure you don't miss the Ain't Rights, if they happen to be performing around your neck of the woods."

","Jeremy Saulnier's ""Murder Party"" and ""Blue Ruin"" are among personal favorites of mine. ""Green Room"" further explores Saulnier's theme of ordinary people driven to extreme violence by situations both in and out of their control. It is refreshing to find in ""Green Room"" that the bad guys are not made to be any more competent at violence than are the victims, nor are they made out to be superhuman, hard to kill, or without fear and reticence. Saunier makes the Neo-Nazis human, not caricatures. He does not make them sympathetic, don't get me wrong, but in making them mere mortals, the film is vastly more interesting and realistic Speaking of realistic, the explicit violence is rendered expertly and has the capacity to effect even the most seasoned horror fans out there. Like Sam Peckinpah, Saulnier makes violent movies for the smart viewer."
"austincoleman-66971","8","1","2","10 May 2019"," Riveting and realistic
","Green Room is one of the best thrillers I have seen in some time. Going in, I did have somewhat high expectations because the premise itself is original and interesting enough to pique curiosity without seeing any trailers or clips.<br/><br/>The beginning of the first act feels a little disjointed and I thought could have benefited from a little more exposition. We are kind of just thrown in to the lives of this band and expected to be empathetic towards them. This just didn't work for me super well and I wish more time had been spent on establishing a stronger emotional connection with our group of ""heroes"" per se.<br/><br/>This is really the only major issue I had, and once the conflict starts it doesn't really matter...the lack of build up actually serves to increase the intensity in some ways. What separates Green Room from other thrillers is just how realistically they are able to bring this scenario to life. This could happen to ANY down on their luck band desperate for every dollar they can get. And it doesn't just do well with the setting, but it also does a great job in shifting the tone in a dramatic way, as many real life traumas happen themselves. The other shoe drops in the blink of an eye and we are immediately transported from a run of the mill scenario to one that is life or death. Yes, they make ""stupid"" decisions that are cliche of a lot of movies like this, but in this case it feels natural because the emotional tension is so strong that it reasonably prevents anyone from thinking critically.<br/><br/>From the moment the conflict begins, my heart did not stop pounding throughout the course of the film's runtime. It is incredibly tense and quite frankly terrifying. There is some extreme violence that may detract from the viewer's experience, but I did not feel that it was too over the top and thought it was done well in order to create the type of tone the creators were likely trying to establish.<br/><br/>The performances here are awesome. The major standout for me was clearly Anton Yelchin...simply fantastic...followed closely by Imogen Poots and of course, Sir Patrick Stewart. Stewart's character honestly felt a little underutilized. I would have loved to have seen more. Even so, he kills every scene that he is in.<br/><br/>Overall, despite its lack of exposition that would have improved the narrative a little, Green Room is one of the more terrifying and intense thrillers I think I've ever seen. It is very well-crafted and, due to its subject matter, just as thought provoking as it is purely entertaining.<br/><br/>Rating note:
I sat on the fence between 8 and 9 for a while. For right now I'm giving an 8/10 because I really did want more emotional and interpersonal connection to the protagonists. However, it is a lot closer to a 9 than most 8's I have given in the past and could easily see this evolving into a 9 for me over time or after an additional viewing."

","Does Jeremy Saulnier have a thing with colors? First he gives us Blue Ruin, then he gave us Green Room. He's got a whole career ahead of him and I hope he covers every spectrum of the rainbow. But I digress. Green Room is good, but you need the stomach and patience to sit through it. Whereas Blue Ruin was brooding and violent, Green Room is less brooding and way more violent. The plot of the film is ingenious in it's own right. A punk band performs a gig at a skinhead compound and are held hostage in a night of terror. The band is in too deep. They've seen too much, and the skinheads want to do anything to bury the evidence, even if it means killing them all. Dark, dark, dark. Darkness consumes this movie. Either the subject matter begins to grow on you, or it doesn't. But I went with it, and for that, I wasn't disappointed. Also, kudos to Saulnier for casting Patrick Stewart and forcing him to cover up his English accent, with hilarious results."

","I watched Green Room without really knowing what to expect. But, I was pleasantly surprised. I found the punk scene accurately portrayed, as well as the animosity most punk rock musicians have towards its crappier subfactions, i.e. the skinhead punks. This movie is a when bad goes to worse situation. Mostly well meaning musicians are caught behind enemy lines, so to speak, doing a frightful gig for skinheads; only because they need the money. The gore and mayhem all seemed to unfurl realistically, which gave the movie a level of truth, that made it an even more bloodcurdling view: due to its realism.<br/><br/>It's a really great horror/thriller film with a lot of cathartic moments. As I said, it's tough to watch at times. This is in a good way, however, since the viewer roots for the main protagonists so much.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend."

But what they don't know is that the gig is supposed to be held at a neo-Nazi bar. There were plenty of ""red flags"" that they should've noticed right from the get go. But I guess they really needed the money. So they perform their songs and as they're about to leave they witness a murder through an unfortunate turn of events. All the sudden they find themselves in a problematic situation; now that they've seen the murder they can't just be let go. For the majority of the movie the protagonists find themselves trapped in that one room; the very room where the murder took place. First against their will. Later on however as the circumstances change they stay in the room for their own protection. Things start to escalate as the owner of the bar starts to prepare for the worst case scenario. <br/><br/>The constant tension and dread is palpable. After all the protagonists are nothing but a bunch kids (figuratively speaking. They are teenagers) trying to survive in this hostile environment. Meanwhile their captors are armed and dangerous.

I think the film's dialogue was a strength whereas with other films of this type its their weakest. The acting was also uniformly very good. It's mostly kind of a simple, run-of-the-mill thriller, but it also has a lot of interesting touches that I found very inspired. The uneasiness and uncertainty of the entire climax and the ending felt really earned, and showing the other side of things (Patrick Stewart and Macon Blair).

"AndrewAgassi","9","3","12","17 May 2016"," It creates more tension than a math exam
","Green Room is so far one of the best films of 2016. It doesn't heavily invest in character development nor can you find some deep philosophical meaning from it. But what it delivers is extreme tension and gore that actually makes you cringe.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a financially poor punk band who perform a gig to a skinhead club. Later, one of the members gets into trouble and they all get locked in to green room. What follows is an adrenaline rush for the viewers. The main characters are faced against skinheads who want them dead as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Though the plot may sound a bit silly, it most definitely isn't. The neo-Nazis in this film are actually terrifying. They are ruthless cold people, however they are also hesitant. They know that the punk band can fight back, so caution must be taken. This shows that the people in this film are realistic. They fear, but they can also cause fear. That is also one of strong aspects of this film- realism. When things happen, there will be consequences. That also applies to gore. The gore will make you cringe. It's realistic and they show you every little detail. When somebody gets injured, they suffer from that injury, making them weaker and easier to kill. The feeling that somebody may die any second creates tension I have never witnessed before.<br/><br/>Another strong point is the acting. Though some of the band members are a bit dull, performances from Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots are fantastic. They are dumb, they have not been in that sort of situation before and they will make dumb decisions, sometimes causing a lot of harm. Another special performance is from Patrick Stewart, who plays the head of the skinheads. My god this man was born for this roll. Every scene is instantly better, when he appears. Whenever he speaks, people listen. People are afraid of him, because he is smart. He knows how to act in these kind of situations. But even he is afraid, because he has to deal with the problem as fast as possible or he will face suspicion from the police. I honestly think that Patrick Stewart should be nominated for an Oscar for that incredible performance.<br/><br/>I also loved the camera work. The scenes in the green room feel claustrophobic with shots close to the faces. The scenes away from the green room look awesome as well. For example, the clubhouse looks empty, dark and quiet, creating some intense shots.<br/><br/>The only negative point is that some of the dialogue is a bit weird at times. At some points the members of the band say things no sane person would say in intense situations, for example: ""Let's split up! Alright good idea!"" It may distract you sometimes, but overall it's not the worst flaw in cinema history.<br/><br/>All in all, Green Room is a must see film, I was sad to see only 3 other people in the cinema with me as this film deserves so much more."

","""Green Room"" (2015 release; 94 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of four musicians in a punk band called the Ain't Rights As the movie opens, we see the four of them waking up in their van, after the van slid off the road the night before. It's not long before they meet up with a local radio show host, who is able to book them onto a nearby concert the next day. When the band gets there, they realize that this is a show for Nazi skinheads. When they open their set with a cover of a Dead Kennedys' anti-Nazi tune, the audience gets very restless. Things only get worse from there... At this point we're about 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Blue Ruin"". Here, he brings a very different story, namely what happens to a punk band when they accidentally end up performing for Nazi skinheads, and things turn sour (in a very unexpected way--sorry, I cannot reveal more). As soon as the band starts their gig, the movie's tension rackets up and simply never lets go from there until the very end. The cast is an ensemble of no-names, at least for me, with of course the exception of Patrick Stewart. Stewart plays the role of the leader of the Nazi skinheads, and he brings it with ice-cold detachment and ruthlessness. Beware: there are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes, so if that is not your thing, by all means stay away from it. if on the other hand you like a true original horror-thriller story, you are in for quite a treat. Last but not least, there is an excellent soundtrack, both from the original score (composed by Brooke Blair and Will Blair), and also the various songs interwoven into the music. When CCR's ""Sinister Purpose"" starts playing over the movie's end credits, it brings a sense of relief, as in: you made it alive through the end! Which is more than can be said for a number of the characters in the movie...<br/><br/>""Green Room"" premiered at Cannes 2015, exactly a year ago, to critical acclaim. No idea why it's taken this long to get a theatrical release but better late than never I suppose. ""Green Room"" opened on 3 or 4 screens in Greater Cincinnati this past weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at the other day was attended okay but not great, somewhat to my surprise. In you are in the mood for a top-notch horror-thriller, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Green Room"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"zkonedog","5","2","7","27 February 2017"," A Bit Exclusionary, But Still Entertaining
","There is no doubt that ""Green Room"" is an exciting film, and one that will keep you entertained until the very end. Here's the thing, though: From a film studio (A24) that has produced some of my absolute favorite films the past few years, ""Green Room"" didn't quite measure up. I think the reason is because its punk-rock atmosphere leaves out a fair number of viewers who can't quite relate.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the punk-rock band the ""Ain't Rights"", comprised of Pat (Anton Yelchin), Reece (Joe Cole), Sam (Alia Shaukat), and Tiger (Callum Turner). They are the typical ""struggling band"", siphoning gas from parked cars just to make it to the next gig. When that ""next gig"" happens to take them to a Nazi skinhead bar in Oregon, however, they witness an atrocity and are not allowed to leave (these people deal with things themselves). When the situation escalates, club owner Darcy (Patrick Stewart) is called onto the scene in order to control the chaos...and he is a man who certainly doesn't care if ultimate, violent force is used to get the job done.<br/><br/>The most interesting themes of ""Green Room"" surround the skinhead culture of violence in order to make sure that problems are ""solved"" without ""outside intervention"". When the band members decide to fight back a bit instead of just rolling over in the face of threats, Darcy brings out a combination of dogs, weapons, and cold-blooded killers that can truly be chill-inducing. So, one could say that just the sheer, stark violence of the picture is a ""plus"" (if you aren't immediately turned off by it) in that it manages to be legitimately creepy and dark.<br/><br/>The problem I had with this movie, though, is that I felt like I was kind of on the outside looking in due to the fact that I have no experience with clubs, live rock music, or punk-rock culture. That could be a ""me problem"", but I wonder if it also won't discourage others who might be in the same boat. It was just very difficult for me to relate to the characters, and that was a problem in a sub-90 minute piece that doesn't leave much time for character development.<br/><br/>Also, ""Green Room"" is a rather stark departure from A24's more mysterious or mind-stimulating fare, instead opting for a shot of adrenaline to the senses. I prefer the former type of film- making, but those who more appreciate the latter will like this one better than I.<br/><br/>So, while I was never bored with ""Green Room"" and indeed enjoyed certain aspects of it, as a whole it doesn't stick out to me as anything special (even in A24's own collection). Maybe I've just been spoiled by A24's tradition of excellence at the cinema that anything below that (or not appealing directly to my film tastes) seems a bit off. Either way, this one was ""just okay"" in my eyes."

","It isn't a entirely something new when it comes to the slasher horror genre, but it is a watchable take on it. So the plot is about a amateur punk rock band group trying to get a gig. And they are desperate enough to even play in a neo nazi pub. However when the members witnesses a murder go down, things start to get really dark for the group. And thus a game of trying to survive by outwitting the people that are trying to kill them by hiding and playing fire with fire. Like I said there wasn't anything new to this genre. But what did stand out to me was how they try to fight against fear because one of the character remembers a past event. When it comes to the violence it is brutal, but doesn't come across as all that realistic. Not because of the blood and gore but because of how the characters try to handle themselves against violence. The acting ain't bad, but when it comes to violence it's like they were just asking to get picked off. I know they probably wasn't going for a overly serious direction despite the circumstance and situation but it does get annoying to watch sometimes. I did think the set up when it comes to the premise, like the title was sort of unique in a way. However the characters that are trying to survive just came off annoying and the build up of the characters was just poorly done. It would have been at least somewhat interesting if the punk band pulled some creative stuff as a group to fight back and escape. But since they were all so darn unlikable. I just didn't care when most of them got picked apart early on when the chaos started because of poor decision making. I also thought the pacing was poorly put together, especially when things start to get dark. There just wasn't any tension or suspense. So when someone gets killed off, you as the audience is just like *hmm*. Overall, I give this movie a 5 out of 10 because of the concept and the somewhat immersive visuals.

They take one last gig at an out of the way bar in the Pacific Northwest - a hangout for neo-Nazis. When Pat accidentally witnesses a murder, they are trapped in (and then barricaded in) the GREEN ROOM while the head of the group, Darcy (Patrick Stewart) can pin the murder on them.<br/><br/>This siege becomes long and drawn out as Darcy and Pat attempt to work out a truce. These scenes are tense and when the violence begins - as it most surely must in these types of movies - it is visceral, intense and hardcore.<br/><br/>Yelchin and Imogen Poots (as a friend of the newly deceased) make decent leads to be trapped in the Green Room with (along with the other members of the band), but is is Stewart's cool, calm, collected and MENACING leader that steals this movie. Stewart calls this film his ""quietest"" role ever and he would be right. But it is in this quietness that the real tension and malevolance resides. Darcy seems calm on the exterior but you can see the wheels turning as he tries to make the best possible outcome - for himself and his crew.<br/><br/>Director and Writer Salnier (Blue Ruin) does a nice job of wratcheting up the tension using sparce dialogue, winding things up just enough to make the inevtiable explosion jarring and meaningful.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this movie is not for the squeamish, there is plenty of blood and guts on the screen before this one is over, but the journey along the way is quite good and one that I would recommend you check out.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","Green Room is a common show business term for the area where performers relax while waiting for their turn on a theater stage or television program, or for guests waiting for their scheduled appearance on a talk show. These rooms are rarely actually painted green, and no one definitely knows the origin of the term, but it now also refers to the crime-horror-thriller ""Green Room"" (R, 1:35). This is the third crime-thriller/horror film written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier (after 2007's ""Murder Party"" and 2013's ""Blue Ruin""), but also bears a resemblance to another recent ""Green"" film. (More on that later.) The Ain't Rights is a northwestern U.S. punk rock band in search of a gig. This is the kind of group that parties so hard that they all pass out in their van in the middle of a corn field with the engine running and then siphon gas from a car in a nearby parking lot in order to get back on the road. After Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole), and Tiger (Callum Turner) play a club that barely pays them enough for a tank of gas, a punk music blogger (David W. Thompson), who recently interviewed them, sends them to a better-paying, but remote club where his cousin works. The bar turns out to be full of skinheads whom the band intentionally antagonizes by starting their set with a cover of The Dead Kennedys' ""Nazi Punks, F*** Off!"" The Ain't Rights eventually win over the crowd with their original stuff, but when they're finished, the end of their set turns out to be just the beginning of their problems.<br/><br/>Just as the band members are about to leave the club, Pat runs back to the green room to retrieve a cell phone that Sam had left charging and he sees a young woman lying on the floor with a knife sticking out of her head. Pat quickly dials 911, but before he can fully explain what he saw, two bouncers named Justin and Gabe (Eric Edelstein and Macon Blair) take the band's cell phones and hustle them back into the green room. They're locked in, along with a club regular named Amber (Imogen Poots), and held at bay by Justin and his .357 Magnum. Gabe attempts to deal with the police and calls the club's owner (Patrick Stewart). The film then becomes a deadly game of cat-and-mouse between the intelligent, but ruthless owner and his violent henchmen and the resourceful but terrified group inside the green room.<br/><br/>""Green Room"" is a solid and well-balanced horror/thriller. It's very dark, meaning the lighting in most of the film's scenes and the tone of the film. Saulnier uses all that darkness and the close quarters in many of those scenes to maximum effect and when he widens his lens or lightens up a scene, it's more of a shock to the system than a relief for the audience. In tone and in some of its content, this movie reminds me a bit of Eli Roth's 2015 cannibal extravaganza ""The Green Inferno"", but without the jungle and all that feasting on human flesh (well, mostly without flesh feasting). ""Green Room"" doesn't cross over into ""torture porn"", but it does have its brutal and bloody scenes. Its jungle is mostly narrow hallways, dark spaces and one very scary green room. Most of the story's tension comes from the psychological torture experienced by a few cornered young people not knowing what's going to happen or what to do next.<br/><br/>It's also very entertaining to watch Anton Yelchin, who usually plays innocent, clean-cut and humorous characters (e.g. in the latest ""Star Trek"" films and in 2015's charming romantic comedy ""5 to 7"") and Patrick Stewart, known on screen mostly for his strong, but sensitive leadership (in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") embrace their inner bad-ass. Unfortunately, a few questionable plot points range from vague to frustratingly nonsensical, but strong acting, effective visuals, a fresh and well-paced story and a consistently dark, foreboding tone mostly make up for the script's few deficiencies. If you appreciate an original, economical and tense horror/thriller, you should make room in your life for some green. ""B+"""

","I was very excited to see Green Room. I've heard nothing but great things about it and I love the trailer for it. I left the theater pretty happy. Sypnosis for the film is pretty simple: A rock band accidentally witness a murder while retrieving into the green room to get one of the band member's phone. Then the security guards/members of a gang lock the band and another girl who witnessed the murder into the green room and I'm going to stop at there because this movie is very thrilling. It's better going into the movie without watching the trailer (if you have that's fine) because they spoil this really awesome part on the trailer where *spoiler/ a girl crawls out of the couch cusions with a box cutter/ *end of spoiler* It did take a while for the premise to kick in and that can easy bore some people who go in on a Friday night looking for fun, and it is a lot of fun but you just have to sit through 20-25 minutes before anything interesting happens. Now one thing that bothered me is that one of the characters said ""we should split up"" and at first I thought they were joking, but then I saw they were dead serious with trying to get away with that line. Anyway, the movie is super interesting with it's kills. It has great effects and set designs with it's low budget. It's also very powerfully acted, Patrick Stewart was great but he never fully broke out, he didn't have as many scenes as you would expect but in the scenes he was in he was great. The main guy and Imogen Poots were also fine as well. So was Alia Shawkat. The suspense is very gritty and intense, defiantly not for the faint-of-heart. If your looking for a suspenseful gritty intense horror-thriller, check out Green Room."

","I saw ""Green Room"", starring Anton Yelchin-Chekov in the new Star Trek movies, Fright Night_2011; Imogen Poots-Need For Speed, Fright Night_2011; Alia Shawkat-Arrested Development_tv, The Runaways and Patrick Stewart-Professor X in the X-Men movies, Robin Hood:Men in Tights.<br/><br/>This is a nice little thriller, although it is ultra violent & bloody. It kind of reminded me of a punk version of 'Straw Dogs'. Anton is in a punk band that is on the road with his band mates, just trying to make a buck. They end up at a drinking establishment that is run by Patrick and almost all of his customers look like neo-nazi skin heads that are getting all liquored up and about ready to go do some damage. After a person gets killed by one of the regulars in the green room, Anton and his band-including Alia-get trapped in the green room, AKA: the dressing room. Imogen is already in the green room-she was a witness to the murder-and she and Anton's band mates have to try to survive getting out of the bar alive, because Patrick wants to blame the death on them, a new band that is just passing through, and eliminate all the evidence. Patrick uses his nazi drinking buddies to try to get at Anton & company and one of them even has attack dogs. It's the old saying of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It does get pretty graphic in the violence department, what with a lot of stabbing and shooting and, oh yeah, the dogs tearing people to pieces. It's rated ""R"" for violence, gory images, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

It has plenty of gore and tension, and we thankfully don't have to spend the whole movie in the green room itself. We wonder why there are so many ""professional"" machinations to cover up the murder, but we eventually learn much more is at stake because these awful skinheads also have a heroin dealership downstairs.<br/><br/>Anton Yelchin normally makes my skin crawl, but he plays a subdued, close performance that fits the movie's tone well.

Then the way Anton's arm was broken, and they just patched him up with duct tape. (Nope, he would be in so much pain and unable to move at all, even with adrenaline pumping through him. He may have been able to do a bit at first, but he would not have lasted as long as he did).<br/><br/>And the way the killings went, they were really fast, so there was not much of a cat and mouse effect happening. I kept thinking it would turn into a werewolf movie, with the meat grinder note, and the way the Nazis seemed like a pack. Maybe it would have redeemed itself a bit. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie for me, was when they told the real music they would take to a desert island.

","""Green Room"" is a strange movie. It's sort of a horror-thriller, set among the apparently still existent punk subculture. The characters speak in slang that can be hard to follow and keep up with, and at times, it seems deliberately obtuse. Some of the dialogue made very little sense to me, and I was often left struggling to understand what was going on. There's a difference between making a movie sound authentic, and making it sound like a group of cool kids having a conversation in front of you they're determined to keep you in the dark about.<br/><br/>I rewatched the beginning to see if I had missed anything in that crucial moment where the plot really gets going, and of course, I hadn't. Therein lies the problem: the story isn't confusing or complicated. It's just told in a way that makes you think it is. The plot is about a down on their luck hardcore punk band who are siphoning fuel to power their van on a tour through north western America. They take a last minute gig in a venue that is strictly ""boots and bracers"" – ie. Skinheads, where their choice of opening cover is hilarious.<br/><br/>While there, they see something they shouldn't have, and it becomes clear to them, if not to us, that they're not going to be let out without a fight. There are some things that happen along the way – many things – that add needless confusion to a fairly straight forward story. <br/><br/>The movie does a great job of putting you within the punk subculture, but the basic plot could have been transplanted into any milieu. There's too much incidental detail, and too much story, and these things are at war with each other."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","10","6 June 2016"," Pretty good horror thriller
","""Green Room"" (not to be mistaken for ""Green Zone"") is an American thriller movie that premiered on several film festivals last year, but it took until June this year for it to receive a wide release. At least here in Germany. The writer and director is Jeremy Saulnier, a man who has made films for quite a while already, but his big breakthrough came only recently with the 2013 film ""Blue Ruin"". So it seems he has a bit of a color thingey going on. Maybe one of his next films will be titled ""Red Cabin""? But back to this one here. It runs for 95 minutes approximately and features some of the rising stars from cinema these days, such as Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots and Alia Shawkat who I was glad to see here as I liked her on ""Arrested Development"".<br/><br/>The story is about a music group, very much from the political left, who ends up giving a concert at a location that is a famous Nazi meeting place. And if this was not enough already, they happen to witness the murder of a young woman. The consequence is that the Nazi gang, led by Patrick Stewart's character, tries to kill them and they succeed in some of the cases, maybe in all? Watch for yourself. After all, this is a good watch for people who love claustrophobic horror films without supernatural aspects, so maybe the likes of ""Panic Room"". I really love the latter and this may be one reason why I also got to enjoy this film here. At its runtime of under 100 minutes, it stays truly essential and that's nice. No need to drag it. There were also here and there a couple scenes that I did not like, for example with the desert island music group (sucks that this was used at the end too), Saulnier tried to make the film a bit too artistic and that's not what he should have gone for. Best would have been for it to stay on the path of being pointless fun. Also the face paintings at the end were a bit embarrassing.<br/><br/>As a whole, I had a pretty good time watching this, occasionally even a great time. Tough to say what was the best thing about the movie. I guess it is a mix of the convincing script and strong performances (especially Stewart). In my very case, it certainly helps that I am crushing a lot on Shawkat and Poots. Horror film maniacs will maybe criticize that it was the usual concept of killing off one by one, but I did not mind it. I liked the way they handled it and the ending scene with the mourning dog was pretty beautiful too. The romance aspects between the two survivors was slightly there, but never in a way that it would distract from the more important plot points. Overall, a well-rounded little film that is absolutely worth checking out. Thumbs up."

From directing a singular location first film to using his own personal properties in his movies, Saulnier jumps up to the top tier of filmmaking with his junior effort ""Green Room"". This film doesn't only represent the greatest of horror films, bit it also stands as an epic departure for Anton Yelchin who was the same age as myself and who died at the age of the infamous number 27.

"brando647","7","1","4","15 June 2017"," Brutal, Blood-Soaked Battle: Punk Rockers vs Neo-Nazis
","I was sold on GREEN ROOM the moment I found out Patrick Stewart is the villain. Not just any villain either, but the head of an organization of rural neo- Nazis. And, to keep the STAR TREK connections flowing, he and his skinheads are going up against a punk band in which the lead guitarist is played by Anton Yelchin who played the young Pavel Chekov in the 2009 reboot and onward. Then GREEN ROOM went on to earn a certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and I was excited. I love a good genre film and GREEN ROOM is a horror/thriller that will effectively keep you on edge. The film focuses on a small-time punk band called the Ain't Rights as they're coming to the end of a cross-country tour. They're a handful of die-hards in it for the music and embracing the struggle, driving all hours and siphoning gas because these gigs aren't paying the greatest. As the movie begins, they find themselves in the Pacific northwest when a promised gig proves to be a bust. Just as they're about ready to call it done and start the long ride home, their local contact promises them a better venue and the chance for some decent cash. The only downside: they're playing to skinheads. Just keep it cool and don't play anything that'll set them off, and it'll be fine. The gig, at a private bar in the middle of the Oregon wilderness, goes well enough, but one wrong move on their way out ensures they won't be allowed to leave alive.<br/><br/>The band finds themselves trapped in the skinhead bar's green room with the owner (Stewart) at first trying to reassure them that everything will be fine, the police are on the way, and soon this whole ordeal will be sorted out. Meanwhile, the neo-Nazis have a secret to protect on this property and that means these scrawny rockers can't be allowed to ruin their operation. What follows is a brutally violent battle of punks vs. Nazis where the Ain't Rights are going to have to force themselves out of their comfort zones and face death head-on if they plan on seeing their way out of there. The band consists of Yelchin with Alia Shawkat, and relative unknowns (to me) Joe Cole and Callum Turner. It's the band that sells it and makes this movie, at times, pretty painful to watch. They give the band a grounded realism as your average aimless youths with nothing more in mind than getting drunk and playing their music So when these stone-cold killers come at them armed with machetes and trained attack dogs, they react with a very real panic. These characters aren't action heroes. They're still practically kids and this is a very real danger for them. So, when they get the nerve to finally try and turn the tables on their enemies, it's sloppy and often ineffective, and when people start to die it provokes a gut reaction, unlike a lot of other slasher films out there where you're too detached to care about the heroes.<br/><br/>It's a treat to see Patrick Stewart as the villain, especially one as horrible as this. His character, Darcy, is the head of this operation and storms on to the scene once his lieutenants alert him to the problem of a pesky corpse and the police having been called to the scene. He operates with composure and he's got a plan to make sure all of this goes away before it can destroy everything he's worked to build. He's soft-spoken, though that may just be because Stewart's slight southern drawl barely conceals his underlying English accent, but the character's realize early on that he's not your average gentle old man. Adding to the sickly feeling of uneasiness in the film is the sharp cinematography of Sean Porter. The whole movie has a dim, overcast feel evocative of the rainy northwest (whether that was a decision or just a result of filming in Oregon, I don't know but it works) and, of course, the movie has a greenish hue due in part to the use of fluorescent lighting in the bar and the rich greens of the surrounding Oregon forest. It works in conjunction with the film's grimy characters and bloody violence to give GREEN ROOM the nightmarish quality it needs to put your in the minds of these innocent punks who've been dumped in the worst case scenario and might not live to see the sunrise."
"siderite","8","1","4","28 May 2017"," Filled with tension to the end
","I liked the movie. I didn't feel the awe that so many of the reviewers reported, but the direction was spot on and the acting, too. One of my few complaints is that the film was too dark, in the way that it was hard to see what was going on. It was realistically dark, but a bit annoying. The second is that it was a bit slow; perhaps I was spoiled by non stop action flicks there, though.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around this hard punk rock band that has a gig in a skinhead joint and they witness a murder. Trying to cover it up (and their heroin operation and whatever they were doing down there) the owner is attempting not only to murder the young people, but also to stage it in a believable way for the police.<br/><br/>It was interesting in the sense that it felt very real. The situations, ironically, felt weird because no one was good at what they were trying to do. These were hard neonazi backwater hillbillies, but they weren't proficient at killing, they were afraid, they made mistakes. The members of the band were trying to survive, but didn't take the logical solution or even the hysterical ""let me out of here!"" cliché that is so overused in thrillers, but had more human reactions that endeared them to the viewer.<br/><br/>The scene in the end describes Saulnier's vision to the dot: ""This is a nightmare"", says a member of the band, ""For us all"", replies the leader of the bad guys. The ending is neither happy, nor hopeless, just ugly, dirty, leaving you with the same feeling the characters in the film, including the dog, had ""why did this had to happen at all?""."

I like to think that I've seen it all when it comes to gore in films but The Green Room did have me wincing in some parts at how vile some of the injury detail is. You do feel tense for the characters involved in this film as it doesn't portray humans as indestructible, and the details of the effects of gunshot and knife wounds is very visceral.<br/><br/>It was good to see Patrick Stewart in something completely different to his usual roles but I don't think he lived up to his potential, though this was probably down to how his character was written.<br/><br/>Ultimately I didn't feel satisfied with the ending and thought it left too many loose ends."

","""Things have gone south, no doubt. But you know if you don't hand over that gun, it won't end well.""<br/><br/>The advantage of watching a movie without any knowledge or awareness of what it's about initially, is that sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised. And that's what ""Green Room"" did. It surprised me. Either way, I thought it was already interesting because it was about the members of an obscure punk band called ""The Ain't Rights"". They travel across the U.S in a shabby looking Minivan, going from gig to gig. It's not exactly the comfortable life as that of a successful, richly paid rock-band. On the contrary. They look like undernourished, sleazy-looking bohemians. They don't even have enough money to buy fuel, so they can move on. I admit it. I envied this group of carefree teenagers whose favorite pastime is to produce raw, anarchic music. Spontaneously memories of such a rebellious life in a distant past started to flash through my mind. Yep, I was a little biased from the start.<br/><br/>When Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole) and Tiger (Callum Turner) decide to accept one more gig, so they can earn some money, they didn't realize they would end up in a hornet's nest. The location where they have to perform is situated somewhere in a secluded forest with some bleak-looking shacks standing around. It appears to be a sort of camp for the local skinheads. After their concert, which they began with a passionate tribute to the Dead Kennedys by playing one of their classics ""Nazi Punks F*ck Off"", they are witnesses of a bloody crime. Somewhat later you see them barricading themselves in their dressing room, trying to negotiate with Darcy (Patrick Stewart) for a safe passage. Darcy seems to be the man who's running the place. As a result, a brutal fight starts with the elite troops of the skinheads (fearless gang members with red laces) who use all kinds of resources.<br/><br/>At first, I was expecting some sort of documentary-like film about the punk scene. However, when it slowly changed into a slasher and the first bloody confrontations was a fact, my enthusiasm was awakened. What's presented here, is pure aggression in its most explicit form. You'll get fury and brutality of an unprecedented nature. The ruthlessness with which the neo-Nazis try to eliminate the band, is fairly confrontational. Nothing is shown in veiled form. Violence hits you unmercifully like a sledgehammer. But not only the violence is explicit. Also the intensity and the rising tension in those claustrophobic rooms is at times unbearable. The overall setting in which the story takes place contributes to this for most part. Those dark corridors and dingy rooms. And the fact that both parties have no idea how to resolve the situation, just makes it even more interesting.<br/><br/>Biggest surprise for me was seeing Patrick Stewart as the charismatic leader of this subversive gang. He's better known as the more reserved and dutiful Captain Jean-Luc Picard. It felt a little weird to see him parading around as a kind of xenophobe who gives cold-blooded murderous orders to these far-right sympathizers. Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots tried to fight back in a fearsome manner. Both of them appeared already together in ""Fright Night"". But I'll always remember Yelchin as ""Odd Thomas"". He managed to survive in ""Green Room"". In real life however, he ran out of luck. His Jeep ,which was parked on a hill, struck him, because he left it in neutral.

I mean the story is what you'd expect from such film, and the basic formula is similar, but the way they presented and flowed it was somewhat refreshing. The flow of the movie was its defining part for me. It felt natural, giving the situation a realistic feel and creating an ever present feel of tension when things go down. <br/><br/>The movie wasn't super violent or gore-y just for the sake of it either. It was a bit tamed, and the way violence was presented made you feel uneasy, like it should.

The film is about a heavy metal band that is on tour trying to promote their image. Right away these people aren't really that likable. They are seen siphoning gas within the first ten minutes and immediately I was angry at these people. As we follow these characters along, they travel to play at a rather underground bar. After their set they find that one of the other bands members before them was murdered in cold blood. As a means of protecting themselves the bars staff traps the witnesses in a room.<br/><br/>Obviously things go south and a lot of people die. This movie reminded me of 'The Raid' as I watched it. Not because there is kung fu in it or anything, but because you really have no clue who is going to live or die. Putting everyone on the chopping block really lets you experience this movie as best as you can.<br/><br/>It created very real tension that carried through out the entire film. To make it even more believable, the action is incredibly gritty. Machetes get involved, guns, box cutters, fire extinguishers, the whole deal. If something could be used as a weapon it was. This really grounded the movie in reality despite is surreal premise.<br/><br/>It also helped that many of the actors are fairly unknown. Of course there's the girl from 'Arrested Development' and a couple guys from 'Star Trek' but other than that, it was mainly people I didn't recognize. I know this is a weird thing to bring up but it helped me further believe that this could happen to people without anyone's knowledge.<br/><br/>However, the movie has a hard time getting all this going. The first half in general has a really hard time getting going. Hardly anything happens during that initial forty five minutes and there really isn't any characters to get invested in. So when a bunch of people you don't know much about do nothing for an hour, it can really test ones patience. <br/><br/>In that first half there wasn't hardly anything that was impressive. You might call it build up to the bloody finale but I call it boring nothing. If that initial forty five minutes was cut in half there wouldn't be any problem. Whats even more disappointing was even in the best moments this movie had failures. Even when the blood is coating the walls, things got a bit tedious.<br/><br/>Mainly because it gets so repetitive. They charge out of their room, people die, and they retreat back. This happens over and over again until the film ends. Of course the tension and grittiness carries us through these scenes but when things get that repetitive than it becomes more and more easy to notice other shortcomings.<br/><br/>So far this movie is on the better end of horror movies for 2016. It's real, raw, and incredibly tense. Throw in a couple great performances and what you should've had is a great movie. But due to an overlong and dull opening half plus a repetitive second half things can get rather stale. If you're a horror fan, this movie will be a lot of fun to watch. If not than don't bother with 'Green Room'."

The characters and the combination between suspense and action was just right for me. Its not quite a 'who done it', but at the same time never got old. I felt drawn in to the story and couldn't help but visit the 'what if that was me' part of my brain.

","Great atmosphere, and practical effects. The entire movie leaves you guessing and stressing out on what happens next. You are constantly in a state of blissful confusion. Also a movie who is as ""ballzy"" as Game of Thrones with the killing off of characters deserves some credit. However, the end sucked!!!!!! Barely any answers to your questions are given.

"Wizard-8","Null","1","5","22 July 2016"," Competent retelling of a reliable formula
","For some reason, the basic plot of ""Green Room"" - innocent individuals finding themselves holed up in a confined space while a great menace is right outside trying to wipe them out - is one that I personally find both irresistible and open to be told in many different ways. It's been done from westerns (""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Rio Bravo"") to horror movies (""Dog Soldiers""). Although ""Green Room"" doesn't really try to bring in a new genre to this old reliable formula, it is a competent retelling overall. The bad guys are vicious and hateful, the good guys are pretty sympathetic, there is some effective brutal violence, it's never dull, and the movie looks pretty good for a low budget exercise.<br/><br/>Are there any problems along the way? Yes, several, problems that I think hold back the movie from being great and instead make it simply good. One problem is that the movie takes quite a long time to really get going - half the movie, if I recall greatly. Also, the final confrontation with Patrick Stewart's character is kind of a letdown; I expected something a lot more charged up. But the movie, despite problems such as these, shouldn't discourage any viewers who enjoy this formula as much as I do."

","It's a review: it may contain nuts, I mean spoilers. Green Room: a film where a decent enough punk band run up against some very nasty Nazis. It starts off interesting, you warm to the band as we learn about their characters, they play some punk music - the high point of the film being their rendition of Nazi Punks F...Off by the Dead Kennedys in front of a nazi skinhead audience. Though the film surprises us when their music actually goes down pretty well. And then things go wrong. There is some good one room tension in the next act of the film - it works great but beyond that this film will appeal if you really, really don't like punk bands or really, really like to see young people chewed up by vicious animals. The acting is great, faultless in fact. But it's a shame that the second half doesn't match the first unless you really, really don't like punk bands or really, really...Of course I may be missing something here in which case see it for yourself."

","From that moment until the end, it's a disturbing and suspenseful movie, with the most captivating and intriguing plot of the year. This film has moments where I was almost unable to see some things ... How cool is that?! This disgusting type of suspense is so well placed in the movie because it needed to be like that, so it turned out to be a really amazing achievement in directing.<br/><br/>For the first time ever, not caring about the characters wasn't a problem for me. The band's members are really stupid, they are that cliché-type of innocent people doing the dumbest things possible. You don't want the whole band to be murdered in cold blood, but you don't really root for anyone. The director already assumed that he's doing an ""inept protagonist"" series, where the main actors portray stupid people that make bad decisions and they will have to suffer the consequences. Not sure if I should feel disappointing or just OK with it.<br/><br/>The continuous suspense kept me on edge all the time and that is also due to two amazing performances: Patrick Stewart as Darcy and Anton Yelchin as Pat are really great. Now, I have a problem with Patrick Stewart and with the time that his character has in the movie: he's not well utilized, he doesn't have THE scene where I'd be so fascinated that I'd re-watch it a thousand times. He is so intriguing and so captivating that I just wish I could have seen more from him. Also, the mystery throughout the movie (""red laces"") and the constant twists increase the suspense so much that keeps me on my toes until the end.<br/><br/>Green Room is a great film, it's suspenseful, has great performances, but it could have had smarter (or not that dumb) protagonists and it should have had more of Patrick Stewart's character.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

"NonSequiturL","7","1","7","24 May 2016"," Horror will always be punk rock!
","Recently, director Guillermo Del Toro wrote a series of passionate tweets praising his contemporary John Carpenter, and lamented his relative lack of success when taking into account his incredible talent and catalog of classic directorial efforts. Del Toro capped off the tweet-storm with the proclamation that, ""Horror will always be punk rock!"" While I'm more of a heavy metal person, I agree with the sentiment. The best horror will always exist on that line just outside the mainstream, in realms that the ""normal folk"" don't want to tread.<br/><br/>Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is literally one of those punk rock-type films that Del Toro is talking about, and appropriately follows a young punk rock band in their attempt to scrape up a living with their musical talents. They're playing in seedy bars and living in their van when they manage to secure a gig at a secluded venue owned and frequented by white supremacists. Things go way downhill when they witness a murder and become trapped in the titular green room by some very nasty individuals.<br/><br/>While the plot and tone are reminiscent of certain chainsaw massacres and their ilk, the punk rock aesthetic lends an air of originality, and the dark, grimy tone is set early and successfully in the piece. It's clear that this movie refuses to pull any punches. The violence is graphic and unflinching, bringing to mind the style of grue that was so popular in the French new wave of the 2000's. This is what real horror fans have come to see. None of that PG-13 bullshit. We're here for the flesh being torn, busted bones hanging limply, and screams of pain and terror. On those accounts, Green Room delivers, but at the same time doesn't become gratuitous. Although the folks seated a few rows across from us who walked out presumably wouldn't agree.<br/><br/>There's a realism to the approach taken by Jeremy Saulnier, who also directed 2013's fantastic Blue Ruin with similar flair. It's filmed in a somewhat documentary-style, with great use of shadow and uneasy color tones. The soundtrack is authentically punk, underscoring the on screen mayhem with an appropriate aural backing.<br/><br/>The cast is likable and feel genuine, and we're quickly on board with them through their trial. Macon Blair (who also starred in Blue Ruin) is of particular note, and Patrick Stewart's turn as a calm, collected neo-nazi is very fun - although I was left wanting a little more.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, it feels as though there is a rush toward the end. The first half is wrought with tension, but the second half sadly loses its rhythm, and the ending feels anticlimactic. After the fantastic setup, it's a shame the story takes the direction it does, and saddles the characters - particularly the villains - with some questionable actions and decisions. Things unravel too quickly. Far more could have been done with the toys the filmmakers had to play with here.<br/><br/>Even if I wasn't entirely convinced by the way it ended, I appreciate what was achieved with Green Room. I love Saulnier's style, and the atmosphere he wrings from his work is unique and filled with dread. I also love the gore effects, which appear to be almost entirely executed via traditional, practical methods. While perhaps not as strong as Blue Ruin, this film is refreshing in its ability to make us squirm and wince. With a little more work, this could have been a real classic, but as it stands, it's a solid, visceral horror/thriller with a novel setting and I can't wait to see what nastiness Saulnier drags us into next."
"jdesando","Null","1","7","26 April 2016"," Enjoyable thriller, horror, and comedy in one cool package.
","Punk rock bands like the one in Green Room frequently spout hoary lyrics, but this band witnesses a murder that pits them against skinheads who fulfill the expectations of the most violent lyrics. Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier helms this one so deftly that I would like to call it a smart comic thriller if it weren't for the horrible images cropping up at the right times.<br/><br/>Similar to the other intelligent horror flick recently, 10 Cloverfield Lane, it's about young adults, this time in a punk rock group, headed by Pat (Anton Yelchin), fighting experienced villains (John Goodman in 10, Patrick Stewart as Darcy in Green) and while the formula dictates that the youngsters, in reduced numbers, overcome the oldsters, this version takes many turns before it gives in to the dictates of the genre. The vibe is '80's horror- thriller with Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs an appropriate comparison.<br/><br/>The languid set up, where we see the band hopping from one low-paying gig to another with a charming sense of humor, sets a right tone of fecklessness that leads to the danger of an exclusive metal club in Oregon catering to straight white-male supremacists manufacturing maybe heroin in their basement. Enter the head honcho, Darcy, as cool as a starship captain, and as indifferent to violence as only a man who has others do his dirty work can. Although things get more violent in dealing with the resourceful youngsters, he remains cool: ""Forensics is no longer a concern,"" he says after planning a flawless scene for the cops that has turned bad for his team.<br/><br/>The intelligence of the panicked punkers and the menace of the skinheads help to keep us attentive at all times to see what happens next. Although some expectations are met, there are enough plot twists to keep us thrilled and to make sense, unlike so many slasher, violence-induced films. Here, the band really has to play in tune, so to speak, facing mounting horrors such as a mangled arm and gruesome jugular feast by the teeth of an attack dog.<br/><br/>Just as in an allegorical way, most peaceful nations are dragged into violence because there are no alternatives, the band resorts to gruesome violence as the only answer to the carnage meted out by their captives. I like the realistic, albeit violent, way the plot progresses. Well, it has to be so or we get no horror, and I get no vicarious thrill out of being unharmed. Except maybe psychologically.<br/><br/>""Later is better for time of death,"" says Darcy. <br/><br/>Now that's terrifyingly cool."

","A broke punk band travels in its van across the country to meet with some promoter who will interview them and set them up with a gig. They think he's legit but of course things don't pan out and they end up playing at a Mexican restaurant for a few bucks. But he offers to make it up to them. He calls a cousin of his and he schedules them for a gig at a skinhead event. Why punks would play at skinhead event? Who knows. But the agree and off they go to some place out in the woods.<br/><br/>One of them comes up with a very punk idea--to start the gig with an anti-Nazi song. Of course it's not appreciated by the skinheads. But the rest of their set is appreciated by the audience. As our band is about to leave, one of them realizes she left her phone in the green room. Another guy offers to pick it up. As he opens the door, he finds a bunch of skinheads and dead girl on the floor with a knife somehow stuck in her skull.<br/><br/>He tries to leave but obviously now no one is leaving. He barely manages to call 911. They are rushed into the green room with a big skinhead guarding them and a girl skinhead friend of the dead one. What follows is a long back and forth negotiation. We meet a couple of skinheads--their leader, a guy in charge of the dogs, one in charge of the music. The leader decides to call 911, he gets some young skinheads to stab themselves for the arriving cops. Now the cops are gone. Our punks were just waiting for the cops the resolve the situation. Now they are back to negotiating with the skinheads.<br/><br/>Eventually some violence erupts which forces the punks or what's left of them to return again and again to the green room to strategize how to escape and get revenge.<br/><br/>Green Room threatens to be yet another minimalist low budget thriller of a group of people stuck in a room screaming at each other for hours. Fortunately, it manages to transcend that formula and give us a bit more. Just not enough though. The punks are for the most part not very relevant. And actually most of them aren't even committed punks, only one of them is. The skinheads too aren't particularly well defined. As others have mentioned, audio recording is terrible. While the punks aren't particularly interesting, the skinhead leadership actually is interesting but you can't understand most of what they say.<br/><br/>While there are some thrills in this movie, there aren't enough given the setting. This movie should have been much stronger. But it would have required better characters, more settings, and more action. Green Room is overly restrained. You expect all hell to break loose at any moment, a moment that never comes. That creates some tension no doubt but it doesn't last. But they did get something very right, and that is the music. Most movies that have metal/extreme music has a theme fail miserably in that area. Green Room doesn't. You just wish it would have gotten the rest as right."
"rooee","6","1","8","29 April 2016"," Mean green Nazi machine
","Anton Yelchin plays Pat, the soft-spoken guitarist for a punk band called The Ain't Rights. They're on a half-baked tour when they get a gig in a Portland bar run by fascists. They play a confrontational set, before discovering a dead body in the green room. They're detained, along with local girl Amber (Imogen Poots). When the owner (Patrick Stewart) comes to dispense with them, the band barricade themselves in the green room. Negotiations fail, the Rottweilers come out, and so begins the worst aftershow party ever.<br/><br/>It's a twist on the backwoods redneck schtick we've seen a million times before, though the setting is undoubtedly bold. If Blue Ruin was Jeremy Saulnier's Coen Brothers calling card, here he's gone full Assault on Precinct 13-era John Carpenter. Or you could replace neo-Nazis with zombies and you've got Night of the Living Dead. <br/><br/>It's beautifully directed and edited, and often heart-poundingly tense. The air of sombreness; the doom-laden dark ambient score; the saturated palette – it all combines to supposedly lend the narrative some kind of weight. But this is a B-movie in art-house clothing. <br/><br/>There is humour but it's subtle, buried under the virtually impenetrable dialogue. Saulnier is sadly unwilling to run with the high concept, resulting in some convoluted and not-very-engaging dramatics among the skinheads.<br/><br/>Poots is miscast as Amber (she never convinces), although I quite enjoyed Yelchin's high-anxiety performance in the lead. Predictably, however, it's Stewart who steals the show. His drawling Darcy is a man of quiet menace: a far more frightening and believable fascist than we usually see on screen. <br/><br/>The Ain't Rights are an awkward bunch. I'm guessing Saulnier's intention was to portray protagonists who are gradually drained of their humanity as the film wears on. But they're quite unlikeable in the first place, so by the time the ironic final shot comes along, the punchline doesn't land. At a push there's the hint of some underlying theme about the plight of the modern liberal left, feeling beset on all sides by right-wing reactionary madness. But the troupe isn't developed enough as a set of characters to be certain. <br/><br/>Then there is the violence: the threat of it and the unflinching depiction of it. There's some extreme body horror bloodiness early on – limbs and throats and guts – which appears to foreshadow a truly Grand Guignol finale; but soon the guns are out and the inventiveness flags and it never arrives.<br/><br/>Green Room is a decent enough stab at a remix on the siege sub-genre. At around 90 minutes it's lean, mean, and ruthlessly efficient. Just don't expect LOLs or depth or a whole bunch of surprises."

","Green Room<br/><br/>Written and Directed by Jeremy Saulnier, a person I've never heard of. So don't feel bad if you haven't either. Green Room is about a heavy rock band who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Witnesses something they shouldn't and now a game of cat and mouse is underway.<br/><br/>Pat, played by the late Anton Yelchin, plays the main character, the bassist for the band and nominated leader of the band once every moment becomes a fight to survive. He plays the part well and has a little arc from the writing stance. I wish he had more emotion though.<br/><br/>The antagonist of the movie is Darcy played by Patrick Stewart. It was hard to see Star Trek's Jean-Luc Picard play this sort of character. That being said after his introduction, since Patrick Stewart is such a talent, I completely forgot that he was JLP. <br/><br/>Another person of note was Imogen Poots, who plays Amber. The only movie I remember her in was Need for Speed. Yes, I remember that film. She did a wonderful job as a female supporting actress for Anton Yelchin. Her role in the movie isn't seemingly important, but becomes more so as the movie progresses. Her character was better written.<br/><br/>Verdict: I would watch this a second time, and recommend it to anyone who loves suspense and a good story."
"asda-man","7","1","9","16 May 2016"," Didn't make me green with sickness or envy
","Don't you hate it when you get yourself hyped up for a film and it lets you down? Green Room has everything I love in a film: A fight for survival, intensity and psychopaths. Horror fans and critics were building it up with stories about people walking out the cinema vomiting and calling it one of the most intense films ever , but I wholeheartedly disagree. Don't get me wrong Green Room is a good film but it's no where near as amazing as people are making it out to be. As an avid fan of home invasion and survive the night kind of horror, I think there are much better examples of this kind of film out there and whilst Green Room is a solid thriller it really doesn't bring anything new to the table. <br/><br/>My biggest gripe is how forgettable the characters are. Likable characters and character development are essential for slasher films like this. If you like the characters then chances are that you'll be invested in the film. However, I didn't really care about any of these characters and they all felt pretty lifeless. Even the potentially fascinating neo-Nazi villains were wasted, with no characters really being explored. Green Room set itself up for a Eden Lake standard character-driven ride, but failed to deliver its full potential.<br/><br/>Another thing that irritated me was the acting. Everyone seemed to be acting very odd with lines being mumbled to a barely audible level and no one really being that bothered about murderous Nazis being outside the door. I don't think this is the fault of the actors though, I get the feeling that this is the style of acting the director was going for but for me it didn't work. Even Patrick Stewart sleep-walked his way through the film failing to be the menacing kingpin he could've been. I don't think anyone's going to be winning any awards here.<br/><br/>This all makes it sound like I hated the film, but I did actually like most of it. I liked the slow build-up of the group ending up in the scary fascist bar and how situations slowly and realistically built up to a life or death situation. When the crazy violence does begin the film never becomes boring despite being set in one location, although it's still never as intense as it could've been. It is very thought-provoking though and leaves you wondering about what you'd do in their situation. I also loved the dark grungy atmosphere which really added to the hellish situation the group are in.<br/><br/>There are some brilliantly tense scenes, especially towards the end with a couple of nail-biting showdowns which are really well done and but I was expecting more. The way it was hyped, I thought it was going to be the same level of intensity as Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's French horror, Inside! However, some of the film is poorly directed with low lighting, frantic camera- work and fast editing so it's often difficult to make out what's going on which takes you out of the film and makes it uninvolving. At some points I found it hard to tell which characters' had died. I also don't quite understand why people are vomiting from the violence. Whilst there are some nasty moments I never found it overly gory, but then again I am very desensitized now. <br/><br/>I know it sounds like I hated every minute but if you take away the hype it is a good little thriller and I just want to warn over- excited people (like I was) that it isn't the ground- breaking horror film they think it's going to be. Films like You're Next and the recent 10 Cloverfield Lane are more intense and better made than this one."
"futuredwight2007","7","1","11","26 April 2016"," ""Green Room"" is a technical marvel, beyond brutal, and underwhelming in the wrong places...
","Jeremy Saulnier's ""Green Room"" is a step in the right direction; A modernized slasher film that we deserve, but one that feels unrefined. We follow a hardcore punk rock band that, after witnessing a murder, is forced by a group of skinheads to stay in a green room. As tensions and the need to escape intensify, so too does the violence and brutality.<br/><br/>On a technical side, the film is an aesthetically pleasing horror/thriller. Cinematographer Sean Porter has captured the pure grit and grunge of backwoods Oregon, along with the visual beauty of the modern punk rock movement. The atmosphere and mise-en-scene of this film so eloquently move along, which leaves the audience on the edge of their seat, wanting more.<br/><br/>Everything else is wasted potential. Most of the film is not boring, but the patterns of what we expect to happen next become apparent. The ""good guys"" plan an escape, and they are met with disturbing and brutal violence in their wake. The violence is stunning, but it's not enough to care. The characters are all just archetypes and portraits of what I would expect from a Texas Chainsaw sequel. The good guys are ""good guys"" because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The bad guys are ""bad guys"" because they are Neo- Nazis, which is enough justification to do what they do.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, because of these simplistic archetypes, I don't care enough for the consequences of anyone, protagonists or antagonists. Nor do they seem to care at points. The threat of death, or of this venue being discovered by the police, is apparent, and yet, no one takes them seriously. I have no problems with simplistic characters or motivations, but with how complex the film presents itself, it left me wanting more. A good example of the slasher archetypes done right, in recent memory, is ""Cabin in the Woods,"" which blends humor, gore, terror, and a level of meta-filmmaking that is complex and great. ""Green Room"" didn't need to be this, but it needed more complicated characters to root for.<br/><br/>The cast did fine, including a sub-par Patrick Stewart. Saulnier's previous film, ""Blue Ruin"" comes highly recommend over this more recent effort. Overall, this film didn't have any message to take away. The only thematic take-away I have is a line from one of the band members calling out a skinhead, saying, ""You were much scarier at night."" The theme here being that there really are monsters in the dark. But that's it. A patterned story about a band trying to escape from a concert hall is a fun idea, presented at a very high level of technical prowess, which thankfully brings a level of professionalism to the slasher genre. However, like the slasher genre, I don't care for the mix of eccentric and bland ""good guys,"" and unlike the slasher genre, I don't care for the bland and predictable villains. I would give ""Green Room"" a 6/10."

","A down-on-their-luck punk band find themselves trapped in a neo-nazi bar after a last minute gig goes horribly wrong. The movie takes its time initially, establishing a real sense of place and atmosphere. We never really get to know our cast of characters all too well, but character complexity is traded for situational complexity. There is more going on under the hood of this film than initially meets the eye and we unearth its insidious machinations alongside our earnest, yet occasionally dimwitted heroes. About halfway through the runtime, things take a turn for the worse. Green Room isn't kidding around. The tension is unrelenting and the violence is extreme yet realistic in its depiction...which only makes it harder to witness.<br/><br/>I consider myself a fan of the horror genre and I wouldn't really consider Green Room to be a horror movie...yet I certainly had difficulty watching some moments. Overall, the movie is brutally nihilistic in execution. It hammers the audience with waves of sickly anxiety, dead serious, brutal, and single-minded in its aims. But then, at the last second, it hits the audience with an unexpected laugh out loud joke and cuts to the credits. It's certainly a ride that's not for everyone. Some movies lose impact and relevance with age, Green Room is NOT one of those movies. The longer it's around, the more layers it gains.<br/><br/>Several months after Green Room's release in the states, the star of the film, Aton Yelchin was tragically killed in a freak accident. Couple this sad circumstance with the reality that we exist in a time when neo-nazi's openly march in the streets and the president of the united states has white supremacist ties and, well, Green Room packs quite the incidental punch in addition to it's intentional ones. A character's ignorance early in the film about the political leanings of white-supremacists has dire consequences. He's not sure what they are, he thinks they're either far right or far left but he doesn't know and doesn't care. His perspective matches that of many people today, the film through this lens acting as a vinegar rebuke to willful political ignorance. Current revelations about sexual abuse or poor treatment of workers in the entertainment industry adds further relevance to Green Room's central point of conflict. When spending money on music, movies, or products in general; we aren't thinking of the views of those BEHIND the music, movies, or products. But if we ended up being the ones victimized by said people, our consumption habits would change in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>The punk band doesn't share the views of the skinheads at the dive they're playing, they take a big gamble by making a huge point of it. But they do intend to profit from them, this choice has consequences. There are characters who are trying to get out of the white supremacist group altogether and one who wants to stay in the community because she likes the music but, in her own words, isn't a neo-nazi. Green Room is cut and dry with it's messaging. Once you're implicit in evil, no matter how far removed from it you think you are, it's going to catch up with you in the end. It's terrifying, it's disgusting, it's riveting, and (for the right audience) it's utterly worth watching.<br/><br/>So, should you see Green Room? If a nail-biting thriller with realistic gore, razor barbed social commentary, and a haunting Patrick Stewart; all marinated in a grimy punk rock/hardcore music needle-bath sounds like a roller coaster tailor-made for your particular brand of weird. Then yes, sit on down next to me and please keep arms and legs inside the ride vehicle at all times.<br/><br/>-Josh Evans"

In fact, not only was I able to get past these scenes and continue enjoying the movie, my biggest criticism turns out to be trying to end the movie with a joke that just doesn't land instead of with ""the orchard"" scene just a moment earlier that almost screams ""fade to black and roll the credits now"".<br/><br/>If you can tolerate some very poor medical knowledge, a repeated ""try using that thing right there"" blunder, and magic dogs, Green Room is one of the better suspense films and worth watching."

Hardcore and ruthless; this flick will keep you guessing. The writers really delivered a gem. A raw dialogue with cunning discourse, the cast seemed tailored for such a script.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart gives us an in-depth look into his range and versatility, and as usual, does not disappoint.

"nfleming-12317","8","0","1","21 May 2020"," Bleak, violent survival film
","Green Room is a film that you have to be in the right mood to watch. It is relentlessly violent and incredibly accurate at depicting neo-nazi gangs. Jeremy Saulnier directed it and its definitely well made. The ariel shots early on are beautiful, and contrast with the claustrophobic setting that most of the film takes place in. The setup to get to the survival premise is kind of forced, and it seems as though some scenes are improvised (poorly). Also, the characters aren't developed at all. I obviously root against the Nazis, but thats because these characters are so vile, not because the ""heroes"" are interesting. All of that aside, this is a great survival movie. No one side has the upper hand at any point throughout the film, leading to tense moments. Be warned, however, the violence is intense. I've seen many a violent film, but the grittiness and realism of this movie is unlike most movies that try to be shocking. This movie doesn't try to be shocking at all, it is a simple survival movie that contains brutal violence. Recommend to anyone who enjoys, well, this movie isn't enjoyable at all, except Patrick Stewart as a neo-nazi is a fascinating performance, and almost bizzare considering I only really know him as Picard. Anyway, 8/10, it accomplished its goal of being a great survival film, but theres no character development, just a crazy situation.<br/><br/>RIP Anton Yelchin"

"jsalinas-22364","8","0","2","29 December 2019"," Not for everyone in more reasons than one, but quite satisfactory for those willing to see it
","Let me just start off by saying: this movie has a REALLY cool premise. A punk rock band trapped in a bar fighting off neo-Nazis? Hell yeah? Intrigued me the moment I heard about it. And the end result was one hell of thrill ride full of great performances, brutal violence, and plenty of tension.<br/><br/>All of the acting is spot-on. Nearly every character in the film is surprisingly charismatic, even the bad guys and they're damn neo-Nazis! However, that detail is justified by Patrick Stewart's chillingly amiable performance as Darcy, an elderly man who, despite his nonthreatening name and grandfatherly appearance, is hiding dark secrets of his own and plenty of complex plans that even I don't fully understand even after seeing the movie. Special shoutout also goes to the band members, especially Anton Yelchin. May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why the movie is considered a horror flick; it's really more of a thriller because of its slow tension, as I've noticed most A24 horror and thriller flicks often have. However, the movie most likely earns its certification as a horror movie because of its abrupt flashes of gruesome violence. And I mean it when I say ""gruesome"". The violence here isn't over-the-top, gratuitous, and unworthy of sympathy like the Saw movies for example. No, the violence in this movie is graphic, often hard to look at it, and unexpected, and there was one particular moment that nearly made me stop watching the movie entirely.<br/><br/>The only main flaw I could find in this movie is that sometimes it feels like it can't balance itself between complex and simple. When it's too complex, the mystery elements lose effect or don't become interesting, resulting in the movie feeling slow at times. When it's too simple, some characters might make really dumb decisions, once again slowing the movie down a bit because you might be left wondering ""Why did they say/do that?"". This can be occasionally frustrating at times, especially since, as mentioned before, this movie has a very charismatic cast.<br/><br/>In conclusion: this movie is supported by an intriguing premise, talented cast, and tension throughout; however, viewers without a stomach for graphic violence or slightly uneven pacing should take caution when watching this."

","God, this movie has been sitting on my watchlist for ages. The idea for it always sounded interesting, so I decided to finally give it a watch and holy crap, it blew me away. This movie doesn't feel slow. A lot of the movie is character's just sitting around and yet it feels so high stakes. I watched this movie before shortly after realizing Anton Yelchin passed away. This movie has charm in a sense. It's a movie I could see myself watching every couple years. My only complaints with the movie are from a technical standpoint mainly. The main problem is some of the dialogue is ""mumbled"" making it hard to hear. My only other complaint is that realistically, none of the character's have a backstory. However I give props to the film makers for making them seem memorable and like they had a reason to be there. Green Room is a great film. The only reason I don't give it any higher then an 8 is that they don't explore things that they easily could have.

I'm not exactly sure what else to compare it to, and I've watched everything from nature documentaries to ""chick flicks"" to horror franchises. ""Green Room"" starts rolling from the start, steadily builds up steam, doesn't take any easy ways out with the plot, and doesn't overstay it's welcome with too long a run time. Patrick Stewart though really seemed to be slumming and only in for the paycheck, since his performance wasn't particularly compelling versus the rest of the cast, yet he probably got paid as much as all of the others put together.

I expected something full of adrenaline, violence, and tension, but nahh... Whenever movie get's close to doing something like that, realism kicks in and ruin's it. For instance, there's a scene where the crowds is going wild while the band plays their song, and the movie cut's out the music. You start thinking the movie will start delving into the mind of neo nazi movement, but movie throws it out the windows few minutes later. It is never explored as a theme, it's just there. We are neo nazis. We are bad. We do bad stuff. Then it shifts to a thriller. Then when you think horror will kick in, it doesn't. There is never that sense of dread or feeling helpless while following the story of our heroes. Not everything is bad though. There are some tense moments, and Patrick Stewart is in it, and he is doing pretty good job, and there are some cool ideas, but ultimately it fails to do anything really good. I'ts all over the place. Credits soundtrack is cool though. I would give somewhere in between 6-7 stars, but since I can't, I'll rather go with the 6. It's not bad or anything, but it just exists.

Can't have been too compelling a read - which is made even more surprising given the presence of Sir Patrick Stewart. He is one of the stronger parts of the film, but at times it seems like the film's content made him feel uncomfortable. He hesitates and just kind of mumbles whenever his character swears, and all violence perpetuated by his character is really, really held back. Nevertheless he is still fun to watch.<br/><br/>I really can't see myself watching it again, or any other films by the director for that matter - but for what it was worth, Green Room was over the top & pointless, but self-aware and just engaging enough to be worthy of a recommendation."

When nearly all of the band members had been chewed to death by the dogs, what was the point in watching the remainder of the film? I lost interest.

","'Green Room' matches the intensity and grimness of writer/director Jeremy Saulnier's breakout effort 'Blue Ruin', but lacks the soul that made that film so haunting and tragically poetic.<br/><br/>It stars the late Anton Yelchin in another low key, naturalistic performance alongside a cast of young character actors who really sell the authenticity of this world. It's grimy and dirty and frightening, and that's even before the violent mayhem starts. The atmosphere is dripping with bad vibes and simmering with an undercurrent of violence, and this feeling is mostly thanks to a convincing cast and some tautly engineered direction. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the cast is Patrick Stewart as the neo-nazi establishment owner who coldly calculates the demise of our main characters. Once you get past the fact that it is Sir Patrick (The Sci-fi Nerd King) breaking some bad, he really is quite chilling to watch.<br/><br/>The film has several disturbingly violent sequences that escalate with each new confrontation until a fairly scattershot climax and it mostly makes for a tense watch. However, because the characters aren't explored in any significant way it supplies us with only superficial thrills via the visceral nature of the violence depicted and the fact that we naturally prefer that the underwritten heavy metal rockers win out over the underwritten nutball Nazis who are trying to slay them. It's ultimately just a dirty indie remake of John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13', but it does a good job of living up to its heritage."

","Coming across a corpse backstage at their latest venue, a punk rock band are a locked in a small room by the white supremacists who own the venue in this independent thriller from 'Blue Ruin' director Jeremy Saulnier. As per 'Blue Ruin', this is a fairly good-looking film with bursts of memorably graphic (and yet never gratuitous) violence, however, the protagonists here are nowhere near as three dimensional as the main character in 'Blue Ruin' and it is sometimes hard to feel for their plight, especially as it was their choice to accept the Neo Nazi gig in the first place. Of course, this might be a deliberate theme: delve into the world of white supremacists and you are playing with fire, etc. The film gets most of its power though from the basic premise of being trapped deep inside a place and having to force one's way out, which becomes even more critical since the band (rather conveniently) play off the grid and have told no one about their latest gig, meaning that it is just up to the Neo Nazis to work out how to dispose of their corpses in non-suspicious ways. With Patrick Stewart well cast as the eerily soft-talking owner of the establishment, the film certainly scores some creepy segments and there is nary a boring moment to be had. Those expecting something as intense and emotionally devastating as 'Blue Ruin' may, however, be disappointed."

And by that I mean that there are some scenes that you can't imagine it would happen for real. When you are in danger you're not going to give away your weapons and stuff, that's just unrealistic. The acting is okay without being great. The story is okay without being great. It's just the music that is excellent. But yes there are way worse movies then this one, that's for sure."

","Didn't think I really needed to see the skinhead suspenser (yep, I damn well may have JUST NOW invented this oddball genre description) ""Green Room"". And perhaps I didn't. But now that I have, there are worse ways to while away an hour and a half of living.<br/><br/>Here's what I found worthwhile about the experience. It showcases the beauty of my stomping grounds, the stunning American Pacific Northwest. It features some cool punk rock AND Credence Clearwater Revival. And the mere presence of the great Patrick Stewart is more than enough to class up this, or any other, joint.<br/><br/>There are confusing scene sequences, unlikely plot developments and scads of interchangeable neo-Nazi dummkopfs proliferating throughout ""Green Room"". But so what? There are certainly enough scares and acts of mayhem going' on here to run a charge or two through most folks.<br/><br/>And if that's not enough to suit ya, then, in the lexicon of the prevailing mentality of the film, ""F--- it, man."""

","Plot story is great.Show human natural behavior is idiot and brainless and reckless and easy panicking. Teach us, is want to survive use brain instead muscle. Really man, OK back to the movie. After watching it, i summarize. This bunch of rocker group think safe and rock sang sound in front audience in far wilderness forest in drug lord warehouse(the band don't know). It is entertainment and heart pumping. One person from the band saw criminal murder on the scene and faster called cops but disrupt. After that, is all hell break lose. They stuck in a room close without mobile communication and any help. Lastly, i think this show not let me watch again and kind of waste of time. But still thrill see no brain people how to act to survive in this worse case scenario happened in case somebody else."

","""Green Room"" was a daring attempt to portray how things go from bad to worse for a touring punk rock band. They wind up playing at a venue for neo-Nazis, witness a murder, and then have to fight for their lives in order to escape. <br/><br/>The late Anton Yelchin was excellent as Pat, one of the group's guitar players. His supporting cast was also top-notch. The viewer will feel a sense of being trapped with no way out. All involved in this movie does a fine job of acting their roles without overdoing it. Patrick Stewart, however, seemed like a turd in a punch bowl-- completely out of place. There was nothing special about his role-- anyone could have played it. He did not come across cold-blooded, menacing, or threatening. I suppose those involved thought if we add another ""name,"" this will attract more viewers.<br/><br/>Now, you may be asking yourself why I did not rate it any higher than I did. One of many reasons was the script was a little confusing. Also, what happens to some of the characters (violence- wise) left me scratching my head. I understand (and have said this many times) in some movies you just have to throw caution to the wind, but some of the outcomes of the battles were just too much.<br/><br/>Rated ""R"" for graphic violence and language, ""Green Room"" isn't a bad movie, and I give it a minimal recommendation."

","One of the last films the late Anton Yelchin ever made,such a great talent. Green room is a great low budget film like for real this film looks like it was made with a 500 dollar budget but it has Patrick Stewart (professor x). The script must have been great because he said that after reading it he was terrified but he loved it, he is also the bad guy in this movie so it's different from his other roles like Picard the dude in the wheel chair and the mentally impaired Professor X in the enterprise. To me on paper this movie has a stupid premise, a band witnesses a murder and a bunch of Neo-Nazis won't allow them to leave. I mean this is a poor band who have to steal gas from other cars to get their van moving, all you have to do is pay them some money to shut up and they will cause they need money but no the Neo-Nazis are too stupid to think like that. As stupid as I think this movie is on paper it's really good on film. This movie is good but every movie has its flaws, it takes a while for some real action to happen in here but when stuff does happen it really happens if you get my drift but then some stuff happens that makes you question some characters especially those Nazis(fascist are stupid). This movie is really bleak like it's dark it has no lighting at all. This is a horror movie and what I like about it it's that you don't need a ghost or demon to scare someone, it's kinda scary but to me the high tensions are the highlights of this movie. It has retro violence and probably shot with an IPHONE making it the epitome of a do it yourself film. Anton Yelchin great performance it's a shame that he was close to blowing up and becoming a well known actor but it isn't just him the whole band did great their mostly unknown to everyone including me but they were great, the acting is phenomenal but this film is like the joint album between Future and Drake ""What a time to be alive"" it's good but it was too much for Drake he just couldn't keep up with Future and them fire ass beats, Drake felt out of his element, like in this film Drake just couldn't keep with them in his wheelchair. Wait. What I'm I talking about. Got sidetracked, this movie is probably one of the best movie of the year but at the same time it isn't because give credit to the fact that this film was shot in a warehouse and on the same tripod Kim Kardishan filmed her greatest film with the D list actor Ray J. But it ain't better then Star Wars. I know they not in the same league but you can't be the 2016 Toronto Raptors to their 2016 Golden State Warriors, I'm still hurting after that loss but if you figure out why Star Wars are the Warriors you the real MVP. I like how these guys saves money by not using lighting."

","From the director of 'Blue Ruin', yet another crime-thriller. This time it revolves around a rock band who trapped in the neo-nazi enclosure on the outskirt of the city. So how do they plan to get away from the green room they're locked in, and armed men are outside waiting for them to take down. The film filled with lots of tense moments and mostly unpredictable stuffs which is a one day event.<br/><br/>I was not surprised, I just expected something as smart as the director's previous film. He retained his favourite actor, Macon Blair to play an important role as their third collaboration in this multistarrer and he once again did well. This theme is not the first time explored, it is a well known, but the setting was very unique. All the actors were amazing, but truly very sad to hear the news about Anton Yelchin. He was a young and a wonderful actor and his '5 to 7' was my favourite.<br/><br/>At first, I thought the plot was so silly. I wondered why they did not use the excessive force as they're capable to tackle such situation. But that's the best part, because they threw away the cliché and approached for something new way to deal it. So the writer, I mean the director did great to carve a rare and thrilling film of the year.<br/><br/>There's no martial arts, criminal gang's collision or the cops fighting the bad guys; it was about how the normal people confront during a hostile situation in the real world. Blue and Green are done, now I'm waiting for the director to announce his next colour project.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I had no expectations for the director nor did i know what the movie was about. Watching the movie I got slowly excited about where it would lead but as it started to climax i felt underwhelmed and a little disjointed as a few scenes made Little confused on what was going on - wait aren't they the bad guys, hmm well who cares. it took a strange path near the end and didn't explain itself all that well. I would recommend watching this on a rainy day but I wouldn't go out of my way to see this in the cinema. Fair well to a good actor and if your a fan of Anton Yelchin you will enjoy his performance in this one as he plays the victim very well and holds his own in this average movie.."
"lukasheck","7","0","7","4 June 2016"," Starts furiously after a slow beginning, stops with a flimsical endling
","What I liked about the film: The film, if you go see it blind will definitively have a big surprise coming for you. It starts out as a (darker) road movie about a young punk band that is starting out and touring the East Coast of the United States. Through a chain of unfortunate events, the band has to play a gig at a neonazi-skinhead location to get the money they need for gas to carry on touring.<br/><br/>That is when the whole movie abruptly goes haywire: Suddenly, one of the band members sees something he is not supposed to see (a murdered corpse of a young woman) and suddenly, the band finds itself trapped inside the name-giving ""green- room"". That was the part that was most enjoyable for me, because it was the part that was most suspenseful, as the dialogue through the door with the club owner (played by Patrick Stewart, the only non-noname of the cast, at least to my knowledge) was increasingly aggressive and threatening. Things get complicated and over the course of the movie, like in a slasher film, one after the other, the band gets ""disensembled"". This was all very aprupt and felt very rushed. Before long, the film ends with some of the remaining characters able to escape and the ending – like the beginning – feels like somewhat of a drag and, in its conclusion, also very flimsy. Through the first half, however, I rate it 7/10."
