","OK this is going to be a bit long... but it will be good food for discussions.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is ""Hollywood"". The Plot line is predictable, but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thought-provoking, assuming you pay attention and didn't just rent it for the bang-bang, or a chance to see Demi in a wet T-shirt. Ridley make some mistakes, but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said, and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film, but I haven't seen to many, because she usually gets on my nerves. However, she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn't want to be a poster child for women's rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she's gonna have to wear that hat anyway.<br/><br/>Viggo is great too. I don't think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out, but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it, many can. This isn't about women's rights... this is about how men, mainly YOUNG men, relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties, emotionally and psychologically, then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young, dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too, once upon a time. Viggo is excellent, he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable, fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap, but think they know better. Pay attention, you can just see that he respects LT O'Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well, some people say over the top, they obviously haven't had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality, but remember, it is a movie, making a point, and being entertaining, things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I don't know if Mr. Scott has any military training, but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes, the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who's been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it's a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However, I'll give that one to Ridley, he's trying not to complicate the plot, and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men's emotions.<br/><br/>As for other Militray stuff, much of the language, feelings about chain of command, frustration with training constraints and political a**-covering was /On The Spot/. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer (some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing, but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world). Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible, but plausible. Remember, it is a movie, he's got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees, deep into their training cycle, with a buttload of prior experience (IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger, one a Marine, probably from RECON, these are guys who know the job already, and this is true to reality). You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right, this would be a Ranger mission, and the Spec-ops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the sea-side extraction point.<br/><br/>Quite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact, I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don't think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically, the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that's about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?<br/><br/>One last comment. I was at the Army Officer's Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's. The next day they weren't laughing... they just said ""you know what, that wasn't half bad."" That don't sound like much, but it's high praise from that group.<br/><br/>Probably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn't Hollywood enough for the lowest-common-denominator crowd.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film."
"SKG-2","8","84","112","22 February 1999"," Maybe Demi Moore does have what it takes
","I fully admit I am not the biggest Demi Moore fan in the world.  As a matter of fact, she's been in some of my least favorite movies of the decade (A FEW GOOD MEN, INDECENT PROPOSAL, THE SCARLET LETTER, THE JUROR, STRIPTEASE), and she really hasn't been good in any of those.  But she did win me over in this movie, because she lives up to her character's line, ""Look, I'm not trying to make any sort of statement here.""  And she isn't.  Instead of letting vanity get in the way, or injecting pathos, she lets her actions speak for her, just like her character does in trying to win acceptance as a SEAL.  The haircut scene is a good example; though it's directed with cinematic flourish, she does it matter-of-fact.<br/><br/>Moore's performance is one of the two performances that elevate this from your standard grunts-become-soldiers movie.  The other is the riveting Viggo Mortenson as the Master Chief, who's the drill instructor.  He doesn't play the role as a sadistic tyrant, but rather as a subtle manipulator who gradually recognizes Jordan O'Neill(Moore) is someone worth taking seriously.  He also avoids going for pathos.<br/><br/>The movie is best when it concentrates on the training.  Ironically, making just a standard grunts-become-soldiers movie makes its message work, because like O'Neill's superiors, we take her seriously because she becomes no different than anyone else.  The beginning is bad, and the climatic battle at the end is overblown, which weakens the movie.  Still, it's worth a look, and I maintain Moore was only given a Razzie Award for this movie and performance because of her past work, and the naysayers really weren't paying attention to her performance here."
"deliaj","5","82","112","7 August 2003"," Where I think this movie fails.
","G.I. Jane has some good points, good scenes, and (some)good acting. However, I saw its main point as trying to promote a ""can-do"" scenario for women in the military (I am a female veteran of 24 years) and I think several things in the movie do just the opposite.  If the idea, problem, or goal is to prove that women can succeed in a traditionally male career, task, or training, then that should be presented while maintaining the woman's gender.  What I mean is, O'Neil doesn't succeed until she shaves her head (shorter than the men's - and unnecessary), bulks up to the point where her body fat falls below normal and she ceases to menstruate, and generally becomes ""one of the boys.""  The point is, she's a woman, not a man.  She shouldn't have to become a man to prove she can succeed with a group of men. This is painfully clear when she screams ""Suck my dick,"" at the Sergeant. The obvious point is that, since she's a woman, she doesn't have one of those.  Nor should she need to metaphorically develop one in order to succeed.  Another point I'd like to make is that her dialogue as a prisoner of war was ridiculous.  The object is to survive.  If you don't, your mission has failed.  Taunting, bragging, and arguing with captors is a big NO-NO.  Her, ""I'm sorry, am I supposed to be afraid?"" line would have gotten her stripped naked and suspended under a water hose for hours.  There are no cadets that are tougher than the captors(instructors).  Bringing unhappy attention to oneself in that situation is inescapably stupid.  It is not tough.  Her worst line, though, is ""I'm going in."" CLICHE!!"
"Ghenghy","9","59","81","18 May 2002"," Worth a second look
","I ignored this on it's release and caught flashes of it during it's run on HBO, there were some exciting action sequences and amazing glimpses into the hell that SEAL training requires, but somehow I just couldnt put all the pieces together. It didnt make sense.....until now. I finally watched this movie in it's entirety last night and I am hooked. Whether the film misses the target on it's ""statement"" is not the point. It's just a good flick. Demi Moore pulls off the roll in convincing style and Viggo Mortenson has his best part as the Master Chief of the SEAL training unit. They have this crazy dynamic between themselves that finally unfolds at the ending, leaving you wishing for just a little more. Solid action film with a great support cast and a perfectly despicable villain played to the hilt by Anne Bancroft as a Senator who compromises GI Jane for her own political gain. Well, at least she tries. I think Demi Moore is one of the most underappreciated talents in recent memory. She has this unique combination of hardass determination and sensitivity that is rare. 9/10"
"coza_usa","Null","22","33","15 July 2003"," a surprisingly good Demi Moore movie
","Demi Moore gave a good performance to a role that suited her really well. I can understand where her character was coming from when she said that she did not want to become a poster figure for women's advancement in the military and society at large.  However, being that she was the only woman in the NAVY Seal training camp, it was sort of inevitable for that to happen.  Hence, her character's comments were unnecessary.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen was excellent as Master Chief.  I found myself still liking his character after he beat the crap out of Demi Moore's in a training game gone wrong.  That scene was brutal but very necessary. In this case, the social message was that equality in the military does not just mean that men and women get an equal share of the pie but also that they both get an equal share of the pain.<br/><br/>SPOILER: I would have liked to see Anne Bancroft's character on Moore's side towards the end but as politics goes, she only cared about getting re-elected.  It was a good reality check for the viewer.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie."
"zardoz-13","5","22","37","16 September 2009"," Gee, I Don't Like Jane
","Actress Demi Moore shaves her head, dons fatigues, and totes a machine gun in British director Ridley Scott's opportune but exploitative ""G.I. Jane,"" a sexual equality polemic about the first female to graduate as a Navy SEAL. This lackluster basic training epic serves up a volatile but exemplary message about equal rights and the armed forces that cost the filmmakers the aid of the Department of Defense. When ""G.I. Jane"" isn't preaching gender parity, this cynical but slickly done ""Top Gun"" clone is gung ho on showing Moore kicking butt in the kind of role her husband Bruce Willis excels. Sadly, ""G.I. Jane's"" melodramatic storyline combines with its juvenile heroics to undermine what little credibility it musters as a socially conscious exercise in political correctness.<br/><br/>Writers David (""The Fugitive"")Twohy and Danielle Alexandra collaborated on what can only be called a prefabricated screenplay. ""G.I. Jane"" marches to the familiar beat that has characterized the formulaic military service picture since the 1920s. Movies such as ""Courage Under Fire,"" ""Heartbreak Ridge,"" and ""Stripes."" have done what ""G.I. Jane"" tries to do. Moreover, they have done it better. Basically, the plots and the heroics in military pictures remain the same, only the sex of the hero has changed with ""G.I. Jane."" The Twohy-Alexandra script alternates between Congressional and Naval brainstorming sessions about Lt. O'Neil and the obstacles she confronts at the SEAL training base in Florida. A shrewd but slippery Texas Senator, Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft), cuts a deal with the future Secretary of the Navy Theodore Hayes (Daniel Von Bergan). He'll snag her vote of approval if the Navy opens its elite SEAL commando school to a woman. Secretary Hayes caves in to Senator DeHaven's request, but squirms when she demands approval of the SEAL candidate.<br/><br/>DeHaven picks Lt. Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) for her physical agility and her keen mind. O'Neil is the kind of woman who makes men nervous. When we first meet her, she is monitoring a satellite transmission with a commando unit trying to escape from enemy country. She arouses the hostility of her male superior officer when she provides the best solution to the extraction problem. But Lt. O'Neil is not a person easily ignored. Neither Senator DeHaven nor Secretary Hayes expects her to finish the course. After all, Navy SEALs are the most demanding and merciless elite combat force in the world. Sixty percent of the recruits who enter the program wash out.<br/><br/>When the press snaps photos of O'Neil on SEAL maneuvers, a controversy erupts in both the Pentagon and Congress. Secretary Hayes and Senator DeHaven sought to keep the project under wraps, but the news wants to interview O'Neil. Suddenly, O'Neil finds herself caught in the middle of a JAG investigation.<br/><br/>Guys will relish the last half-hour of ""G.I. Jane."" That's when the bullets start to fly. During a training exercise in the Mediterranean Sea, the SEALs get to help out U.S. troops retrieving a fallen satellite in Libya. This part of the script is straight out of a ""Star Trek"" movie because the SEAL recruits are the only force close enough to respond to the situation. Nobody else can rescue these troops, so the Master Chief (Viggo Mortensen) takes his recruits into battle. Unfortunately, things go sour and the Master Chief catches a bullet. He sends O'Neil packing, but she refuses to leave him to his fate. Instead, O'Neil figures out the master chief's escape plan and stages an ambush to wipe out his adversaries. Not since World War II Nazi movies have the enemy been so gullible and easy to kill. These Libyan soldiers present about as much a threat to the SEALs as the Iraqi soldiers did to Charlie Sheen in the ""Hot Shots"" movies.<br/><br/>Demi Moore knocks herself out as Navy Intelligence officer Lt. Jordan O'Neil. Even her character's name has a masculine quality to it. When Demi isn't trying to impress us with her brains, she displays her feminine brawn. The calisthenics that she performs in her tight undies defy gravity. The one-armed push-ups are enough to make you break into a sweat. All of this resembles the grunge side of last summer's idiotic opus ""Striptease,"" except that frontal nudity is avoided. Moore's performance, to her credit here, is both straight-forward and serious even when O'Neil plays toy soldier in the last reel.<br/><br/>Veteran actress Anne Bancroft of ""Point of No Return"" shines as the crafty Texas senator whose willing to use as well as abuse Lt. O'Neil to save her own congressional bacon. This is Bancroft's juiciest role in years, and she plays it to the hilt. Her best scene with O'Neil has Bancroft's cagey Senator explaining why women in combat will remain a hot issue. According to DeHaven, lawmakers fear the political suicide that television images of dead women being shipped home in body bags would prompt. Director Ridley Scott pulls some slick optical tricks to bolster ""G. I. Jane,"" but they don't beef up the action. Jiggling his camera during the combat scenes may create disorientation in audience, but it doesn't trigger a rush of adrenalin. This artsy gimmick doesn't generate either tension or suspense. Anyway, you know that Demi Moore isn't going to get a scratch on her because she's smart enough to dodge the bullets that stupid men are firing at her.<br/><br/>Simply, Scott doesn't make ""G.I. Jane"" rock and roll. The grueling training sequences are okay, but the final combat scenes resemble Boy Scout antics, compared with even a marginal effort like ""In The Army Now."" Ridley Scott has produced some memorable films that deploy women in gender stretching roles, such as ""Alien"" and ""Thelma & Louise."" ""G.I. Jane"" boasts none of the art, hype, or viscera of those movies. In the commercially oriented market place, if the next movie doesn't top the last, trouble lies ahead. Compared with last summer's dignified masterpiece ""Courage Under Fire,"" ""G.I. Jane"" amounts to sheer hokum."

","""G.I. Jane"" is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the ""Chronicles of Riddick"" series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like ""Pitch Black"" that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of ""The Expendables"", Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going ""Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross"". Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like ""Full Metal Jacket"" in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike ""Full Metal Jacket"", the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly enjoyed ""G.I. Jane"". I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray."

","This is one of Ridley Scott's better films, up there with 'Alien' or 'Matchstick Men'.<br/><br/>There's been A LOT of dissing of this film, especially by idiots that refuse to even watch it. Most of them whine and moan about how the writer (David Twohy who wrote 'Pitch Black') got the terminology and endless DoD acronyms wrong. SFW. It's a fictional drama, not a documentary. You want a documentary? Watch the Hitler Channel.<br/><br/>I used to be a wildland firefighter and, yep, I'm a split tail. I've seen fictional wildfire movies where the tanker planes fly at night and the actors sprint through fields of flaming dirt (note to non-firefighters: dirt don't burn). Again, SFW. It was a movie, big deal.<br/><br/>The No. 1 reason I like this film is Viggo Mortensen's performance. He's way better than Demi Moore, not that Demi is bad. I don't think she deserved the Razzie for this. Again, that came from misogynistic armchair warriors who are unemployed and live with Mommy. Consider the source.<br/><br/>What this film does have is action, suspense, conflict, fast dialog, good character development -- all the stuff a movie like some horrendous Steven Segal mess is SUPPOSED to have but usually doesn't.<br/><br/>Rent this flick, keep an open mind and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind, a very high percentage of the enlisted women who have served in the Middle East have been harassed, assaulted and raped -- by their own coworkers, not 'the enemy.' Then reconsider all these bad reviews and ask yourself what does that say?"

Indeed a recent commentator stated: ""it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do."" What claptrap! No one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore ""buffing"" up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD/S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so. There is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out, can't compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can't handle the psychological harassment. I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived, purported message of this film. In the real world, Demi wouldn't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training. Wishing alone won't do it. Skip this film as wishful thinking, and better spend your time reading ""The Warrior Elite"" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001)for the best description as to what really goes on in this training.

Command Master Chief John James Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) is their trainer. She has to overcome expectations, sexism, politics and the pressure of the program to succeed.<br/><br/>There is nothing surprising or original in this movie. It's got all the training and director Ridley Scott is an expert at jazzing up those 'action' scenes. The most compelling originality comes from Demi Moore shaving her hair. I do have to say that she looks fierce with the bald head. She looks fierce generally and Scott has her exercising up a storm.

"Uriah43","2","9","18","24 February 2013"," Feminist Propaganda
","This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays ""Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill"" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it ""Senator Lillian DeHaven"" (Anne Bancroft) also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all ""gender norms"" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor ""Master Chief John James Urgayle"" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one."

","Some movies are just ridiculous right from the start and this is one of them. First there is no such thing as CRT. Second women are not in combat for very good reasons. Now while some women can compete at things like running or swimming, they cannot compete with anything that requires upper body strength. The idea that you can make it through BUD/s but somehow wash out in CRT training is also nuts. BUD/s has a 70% failure rate and only those who really want to be there will make it through. It's a lot harder than it looks. Safety is the number one concern in training and eating bad food (as they depict in the movie) has no point at all. The instructors in this movie come off as sadists where as in real training the instructors actually want you to succeed. The marines spent 2½ years doing research on integrated teams and in every case all male teams out performed integrated ones. You might be able to march 20 miles with 75 lbs. on your back but the real question is how effective are you when you get there? Simply put men are built for war and woman are not."

She handled the part mucho convincingly, as did Mortensen as her tormentor (not mentor). You knew they would eventually kiss and make up - well make up, anyway, but it was a long hard road traveled before they got there.<br/><br/>The road was brutal and I question if beating up Moore, as Mortensen did with much vigor, would be tolerated. But, she came out bruised and smiling. In return, she got a slight smile from Mortensen.<br/><br/>It was a fast moving moving picture with little let up in action, except for the scenes involving the brass and politicians who were as, if not more, vicious than the military. Anne Bancroft handled her role beautifully - a politician you love to hate.<br/><br/>Jim Caviezel had a small role in this flick. Later, of course, he portrayed Jesus. In that picture he had to eliminate cussing.<br/><br/>The star of that pic, of course, was Mel Gibson - noted anti-Semite, wife beater, and alcoholic. What a combination - Caviezel cusses, Gibson handles the rest. He and Charlie Sheen would make a good team - the Two Stooges.<br/><br/>Thinking about the training the SEALs undergo - makes Parris Island look like Wuss City. (My uncle was a D. I. there). As for me, training was a lot less rugged, in the Signal Corps, U. S. Army. I recall a corporal in charge of our unit who was chastised because one of the guys did something wrong and he made all of us do the manual of arms using our footlockers.<br/><br/>Anyway, for exciting entertainment and - by the way no sex scenes - ""G.

","A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment ""A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's"".<br/><br/>This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.<br/><br/>No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.<br/><br/>""G.I.

While some scenes in the movie, such as the confusing end battle, seem a little out of place (exactly who were the trainees fighting?) the film moves along with startling pace and precision.  Moore, who as everyone knows shaved her head for the role of Jordan O'Neill, is tough but feminine and internally vulnerable as a woman scorned by her male teammates. The most violent scene in the film comes during the survival exercise in which O'Neill is bashed around by the Master Chief.

"ironhorse_iv","6","5","9","4 June 2018"," While, this movie was somewhat uplifting. 'G.I Jane' just didn't quite get my seal of approval. It was very mediocre.
","When Demi Moore, appeared on the red carpet with a bald head and a muscular built, for the premiere of 1996 'Striptease'. There was a lot of good buzz for her next big film, 1997's 'G.I Jane'. However, once the public got a hold of the film directed by Ridley Scott. The buzz turn into negative press. Without spoiling the well-shot movie, too much, one of the reasons, why this film didn't do so well at the box office, was, because viewers and critics, alike were under the impression that was going to be, a very realistic depiction of what life is like, for a woman to go through Navy SEALS training. However, the film wasn't like that. Actually, the movie was heavily fictional story of a Navy servicewoman, Lt. Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) being the first woman to enrolled in the Armed Force's 'the Combined Reconnaissance Team' (CRT) training program; a fictitious special operations until, that brings together operators from across all branches of the military into one group. Because of that, all the marketing for this film, including the trailers were misleading. It's hardly about Navy Seals at all! No wonder, why, this movie was called 'G.I Jane', despite the fact that the acronym is mostly used to describe the soldiers not sailors. 'The CRT' sounds like a team that a toy company like Hasbro would create, rather than the Department of Defense. Despite that outrageous figment artistic license, the movie training story is still not very well told. One such example is the out of the blue force action scene, toward the end of the movie. The idea that a national emergency situation, would require trainee's support, over years upon years, of well-trained, ready to go, Armed Force's special operation personnel is highly illogical. Not only that, but wouldn't it, make more sense, that the team that should support the U.S Army Rangers, in their mission, shouldn't be the trainees, but the Army's own, Delta Force or Green Berets. After all they're all in the same reconnaissance branch. Also, in real-life, any special operation trainee in any branch would probably take up to 2 years of training before, they ever saw combat. Such is the case with the real Navy Seals recruits. For them, they first have to go to Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School for 8 weeks; before advancing into BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL), training for another six months; follow up with another 3 weeks in parachute jump school/ plus 26 week course in SEAL Qualification Training (SQT), before finally, finishing off with SEAL Tactical Training (STT) that, normal workup or pre-deployment workup, including SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) is a 12- to 18-month cycle divided into three phases with them going to many different locations. The idea that this film is presenting, with a trainee skipping school programs and leapfrog toward any training site, within a few months, with the same instructors, plus go to war, with them, is not bound in any reality. No wonder, Moore went so far as to call then-President Bill Clinton to try to get advice from the Pentagon for the movie script. It's clear that screenwriters, David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra, had no clue, in what, they were doing. Despite the unrealistic inaccurate depiction of how the United States military operates their training courses, I still have to give Moore, some praise. While, her acting in this movie was alright; Demi really did look the part. Because of that, I highly disagree with critics, with her deserving a Razzie Award for Worst Actress for this film. If anything, Anne Bancroft's performance as Senator Lillian DeHaven was the worst. It was hammy and way too over-the-top for the character she's playing. As for Viggo Mortensen. He does a pretty damn good job of portraying Command Master Chief John James Urgayle. However, the idea that his character would trumped up charges of O'Neil being a lesbian (violating the ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy), seem a bit, out of character, but once again, that's the writer's fault, not the actor. It's lazy writing. As for the infamous POW scene, where the Master Chief beats her up and threatens her with rape. Surprisingly, those acts are justified. That's is what would happen if she was indeed captured by the enemy. While, there are those, who particular annoyed by this, because instructors are not supposed to physically abuse recruits. Under SERE-C, it's possible that it could happen, however, very unlikely under regular SERE training. Especially if the trainee outrank the Master Chief; such as O'Neil being a Lieutenant. So that was a bit odd. As for her having mistreatment from other recruits. It also could happens, as shown in real-life scandals like 'Tailhook', but it's likewise very rare, due to trust and teamwork being so vital in the military. Still, no one can deny, there is some sexism in the Armed Forces; after all, women weren't allowed to serve in any special operation roles, until January 2016; which is kinda depressing, because, when it comes to utilizing women in those fields; the United States is in the dark ages, compare to countries; which already had a number of female soldiers holding their own, reaching and surpassing the standards of their duties. As of this date of this writing, there has yet to be a natural born female to join the Navy Seals; which is sad, because everybody should had the fighting chance to serve their nation, if they want to. The idea of women having not enough brawn power to be in special operation is really outdate excuse. The majority of missions don't fail, because of the lack of man power. They flop, because the lack of smart strategies and misused of resources. Much like this movie. Regardless, of that, I hope, this movie's positive message would encouraged women to fight. Maybe, one day, there will be a good real-life 'G.I Jane' story to tell than this fictional half-ass version. One can hope."
"tieman64","Null","5","9","5 July 2011"," Botox goes to boot camp
","Though not as evil as his later war film, ""Black Hawk Down"", Ridley Scott's ""G.I Jane"" is an equally dumb war movie which finds actress Demi Moore enrolling into a Navy Seals training camp. Her mission? To prove she has what it takes to be ""one of the guys"".<br/><br/>In the late 70s Scott got it into his head that he was a feminist. Like most directors (Tarantino, Cameron, Snyder, even Scorsese with ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" etc), though, Scott has a wholly misguided view of feminism; the notion that female empowerment means women beating up men, shunting aside femininity in favour for hyper-masculinity, guns, violence, murder and abuse, and engaging or partaking in the same actions which typically subjugate women. The end result is ""G.I. Jane"", a film about women standing up for equality by travelling to Libya and killing Libyans because a US spy satellite crashed in a foreign, third world country. What the hell? <br/><br/>The further irony is this: the film is about people accepting women, but is acted by a woman who doesn't accept herself, Moore desperately flaunting her plastic surgery, her bald head, her toned body, her silicone-gel breasts and subjecting herself to all manners of abuse, all in the name of proving that she is a ""serious actress"" and has what it takes to be ""loved by us"".<br/><br/>Aesthetically the film is surprisingly ugly for a Ridley Scott production, with kitschy production design and dated, tacky music-video lighting.<br/><br/>4/10 – Worth one viewing."

","Ridley Scott is cinema's biggest puzzle since Brian DePalma.  When he makes a bad film critics all voice their disappointment - but what were they expecting?  ALL his films (although I've yet to see ""Gladiator"") are bad. They ALL suggest that his best work lies elsewhere, which doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps there's a secret cache of Scott films which only Freemasons know about.<br/><br/>So ""G.I. Jane"" is precisely what one would expect from the director of the criminally over-rated ""Alien"", the tediously worthy ""Blade Runner"", the pretty but hollow ""Legend"", the lifeless ""Black Rain"", the exploitative ""Thelma and Louise"" ... I could go on.  There is one difference.  As another viewer has commented all of his other films have some sort of visual sense; ""Legend"", for instance, looks spectacular; and even when the cinematography and art direction yield nothing of interest (as in ""Blade Runner""), there's a strong indication that someone was at least TRYING.  The only such indication we get in ""G.I. Jane"" is the confused, confusing, positively DEMENTED, editing and camerawork in the final battle.<br/><br/>It's a little hard to pick on ""G.I. Jane"" for its fascist sentimentality. With but a few exceptions, EVERY American film dealing with the military is like this.  Still, that's no reason to let Scott off the hook; and anyway, his film is worse than most.  The new recruits are so pointlessly tortured, the drill sergeant bellows such complete rubbish, there are so many yes SIR!s, that we might think it's a comedy ... but no, we can tell that Scott's eyes are moist, and he has a catch in his voice.

","G.I. Jane (1997): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Demi Moore, Viggo Mortensen, Anne Bancroft, Scott Wilson, Morris Chestnut: A film about a woman in a man's world with violence being the key factor. Demi Moore gives a convincing portrayal of a woman in military training and trying to withstand painstaking labour, crude gender jokes, and eating out of a trash bin. She exercises constantly and even shaves her head to blend in but outside forces attempt to sabotage her. What really comes across is her sense of human worth and her demand to be treated equally. During war games her entire troop is captured and she endures torture at the hands of her commander. Director Ridley Scott is skilled at presenting realism but the screenplay is marred with clichés and predictable ending that borders on farce. Scott has made superior films such as Blade Runner and Alien but this is hardly ranking up there with films that demonstrated greater skill. Moore displays a real sense of individuality while her co-stars surrender to stereotypes. Viggo Mortensen plays her heavy handed commander in what is easily a predictable stereotype with all the integrity of a playground bully. Anne Bancroft is also wasted in a role of a woman who is stuck so far back in tradition that it is a wonder that she exists in real time. For Moore this is barely a step up from Striptease.

","Not having seen this film when it first was released, we had the opportunity of catching up with it recently. In spite of our misgivings, ""G.I. Jane"" turned out to be an entertaining picture. Let's not forget this is a Ridley Scott film, which assures the viewer a well crafted product. The screen play is based on a story by Danielle Alexandra, who co-wrote it with David Twohy.<br/><br/>The movie mixes the world of politics and the armed forces, in this case, the US Navy. At the center of it all is Jordan O'Neil, a lieutenant that has seen other people get ahead of her because the Navy rejected her in serving aboard a submarine because at that time there were no facilities for a female in that all male environment.<br/><br/>Jordan is tapped to go into the Navy Seal program because an ambitious US senator, Lillian DeHaven, from Texas, wants to prove a point. She wants to send a female to integrate an exclusive group of the Navy. The Navy Seal is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. As such, Jordan O'Neil must go to a grueling training, in which, only about forty percent of the people that start, will finish. Jordan proves to have what it takes to be accepted at that high classification. However, things get in her way when her own mentor, who has the closing of some bases in her own state to deal with, decides to take indiscreet photographs of Jordan at a beach party with other female personnel.<br/><br/>During the confrontation that ensues, Jordan shows she will not take the senator's BS; Jordan will do anything and will tell the press about what is really happening. Standing up to Sen. DeHaven assures Jordan she will go back to finish what she started.<br/><br/>The casting of Demi Moore for the lead role pays off. Ms. Moore, who is in excellent shape shows she can conquer any obstacles that stand in her way. Viggo Mortensen plays the enigmatic, and brutish, Master Chief Urgayle. This man is hard on everyone under his command, but there is a softer side of him as we watch him reading J. M. Coetzee and D. H. Lawrence's poems. Anne Bancroft plays the ruthless senator with relish. David Vadim and James Cavaziel are seen among the recruits going through the hard training. Scott Wilson plays the Commanding Officer of the base where Jordan undergoes the training and he makes no bones about how much he hates the idea of a female breaking the sex line.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott directs the film in an almost documentary style, since most of the picture depicts the training aspect. Hugh Johnson's cinematography works well with Piero Scalia's editing. There is even some Mozart and Puccini in the background that are not out of place in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott delivers again in this action packed movie."

","With a title like G.I. Jane, it would be easy to dismiss Ridley Scott's latest effort as exploitation fare. Such a reaction, however, would do the picture an injustice. On the other hand, the movie lacks the thematic depth that the film makers would like to attribute to it. Basically, this is a high-grade testosterone flick. While G.I. Jane is admittedly effective at doing most of what it attempts, the problem lies in its lack of ambition. We've seen movies like this, about honor and courage in the military. Many of the trappings may be different, but, at its core, G.I. Jane isn't all that different from John Wayne's The Sands of Iwo Jima.

In a way it certainly gives the voice to the ""fairer sex"" or ""weaker sex"" and lets a woman speak for herself. What I didn't, however, like about it was the ""propaganda"" attached to it. The film at the very beginning poses a thesis, which is clear to everybody (""Let's prove that a female may be an efficient soldier, at times better than the male ones""), and the story unfolds only to back up that thesis. I would say, an overtly political one. I guess it would be more interesting to watch G.I.Jane on her way to passing the mental and physical test without the ""global"", ""political"" background.

","I've always thought that Ridley Scott's G.I. Jane is the movie Michael Bay made in another reality where he matured a little more. I mean that as a compliment to Sir Ridley and the film. The crisp, aesthetically lighted style has Bay written all over it, but it's employed alongside a human story of one girl facing some truly daunting odds. Demi Moore plays Jordan O Neill, a determined, plucky individual who has her mind and heart set on going through the infamous Navy SEAL training, making her the first woman to undertake the task. She just wants to do her training like the rest of her peers, but unfortunately her situation comes with a tirade of media attention and notoriety, something which she never signed on for. Corrupt politician Theodore Hayes (the late Daniel Von Bargen smarming it up) wants to ruin her, and he's at odds with a pushy Senator (Anne Bancroft is as stiff and sour as the glass of kentucky mash she constantly pulls from). Meanwhile, Moore begins her training, thrown in with a bunch of testosterone fuelled dudes, rabid dogs who don't react well to a girl in their midst. Her instructors do their best, but she meets quite the adversary in Master Chief James Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) a no nonsense guy with a razor sharp intellect and a personality to fuel it. Mortensen gets to do something really special with the role. Where other drill instructors in film are somewhat caricatures, monstrous, profane loud-mouths with all the depth of a wood plank, Urgayle has a metallic edge that encases real human qualities beneath. Mortensen latches on to that right off the bat, blessing the film with a fully three dimensional person. The cast is great as well, with work from Kevin Gage, David Warshofsky, Jason Beghe, Morris Chestnut, Jim Caviesel and the legendary Scott Wilson who is mint as the cranky base commander. His dialogue is straight out of a Mamet script and Wilson bites down hard, especially in a scene where he verbally owns Bancroft. Moore is combustible, lacing her take no prisoners attitude with the grace and power of her femininity. She's also in wicked shape too, her physique a reflection of both Jordan's commitment to her goal and Demi's steadfast need to tell the best possible story. This one is far better than some critics would have you believe, with a story arc both suited to the character and theme. It's also just plain powerhouse filmmaking that chimes in on all the right notes. Awesome stuff."

This is a serious action/drama that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Other cast members of note are Viggo Mortensen, Kevin Gage, Morris Chestnut and David Vadim. Worth watching more than once."
"Sidbose","8","3","7","12 August 2010"," This is where IMDb doesn't measure up...
","...because some of the most stimulating films ever made lose out to the average just because they did not appeal to the herd mentality. Films like GI Jane get a short shrift on this hugely followed platform while a slasher film with a trite storyline will find a better rating. And, I too was a party to the collective prejudice of the reviewers, until I decided to undo it by filing in this review. I gave the movie a skip several times just because I thought, ""why the hell are they trying to make a hero out of a woman in boy's playground!"" There 'we' go. And, then there was Demi Moore! It was like trying to slip out of striptease and wear the Uniform. Until, I saw the rental at my friend's place to kill time. And, boy I was embarrassed of myself just the same as Mortensen who plays Demi Moore's superior in the film. This is certainly not the best film but a disciplined one. The plot's forward movement was much better than some of the obscenely expensive films of Bruckerheimer or Michael Bay films which just end up distracting the audience from the poor script. The build up was good. The characters believable. I didn't know it was a ridley scott film until I checked out the film's title on IMDb while watching the film. Going into the storyline would be a waste. I would just like to add that Moore got a chip on her shoulder wearing the uniform. Striptease seemed a waste of time. I would have given a 7 rating for the film but when I see the mindless waste that my fellow reviewers have turned it into I thought I will give it an 8...just to clear up the mess a bit."

","First of all, there is no reason why a woman, who through strength training has developed her strength as much as a man with the same muscle mass could do, should not join the Seals or other Special Forces. If you would do a little research before you open your fat mouth, you would find that not only is our society sexist, but also we are lacking in studies on women in strength training because it's not seen as feminine. However, is has been proved that women have the ability to increase their strength through training. Yes, women's ABSOLUTE strength is on average lower than men's, however ""women are as able as men to develop strength relative to total muscle mass.""(taken from ""Strength Training for Women: Debunking Myths That Block Opportunity"" William P. Ebben, MS, MSSW, CSCS; Randall L. Jensen, PhD.THE PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE - VOL 26 - NO. 5 - MAY 98 )<br/><br/>Thusly, it is in fact possible that a woman can be stronger than a man. A woman who trains, and passes the physical tests should be allowed in the SEALS and other Special Forces. For a woman is as intelligent as a man and as strong as a man with the same mass. NOt only that, but studies have shown that women are better multi-taskers, which makes them good under time constraints and pressure...aka BATTLE.<br/><br/>Of course G.I. Jane had an attractive female for the lead role, movie-goers are sexist. Haha. Vigo Mortissen ain't so bad either, and it's doubtful that he actually went through the rigorous training that Demi Moore did. Now... <br/><br/>More women need to see this movie, especially women who believe that they can do anything they put their mind too. There's no good reason why women are not be allowed to fight in combat to protect our country. Also, it's not fair that men are drafted and women are not. Our country is still sexist, despite the feminist and civil rights movements. This film shows how innately sexist we are as a society. The most sexist person in the movie is not a man, as you might assume, but a woman Senator. She tries to hold Lt. O Neil back, but she soon learns that you don't mess with G.I. Jane. This is one of my all time favorite movies; Demi Moore is a powerful actress, and this part was written for her. Viggo Mortissen plays Master Chief, a person of many depths, just like Lt. ONeil. He parallels her nicely in the film, and the two stars work well together to make G.I. Jane the best film to show the need for equal rights in the military."
"Bogey Man","4","3","7","15 May 2002"," Definitely Ridley's worst film to date
","A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this film or then I couldn't reach it properly. It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I really can't understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert?! It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are plenty) and they are very intense and directed with skill. The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing.<br/><br/>This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. Still I'm glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this film.<br/><br/>A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on..) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10."

","Maybe you can get through this but I couldn't get past the first 45 minutes. Every scene was too dark. Almost all the scenes took place at night or were shot day-for-night. All of the indoor scenes were shadowy, even in the mess hall, so much so that faces were indistinguishable. Groups of people standing together became homogeneous black masses. When I realized that I was looking forward to the commercial breaks because I could actually SEE them, I gave up.<br/><br/>Here's what I got out of the first 45 minutes. Demi Moore is a successful Naval Intelligence officer, a lieutenant who is given a crack at the SEAL training program. She feels she ought to take it because she would be the first woman to complete the program. (She's been denied duty on submarines and in a couple of other positions because they couldn't accommodate women.) She has a conversation about this with her husband in bed, in almost complete darkness, so I can only guess from the conversation that it was her husband because her companion didn't sound like Daffy Duck. She points out that although they've been in the Navy the same amount of time and had similar appointments, he has had a more successful career because he's a man. He doesn't understand her desire to prove herself despite her womanhood. (My heart began to sink somewhere around here.)<br/><br/>Well, I kid you not, the training program is really a rough one. They seem to perform all their exercises at night and in the rain. And when the recruits are told they must jump over a series of barriers or something -- I couldn't tell exactly what the obstacles were because I couldn't see them -- she is informed that steps have been provided for her use. She gets up on her hind legs and screams that she doesn't want any special considerations just because she's a woman. The other recruits, by the way, have been acting like testosterone-maddened brutes towards her -- whistling when she enters the mess deck, ogling her rack, shouting out questions to her: ""Don't you know it's rude to point""? I don't know why. Demi Moore isn't unattractive but her voice sounds like tires crunching over a gravel driveway.<br/><br/>Enough is enough. Whether or not the photography was bilged, the script seemed well on its way to doing so all on its own. You can imagine how little effort went into picking a title for this politically correct piece -- ""GI Jane."" The writers and the director (who has done admirable work elsewhere) seemed to have worked equally hard on the story. That is to say, not very much. I anticipated that she would not only successfully complete the program but in addition perform some heroic deed -- saving the life of a fellow recruit during an accident or something. There would be a band playing at the end, when the credentials were being handed out, and all the men who had treated her with such condescension would stand at attention when she passed. Her husband would take her in his arms and apologize for having been such an unfeeling moron. I mean, that's the kind of plot a committee of unimaginative writers would come up with and a bunch of MBAs with an eye on the box office would greenlight. It's like one of those connect-the-dots puzzles that are provided on the backs of the menus in some Chinese restaurants to keep the impatient kids occupied, only here, instead of winding up with a pencil drawing of a clown it comes out as a dollar sign.<br/><br/>Demi Moore is good at playing a tough cookie with that voice of hers that sounds as if it had been cured by Gauloise. And Vigo Mortenson has the stereotyped role of the harsh Master Chief who is only sadistic in the service of a noble cause. At least I think it was Vigo Mortenson. It may have been Sam Shephard. It was too dark to tell."
"dgoyet","10","4","11","20 May 2005"," Gi Jane
","I believe GI Jane is one whale of a movie. The whole thing starts off as Jordan is volunteered for training she did not apply. Handed the job she sees the opportunity which otherwise she might have never had.<br/><br/>The whole scenario changes somewhat with the Master Chief who and this is obvious is using whatever wile he can to get her to ring out. A point that many seem to have missed. In that particular environment anyone who has been there knows the drill as far as being a prisoner goes. However this scene where she is being interrogated turns into a war of wills between her and the chief. He tries to use that to break her and he only makes her stronger. <br/><br/>There was a point of decision time where she almost did ring out but instead hangs in there. Within the time alloted the movie overall makes it and brings out a point that I have never heard commented on.<br/><br/>A woman should have the right of choice and if she chooses to be GI Jane and proves herself which she would have to do and the movie shows that then that choice is hers and no one has the right to make it for her or to force on her standards contrary to her wishes which places her in a secondary position. A point the movie makes well.<br/><br/>The movie depicts well the boys club and dramatizes well the ability of the human spirit to overcome. She is put down, marginalized, isolated, and challenged at every turn. It shows what some have mistaken as excessive, the haircut, but notice, after the master chief had really made her mad and determined. He did her a favor.<br/><br/>Now of course there were other overtones but overall the movie was well acted and very enjoyable to watch. Being a former Delta Force commander I thought very close to the truth.<br/><br/>The only real limitations on any of us is the ones we impose on ourselves!"
"aldebaran68","5","2","4","25 April 2016"," Intriguing, unsatisfying, disappointing
","OK. I'm European/ME background so not the greatest fan of the US military esp. not Hollywood depictions of it. I don't want Islam in Europe (they tried twice before, not a 3rd time thank you), but nor do I want the West intruding there. Libya, Syria, and Iraq we should not be there. So I don't like the Libyan bit. Yes it happened for real as a Western intervention, no I still don't like it. It was ineffective and unsuccessful. I hated the invasion of Iraq 2003. Why am I saying all this? Because for all the 'US military is the Best in the World' as this movie tries so hard to portray (best, meanest, roughest, toughest etc.) it hasn't won a single war since against Japan 1945. GW1 was a 100hr 'turkey shoot' hi-tech war against peasants. The US military is not the best in the world, just the most expensive, and the smallest by population resource base (about less than 1% of the population). I thought Blackhawk Down was a more realistic portrayal of the US SF in an Islamic environment. <br/><br/>Now to Demi More. I thought she performed a thankless role well. Didn't do her career much good though Personally I do not approve of or agree with women in combat roles. Not one bit. Any other part of the military-welcome, but not combat. Esp. not in the ME where it seems at least 60% of the US effort has been for the last 15 years. There is presently a huge controversy in the US about opening up the SF to women. They the SF operatives apparently do not want it. Only the politicos (very well portrayed in the movie) want it for stupid non-military or operational reasons. If a woman in uniform is captured in the ME by Jihadis, she will endure a nightmare that will scar, damage and ruin her for life.<br/><br/>Out there attitudes to khuffar (Infidel/non-Muslim) women in uniform are many times worse even than for Muslim women who rebel against the religion. What DM went through with Master Chief would be 'a walk in the park' compared to what she would undergo in reality at Jihadi hands. So that argument about women in combat is mostly unrealistic. And the film portrayal, while maybe realistic about the training, is unrealistic about what an enemy would do to a Woman in uniform... Not merely 'a bit of roughness' but utter screaming barbarity... <br/><br/>The point of GI Jane was to portray women going into SF training then into combat. It failed to show the outcome of that reality in the fully conflictual (Iraqi/Syria) ME. Possibly it only wanted to portray her readiness to operate in a unit while not showing 'cultural context'. This was cheating IMHO. Imagine GI Jane in Blackhawk down. That would much more realistic. Imagine her as a chopper pilot, like the guy who got dragged off. This movie failed to portray the argument of women in SF except in the most 'entertaining' light. So it was entertaining, for that I gave it 5. But for lack of realism in its representational purpose I wouldn't give it more. A 'Blackhawk Down' scenario with a female operative would have been much more realistic"

","When this film came out I ignored it and finally got around to seeing some of it on You Tube recently. I watched about half an hour although I did anticipate watching the whole movie. Alas I was just so bored with it by the 30 minute mark I had to withdraw from the battlefield.<br/><br/>And it was obviously going to be a real battle against boredom to survive the whole 2 hours of this travesty of a film. Clichéd dialogue from the start, exaggerated acting, the whole thing is a cartoon of reality. Of course the main premise is nonsense, a female navy seal is out to show the patriarchy that women can do the job just as well but that isn't what seals the fate of this trash.<br/><br/>No, what seals the fate of this trash is the superficial photography and fast editing that makes the film look like a TV commercial, which isn't surprising when you consider that's what Ridley Scott is, a TV commercial director.<br/><br/>I like Blade Runner, Alien, The Duelists, but post Blade Runner I think Ridley, like his brother Tony now deceased, has taken the lazy route of film direction and relying mostly on visuals at the expense of depth and substance.<br/><br/>Not much more to say other than avoid this turkey.

","This had the potential to be a very good movie- a talented director like Ridley Scott who has made some very good movies, a great actress like Annne Bancroft who has been in some outstanding films like The Elephant Man and the Miracle Worker and a sexy actress like Demi Moore who has been in some not so good movies but she has given some good performances. Why didn't it work so well and why do I consider it one of Scott's weaker movies? <br/><br/>Starting with the good things the film is assuredly directed by Ridley Scott. Also the cinematography, editing and visuals are very nice, and the soundtrack has some energy too. While I thought the acting was unexceptional on the most part, I thought that Viggo Mortensen gave a wonderfully gruff performance as Moore's poetry-reciting superior. Finally the training scenes are impressively co-ordinated.<br/><br/>However, the story is predictable and pretentious and the dialogue mostly is horribly clunky. Then there is some uneven pacing, a somewhat tedious final third and the film just goes on for 20 minutes too long. And while Demi Moore is in great shape and has some presence, shaved head and all, she sadly forgot about her acting skills to match. Screaming ""suck my dick"" is hardly exceptional acting Demi. The other acting is also unexceptional, Anne Bancroft in particular is a great actress(as I have said already) but overdoes it here.<br/><br/>Overall, G.I.Jane does have its moments but it isn't a great film in my eyes. An example of a film that is high-on-testosterone but somewhat low on brains, by all means it is watchable but this is a disappointment from Ridley Scott. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","A senior female Senator pushes the issue of the role of women in the military and finds herself with an ultimatum  put some test cases through the Navy SEAL training programme and, if they make it, then the possibility of equality is on the table. The applicants are varied but Senator DeHaven settles on Lt Jordan O'Neil, an intel officer who has the smarts and the drive to potentially make it but also the looks to help by being quite ""media-friendly"".<br/><br/>I might be wrong but I do recall GI Jane being one of the films that saw Moore's career start/continue its slide from box office success to box office risk. It is also one that mostly attracts fairly poor reviews from most audiences. Watching it recently I must admit that I can see both sides of the argument  which is why the rating for this film is almost squarely on 5 out of 10 as well I suppose! At its heart the film is a solid tale about overcoming obstacles in the pursuit of equality. It is not a theme that we haven't seen before and it is one that I thought might be interesting. To an extent it is and it does push just enough dramatic buttons to do the job  even an all-action conclusion. The problem is though the film is not really intelligent enough to rise above these basics.<br/><br/>So what we do get is a rather noisy affair where guts and violence are exposed in all the characters and probably too many shots of O'Neil in tiny shorts and vest doing push-ups with lots of sweaty flesh exposed; I got the point it was making but it did feel a bit gratuitous. Likewise the narrative did emphasis the degree to which O'Neil proved herself equal in terms of violence and aggression, although I was glad that the overall thrust was that she was an equal member of the team, with her intel skills being what earned her her place rather than the ability to kick people.<br/><br/>Moore is a good presence in the lead role but she never really has a character that goes deeper than one that can be described in simple words like ""determined"" or ""gutsy"". Nor can she make at times terrible dialogue work (""suck my d**k"" etc) but then I cannot imagine who could. Mortensen hangs round moodily in tiny shorts doing a weak version of the movie cliché  at times he comes off more like a wife-beater than a motivator and trainer. Bancroft is hammy to the point of being a bit silly in her early scenes; she pulls it back a bit at the end but not too much. The support cast all feature typical performances from Chestnut, von Bargen, Caviezel, Kestner and others.<br/><br/>Overall then a so-so film. It does the basic well enough within the gloss of a typically Hollywood film. However with some terrible dialogue, two dimensional characters and a predictable narrative arch, it is likely to disappoint in as many ways as it engages."

","For Al Bundy, chicks comes from the « big (g)uns » magazine. « Top Gun » is the famous movie with Cruise joining the military. So, my title should be clear now as « GI Jane » is about a woman enlisting. As the actress is Demi, it's funny to see that she has explored all the scale of her femininity : to the extreme low here as being a soldier to the extreme high when she played a striper in « striptease ». It would be interesting to hear her feelings about those experiences but as a GI, she was more stunning as she dressed with the uniform instead of doing push up. <br/><br/>Beyond this fashion note, the movie is a terrible tool for the cause of feminism : the explanation for her opportunity is totally lame as the arguments are drowned under a poor political scheme and they miss the target every time (her period, the lesbian threat ,). Worst, this angle isn't used to dynamite the old, usual, unsurprising evolution of those military school movies : at first, the recruits suffer, then, some of them oppose, but at the end, they prove their value during an operation. Indeed, this movie is just drills after drills, with instructors shouting in megaphone. <br/><br/>Finally, it's a propaganda for uncle Sam's military and never is questioned why the so-called first democracy in the world needs a such big army. Nobody wonders the legitimacy of their operation faraway of their coast and the fact that they are the first to kill in the desert state (wasn't it so an aggression ?). Thus, it made me realize that Ridley Scott is far away to have the credibility of a Spielberg or a Coppola. He is just an aesthete that sells his art to corporations and as long they pay for it, he doesn't ask questions (see also his « body of lies »). The only good surprise here was Viggo Mortensen as the instructor. He is excellent to depict authority with a certain heart so he was indeed at the right place here."

","It's a pity Demi Moore's great performance, and the overall high qualities of this production, are wasted on such an artificial and  nasty plot and subtext. Moore's portrayal of Lieut Jordan O'Neill putting herself through hell on a Navy SEAL training course, in order to convince military chiefs that women should be allowed on combat duties, may appear superficially to strengthen the argument for equal opportunities, but in reality undermines the case. The movie's message - expressed most forcefully when O'Neill shouts ""Suck my d**k!"" at a tormentor -  is that to achieve equality women have to become men. The unspoken implication is that the vast majority of women (and men) would think this too high a price to pay, and therefore women will never achieve equality. <br/><br/>However, before we the audience reach that conclusion, director Ridley Scott has set us up to sit through the sight of a group of men and a woman being literally and metaphorically dragged through the mud, culminating in O'Neill being beaten up by the Master Chief in charge of training, played all too convincingly by Viggo Mortensen. I don't object to the nastiness as such - we've seen the same or worse in many movies - but usually we're expected to be repulsed, whereas here our approval is sought. <br/><br/>Had it contained any serious discussion of the real issues involved in putting women on the front line, there might have been some point to this movie.

","Ridley Scott directed this flawed but involving study of Lt. Jordan O'Neil, a Navy topographic analyst who is chosen as a test case for the presence of women in combat. G.I. Jane is an action film tells the fictional story of the first woman to undergo training in U.S. Navy Special Warfare Group.The movie stars Demi Moore together with Viggo Mortensen and Anne Bancroft.The SEAL/CRT (Combined Reconnaissance Team) course depicted in the film is offered at Coronado Naval Amphibious Base in California.O'Neil is hand-picked by U.S. Senator Lillian DeHaven to go through the rigorous training right along with the men. Also,she faces sexism and physical challenges as well as the horse-trading by the Senator who selected her for the experimental program.<br/><br/>In the story,aware that she is making history and knowing that 60% of all male trainees will fail the rigorous training, Lt. O'Neil struggles to prove herself physically and mentally worthy of becoming a Navy SEAL. What she doesn't know is that she is being sold out by hard-bitten Texas senator Lillian DeHaven, who is being blackmailed by the Defense Department with politically fatal base closings unless O'Neil fails the program. The complicated political subplot, however, only distracts from the film's real virtues -- the wonderfully staged scenes of CRT selection training -- and fizzles at its climactic moment. The training scenes are wonderful, however, as the central recruits are pushed to their physical limits by a grueling weeding-out process.Master Chief John James Urgayle, a steely-eyed, tough-as-nails instructor who somehow finds time to quote D.H. Lawrence when he isn't making people eat garbage and beating O'Neil senseless as part of a training exercise. Mortensen and the believably-buffed Moore are terrific, and their scenes of confrontation are the film's high points. Unfortunately, the screenplay by David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra falls down every time it attempts to sidestep a cliché, and the climactic mission positively wallows in a predictable Top Gun muddle. Still, the characters are engaging and those looking for an enjoyable variant on the basic- training sub-genre of high-octane modern action films should be pleased.<br/><br/>Demi Moore tries a surprising turn to play Lt. Jordan O'Neil,who unfortunately turns more into an action figure instead of a character that is a human being the possesses both strength and weaknesses. Added to that,the it was an unrealistic execution of an intriguing premise and does not make it a point to make it realistic and plausible.Also,Scott's direction turn into making the film commercially viable by presenting Demi's scenes by overselling them. Too bad that it could have been a good movie considering the talent of the cast involved if the filmmakers prioritized telling a good story rather than prioritizing Demi's appeal into an interesting role."

I've always quite liked GI Jane as a film, seen it a couple of times before but not in a while. I stayed up last night to watch it because I'd never paid that much attention to Viggo Mortensen's character that I could recall. Unsurprising, one look at that mustache is enough to put anyone off, and also explains why I didn't recognise him before. There are several things about his character I think I misinterpreted before simply due to not paying that much attention and all the poetry was great, I had completely forgotten all of that if I'd ever got it in the first place. GI Jane has always been the kind of film I watch for a bit of a laugh rather than pay attention to the fine nuances of. And if you don't pay attention you come away with the idea that Viggo's character is an asshole when actually he's not even vaguely.<br/><br/>Demi Moore has very large breasts for an athletic character but aside from that I think she's very good, even if she had watched Aliens 2 a little too much before playing the part.<br/><br/>In summary: Viggo very hot, his mustache is not so hot, his acting is great, and DH Lawrence rocks."

","Okay, so this is a short review of what I think. I think this is an underrated movie. I really liked it, it shows you just what politicians can/will do just to save their own ass.

This movie has many great scenes as you can watch over and over again, some funny scenes and some more serious.<br/><br/>Also, I think Demi Moore was outstanding in this movie! I have never really been a fan of her but she made a good performance in this one. Her character (Jordan O'Neill) was perfect for Demi. Did you know that she even shaved her long hair off just for the movie? And she worked out a lot for it too. Viggo Mortenson was great in this movie too, as he always is, as Master Chief. I like his character, one of the reasons to that is because he is one of those who doesn't underestimate O'Neill. <br/><br/>I recommend you to watch it even if the end was bad, and like a few others said in their reviews, it was too overblown! /I'm sorry for my bad English, it's my second language and I'm only 15, but I'm learning ;)"

","Alright, alright, so the movie isn't perfect, the scenes are somewhat disjointed, some of the acting is stiff and the premise is slightly cliché -- so? It's completely on point when it comes to sexism in society, and is a definite self-esteem booster for women all over America who aren't happy making less money in less important positions at work, or just being seen as cooks, cleaners and baby-makers at home.<br/><br/>The storyline revolves around Lt. O'Neil (Demi Moore), a female intel officer in the U.S. Navy, chosen out of an array of female officers, to participate in CRT SEAL Training as a result of a female Texas Senator's (Anne Bancroft) feminist power-play for popularity. During her training, she faces off against the rough and tumble Command Master Chief Urgayle (Viggo Mortinson), intense training and a myriad of military men hell-bent on keeping the most intense military certification just for the good old boys.<br/><br/>Now, I'm no Soldier Girl, certainly not tough, and I get squeamish when I see a spider. My husband laughs when I sock him in the arm, for heaven's sake. But it would take some kind of ice-cold human being to not appreciate experiencing the story of a woman who makes the decision to ""gut it out"" and prove that that extra ""x"" chromosome doesn't stop someone from beating the odds, just like the other guys.<br/><br/>Demi Moore plays the character perfectly, conservative and reserved, just like an officer in the military. Her expressions of pain, determination and conviction to succeed strikes one straight to the core. Her delivery of the sharp one-liners is exhilarating in a way that I can't help but attempt to repeat under my breath. Viggo Mortinson plays with the depth of the tough Master Chief and gives us a level of reality and harshness that is absolutely necessary in a film about gruelling SEAL training. The ensemble and supporting cast is well put-together, very real, and very stark.<br/><br/>The low score on IMDb disappoints -- maybe America isn't ready for a soldier who demands a ""Yes, Ma'am""? I certainly hope not.<br/><br/>And of course, if you don't like the review, you can ""SUCK MY ****!"""
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","3","7 December 2009"," Don't tell me what I can't do
","This deals with the idea of both sexes having the same opportunities, using the idea of a female in the military, as a soldier. A Navy SEAL, no less. There's no doubt that Moore is by far one of the best choices for the role. She's one of those women who can pull off being tough without ceasing to be attractive, and who, without coming off as masculine, does not really exude a vast level of girliness, or at least not often(in her roles, I know nothing about her outside of that). It starts out very promising, confronting the stereotypes, the prejudice and the special treatment. The acting is great, Moore, Mortensen and Bancroft are all spot-on. I guess the reason Caviezel was given nothing to do was that he hadn't been discovered yet. The cinematography and editing are quite good. However, then this changes, turning itself into a blind and exaggerated battle cry(it doesn't help that the last bit is filmed in an overly shaky manner, trying to increase the intensity in a fake way) for the gender, claiming it to be superior. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the goal of feminism equality? Is it not only the extremists who wish to reach outright dominance? I am not in any way downplaying the plight that they have suffered throughout history. With that said, isn't it smarter to go for a fair situation, instead of shifting the balance all the way? There is a lot of Hollywood in this, that prevents you from taking all of it at face value. The DVD comes with a four and a half minute featurette, B-roll footage, interviews(with Demi, Viggo and Ridley), trailers(domestic and foreign), TV spots and a music video. I recommend this to those who are interested in the conflict that it explores. There aren't enough films about it, and I hope that there either already is, or at least will be, one that is better than this one. 6/10"
"sometimespaco","Null","1","3","6 August 2003"," Enjoyable movie if you're not neanderthal man
","I really enjoyed this movie and I definitelly recommend it if and only if: - You don't mind a predictably ""feel good"" plot - You believe that women can actually fight in combat (I do)<br/><br/>Also note that I say this is an 'enjoyable' movie, not a great movie.  The script and plot aren't anything special (they're not bad either), and I actually liked the cinematography and mood except for the desert scene. SPOILER: They made the camera jump/jiggle a lot in that scene to make the battle look more chaotic and frantic - I think it just detracted from the action.<br/><br/>I've noted with interest that most of the negative comments I've read seem to focus on either:<br/><br/>1) plot/story quality 2) believability<br/><br/>On the first point, feel good movies usually have predictable plots - I won't fault it there.  Men of Honor, another movie involving the Navy, is incredibly predictable (and took significant liberties with the actual man's life for the dramatic court room scene).  Still, I thoroughly enjoyed that movie, and I enjoyed this one as well for the same reason - they do a good job of conveying adversity and making you care enough to feel good when the main character triumphs in the end.  Ie- feel good movie.<br/><br/>On the second point, really - shut your freakin' pie hole!  Jeezus, other militaries in this world allow women in combat where they have served successfully and with distinction.  And the portrayal of the some of the Seals candidates is not as over-the-top and stereotypical as some take it to be.  If you are/were in the service, you'll notice that the people that give her the most crap are the enlisted candidates while the officer candidates are generally supportive.  Go hang with grunts in the Marines and you'll find a LOT of guys that act like the knuckleheads in this movie (and don't get me wrong - I like the Corp, hell I've got family still in active duty, male and female).  If you want a 100% accurate depiction of the Seals program, watch a documentary - expect some liberties and live with it.<br/><br/>Great movie for a cheap rental or a saturday afternoon on the couch :)"

","Using the familiar plot of an against the odds win over adversity, ""GI Jane"" is a satisfactory film.  It bears resemblance to ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", only this time the lead character isn't a cocky rogue but a woman.<br/><br/>The premise is simple enough.  Tired of the treatment of women in the military, a Texas senator (Anne Bancroft), wants a female put into an all-male arena: the elite Navy SEALs.  Cue Demi Moore as Jordan O'Neill, a sexy, young and energetic female officer.  With all assurances that she will be treated fairly, she enters the SEAL training camp, against the advice of her boyfriend Royce (Jason Beghe).<br/><br/>Upon entering it is obvious to the viewer what is going to happen. Countless episodes of minor sexual harassment abound, but O'Neill presses on with the training.  She is hounded by her unforgiving drill sergeant, Master Chief John Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen in his best role).  Things reach boiling point in a training exercise and the sadistic Urgayle brutally beats up O'Neill, as if to show she is 'just' a woman.  Of course, O'Neill doesn't give up.<br/><br/>The most disappointing element of ""GI Jane"" is that in terms of being accepted by her fellow comrades, O'Neill has to almost become a man.  In the start of the film, there is a scene where she and Royce are in a bath together, with low contrast lighting and plenty of bubblebath.  She looks very feminine, with her long wet hair and tanned soft skin.  Yet at the end of the movie, she has shaved off her hair, strutting around a bar and drinking Budweiser with her crew.  The crunch scene, where O'Neill crosses the gender line is after she has been beaten to a pulp by Urgayle.  He tells her to give up, to which she replies, ""Suck my d*ck!""  Had O'Neill not shaved off her hair or not replied to Urgayle like that, the film may have had some more credibility.<br/><br/>The film ends as the viewer expects, with Mortensen fulfilling his Louis Gosset Jr type - hard man with a heart of gold drill sergeant.  O'Neill saves the day and we are all happy.<br/><br/>Demi Moore has plenty of on-screen presence and should be able to hold down a film as a lead actress.  Yet throughout this film she does not come across enough as O'Neill, we only see Demi Moore playing a Navy SEAL.  An almost soft-porn sequence of shots of O'Neill working out, complete with wet t-shirt and ultra-tight shorts, make it seem more like an aerobics work out video or music clip, which sets a similar tone for the whole film.<br/><br/>In the end, Ridley Scott has taken the easy route and let Moore be the centre of attention, rather than him controlling the film's vision.  ""GI Jane"" is an entertaining no-brainer that will be a must for Moore fans (she isn't all that bad and she is good to look at), and a good piece of mindless action for everyone else."

In fact, another commenter rightly said that the film's focus was more on the training, than the combat.  Yes, that is correct, because naturally, you have to pass SEAL training before you can go into combat as a SEAL!  It's also for another, more subtle reason: that the best warriors are given the toughest, most combatlike training!  I don't mean to speak for any of our brave men and women who fought in the Gulf War, but I do remember some of them (especially tankers) saying that their training was more rigorous than combat against Iraqi T-72's!

There, O'Neill endures a grueling and inhumanly punishing regime, but is determined to stay put and prove to everyone that she is capable of completing her training and is worthy of her spot in the Navy program.<br/><br/>Moore played the part pretty well, pulling off the macho role convincingly and proved she is a strong person to stand up to her all-male peers. Viggo Mortensen played the tormenting Chief John James Urgayle well - cunning, vicious and villainous. The rest of the cast consisted of the male officers, who also pulled off pretty convincing military roles. Them doubting O'Niell's ability to join the Navy and mocking her determination provided some intrigue in the movie.

","Going in with very low expectations - I'm not very fond of the director, it reviewed poorly, killed its star's career and lost the studio money - I was pleasantly surprised by how thoroughly enjoyable it was. Demi Moore delivers one of the best performances of her career in one of those remarkably physically demanding roles for which men are applauded and women - should another dare to take on such a role after the flak Moore received - are often ridiculed. In the hands of a less talented actress her toughness and imposing physique might become male-impersonation clichés - see Vasquez in Aliens - but Moore remains utterly feminine throughout.<br/><br/>The training sequences of which much of the film is comprised are all handled well and never outstay their welcome or become repetitive, and even when they stretch credibility - as in the punishingly violent sequence where Moore is outright attacked - it's hugely satisfying dramatically when you consider the attacker's motives. <br/><br/>Things become very silly and highly implausible once a training mission turns into the real thing, but it remains enjoyable. It may feel like it was tacked on from a different movie but few chop-shop efforts work so well. <br/><br/>It bears discussion too: it raises very serious questions about women in combat, and is deceptively balanced in the time it gives both sides of the argument - even if you have to use your brain to spot the ""anti"" moments. Sure women can do it, but should they be allowed to? During her brutal interrogation the men crack. Would they have done so if a man had been suffering? It offers no answers, it's just happy to present Moore's story without calling anyone villains.<br/><br/>It's not all great though. It's filmed in a slightly annoying style that seems determined not to make any use of the widescreen format, but that's fairly typical of the Scott brothers so I can't say it was unexpected. Also the supporting characters are often straight out of a cartoon.<br/><br/>Overall it's an exciting story, well executed, and blessed with a fine central performance that ensures every blow and setback the likable heroine suffers is felt by the audience, and every triumph celebrated."

When it was aired on TV, I decided I would give it a try, and I have to say that for the most part, it was quite an enjoyable movie. The most appealing part of this movie, I have to say, was without a doubt, Viggo Mortensen. I have seen him in several movies, and he never fails to steal every scene he is in. He has a magnetic, enigmatic presence on screen. The fight scene between himself and Demi Moore, I have to say, was really well-done, and I do have to say, that although I am a HUGE fan of Viggo, he deserved that. Demi Moore was also pretty good in this movie. I am not really a fan of Demi, but I do have to say it is incredibley refreshing to see a movie with a woman who can prove that she is strong and capable, without resorting the typical cliched lines that the 'tough' women always use in most movies, which I find absolutely repulsive and nauseating."

To director Ridley Scott, the relentless training is more seductively fierce than actual war.  As the recruits endure recklessly absurd trials of brute strength and mental persistence, Scott turns the training into a torturous, masochistic test of self-will.  He presents a rain-soaked, color-impaired vision of ""harrowing"" brutality, using his artist's eye to immaculately pose the abusive action.  The grim, nightmarish style is somewhat ridiculous-the training is, after all, NOT war, but glorified make-believe.<br/><br/>Moore, though, is surprisingly game for the grueling demands of the role. When Jordan rejects the Navy's ""policy"" of special treatment and double standards for female recruits, it's as if Moore herself is asking to finally be taken seriously as a performer.  Shorn of her star vanity and doing one-armed push-ups, she's determined to beat the odds, and actually act for the first time.  We sense Jordan's tenacity, appreciate her attempt to prove herself more than just a feminist symbol, and understand her vexation at being treated differently than ""the guys.""  Her face bloodied and bruised, her hair shaved to a stubble, Moore throws herself into the movie, and comes out tough-as-nails and more likable than ever before.<br/><br/>The movie itself is quite predictable-of course Jordan will eventually prove herself in a genuine combat situation.  But it's also pure propaganda. Should American women be allowed in combat?  Obviously many women are physically and mentally capable of battle.  So the movie declares, but who disagrees?  That's not really the issue.  The arguments forbidding women from combat are not about inferiority, but practicality.  (For example, no amount of social engineering will eliminate the inevitable sexual tension from integrated platoons.  You can't shut down sex drives through legislation.)  Scott never addresses these non-sexist reasons-doesn't even acknowledge them-and offers instead all the usual, immaterial pieties like ""How strong do you have to be to pull a trigger?""  A better director would probe deeper, and question the underlying reasons for how the military is structured.  For example, why are men assumed to be the primary warriors, and why are women allowed to fight only under special qualifications and political motivations?<br/><br/>The script is prone to making nonsense analogies, such as comparing the military's current ""discrimination"" against women to how blacks were treated by the Navy at one time.  It wants to compare what is considered two prejudices, without recognizing that a correlation between them simply doesn't exist.  There are no relevant biological differences between black men and white men, while there are indeed relevant differences between the male and female bodies.  As part of its idealism, the film ignores certain realities, which is an act that comes across as blind ignorance rather than enlightenment, or even dramatic license.<br/><br/>Deceitfully, G.I. JANE is also propaganda of a distinctly MALE variety.  The suspense is driven by conventionally masculine questions:  Will Jordan survive her master-chief's vile attack on her ego?  Will she defy the senator after being sold out for political votes?  Will she get to blow up lots of stuff?  Most unsettling, however, is that Jordan ultimately becomes a worthy warrior not by establishing herself as physically fit, but because she claims to have a penis, too.  In denying that she has different parts, Jordan willingly purges herself of her femininity.  Isn't that a form of self-imposed sexism?  G.I. JANE professes a desire for gender equality, but ironically sanctions instead a merging of the sexes where maleness is preferable.<br/><br/>ERIC BELTMANN"

","Demi Moore is one female Seal out of water.<br/><br/>In most cases of discrimination, the minority party is a small percentage of the total population. They have friends, you might say. Here its one against the world. The odds aren't hardly fair. The environment of prejudice here is completely believable. We don't need much convincing that Navy Seals training is a hardcore testosterone-fueled boys club. And its a scary place to be. I'd liken it to a girl put into an all-boys public high-school. She's eaten alive at every turn. The viewer is put in the position of such vulnerability, because we are aligned with the one woman in a world full of bitter, threatened soldiers, constantly passing sexist comments and threatening to take advantage of the female Seal.<br/><br/>There are moments that border on exploitation: Demi Moore's implants are put to good use in a sequence doing pushups in a short cut-off shirt, set to Three Dog Night's Mama Told Me (Not to Come). There is a speech intended for dafter viewers by an African-American character sympathising with Moore by likening her to his grandfather who was refused navy service on the grounds that African-Americans can't see at night (A surreal anecdote, but believable.) On the whole, however, the film is well made in Ridley's late style, which is to say, less style than his earlier pictures. It has several glimpses of the striking lighting which characterised his earlier pictures. My recommendations are as follows: 1) If you're looking for a silly movie, this is not one. Its dark.<br/><br/>2) If you're looking for a dark war training picture, or a good drama, then I recommend it.<br/><br/>3) If you're going through all Ridley Scott's movies as I am, this is a good three-star picture, but probably won't be one of your favourites by the end, which for me so far are Alien, Legend and Blade Runner."

","Well, don't go in seeing this movie if you have a bone to pick -- that applies to any movie, really.  Go see films to be entertained, or stay away from Hollywood and stay with art flicks and/or documentaries.  It would sure be nice if people just accepted the fact that Hollywood is about making money first, entertaining the public second, and everything else a distant third.  <br/><br/>In my opinion, this is one of Ridley Scott's strongest films.  More entertaining than Gladiator (and more true-to-life -- we can relate to the characters here since they're all quite human and living in modern times, but not to General Maximus Decimus Meridus).  A nice coverage of Navy Seals in training (can't comment on the realism although I was in the Naval Reserves for 6 years), this is one of my favorite popcorn movies, and doesn't require the brain to be totally disengaged, which is a nice extra. <br/><br/>
Not a good buy (simply because it's too painful to watch regularly) but makes a great occasional rental.  Production values and cinematography are first-rate, and the storyline is incredibly entertaining (if ultimately uninspired).<br/><br/>Why some people have savaged this film is beyond me.  Sure, it's cliched... but films like The Matrix and Saving Private Ryan aren't?  If you like action and/or military movies, just disregard the more blatant critics (I always do, knowing they have some personal agenda they're bringing to the film) and watch for enjoyment, without preconceptions... maybe you'll like it.

Demi Moore is great as the woman who made SEAL- a friend of mine who is a SEAL saw this with me and said that is exactly what training is like.  Demi Moore never backs down- even when beaten by the Masterchief. She also confronts the Senator to protest her unfair treatment.  In this movie she is both strong and vulnerable.  As a woman in the military she beats the odds, but as a woman in love she has to let her boyfriend know she will NOT stand back and be patronized.  Some of the scenes were hard to watch-- especially her treatment by the Marines in charge.  All together I watched this move three times-each time I found more in it than I expected.

Luckily, he has some tricks up his sleeve that makes it worthwhile and actually kind of entertaining. The film is well shot, for example, with camera angles, mud and scenery to make up for the bad dialogue and sometimes average acting. Actually, this film could have made it fairly well without any dialogue...<br/><br/>But it's just an average movie, no more, no less. Looking at some of Ridley Scott's other work, it doesn't stand a chance. But Demi Moore isn't so bad, for once."
"indialm","10","1","6","23 December 2012"," From personal experience
","G.I.Jane has some obvious flaws. Not the least of which is when Demi Moore walks into the mess with obviously no bra on under her white tee shirt. No self respecting female trying to get into the world of a macho, hyper-testosterone fueled job would do anything to accentuate her femininity. No makeup,no feminine underwear,nothing that makes her different than a male recruit. A fact shown to good example when Moore shaves all her hair off during a break and I give her credit for actually doing it and not faking it by wearing a wig. That takes guts. As someone who has been through something similar,I can tell you that not being wanted in a group of men elicits a type of behavior in a group mentality that would never happen if the man was alone. I really enjoyed this film despite some of its problems at suspending disbelief. For example, when the master chief is looking at the exercise where the recruits are in the rain, climbing forward on their bellies under barbed wire, he's ""seeing"" the action that wouldn't be possible through a scope or binoculars. Another is when each team in is the water and picked up ""on the go"" as the inflatable rafts rush by. Each male is given help by someone inside the raft and hoisted up inside. Yet when Moore's character turn comes, there is no help and she slips back into the water. She's unable to do it but is later criticized by the Master Chief for not being able to lift her ""own body weight."" Well, we don't know if that's so or not, as all the males were helped getting inside. There are other instances of such examples but the thing that makes this film work for me is I know how it feels to be unwanted and be considered incapable of doing what's considered typically a ""man's job."" The politics and technical mistakes aside, the real essence of the film is if a woman wants to fight for her country she should be able to."

","G.I. Jane is directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra. It stars Demi Moore, Vigo Mortensen, Anne Bancroft, Jason Beghe, John Michael Higgins and Kevin Gage. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Hugh Johnson.<br/><br/>A female Senator succeeds in enrolling a woman into Combined Reconnaissance Team training (Navy Seals) where everyone expects her to fail.<br/><br/>Having made a telling feminist mark with his excellent Thelma and Louise in 1991, Ridley Scott picks up the lady baton once again only to drop it half way through. This is a film of confused messages, what starts out as a worthwhile story involving a woman trying to overcome extreme prejudices in one of America's elite fighting forces, ends up as a gung-ho hoorah movie with Jane having ""manned"" up.<br/><br/>Things aren't helped by the sheer ridiculousness of the treatment meted out to Jane by her superior in training, Master Chief John James Urgayle (Mortensen suitably vile), so much so you would like to think if that sort of stuff goes on then arrests should be made. Daftness also comes by way of the superior officers prancing around training camp in the world's tightest shorts, one would think they must be on their way to ""The Blue Oyster Bar""...<br/><br/>Things are further compounded by the fact that as committed as Moore is in the title role, and she is and gives it her all, one can't buy into the characterisation because you simply are watching Demi Moore the actress. Shaved head and beefed up she may be, but this is still one of the highest paid actresses of her era, the characterisation thin on the ground with no depth. The political machinations at work barely get time to breath in fact the key mid-point tonal political shift is given short shrift.<br/><br/>Stylisation as one would expect from Scott, is super, as is his control of top draw action sequences. But the cock-eyed view of a woman in a man's world is hard to swallow, and although it mostly entertains, it's ultimately a shallow exercise. 5/10"

","Jordan O'Neill (Demi Moore) is selected to be one of the test subjects in an attempt to explore the possibility to change the policies for women in the navy. Unsurprisingly, there's more than one agenda in the mix.<br/><br/>Yes, this is kind of a flat film. Yes: it has flaws. Yes, it's ridiculously predictable. But do I love this film or what? It's one of my dearest feel good films of all time. I think Ridley Scott managed to capture a few real issues in a film that is essentially an amusing and very simple story. The actors do a great job and the story is straightforward, I think it is all it was intended to be.<br/><br/>Also, they beat each other up and there are helicopters and explosions.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS and annoyingly large wall of text below!***<br/><br/>The gender issue is so apparent it might as well be a joke, and in a lot of cases it is! Symbolic references to genitals everywhere. Maybe that's why it works so well. You want the jokes and extreme symbolism. And the helicopters and the violence.<br/><br/>There are two powerful women in this film, both of them are trying to make it, but while being a woman is part of the strategy for one of them, being treated as a person rather than a woman is vital for the other. DeHaven is trying to make a feminist statement as part of a (not so clean) political campaign, Jordan just tries to do what she wants in life, despite being a woman.<br/><br/>Jordan is victimised and diminished by basically all people around her, DeHaven being the most cruel of them all. At least C.O. Salem is honest. Even her partner is trying to hold her back to some extent, though he comes to respect her decision in the end. But Jordan never considers herself a victim and doesn't for one minute feel sorry for herself. <br/><br/>There is just critique and hopeless idiocy in a lot of the characters' reasoning: 1) Women in combat isn't a yes/no decision, because it IS true that men tend to become more protective towards women, and that IS problematic in a war situation (I just read a book on this, so I feel comfortable stating this). Ideology and reality have a tendency to clash. But this doesn't mean that we can't change this: by the time this film came out the policies for women were different from they are now, so apparently we are getting somewhere. 2) There is always someone who decides what is and what isn't politically correct, and while striving for equality, what is important and what is just for show? Does forcing ""gender education"" upon someone really make a difference or is it just antagonising? Even if I thoroughly dislike the character C.O. Salem and all his opinions, I get where he's coming from and it's not only the 50s.<br/><br/>How can we strive for equality when there are still people using their gender as justification or means to succeed? How can we look past ""gender norms"" when we are the ones upholding and creating them? And why are people not judged by what they bring to the table, when that should be the only thing that matters?"
"scourty","10","0","4","9 January 2014"," One of my favorite
","I adore this movie, not only for the remarkable performance of Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, but also for the way it handles its message. It's not a movie about feminists, Moore's character just want to be on the front lines, she doesn't care for equality or women's rights. The movie doesn't shy away from anything, it is brutal but not overly so. It's about much more than the army letting women fight. It's about how everything is political, how you can become a symbol without wanting to be, how the fight is never over. Moore has to fight to enter the program, and then she has to fight the Senator to stay there once she finally belonged, how even when he knows how strong she is, Mortensen still can't bring himself to risk her becoming hurt. It's a movie about how one person can change things without even wanting to. But that is not why I love this film. I love it because the main character don't take anything from anyone, be they her superior or a freaking senator. Demi Moore is a total bad-ass in this and that's why this movie is always glorious. I watched it a dozen times but I still find new things every time. This movie makes you think, but in a way where you don't even realize it. So many movies now shout their message loud and clear, but this one is more subtle about it, and you can watch as just another action movie about becoming a soldier, but you'll come out wiser or at least more prone to looking at sexism and feminism in a new way."

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","2","3 March 2012"," Should Woman be on the Front Line?
","The first thing that I heard about this movie was that the US Navy was opposed to making it and was very resistant to allowing Scott to use any of their facilities. I don't know what happened in the end but they seemed to be using some pretty hi-tech weaponry. One just doesn't walk down to a corner store and buy an Apache, though I thought the Apache was being used very ineffectively in the situation. Basically the Navy Seals were being pursued by a Lybian border patrol and they were on foot, so the Apache was firing missiles. I would have used the chain gun because it is much more effective against infantry than missiles, missiles are for tanks and other vehicles.<br/><br/>G.I. Jane is a protest movie and it is about women in the military in front line jobs. The Navy Seals are said to be the best of the front line troops and thus we focus on this. The movie is much more political and deals a lot with the political ramifications of what is going on. The biggest protest here is that nobody wants to bring women home in body bags. What the women say is that they can do anything that a man can do, so if a man can be a front line soldier, then a woman should be as well. Starship Troopers actually has women as front line soldiers. We see the main character wanting to be treated like all the other men, but at first she is given help because they feel that she needs it. What she doesn't want is to be treated any differently. The is opposition to what she is doing but it doesn't come out as strong as it did in the previews. In the previews we are led to believe that everywhere she goes she faces opposition, but this is not true. People do try to persuade her from doing it, but she is stubborn and continues.<br/><br/>It is the political side of the movie that draws the criticism. The politicians say that they don't want women coming home in body bags. The whole idea is about change and people don't want to do it. Feminisim is a very strong force in today's society and now we are moving further into what originally were male only jobs. Today we see women weightlifters and labourers, but we still don't see women soldiers. In Australia we have women on the naval ships but not in infantry. Now, in this movie, we see the beginnings of a protest against this.<br/><br/>The movie itself was a little confusing at times because the characters seem to mumble and it was hard to concentrate with Louisa and Melissa doing their usual girly things behind me, but that was not Ridley Scott's fault. His dark, wet style is very evident here, though it is quite different to Burton's style. Scott focuses more on this protest, and his darkness is much more realistic. Scott seems to keep the movie dark as a symbol of this world where women are not free to do what they like. Scott also seems to like rain because it is raining a lot in this movie. This seems to symbolise the struggle that the soldiers are going through in the training.<br/><br/>The training is very hard, and Scott reminds us of this constantly. They eat from bins and go through training to handle torture and capture. They are beaten up, drowned, and pushed to the limit. They say that there is a 60% dropout rate, and most of them want Jane to do it, but she doesn't. She makes it through a large part of the course only to become a political embarrassment."

","This flic's been out for quite awhile, but I just watched it again a few days ago for the third time. I like it better now than when I saw it when it first came out. Looking at a lot of other reviews, it seems that a lot of negative posts were based on the notion that the premise of a female successfully completing ""SEAL"" team training was improbable, or that it was a feminist screed. In the former case, if that was the criteria for determining good from bad there would be very few films made at all. In the latter case, where's the same rant against Ripley in Alien(s), or Starling in Silence of the Lambs, or Jeanne d'Arc in the Messenger? In any case, what I did like was the dialog. Short, ironic, cynical and to the point, just like I remember most of my discussions when I was in the Marines. ""The ebb and flow of the Atlantic tides, the drift of the continents, the very position of the sun along its ecliptic. THESE are just a FEW of the things I control in my world! Is that clear?"" That could have been uttered by my Sergeant Instructor at OCS. The tempo is quick, the demands of the physical regimen undercut by politics made for an interesting twist or subplot, and the positive outcome through grit and determination to overcome all obstacles was rather heartwarming. This movie didn't cause me to ponder great issues after it was over, but I was carried along by its challenge and conflict to its ultimate resolution. If you can get over your political/social predisposition going in, I suspect that you'll rather enjoy it."

","Thee Ridley Scott, did a fantastic job of G.I JANE!<br/><br/>From a rhetorical analysis perspective. The editing of the film was sharp, and fast paced. Probably to heighten the viewers emotions for the action film, especially in the first training scene in the daytime Moore goes through. <br/><br/>As for the Narrative, I feel it followed Bulgarian theorist Tzvetan Tordrov's theorisation. (I suppose that's why the main outline of the story could be be seen as easy to follow, down the the continuous film releases with the same 'Narrative Structure' hence some saying... predictable....not that it's always a bad thing)<br/><br/>-There is a balance in a calm state (Navy Seals Sere programme) - That gets distrupted (When a woman is put forward for a test trial.... Expecting to fail as well) - Balance is restored towards the last act of the film.<br/><br/>I feel Moore,along with Viggo M and Anne B performances were outstanding.

","G. I. Jane was a solid military movie, with a women's-rights message that only came across a little heavy once or twice (""She's not the problem. . . we are!""). <br/><br/>I was afraid that there would be a forced love-story, but that too is kept to a bare minimum and doesn't feel forced at all. It makes sense within the movie, establishes her sexuality that she strives to ignore, and it's not a big time commitment for the viewer.<br/><br/>That lack of a love story lead to my only problem with this movie: the length. The movie seems long enough to have included several more subplots, but instead many scenes just go on and on interminably, and the movie would benefit from being a good 30 minutes shorter. <br/><br/>It's predictable, and toward the end I was waiting for Lou Gossett, Jr., but in a good way. It's worth a watch if you like Top Gun but you don't like volleyball."

The movie doesn't really loses its pace and progresses well till the end. <br/><br/>The End could have been better. Showing a war sequence to prove the reason for very obvious.

I would rate 7."
"Sierra_Chester","8","0","2","3 January 2007"," An enjoyable film, if not entirely realistic
","First of all, I think most of the people complaining about how a woman could never be a SEAL, or how the training is unrealistic, are not even in the military. So that pretty much discounts anything they have to say. If you've never been through it yourself, who are you to say who can and cannot do it? Moving on...<br/><br/>I thought this enjoyable, Demi Moore is very convincing as she buffed herself up for this role and is pretty amazing to watch doing those one-armed push-ups and sit-ups. The hard work she put into getting into shape really shows, and I commend her for it.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortenson reminded me of a Drill Sergeant I had, the way he had an underlying humor but was still tough as nails. Mortenson was also very fit, though kind of skinny, but he also did a rather good job. I was especially happy to see the way he thought of Jordan as just one of the team, as shown when he makes one trainee pay for leaving her behind.<br/><br/>Anne Bancroft is wonderfully evil. That's pretty much all there is to say. She epitomizes what a corrupt politician is.<br/><br/>Now, onto the subject of Jordan's ""sex change"". I disagree with those who say the movie should not have called for her to shave her head. I realize her motivation for doing it seemed to be so she would fit in better, but for practical reasons, she should've shaved it anyway. It was laughable to see her going through PT and having her long flowing down her shoulders. Having one strand out of my bun would've warranted me a good 50 push-ups...this is SEAL training, it wouldn't be tolerated. So I think shaving her head was a good thing to put in.<br/><br/>It does seem she loses a lot of her femininity throughout the movie, but while it may not be a good thing, it's a realistic thing. How many women could go through what she went through but come out still as a girly girl who wears cute dresses and has her hair nice and long? ZERO. In order to really become a team, she became one of them. It happens even in today's military.<br/><br/>I'm no expert on SEALS training, but there are some things I find rather odd.<br/><br/>(1) This free time they have to go in and shower quietly by themselves! At BCT, there were 15 girls in a shower and we had 5 minutes to get done and get back in formation. My training was nowhere NEAR what the SEALS go through, so I doubt they'd have any easier time.<br/><br/>(2) The time Jordan had to work out on her own. For one thing, where'd she get all that time anyway? And another, the human body NEEDS TO SLEEP. She would be too exhausted to push herself so far in the few moments she had off. Stress fractures and severe fatigue would most certainly set in.<br/><br/>Those are my only real complaints, everything is--as far as I know--rather well-displayed. The live fire exercises brought back a couple memories of my own, as well as running around with a boat over their heads (though in my case it was a log). Like I said though, I'm not a SEAL, so if one comes up to me and tells me the movie was completely wrong...I'll believe them! Now for the big question...could women be SEALS? Or even in combat at all? I don't know about SEALS, I just don't have enough information to say...their training is very secretive, you don't know anything till you're there. So the only people who would know if women could make it or not are--well, no one.<br/><br/>Now in combat, yes, they can. And they should. But with that responsibility, comes more pressure. If women were to be allowed in the infantry, then they should meet the same standards as the men, not have them lowered so it's easier. That includes a 25 mile ruck march, and all the PT standards in the test. You want to be one of the best, you have to earn it. It's not impossible. I've seen women who run faster and do more push-ups than a lot of guys, I'm one of them.<br/><br/>It's been proved time and time again that women can function in combat, so that's not a valid argument. But a big problem that comes up (and is mentioned in the movie) is that men will automatically try to save the woman. I agree. But do I think women should be punished because of that? No. Just because some (I emphasize SOME) men can't deal with it doesn't mean the military should discriminate against women, it just means those men shouldn't be in the combat either. A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's, and it's old-fashioned and ridiculous that some men still hold to a different view than that.<br/><br/>Well, there's my review. All in all, I think the movie was good, so I gave it a 6, it's definitely worth seeing...if you go into it with an open mind and don't listen to those who don't know what they're talking about."

","G.I. Jane follows a female soldier as she train to become a SEAL operative, not knowing her career is all just a political stunt from a Senator.<br/><br/>This movie don't know where it's going. Is it a pure action movie or is it trying to be critical and political? While the idea in it self is interesting; let's follow a female training to become a Navy SEAL, the writing just isn't good enough. First off all you know from the second you sit down how it's going to end. Then it tries to join a political story with the personal story and don't do it very well. It simply doesn't know which one is the number one story and so the movie has problems focusing. It starts off strong looking like a political thriller just to have this story put on ice and forgotten. It's first brought back up when they realize they have to tie up the loose end it made. They aim too high making the political plot too big and the connection a bit too vague. They could've made a own movie about it and left it out of this one. The dialog contains too many cheesy punchlines witch creates a funny moment, but kind of takes the credibility from the dialog and makes it seem fake. The film tries to be realistic and accurate, but the dialog along with logical errors and other errors and mistakes becomes so obvious and such a contrast that it just makes it funny and makes you take it less serious.<br/><br/>Demi Moore does a really good job as Lt. Jordan O'Neil and the over all acting is good. Viggo Mortensen deliver as Master Chief John James 'Jack' Urgayle and the rest of the cast is nothing less than good. They bring this movie up one or two levels, no doubt about it.<br/><br/>As for the music it's good in it self, but the use of it is rather odd. They use some pretty tense action music for some scenes set in a slow paced political meetings. No doubt it makes the scenes more action filled and make them seem less boring, but you're not used to the combination and it seems really odd and misplaced. As for action sequences, they're tense and good. The music is generally good, both the original and non-original.<br/><br/>The cinematography is all over good. The composition of the shots as well as the lightning is good, but what really caught my attention as really nice was the effects of the very quick shock zoom at the ambush near the end. They make good use of the camera and it's all quite nice to look at. <br/><br/>I'd also have to mention the production design witch struck me as quite cool and fitting. The locations on the beach and in Libanon is quite nice as well. <br/><br/>G.I. Jane is not the film of the century, nor the decade. The back of my DVD-case reads: ""If you are to watch one action movie in your life, G.I. Jane is it!"". I can think of a couple of others I'd see before this one, but it's not a waste of time. I'd say this movie don't use it's full potential and had the writing been better this could've been a must see. Still it ends up as one that's just ""worth a look""."

","The rating of this movie is farcical: GI Jane is wholly underrated. Women in positions that would by conventional logic require the physical aptitude and the presence of males is a subject that isn't broached often enough. I don't have an agenda as per the subject, but I feel that it's fascinating and worthy of further study. Demi Moore becomes a Navy SEALs, the most ""intensive training program known to man."" Usually there are two categories of these kinds of butch femme characters, sexy actresses who try to be tough soldiers, and actresses who convincingly portray soldiers. Demi is a little bit more of the former than latter, bringing her attitude on the platter of a nice body. <br/><br/>The political play of the movie is disregarded as unrealistic. Why? It's obvious that much of this ""women-in-combat"" experiment is conducted at the highest levels of Congress and the Executive branch. The only thing that I could see happening in a scenario like this is a massive lawsuit by military figures to stop this woman going through BUD/S, unless they were co-opted by superior officers, which I think that they are in this film.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I feel that the performances are quite excellent. GI Jane's Master Chief Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) was one of the reasons I got excited to see LotR. All of the minor supporting roles, Anne Bancroft, the general who operates the SEAL base, all evince their roles with skill. The only complaint I have is with the shallowness of the supporting cast, such characters Slovnik and Cortez, both who doubt ""GI Jane"" with a passion bordering insubordinance. Their characters are highly unprofessional and in my opinion would lack the fortitude to execute orders in a real combat situation. <br/><br/>A deeply underrated project whose commentary on the modern social ambiguities regarding gender and sex is pitiably ignored."

","First point: this is a Disney movie so Disney ethics will prevail in the long run.  Also, Disney movies excel at making environments artificial, as what happens here.  Look at how plain Libya looks compared to Zucchabar in 'Gladiator'.<br/><br/>Second point: this is a post-'Legend' Ridley Scott movie.  Hence this is more of an experiment than an accomplished film.  Also, Scott thinks more about the eye (particularly in rhythm with the scene) rather than the script.  This is unlike Scorcese, Spielberg, and Jackson.<br/><br/>What makes this interesting is Scott's crew.  Marilyn Vance is one of the best costume designers in the business, a plus if you're into that sort of thing.  The photographer and composer are mindless (the latter wants to be Hans Zimmer, just listen), but more importantly, this marks the start of collaboration between Scott and Pietro Scalia.  Pietro didn't quite catch on to what Scott was trying to do here (especially compared to his work on 'JFK'), but by 'Gladiator' the two had achieved a rhythm.<br/><br/>You can see Bruckheimerisms here that haunted Tony Scott, Ridley & Pietro learned and evaded them the next time.

I decided to finally watch the entire thing.<br/><br/>Now, being a woman myself, i found this movie to be very empowering and inspiring.  I believe that Demi Moore gave an awesome performance.

Now, this movie may just be that it touched on a personal level, but I believe that it really shows what women are capable of.  And I love the fact that O'Neil did not try to beat out the men, but just tried to be accepted as one of them, which is a lot more realistic.<br/><br/>I can understand how a lot of men would not like this movie because of the power that women have in it.  Not trying to insult anyone, I believe that many men feel that their masculinity is in danger when they see a woman competing with men, and holding their own.

Demi Moore is Lt. Jordan O'Neil. She gives a credible performance as both an actor and as a fine physical specimen.

If you're either expecting ""Private Benjamin"" or a Shoot-em-up action-adventure, then this is probably not the one for you, but if not, and provided you can leave your skepticism and or pre-conceived ideas at the door, you might just, as I did, find yourself pleasantly entertained.<br/><br/>

","Sir Ridley Scott is undoubtedly one of the finest contemporary film directors of our time and GI Jane is another example of his finely honed cinematic skill. The movie accurately depicts SEAL training and manages to thematically intertwine the advantage women bring to roles of combat. The protagonist Jordan O'Neill a topographical analyst with Naval Intelligence is recruited as a test case for SEAL training. Although physically dwarfed by the other candidates O'Neill's ""academic evolution"" is significantly greater than many on her team. This aspect of feminine intelligence is highlighted again and again within the screenplay and evokes in O'Neill a strength and resiliency that allows her to ""gut it out"". Like his other tremendous films Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down and Gladiator, GI Jane is a tapestry of the complexity of the human condition and the need to use all our strengths in times of crisis.

Some compare it to Bruckheimer works etc. etc. whatever...<br/><br/>On a personal note, for the men, this is a film that can appeal to the machismo side of hoo-ahh, while for women, it makes a statement whether that was its intended purpose or not.  Regardless, if one is able to step away from preconceived notions and ""suspend disbelief,"" it might be found to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Because the DVD has no extras, we cannot know exactly what might have been intended other than to fill theater seats, which is the ultimate purpose of most Hollywood movies.  I'm sure old interviews might be tracked down, but who cares, really?<br/><br/>Technically, I think it is well done. I dug (spoilers) the ominous tone of the cinematography like a thunderstorm about to wash over one. I do agree with another reviewer that Demi Moore has picked some rotten tomatoes as far as works in which to star, but I thought this was one of her best.

In return, bases in her home state would not be closed and she could get re-elected. When O'Neal appeared to be headed for success, the senator orchestrated trumped-up charges of behavior unbecoming an officer, lesbian fraternization, so she would be on office duty pending the investigation. O'Neal got back in to finish her training when her boyfriend realized the truth, and O'Neal threatened to expose the senator.<br/><br/>And, as a final punctuation mark to the story, in a final training exercise they were pressed into service to recover a stray satellite that fell in Iran, a gun battle ensured, O'Neal got to save the Master Chief who had tried so hard to get her to drop out.<br/><br/>Not a great film, but a very, very good one, regarding the lesson to accept others, and also to be dedicated to a cause.

","I suppose that's what the film makers would want us to shout at the screen while watching G.I. Jane.  I had a few other choice expletives in mind. This gritty, unpleasant Demi Moore vehicle in which she stars and co-produces is certainly slick and classy looking. We wouldn't expect less from director Ridley Scott, the man who gave us Blade Runner and Alien. Ms. Moore, with grim determination and nary an ounce of humor, plays Jordan O'Neil, a Navy lieutenant accepted as the first woman in the SEAL training program. Moore is way more convincing as a combat-ready soldier than was Meg Ryan in Courage Under Fire. Here Jordan, nicknamed ""G.I. Jane,"" is certainly sinewy and impressively buffed, able to do one-armed push-ups and upside-down sit-ups for hours on end. Her sourness, however, prevents us from rooting for Jordan/Jane to make it through the impossibly grueling SEAL boot camp. I think I would have preferred Sgt. Benjamin! The faux feminism of Jane seems to be saying that to be equal, women must be men. Jordan's battle cry is the anatomically impossible ""Suck my..."" -- well, you know what goes with Jane and Spot. The torturama reaches its long-awaited climax in a Washington showdown with power-wielding politicos who can put an end to Jordan/Jane's misery (and ours). Wait. It's not over yet. Another 20-30 minutes of senseless action are tacked on to try our patience even more. See Jane fight. And fight. And fight. See Jane save the life of her sadistic Master Chief. See Jane kick Libyan ass! Women in the military are having a tough enough time these days without Hollywood trivializing it all to assuage some star ego. As a crusader for gender sensitivity (and shorter haircuts), Moore is less. On the other hand, any movie that features Ms. Moore being tortured and abused for 120 minutes can't be all bad. It delivers much the same perverse satisfaction as an action effort that kills off Steven Seagal in the first 10 minutes (Executive Decision)."

I particularly liked that the woman chosen was realistically physically equipped to handle the role.  she's cut, not some little tiny woman that would never be able to make it through Seals training.  This was a good military movie, and did a very good job of showing what Seals training is really like.  So it's a little unrealistic that a woman could actually be admitted and allowed in to the Navy Seals...so what...that's not because she couldn't handle it..it's cause a bunch of ***holes run things and don't allow it.  Maybe this movie is realistic, and once those in charge see that...maybe it will become reality.  Not every woman is strong enough to go through that kind of training, but not every man is either.  So why not think it realistic that if it were allowed to happen, it would?  Plus, it's only a movie...since when are movies supposed to be completely based on reality?"

","I saw this on TV and was intrigued to watch it, because I seem to recall that the reviews at the time were not promising.  Nevertheless I did enjoy it, although some of the expletives coming out of Demi's mouth seemed a bit forced.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the ending was warm and schmaltzy and the circumstances that lead her to being taken off and then allowed back as part of the trainees strained credibility.<br/><br/>Still better than I expected, I think the publicity about it got out of hand which is a pity.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"
"BGW Claw","8","0","3","30 July 2001"," A vastly underrated film, great Ridley Scott...
","Ridley Scott, one of the world's top directors, made a great film in 1997 that got trashed by the critics, but Heaven knows why.  I know...because critics are morons.  This is a great military film, packed with tension, good dialog, excellent cinematography, and great performances.  This is definitely worth seeing and I hope they do a special edition DVD in the near future.  I give the film a 93 or an 8/10.  Can't wait for Scott's next military-themed venture, 2002's BLACK HAWK DOWN.  Ridley rules!"
"navyaircrewman","Null","0","1","3 October 2000"," Typical Hollywood, realism be damned
","I have seen this movie actually a couple of times.  I can't say that I don't enjoy watching it for the entertainment factor.  That being said, I can see a potential time where a woman could make it through Special Warfare training.  I have known a couple of women that became Rescue Swimmers (probably the second hardest school in the Navy) that if the opportunity were given to them they could probably make it. The movie depicts SEAL training in VA, when in actuality it is in Coronado, CA.  SERE training is done completely separately from SEAL training and usually includes other branches of the military as well as other occupations (pilots, aircrew,).  The movie is fun to watch if you don't try to find realism in your military movies.  Navy Seals (starring Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen) was the same type of movie, exciting action adventure, total BS when it comes to the realism factor.  But after all that is why we go to the movies.  To disbelieve. If you expect this movie to be an accurate portrayal of SEAL/SERE training, you will be grossly disappointed.  If you want to see a movie where the female overcomes adversity and are fine with movies that make up for what they lack in dialogue, by filling it with action, then this movie is definitely for you."
"nlloyd33","10","0","3","21 August 2000"," the most realistic seal movie other than the girl issue.
","I liked this movie a lot, it was definitely the most realistic seal movie i've seen. The only reason I said ""the girl issue,"" is because I'm not sure about it. In the future women might join the Seals, but they haven't yet. So on that part it is unrealistic. One of the things I liked in this movie, was that it all added up to all the seal books i've read. A lot of other movies including, Navy Seals, and Under Siege just don't add up the realism of the Seals. I definitely recommend the movie to any military or special forces movie fan. R-strong language, brief nudity, some basic training violence, and adult content. ***out of*****"
"joely-3","10","0","3","17 June 2000"," Anne Bancroft as Senator Lillian DeHaven is Oscar worthy...
","G.I. Jane was a fine movie that effectively combined drama, politics, and brutal action in one. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen are powerful leads, but the real attention-getter is Oscar Winner Anne Bancroft, who plays a Texas Democrat Senator Lillian DeHaven. Not only is it rare to see a high-ranking female politician played in movies, but it is exceptionally rare to see a high-powered female military figure as Bancroft was. As Senator Lillian DeHaven, she played the chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Military Arms & Actions who promises an appointment to Secretary of the Navy to a gentleman who allows her to enter G.I. Jane (Moore) in the elite Navy Seals program. Senator DeHaven is up for re-election in Texas, and she is expected to loose unless she can gain publicity, which she deceitfully uses G.I. Jane for... Excellent Movie"

","I first thought this movie to be a complete flop... Ratings low, poor concept, and basically...not good at all. But then I hired it out. The movie itself was great.

"sutcal","8","0","2","22 December 1999"," IF it's action you want you will like this...but don't take it too seriously
","Upon first viewing GI Jane is an enjoyable action flick, providing you don't take it too seriously.  The problem with the movie is that I got the impression there were some serious issues that were being preached throughout through Moore's character and the stereotypical male co-stars. Equality in the military, women are as good as men, women lead saves the day, take women seriously in combat etc.<br/><br/>If you think about those aspects too much, you tend to see the stereotypical characters and the movie loses its appeal.<br/><br/>Demi Moore plays Lt Jordan O'Neil who seems to have a mix of qualities ranging from Ripley (aliens), Mayo (Officer and a gentlemen and MAverick (Top Gun).  Moore is physically attractive but also has bulked up for this role.  Her acting is not really pushed here, however she does malke a passable Navy Seal.<br/><br/>I liked Viggo Mortensen who plays the role of Master Chief John Urgayle. He is the consumate prick of a master sergeant, just like the really can be. He pushes O'Neil all the way whilst really having a growing inner respect and liking for her.  Unfortunatley the ending of the movie spoils the relationship that had been built until then.  It was too ""warm and fuzzy"" and became the ""women proves she can handle it and gets respect of superior"" finish that was inevitable.<br/><br/>Anne Bancroft as Sen Lillia De Haven is also good. The manipulative politician uses O'Neil for political gain and sells out as quickly as she bought in.  Again the disappointment in the movie came in the ""win"" O'Neil gets from De Haven ( I won't spoil the plot other than to say for such a tough Senator she caved in like a deck of cards)<br/><br/>The other main character is O'Neils love interest Royce (played by Jason Beghe who I last saw in Cab to Canada).  Another stereotypical male who doubts at first, becomes a convert and then supports O'Neil all the way. I like Beghe's acting and am sure that he will have a few more semi-leading roles in the near future.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was entertaining and worth watching.  I caution you not to read too much into the messages that the movie delivers.  To do that would require you to take the whole movie too seriously and it quite simply isn't strong enough dramatically for this to work.  As an action flick, thumbs up."
"Jim-288","6","0","1","16 December 1999"," Good until final act
","The film was actually very good--until the final act.  The ""tacked"" on battle was gratuitous and did little to serve the story.  I'd read that Ridley originally shot Moore's character dying in action, which would have reinforced the idea that she was a political pawn"
"sandyode","Null","0","3","24 October 1998"," You don't have to prove yourself - Demi
","Demi Moore is a talented actress - there's no doubt in most of our minds about that.  It seems there may be some doubt about it in Ms. Moore's mind however - why else would she have accepted such a role.  In seeing her on screen in GI Jane - one gets the feeling that Demi is imitating the Little Engine That Could.  Instead of her true acting ability shining through one senses a desperateness that is evident on the screen - Demi is mentally telling herself, ""I think I can act this role..."" and all other sounds are background to this din.  Sorry Demi!"
"Danimal-7","6","0","1","8 September 1999"," Sloppy but good-hearted movie
","(Minor spoilers).<br/><br/>G.I. JANE is the story of Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore), who is selected to become the first woman to undertake combat training with the Navy SEALs. It is intended that, if she is successful, Congress will debate opening combat roles in the military to women. O'Neil must face the hellish rigors of the training, administered harshly and meticulously by master Chief Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen), as well as overcoming the hostility and uncooperativeness of her fellow trainees, and the political machinations of the Senator who selected her.<br/><br/>The plot of G.I. JANE is a lamentable mess. At one point, O'Neil takes the irrevocable step of resigning from the program, only to promptly be let back in and allowed to continue. What? The sequences of the SERE island training are simply absurd; no trainees could take that amount of punishment without being hospitalized for weeks with multiple fractures. And there is the oh-so-predictable, oh-so-stupid gimmick of dropping the trainees into actual combat at the end.<br/><br/>There is also the question of the realism of O'Neil's success. I will not deny that there are women who could make it through combat training; it's been done, in other countries and times. But it's a fact that such women are very rare exceptions to the rule. And G.I. JANE makes it quite clear that Senator DeHaven has passed over the best-qualified female candidates and selected O'Neil, a comm officer, principally for her appearance rather than her physical abilities. I just can't believe that any woman less than the very best in the field could pass SEAL training, when the program eliminates nearly half of the men who take it on.<br/><br/>But G.I. JANE recovers in heart what it lacks in brains. O'Neil's determination to be treated as an equal, even when that treatment isn't nice, is laudable. The symbol of this attitude, of course, is how she shaves her head. But it is present everywhere else in the movie; she refuses special privileges, objects to an aide in the obstacle course, and even sleeps in the men's barracks. In a world where whiny feminists use unequal treatment as an excuse and a crutch to be discarded when no longer convenient, O'Neil insists on truly equal treatment, and I have to admire her for it.<br/><br/>However, the movie's treatment of the issues surrounding women in the military is very simplistic and deceptive. At one point, when Urgayle points out that men will unreasonably endanger themselves to save women in combat, thus risking their units, O'Neil dismissively responds that if you save a man, you're a hero, but if you save a woman, you're taking an unjustified risk. This is not true, as those who've seen SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or FULL METAL JACKET should realize; both movies show how soldiers are sometimes forced to let a sniper's victim die alone because going out to rescue him will merely get other men shot too. I'm not saying the problem is insoluble; after all, much of military discipline consists of training people to ignore such natural instincts as running like hell. But complex problems such as Urgayle raises will not go away merely because they are ignored. At the same time, the movie ignores what I always felt was the strongest argument in favor of women in combat: the historical instances where women fought successfully on the winning side in World War II, Vietnam, and the Israeli revolution, among others.<br/><br/>Demi Moore will never be a great actress, but she successfully shows O'Neil's fiery determination. Viggo Mortensen does a virtuoso job as Urgayle, though the ambiguous writing of his part makes it seem sometimes that he is playing two different men. Mortensen is one of the few actors who can play nearly any role he is handed; what two more different characters can you imagine than Urgayle in this movie and Weps in CRIMSON TIDE? Anne Bancroft is so good at impersonating ex-Texas governor Ann Richards that I didn't mind the fact that her part was a laughable stick-figure villain. Trevor Jones' suspense-building score is the only thing that makes the last scenes bearable.<br/><br/>G.I. JANE is entertaining, and it at least tries to put out serious thoughts for consideration, even if it isn't very good at it. Give it a look sometime.<br/><br/>Rating: **1/2 out of ****."
"daPeda","4","0","4","5 June 1999"," So what!?
","In Austria, they are just beginning letting women into the army (though there's nothing like the SEALS here - at least to my knowledge). Anyway, the movie was entertaining although it certainly had its lengths not filled with thought provoking material. Now, one day after watching the movie, I've already almost forgotten it. This leads to my rating 4 out of 10."
"Strawb-2","Null","0","1","21 May 1999"," Better than I expected
","I saw this after all the bad press had died down and was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I thought Demi Moore's performance was gritty, emotional and even believable (although I'm not a military expert).  Her character was strong yet human showing how determined some people get the more others knock 'em down.  Given Demi's alleged reputation for vanity, she showed little of it here and that warmed me to her. She expressed a woman torn between ambition and circumstance who doesn't want to be a figurehead - just a a good soldier. Do you think she saw ""Aliens"" before?? Just curious<br/><br/>But the standout performance for me was Viggo Mortensen.  It is so easy for actors to portray military figures as one dimensional.  As Argayle, he was strong and smart - showing excellent tactical cunning and physical stamina. I'm not sure how many SEALS read Pablo Keruda but Mortensen showed more than your average ""grunt"" with his D.H. Lawrence quotations. This shows that brains and brawn are needed but it did stretch the imagination a little. Not sure about the moustache though ..... that's from a feminine perspective.<br/><br/>Okay - it was far fetched in many ways;I doubt it would be likely that O'Neil would have survived being brutally kicked in the face by the Master Chief's big boots with just a few bruises (shattered cheekbones or broken jaw seems more accurate)..... but hey - its the movies! I even liked the ""she must be a lesbian plotline"". But Ridley Scott is a fine film maker and it shows.<br/><br/>And if Charlie Sheen can be a Navy SEAL - so can Demi.  She'd whip his pampered ass!!!"
"Kimble-3","Null","0","1","18 March 1999"," Three stars, works on a gut level.
","If you hit a man full force in the face, you're gonna do some damage. If a strong, heavy-set Navy Seals instructor/leader hits a woman full force in the face then slams her hard into a solid surface, she's going to sustain some nasty damage which will be quite noticeable for the rest of her life. But in this film, Demi Moore not only survives with nothing much more than a bloody nose but has her hands tied behind her back but still manages to defend herself well. Most of the rest, except for scenes with Ann Bancroft [who is great] are mostly believable, filled with tension and drama. However, on gut level, the film is entertaining. 3 stars out of 5. - John Kimble."
