","This is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and one of the top horror stories ever told.  It's creepy, simplistic, and eerie.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the enchanting simplicity of the plot, the lack of need for ""Hollywood"" special effects, and the haunting atmosphere that loomed over everything from beginning to end.<br/><br/> The first half, or even three quarters, seemed to move along a bit slowly, but it felt necessary to build the suspense to the point where I was biting my nails in anticipation of the inevitable.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman's character, Grace... I was torn between empathy and disgust for her at times, but she definitely succeeded at captivating me with their lives and story.  Predictable in parts, but it still leaves you guessing. This was a quality ghost story, with an old fashioned ambiance; downright spooky.<br/><br/> I was in awe of the ending, a fairly intelligent premise. It's the kind of movie that lets you escape reality for a while by entertaining you, but at the same time, returns you to the ""real world"" with your spine tingling, wondering if there isn't some possibility of truth...  Chilling."
"Coventry","8","231","261","4 November 2004"," Subtle, genuinely creepy and ... SUBTLE
","The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades."
"SteveMadcow","10","145","163","2 December 2001"," ""THE OTHERS is a creepy film... that reminded me of an old 40s or 50s ghost story.""
","The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Grace lives in a mansion with her two children, both allergic to sunlight. That little twist on the story was just great. It makes the film completely opposite than other ghost stories, with Grace not afraid of the dark, and making sure to keep the light out, to save her children. This provides us with a very creepy, and dark atmosphere. Plus the mansion is also a creepy place. Not to mention, that in the film everyone who enters the house, must close the previous door, before opening the next.<br/><br/>
Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast in The Others. This may be one of her best performances ever (She was also great in this years Moulin Rouge). She was really very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently, who played Nicolas, really seemed like siblings. Awesome job by both. Fionnula Flanagan was also fantastic as Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out, and I didn't know where she stood. Was she good or bad? I didn't know, but her acting was right on the ball.<br/><br/>Alejandro Anemabar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is beautiful. This guy's has got a bright future. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director, Alejandro Amenabar. The music is creepy, and really adds to the feel of a 50's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film, and makes the scary scenes, even scarier. The score is fabulous. Not only did Alejandro Amenabar direct, and score, but he wrote the great, and well-developed screenplay.<br/><br/>The Others is not without a great twist ending, that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming, and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well, and I was speechless after the film. Outstanding finale.<br/><br/>This film is yet another horror film that proves that big budget special effects suck! This film is scary, and it only had a $17m budget. The Others did great at the box office, and deserved every buck it earned. It's a creepy film, that has its very scary moments. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. This really reminded me of an old 40's or 50's film. I highly recommend this film to every fan of ghost stories.<br/><br/>The Others: 10/10, A+"
"mercybell","10","117","136","10 August 2001"," A Beautiful Drama Entangled in Intense Thrills and Chills
","It's funny that I see this movie the way I do, perhaps I'm more perceptive to little dramatic, human touches, but I saw this movie and was satisfied with it. In fact, I fell in love with it. This movie is chilling, very spooky, with a few moments that will make you jump, but it's a movie that works itself up, and by the end of the movie you feel scared, and like someone has zapped you a few times, chilly from inside out, but fulfilled.<br/><br/>People have been comparing this to ""Sixth Sense"". Though the movie may share similarities, this stands on it's own. It's content is not trying to send a message, except for a universal theme that you want to grasp onto. There is historical and religious content, purely in context for the twists and turns and nuances to make this film so complete in every aspect. Everything works so well. This movie takes pride in each scene, and each is set up so that you get the most of it. Everything relates to everything, you are given clues the entire movie, but it's set up so masterfully the ending is the suprise you've been waiting for.<br/><br/>The performance by Kidman and the two children are one of a kind. It's a realistic interaction between siblings and a controlling, dysfunctional, but loving mother. The acting and writing (the script) is so well done, it adds for scattered scenes that will, hopefully, stick around with you for a long time. There's this one beautiful scene in the movie, it's where Grace (Nicole Kidman) is hugging her son, and her daughter (who is slightly estranged from her mom) runs up and hugs her, and there this look of absolute release on the face of Grace. Another great scene is when Grace carries her rifle around the house (shoot the ghost!), and she's desperately trying to protect her house and children.  There are more like that, so keep your eyes open.<br/><br/>The cinematography is innovative and brilliant, camera angles and the lighting set everything up so well. The lighting is very important as well, in fact, the subject of ""light"" is so well mixed into the story, the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does. There are times when you long for the darkness, just as the characters long for the darkness (due to a part of the plot including a health condition of the children, which serves a basis for the mental thrill fest to come). To finish off this concoction, try to listen to the score, because it's very fitting.<br/><br/>This is more of a drama than a thriller, though it deserves to be a thriller (it's scary), but the power of it's dramatic side comes bursting through. This is a beautiful movie, it has overtones of a more serious side, and it's a movie that hardly belongs in  the horror section because of it's beauty, but it's too darned eerie, weird, and chilling to fit anywhere else."
"overthetop10","10","132","157","15 August 2001"," Nicole Kidman rules!
","If I had to sum up this movie in a word, it would be ""chilling.""  The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film.  It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.<br/><br/>Writer/director/composer Alejandro Amenabar creates a dark, dark atmosphere, in which you feel like you can't trust anyone.  Nicole Kidman, in her brilliant performance as Grace, is supposedly the ""heroine"" of the film, but as I watched the movie I found myself more frightened of her than rooting for her; steely and overbearing, with a hint of psychotic hysteria in her icy eyes.  And then the children, (held their own and even stole a few scenes from the more experienced players) were just hellishly creepy.  The little girl was one of the most ominous characters I have ever seen in a film.  And the servants (who were also finely played) will keep you guessing the whole way through.  Every time you think you have it figured out, some of the household help will pop up and throw the whole framework off-kilter.<br/><br/>The real attraction in this film is Nicole Kidman, following up her bravura performance as Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"" with a woman teetering between insanity and iron control.  Grace has so many layers, and Kidman reveals almost all of them through her face.  The film is anchored by her presence, and she plays off the other actors extremely well -- note the tense relationship she has with Anne, her daughter.  When the two lock eyes, it's like watching two trains crash head-first into one another.<br/><br/>The only disappointment in this movie is the ending, which is slightly anti-climactic.  When you get to it, you'll be satisfied, and it ties up everything that's happened in the movie up to that point quite well.  But it seemed almost anti-climactic, and I was left feeling a little bit let down.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave The Others a 9/10."

"BermudezLievano","10","187","231","26 November 2001"," Perfect.... a master at work
","Alejandro Amenábar is a very young and talented director, born in Chile and raised in Spain. He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodóvar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29).<br/><br/> The best comparison I can make of this film is to a piece of clockwork. Precise, exact, nothing is gratuitous or excessive.... What a subtle charm this film works on you as a spectator. The screenplay is one of the best of this genre I have seen in the last few years, very carefully revised and misleading, yet at the end everything makes perfect sense, not the mention on the second time you watch it.<br/><br/> It is true that many of the film's features and details may be traced to classic films of the genre, but there is nothing wrong with that. The director himself said it was an homage to directors like Alfred Hitchcock (to whom he has been compared somewhat prematurely.... he may reach such height but he still has a long road to walk). That is one of the great things about the film; it takes the best of the genre, the best that has been made by the best directors... it's a film lover's delight.<br/><br/> I had never thought Nicole Kidman could have been at the height of the project, as I really have never considered her a great actress. All I can say is I am still dumbfounded by her extraordinary performance... really, a large percentage of the film's success can be related to her. Sober and discreet when needed, yet grand all the same... It does remind some of the most elegant names of classic Hollywood cinema like the Bette Davis of All about Eve or the Katharine Hepburn of The African queen. But it would be really selfish to give her all the credit when she was supported by an extraordinary cast. Fionnula Flanagan (the sweet old lady from Waking Ned Devine) is trully magnificent as the governess, Mrs. Mills, and very surprising performances of a mute and an old gardener are given by Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes. The children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) are also fantastic.<br/><br/> Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamín Fernández and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people.<br/><br/> I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, La stanza del figlio, The shipping news, The hours and Italiensk for begyndere, but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 10/10 is really fair for a film that has it all, a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of big-time projects that waste his potential.<br/><br/> It is a film to feast on.. to savour, to enjoy, to remember...."

","The Stewart household is a strange one. An isolated house in the Isle of Jersey, it's constantly enveloped in thick, blue fog, all doors must remain closed, and drapes block the sunlight because the children suffer from an illness in which they are extremely sensitive to it. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, finally coming to her own in a story worthy of her talents), wakes up one morning screaming from what may have been a nightmare. Three strangers arrive to the house and they tell Grace they are replying for her request for domestic help -- and almost immediately, though subtly, strange events begin happening and it slowly becomes clear that there are other unseen, unwanted people occupying their quarters. This only becomes more evident when Grace discovers, to her horror, that these servants are more than what they seem to and that her own reality is not what she believes it to be.<br/><br/>Alejandro Amenabar had already caught the attention of Tom Cruise who produced and starred in his own remake of OPEN YOUR EYES, which gave Cameron Diaz a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and here he establishes himself for the American movie going public with his follow-up. Again going for clever storytelling -- even if it takes a while to take off -- and relying on atmosphere rather than on expensively produced special effects, it's a showcase for Nicole Kidman who carries the entire film on her shoulders and who conveys furious determination to protect her household and absolute terror at the unknown forces against her with intense verve. Fionulla Flannagan and Christopher Eccleston provide some interesting foils to her dominant presence, but the real star is the film itself, who never goes for a quick cheat to fabricate its denouement (diametrically opposed to what M. Night Shyamalan's style where the twist is everything). Already a contemporary classic, it will go down in cinema history as an updated take on THE HAUNTING, with more finely tuned performances, even darker atmosphere, and a rising sense of dread."
"LtCol_Kilgore","8","99","125","26 September 2001"," Suspenseful, stylish horror film ***/****
","The others ***/****<br/><br/> ""The Others"" is a suspenseful horror film unlike many these days. Most are concerned with blood and gore, teenage girls getting naked, body count, and not scary. ""The Others"" is atmospheric, spooky, bloodless, and carried by strong acting and fleshed out characters. Yet, it takes too long to make an impact and the final payoff is not as shocking as it should be.<br/><br/> The plot is simple and not especially innovative (your average ghost story), but it seems fresh thanks to strong acting and a well-crafted, eerie atmosphere that rivals that of a Tim Burton film. Nicole Kidman is Grace, a beautiful young married mother who must raise her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) alone in their gigantic (actually, ridiculously large) mansion on a British isle, around the end of WWII. They are alone, for the husband and father has been at war and has not returned, and their housekeepers mysteriously vanished. Suddenly, a trio of friendly caretakers arrive one day. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) is the amiable old lady, Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) is a mute young girl, and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) is the not-so-social gardener. However, there is a strange, arcane facet to the trio; they have little background and had no way of knowing that Grace was offering positions at her manor. Aside from this, Grace must deal with her children, who have a deadly allergy to light, which means that the house must be dark all the time, allowing for a spooky dark, shadowy ambience. Anna and Nicholas, most importantly, have been visited - by a family of ghosts. Noises - crying, piano music, and running - have been heard. And curtains that stop light from entering the house are opening and closing by themselves. The film is based around Grace's efforts to solve the enigma.<br/><br/>I love the atmosphere of ""The Others,"" set in a nostalgic and ominous 1940's estate. Snowy mist blankets the grass and crisp fall leaves. Murky waters of a lake border the chateau. Elegant furniture, polished marble and wood floors, neatly-woven blankets, tautly fabricated furnishings of wood and olive green cloth, coal black German sedans, lightly wrinkled sweaters and jackets are all seemingly authentic from the era. One spectacular and tense scene has Grace haplessly stumbling through an impenetrably thick ocean of milky fog that weaves through overhanging trees and a ground of crunchy bronze and russet leaves.<br/><br/>The action takes a while to get started up, which is a major negative. This is due to the director, Amenabar, spending time to develop an involving plot, 3-D characters, and the aforementioned décor. While Amenabar succeeds in those respects, we find ourselves wishing something would happen. Many people will easily become bored, feel tempted to sleep or leave, etc., but I, while not exactly enthralled by that point in the film, was still enjoying it.<br/><br/>When we finally are treated to doses of suspense and chills (not so much horror and terror), it is satisfying. You most likely will find yourself on the edge of your seat or huddled in a ball anxiously awaiting the potentially fatal results of Grace's investigation. This is not so much because you care about her character, but really because you expect a sudden scream and heart-stopping outburst of maniacal ghosts. Most scenes are chilling, including the door shutting in the piano room, the old lady in the white dress, and the final chaotic conclusion. However, I can not say that I was truly horrified and paranoid from this film, unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" where I was freaked out for months. I was still very entertained.<br/><br/>I must commend all the actors in the film, especially Nicole Kidman. The acting was down to earth and realistic, despite Nicole Kidman forced into saying some foolish lines (""Something.. Diabolical!). The two child actors, Mann and Bentley, were excellent in a fairly difficult role for children.<br/><br/> Another important downside to the film was the ""shocking"" conclusion. While I must admit that I found it brilliant, it lacked the powerful punch I wish it had. I don't know why this is, it just isn't. I am disappointed at how much potential the ending could have packed and how little it did.<br/><br/> Overall, I found ""The Others"" a highly entertaining thriller with magnetic milieus and plenty of startles."
"Kyle007","9","61","81","11 March 2005"," What a twist!!! Scary to the last moments, specially at the last moments
","First of all, i have to say that this year (2001) is the one that established Nicole Kidman as a superstar, she was an ""A"" actress, but here she became ""A+"", first and mainly with Moulin Rouge and then with this superb movie, i have to say that i saw a few people who gave this great movie a 10, i rate it with a 10 only because there is nothing higher, but i'm sure it deserves a lot of credit.<br/><br/>And i have also seen many people complaining of the ""borrowed storyline"" (Comparing ""the others"" with ""Sixth sense""), bah they touch the same topic of life (and death actually), but this one has a more religious view, and makes you think a lot about that.<br/><br/>Nicole did a great job in this movie, nobody can't deny it, her role as a lovely but at moments almost gone crazy mother of 2 was a dualistic and strange thing that fitted perfectly well in the story. All the supporting actors did a great performance as well.<br/><br/>The plot, the plot, i think it couldn't have been better, i don't want to tell you anything about it, so you can have the surprise i had when i first saw it, but the best of all is that you are almost as surprised the first time you see it than the second, and the third, and the fourth...... You just want to see it again, because you experience a feeling that only a few, but a few few movies give you; a strong chill crosses your whole body, it is fear, but you like it anyway, it is a fear that awakes curiosity, curiosity for what is happening next...<br/><br/>And what a spectacular, but necessary addition is the environment of the movie: an old mansion at the times of War world II, permanent darkness and haze, dead-like servants, photosensitive children so that the house had to be kept in an absolute darkness, no electric light........could it be more scary?? I don't think so.<br/><br/>And by the way, this is a proof that a movie doesn't need amazing special effects, even more, i think this movie doesn't even have special effects, it is all in the way the story is told, nothing more....and nothing less, something that seems to be hard these days.........<br/><br/>But i'll stop talking, if you are reading my comment, just stop and go to your nearer video shop and buy it, or rent it at least..........you won't be disappointed..............believe me."
"FilmOtaku","7","76","103","6 November 2004"," A throwback to the great spooky Gothic films
","Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.<br/><br/>With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. <br/><br/>'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10<br/><br/>Shelly"

The plot is very well disclosed and the entire cast has magnificent performances. Nicole Kidman is very beautiful before her plastic surgery of the nose and has a top-notch performance. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Outros"" (""The Others"")"
"Manthorpe","8","75","106","23 January 2004"," Fairly decent and original concept.
","I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because ""scary"" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>First off, I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense, so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.<br/><br/>Grace (Kidman) and her two young photosensitive (X.P.) children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition, all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants, strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later, she will have to come to terms with what's going on...<br/><br/>Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie, and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films, I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn, hard nosed, uptight tart, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two, and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere, partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive, the house must always be dark, and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well, the fog, which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well, and is well placed and executed.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects, and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out, and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband, I would have ranked it higher.<br/><br/>
Easily a solid 8/10."

","I watched THE OTHERS simply because Christopher Eccleston in it , a future DOCTOR WHO in a scary movie , now this I've got to see , but to be honest Eccleston's role is little more than cameo while the always consistent Nicole Kidman isn't the real star of the movie - It's writer/director Alejandro Amenabar <br/><br/>From the opening shots where the servants arrive at Grace Stewart's house I had the story pegged as to where it was going . Grace is an absolute nutter isn't she ? But then the story twists and turns a little and then I thought she might be a victim , I mean these servants ... But the story keeps twisting along nicely so that the script is one step ahead of the audience . There is a slight problem though if you're familiar to Amenabar's work , especially ABRE LOS OJOS and that is that he's a master of the shock twist ending and I thought with the appearance of Eccleston's Charles Stewart half way through the movie I had the story sussed . I actually did work out how he fitted into the story and was correct in guessing his fate but I never believed in what the twist ending was so well done Senor Amenabar <br/><br/>There is a problem with this type of story and THE OTHERS is no different in that respect - You can only enjoy the movie once since you know the shock twist at the end when you see it a second , third , fourth time and there's another very successful film ( No clues but you'll know the one I'm talking about after you see this ) that has the same idea which means comparison's are inevitable , but it's difficult to compare to one another . Certainly THE OTHERS has a more creepy atmosphere and probably a better pace and cast with special mention going to Alakina Mann as Anna who plays her role as a totally convincing horrid brat , nice to know Amenabar has resisted the temptation to portray the children as sugery sweet little cherubs which is often the case in Hollywood movies , you might not believe this but THE OTHERS in fact is a Spanish film"

","At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, 'The Others' is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.<br/><br/>'The Others' is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children's condition, and Grace's husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there's no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don't exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can't deny there is something ominous about the house...<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn't always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.<br/><br/>'The Others' is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of 'The Exorcist' and 'The Devil's Backbone', it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters' motives are right to the end.<br/><br/>This film has to be one of the best horror films I've ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright."

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","4","6 November 2019"," This supernatural gothic horror film is otherworldly indeed. It's one very creepy movie.
","Set on the British Island of Jersey in the immediate aftermath of WWII, the film written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar follows the story of housewife/mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), being haunted by spirits wanting them to leave. Without spoiling the movie too much, for a film rated PG-13 and not a drop of blood or graphic gore in it. It's scary! It works because how well made the motion picture was. All the camera shots portray the dark picturesque decaying creepy astrosphere with melodramatic psychology fear to a tee. For example the opening title shots with the hand drawn drawing of a house fading into an actual home through an excellent use of transition made it seem like a ghost story was coming to light. While the overall atmosphere of clichés fog and haze does go overboard at times in the film; it does set a mysterious mood to the settlings. Adding to this, the voyeuristic wide shot taken from outside looking in the house through the pane of glass are very powerful. It shows the isolation of the trapped characters to the point that it's very effecting unsettling. I also like how most of the film takes place within dark rooms and dim hallways with flames of candles in lanterns as the only source of light due to the children's photosensitivity sickness. It create a more shadowy feel to the film, creating disoriented and uneasy psychological state within the viewers on what they're seeing and not seeing. A good example of this is the puppet scene. However some of the significant use of mirrors and reflections shots throughout the film don't really go anywhere. You would think it would play both more conscious and subconscious in the character's mind, but its themes are avert for the most part. As for sound. The disembodied voices, strange noises and intense musical music can lead the viewers to believe that something frightening is about to happen, yet, most of the big scares come at the moment where it's quite quiet with not much going on the screen. The film cleverly tricks your senses. Thus making scenes like the piano room jolts hardly predictable. I glad that the movie doesn't really indulge on too many in your face jump scares. The old school approach of not showing much is ambiguous. It's the fear of the unknown that really scare people. As for pacing. The film works best as a slow burn thriller with its runtime. While this might cause some parts of the movie to seem boring with certain amount of static shots, little action & heavy exposition dumps. In the end it does works to build up the tension to the climatic 1999 film 'Six Sense' gotcha type twist ending. Because of that, the movie has a lot of repeat value as there is plenty of clever hints and Easter eggs that lead to that the revelation of the terrible secret besides the gravesites and the oddly out of place post mortem photograph album with the servants like Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). Some examples are the way Grace first picks up the rifle. She's seen looking at the item as it was déjà vu. Another is her frequently complaining about migraines. Even her children peculiarly heavy breathing foreshadows the end. To add onto that, Grace's religious fundamentalism makes a lot of sense when you consider that she interpreted her and her children allegedly continuing to survive after the war as a miracle of God. No wonder why she got super religionist and try to 'live' up to her given name to the point that she berates Anne for questioning what she's been taught by her, and uses biblical stories like limbo to frighten and manipulate her daughter. Kidman was very convincing as the prudish, over-bearing mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world. While her character can be a bit cold & unlikeable. There were some lovely heartfelt motherly love scenes between Grace's psychotic episodes for us not to turn off the movie. As for the children. The acting is a mixed bag. The girl that play Anne was pretty decent in the role, however, I felt that the kid playing Nicholas was below average in certain parts. It didn't help that the lines coming from them felt a little too posh and thick for my taste. They didn't sound like real kids from that era. More like children of pre-WW1. As for the supporting cast. It was alright for the most part, but if the film has any big fault. I really didn't find Christopher Eccleston's role as Charlie that appealing. I felt that his premise didn't really add much to the plot. Plus his character return didn't make much sense with the story that they were telling; much in the same way, a bunch of photographs of corpses posing for portraits can end up in a storing room in a house or a living person can possessed a dead person. Nevertheless, I do dig the some of the audience member's interpretation on the reasons about Grace's pariah state. It really does seem like she might had collaborated with the enemy during the war. Certain scenes points to that being the cause of her madness. No wonder why she didn't want her children to stray too far from Christ. Although, Grace has a strong connect with the lord. The film does takes direct ideological aim at Christian theology. Undermines faith and biblical doctrine calling them dangerous fabrications to the point that some people might find the movie blasphemous. Amenábar really didn't like Catholic school. Regardless of that, overall while this morbidly fascinating movie is probably not going to lift your spirits with its depressing ending & make your love life with your significant other better. It's still otherwise, a very good movie worth checking out. One far from being dead."

"WiseJoeyD","9","17","24","4 November 2001"," Nicole is two for two
","Nicole Kidman is a lucky girl.  She's got two great movies out there.  All in the space of a year and both showcasing her ample talent.  The Others in particular, while devoid of OTT performances, costumes and sing along songs, will appeal to a lot of people.  People who enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' in particular will enjoy it, and those who're into X-Files' will surely enjoy this too.  However, it isn't a slasher thriller, with some ditzy teenagers running around a school chased by a homicidal fisherman. No, it's much more intelligent and, to me, seemed a far slicker movie than even  'Sixth Sense'<br/><br/>It's focus is on a family, after the war, living in an old mansion (prime ghost story location!  Why can't they have a nice semi detached?!).  The children are photosensitive and the house must be kept in darkness and this creates an imposing atmosphere from the off.  The characters, including the mother played by Kidman, seem to have more to them than we are led to believe at the start.  There are noises in the house, the children say they've seen people walking around, the mother seems to on the edge and about to break, and all the while, the creepy atmosphere grows and grows.<br/><br/>
It's strength lies in the fact that it doesn't simply throw the characters into scary situations, (e.g. some man chasing them around the house) to get a reaction from the audience.  It instead creates a sense of dread.  The director uses the camera and sound to merely suggest what's there.  The viewer's mind is allowed to make up the rest (and is much more effective than several million dollars of special effects).  The sound of whispering in an empty room, or the haunting sound of a piano playing from a locked room.  And having creepy maids and gardeners puts the audience at unease, trying to second guess if they're good, bad or evil.<br/><br/>The story takes a lot of dramatic twists and turns.  And in the end, everything is, to paraphrase one of the characters, ""...Changed.  It'll never be the same again.""  The conclusion is one to rival 'Sixth Sense'. You're feelings are towards the characters are completely different, and ""The Others"" of the title are not who you'd have thought they were.<br/><br/>The mother is, of course, the main focus of the story.  Treading, it would seem, a fine line between exploding, and being ready to give up.  At first, it seems sure fire who's good, and who's bad.  But then you feel a growing antipathy towards some characters, and to a certain extent, the mother.  In the end, though, you only feel extremely sorry and sad for the characters, yet angry at some of them too.<br/><br/>This movie, along with Moulin Rouge' was a pleasure to see (well, it was a pleasure in hindsight.  It was definitely in the `too engrossed to move' range when I was in the middle of watching it) and I would recommend it to anyone (except those with baby's or heart conditions)"
"TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom","9","8","10","15 June 2002"," ""The others said they wouldn't. But they did.""
","Imagine: Someone makes a scary thriller...and it actually has a BRAIN! Well, maybe I'm exaggerating, because some other thrillers do. Take ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Vanilla Sky"" for instance. They had plots, and made you think. But take, say, ""House on Haunted Hill"" (the remake)? Blood. Sex. Gore. Bad special effects. Scares? A real plot? Any reason for making the movie whatsoever besides cheap thrills and money? I think not. ""The Others"" isn't gross at all. The character development is good, and the musical score and sound is outstanding. And Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date.<br/><br/>Kidman is Grace, a prim, religious 1940's mother with two photosensitive children, Anne and Nicholas. Every day, instead of school, the children study the Bible by candlelight. (By the way, the setting for the story is great, too. Almost the entire film is shot inside the beautiful but very dark house.) At the beginning, three mysterious servants come to work at the house--even though the advertisement Grace meant to send out never got mailed. This is because, they say, the servants worked in the house before.<br/><br/>Soon, Anne begins mentioning Victor, a boy that assumingly keeps talking to her. While at first it looks like a good plan to scare Nicholas, eventually Grace hears noises in the abandoned room upstairs. The old forbidden piano starts playing after the children and servants are asleep, and even though a door isn't supposed to be opened without the previous one being closed first, Grace keeps seeing the door behind her in the corner of her eye open.<br/><br/>
This might not sound interesting or scary, but you have to see it. The setup for each sudden, frightening moment is about three-quarters of what really scares you, and that's true for most other movies, too. I probably shouldn't go on with the plot, because this is one of the only movies where just one little spoiler ruins the entire movie.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is also probably the only movie that scares you out of your wits every time, not just the first time, and at the same time doesn't give you nightmares for weeks. Probably because none of the scary images are really enough to stick in your head.<br/><br/>The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, are excellent young actors, especially James Bentley. He deserves the Young Artist Award he received for this picture, no question about it, and Alakina Mann deserves her nomination.<br/><br/>I hate to break it to you fans of gory thrillers, but blood and guts just aren't scary. Sure, they're gross, but they're more hokey than frightening, and it looks as if the filmmakers haven't got anything better to lengthen the movie with, like actual content. Movies like ""The Others"" really deserve praise for using things important to the plot, or at least explaining them at the end. I recommend this to anyone who's in the mood for a good scare without the gore."
"sidhu-karna","10","6","7","19 April 2014"," Horror in its original sense
","This movie is about horror- not disgusting horror of mutilated bodies but horror of realizing a simple truth in the end.<br/><br/>Amenabar redefines the horror genre which he did once already with ""Open your eyes"". Acting is top notch. Nicole Kidman including the kids draw us into the world of their banal existence. All the characters have their own quirks which is a treat to watch. The most original thing is the minimalism presented. There are no ear shattering music to irritate in the name of shocking you. Everything including the dialog and the music seem have a reason for existence linking it to the story.<br/><br/>A must watch!"
"hitchcockthelegend","9","7","9","30 May 2011"," No one can make us leave this house.
","The Others is directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar. It stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes, Alakina Mann & James Bentley. Amenábar also scores the music and the cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarobe. Plot sees Kidman as Grace Stewart, the mother of two children who have an allergy to sunlight. With her husband still missing in action during WWII, Grace and the children reside in a remote mansion on the isle of Jersey. When one day a trio of house servants turn up looking to fill the vacancies at the mansion, it coincides with strange supernatural occurrences around the home. Are the children being mischievous? Is Grace losing her mind? Or is there indeed something not of this world at work?<br/><br/>The haunted house creeper has had a number of film version tellings over the years. A different kind of horror film, it's a sub-genre that relies on suggestion and atmospheric shocks instead of rampant blood letting. The Others is one of the finest of its type, a wonderfully crafted chiller that thrives on old fashioned values to deliver its scares. The set up is standard formula stuff, a big gloomy mansion that's nice and remote with rolling gardens and finds itself often cloaked by impenetrable fog. A couple of cherubic kids, classically inviting creepy activity, and servants that have foreboding written all over their respective foreheads. Throw into the pot the lonely female trying to hold her self together as things threaten to unhinge the family bond, and it's so far so formulaic. But Amenábar, for his English language debut, has a great sense of mood and pacing, slowly unwinding the coil to reveal a sense of impending doom, playing it out amongst eerie sounds and deft camera movements about the house. That the kiddies have a light sensitive problem gives Amenábar the perfect excuse to keep the whole thing dimly lit: to great eerie effect.<br/><br/>With unease in place and the small band of characters firmly established, the other key element of the film starts to kick in, namely the mystery element. Just what exactly is going on here? The children, excellently played by débutantes Mann & Bentley, garner much sympathy, but at the same time we suspect they might be at fault for the ghostly activity. The servants are led by the officious looking, but gently spoken, Bertha Mills (Flanagan superb), you sense something isn't quite right but all cards are played close to the chest so as to not reveal anything. So much so that when the reveal does come, it's a doozy, firmly rounding out The Others as a classic of its type. The trump card here, tho, is Kidman. Pale faced and cold to the eye, she nails the plummy English accent whilst turning in a classic performance of a repressed woman battling against-it seems-everything and everyone. Following in the footsteps of Deborah Kerr and Julie Harris, Kidman's ability to make Grace's mental disintegration believable marks it out as one of the best horror sub-genre performances ever.<br/><br/>Suspense, scares and some tricks up its sleeve, The Others is every inch a quality bit of psychological horror. 9/10"

","This movie is no ordinary movie. At first it might look like just another good-mystery horror movie. However, as you watch it twice or three times, you will realize it has a complex thought-provoking subject which many of us would avoid because there are no right answers for the implied subject. Sometimes we will avoid because it can take us to a place we don't want to be very often, which is the boundaries between this world and the ""next"" one, whatever your faith is. Unless you're a totally science person like Stephen Hawking, you know we still struggle to understand the mysteries of this life. Why we are here, how and when we die, and how these events are related. That's the foundation of many of ours issues as humans, fears, uncertainties. To me, the idea of being trapped in a ""limited world"", whether it is a house, a neighborhood or even a city is really scary. It is like, depending how you leave this world, you should stay in limbo, whatever your limbo is, and for what reason? Reflection? I guess, the only remedy what we know will come someday is trying to live your life the best way you can. Follow your dreams, treat the others well and keep your faith, Those who choose to live in the desert might end up going to one. Try to make friends, take care of nature, pets, wild life, you might just cross to be in a better version of what you choose here or the opposite to that matter."

And then the strange sounds start plaguing the family.<br/><br/>The Others works as a horror film because it allows the atmosphere to build. There are very few jump scares, almost none at all, and most of the horror is build on the fact that the mother is slowly losing her mind and is forced to doubt her every decision. The situation itself is strange enough with a lone manor, two children being forced to live indoors for fear of the light and three closemouthed locals, but then the facts start revealing themselves and it ended up being quite different from what I'd imagined.

Hers is the carrying performance of this entire film and she sells it flawlessly. From a stern although caring mother to a determined mistress of a manor to a scared soul trembling in the face of the unknown.

"Cinesnatch","10","3","3","8 May 2003"," Exquisitely tempered pace, wonderful casting, and a crowd-pleasing ending make this one of mainstream Hollywood's best film in years.
","The concept is lovely: Supposedly deceased husband from the war leaves behind wife (played by Nicole Kidman) and two children.  The kids are photosensitive to light so the curtains throughout the mansion must remain closed at all times.  Wife hires a new staff of three and then strange things begin to happen.<br/><br/>The story is so well-thought out to most every detail, which makes the ending so sound and shocking.  `The Sixth Sense' precedes it by two years and regenerated an entire film genre in the Hollywood spectrum.  Typically, that film would stand as the measure of the subsequent submissions, which would slowly degenerate into paler imitations until the phenomenon faded out.  However, I believe that not only has `The Others' one-upped the sense and raised the stakes, but will hold up much better over time.  Not only is the first viewing exciting, but the second viewing shows just how well done this film is.  <br/><br/>The mansion that is the centerpiece for the film is masterfully shot from the attic to the kitchen, with Kidman opening, closing, and locking doors everywhere she goes all the time, as well as constantly drawing the drapes.<br/><br/>There isn't really a weak link in this small troop of a cast.  Kidman delivers an especially anal, unreserved performance as an over-protective British mother who teeters on being borderline psychotic.  The kids are like Christina and Christopher Crawford: the overly headstrong sister and cute, lovable and innocent younger brother.  The maid's kindness, with her sidekicks the mute and the groundskeeper, turns deliciously ominous as we get closer to the secret they carry with them.<br/><br/>""Open Your Eyes"" and ""The Others"" have been two of the best films I've seen in the last five years.

Every scene that he wrote give a sense of the mental dread that the family feels as they progress toward the climax and conclusion. (4) The musical score also enhances the dread. Amenabar is also a musical jack. (5) I love the metaphor of light in a mansion as a water on a sinking ship. (6) The cinematography and lighting leaves no wanting. (7) The events of the story are spooky enough. (8) The last twenty minutes of the film are worth the ticket price alone. (9) The rest of the cast put in excellent performances as well. (10) Truly classic horror methods were used to convey mental dread.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.  Overall, this is a truly spooky film and it should have received an Oscar for either acting, directing, screen writing or even musical score.<br/><br/>PS: Also see ""Abre los Ojos"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" to see Alejandro Amenabar's creative genius at work.  He along with Tom Tykwer are part of a new wave of filmmakers from Europe that have invaded the United States and brought some clarity and sanity to the supposed normalcy in American cinema.  Let the good work keep coming!  Here ends my rant!"

","Next week I will be watching this movie for the first time since 2002. I think it will stand the test of time. Interesting to write down now how I feel about it from memory and see if I still have that opinion after re-watching it.<br/><br/>When I watched it, it was very late at night. I only had some candles burning in my living room and a mug of hot chocolate. Usually I love that atmosphere, it's cozy. Not while watching this movie though. Suddenly the living room seemed too dark and eerie in the candle light. Eventually I had to pause the movie and run to the switch to turn the lights on. Only then did I manage to finish watching this movie. And I'm no easily scared by horror movies, I've seen too many of those. <br/><br/>I did not guess the twist in the end. The story telling was amazing and Kidman a surprise in a movie like this, but she was great, as were all actors and actresses. I enjoyed the way the plot enfolded, building up the mystery and suspense only to actually deliver with an unexpected twist. Everything worked."
"fionajgifford","10","5","6","1 November 2014"," one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while
","With all the terrible horror movies I've seen before I was really hoping this was going to be a good one and it definitely was, with a fantastic cast and brilliant acting from all the actors and an amazing storyline it was definitely worth watching. Nicole Kidman in particular was fantastic in portraying her character with so much emotion which really helped to convey the deep issues of the movie. Without giving anything away it is a great story from start to finish with plenty of jumps and some tense moments and an ending that completely shocked me I would say it's actually worth watching just for that aspect alone. I would definitely recommend it."
"alishahmohd","9","5","6","23 August 2014"," A very good horror film with a spectacular conclusion
","When I first heard of The Others, I honestly was that not interested in watching it, it's premise seemed like a generic horror flick and the plot about a mother living with her photosensitive children alone in a large house or mansion sounded as generic as it gets. How many horror movies we have seen with families living in an abandoned Haunted mansion? The Others didn't seem that different even if the children were suffering from a rare illness or disease, it became hard for me to distinguish the Others from your average generic horror flick. All that was until I actually watched this great film was absolutely mesmerized with it.<br/><br/>The film starts out slow, as you are introduced to the characters and the new servants are hired to work in the house and you are introduced to the children and find out about the rare disease they suffer from. As the plot unfolds and the film moves on, events start to unfold, some weird incidents and noises start to occur in the house making the mother, the children and the servants realize that they are not alone in the house, making them believe it is haunted. The plot keeps on unfolding when the unforeseen twist occurs in the end, which I honestly did not see coming at all. It was shocking and was so well handled and executed that it is in my opinion one of the best scenes in horror films even though the scene in retrospect is not that scary but it is the shock factor that makes that scene so great to watch.<br/><br/>Performance wise, Nicole plays Grace, the mother of the two children perfectly, she is strict towards her children and tries to discipline them, but is also well protective of them and loves them deeply, she is also depressed about being cut off from the rest of the world due to her children's condition. Bertha Mills who plays the nanny does a fantastic job in her role as a kind old lady but there is something that always remains mysterious about her especially in the later part of the film where she behaves oddly and it seems like that she is up to something with the other servants.<br/><br/>The boy who plays Nicolas was actually good in his role, a kid who is scared, and is a sort of a momma's boy who is deeply attached to his mother, and he is scared about the recent haunting in the house. That brings me to Alakina Mann the girl who play's Ann. She received nominations for her performance in this film and it is very well deserved. It is a one of best performances a child artist has done in a horror film, she can be funny, she can be mysterious and creepy, and can also play a serious role. All of which she does in this film. Ann's character was extremely deep and the actress who played her did her job as perfectly as she can. The rest of the cast also performs well and serve well in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, before the watched the Others, I was thinking about watching just another horror film but I was so wrong, this is a fantastic film, with several scary parts and creepy scenes, a slow but well developed plot and a spectacular twist which will leave you in awe and leave you talking about it for days, and make you watch the entire film entirely from a different perspective.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10."
"ma-cortes","8","5","6","5 January 2014"," Creepy movie builds taut by showing virtually eerie images , unsettling score and evocative cinematography
","Thrilling and surprising story full of chills , plot twists , intrigue and excitement . The movie opens with Nicole Kidman, in voice-over, reading a story. She begins with the words, ""Now children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin."" As a woman named Grace Stewart who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive (it is very strange with roughly a thousand people in the world that have it) children (the disease they have is an actual disease known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum). Grace , whose husband (Christopher Eccleston) has never returned from the war , becomes convinced that her family home (the house - supposedly on the island of Jersey - is actually located in the north of Spanish , in Las Fraguas , Cantabria , Palace of Hornillos) haunted while overprotecting her two young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley were cast after an intensive search that encompassed 5,000 children). They will live alone there with oppressive, rare and almost religious rules , until she needs to hire a group of servants (Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle , Elaine Cassidy as Lydia and Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Bertha Mills) for them .<br/><br/>The motion picture displays genuine chills , suspense, mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension , thriller , emotions and terror . It's an exciting , bizarre film ; skillfully written and proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling .The basis for this movie is an episode of the British series 'Armchair Theatre' called 'The Others' made in 1970 and remade as a movie called 'Voices' in 1972 , this version is more elaborate but the story is the same. ¨Los Otros¨ comes from a peculiar cross-section of production cultures ; it stars an Australian woman playing an Englishwoman ; it was written and directed by a Spaniard, backed by Americans, set in Jersey but filmed in Spain. Plenty of twists and turns , the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling musical score by the same Alejandro Amenabar . He along with screenwriter Mateo Gil appear in one of the photographs of dead people . Furthermore , Alejandro also wrote the interesting plot , embarking into the phantasmagorical, psychological or even quasi-surrealist story . Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets by Benjamin Fernandez and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a magnificent film . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe which heightens the suspense . This was the first film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain's national film awards) with not a single word of Spanish spoken in it and his film went on after its release , to become Spain's biggest grossing domestic film of all time. The film opened in the US at number 4 in the box office charts and stayed around that figure for its initial run. Seven weeks into release it actually climbed up to the number 2 spot. <br/><br/>The picture was very well directed by Amenabar in his third movie, after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps best-known early short-film ""Himenóptero"" in 1992, in which he directed , produced, acted and wrote the script and the music, Amenábar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with ""Thesis"", Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And ¨Abre Los Ojos¨ that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise who in ¨The others¨ was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros¨ (2001) was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky (2001), the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabár''s Abre Los Ojos (1997). Ironically, it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . ""Los Otros"" confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films , most notably ""Butterflies tongue"" (1999). He subsequently directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz . Rating : Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching ."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>The first thing to decide when creating an intelligent film is who the camera is. <br/><br/>We start out here with one identity and discover that we actually have another. This is a well known if rarely pulled trick in the mystery genre. Films like this are essentially mysteries, following all of the important rules. That makes them more engaging because the viewer engages in a game with the writer (and her surrogate the actor) to outwit each other.<br/><br/>The filmmaker here is very intelligent in leveraging this by exploiting Kidman's rather hypnotizing, slowly incubating terror."
"princesss_buttercup3","8","6","8","19 June 2008"," Exceeded expectations.
","First off, let me say that this film is not at all reminiscent of Hitchcock, contrary to the opinion of several previous reviewers. While Hitch did do psychodramas, this is really more of a ghost story. Like other reviewers have said, the movie is very stylized and suspenseful, and above all, entertaining. I don't disagree that it is slow, but in this film, that is a virtue. It allows the viewer to get a real feel for the individual characters and the family/household dynamic- all of which are critical to the climax. It is difficult to give a thorough critique without giving too much away, but I must say that I did NOT see ""it"" coming- and I always appreciate it when a film can turn my perspective upside down. This is mostly a visual movie and I have a feeling it won't come across as brilliantly on a small screen, so if you're reading this and considering seeing the film, I strongly recommend seeing it in the theater. The use of light and space and camera angles is excellent, and I also appreciated the minimal use of background music- sometimes in a thriller/horror film, the score can become distracting or overpower the dialogue- NOT a problem here. I wouldn't be surprised if this film is nominated for several of the more obscure Oscar categories (the ones I normally wouldn't even notice) like Sound Editing and Cinematography. There are a few minor inconsistencies and anacronisms, but as a whole package, this film delivers. I've seen a lot of comparisons to ""The Sixth Sense"", but please don't let those shape your expectations of this movie. This is a very different, and in many ways, superior movie, because it relies even less on gore and shock and more on suspense and psychological drama."
"billion_mucks","8","6","8","1 November 2007"," A strong plate
","Everything is spoken in whispers. The atmosphere, music in crescendo at all times, mixes a continuous fog; and the lonely panorama of an antique house. One has to be prepared to fight a phsycological war against the movie: not only because one expects a shock at each time the music reaches a climax, but because one is faced ideologically with a tremendously upsetting and desolating point of view of death. Nicole Kidman's delivers true fear to the audience, and the empty spaces on the dreaded house and suspenseful innuendos will paralyze your back hairs. The twist, marvelous twist, will leave everyone gasping. If you say you'd expected it, thats because you weren't INTO the movie but reasoning apart. Be ready. Ones heart will flutter, the interesting premise will keep you seated. Its a damn fine movie, an edgy thriller."

The movie builds slowly to the climax which is a real shocker.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman was absolutely stunning as the mother protecting her children during WWII. Fionnula Flanagan (Four Brothers, Tears of the Sun) was also very good as the housekeeper. I also enjoyed Alakina Mann (Girl with a Pearl Erring) as the daughter.<br/><br/>A must see."

","The previews had turned me off. Looked like another run-of-the-mill ghost story, complete with bad special effects, to me. But I was in the mood for ghost stories one day and could find nothing else I hadn't seen, so I broke down and rented this one.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did. While I don't share quite the exclamation-point-profuse enthusiasm some reviewers have for it, I was very impressed. (***Don't read any further if you haven't seen the movie yet and don't want to spoil the surprise.***) I had no idea throughout who was good, who was crazy, whether or not there was anything supernatural going on, whether or not the kids were really sick, or how it would end. I, fortunately, hadn't read the other reviews here of it before watching the movie, so hadn't made the obvious comparison to the surprise ending of another ghost story that came out at the same time, ahem ahem...but I didn't mind it. It was different enough, in my opinion, to still be likable, and it had come as quite a surprise to me. And really, excellent as the other movie was, it was NOT the first ever to use such a concept. It was even used in ""Beetlejuice,"" remember? Though in that one it happened at the beginning, not the end.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""The Others"" is a pleasant surprise of a ghost story."

The family have recently got some new servants, after the last set of servants 'disappeared' (the reason for this is explained at the end with an unforgettable twist). It is very clear that the mother isn't entirely stable, and when her daughter says she has seen a boy, and then an entire family who want to take over the whole house, she begins to get extremely paranoid, leading up to a great climax! This has everything: drama, suspense, horror, and it just oozes atmosphere, especially in the few final scenes, on a dark, misty night, when the truth behind the terrifying mystery is finally revealed! <br/><br/>For fans of subtle, scary ghost movies, give this one a look!"
"lee_eisenberg","10","12","20","16 February 2007"," we all may be assuming the wrong thing about ourselves
","At the beginning of ""The Others"" we get introduced to housewife Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) living with her photosensitive children on the island of Jersey during World War II. They can't leave the island as the Nazi submarines have it surrounded. Then, ghostly things begin to happen in the house, and the children say that some other people are living in the house. As time passes, Grace gets more and more desperate and angrily starts carrying a rifle around. And then...it turns out that we've been assuming the wrong thing the whole time.<br/><br/>This movie probably makes a more interesting use of light and dark than any other movie (at least that I can think of). Every scene's contrast makes you think that something terrible is about to happen. Some people have compared this movie to ""The Sixth Sense"", and I would call that a legitimate analogy. Not only is there the horror factor, but also how the main character is forced to reassess everything that s/he has known...and then we find out the truth. Kidman, whose roles often seem a little too glamorous, here makes your blood freeze and displays a menacing face without even trying.<br/><br/>Overall, I do recommend this one. Just see whether or not you totally trust yourself after watching this."
"MUFCOK","9","4","5","3 February 2015"," The perfect example of how to create a ghost story.
","The Others is one of my favourite horror films of all time. It has a good plot, it is subtle, it gives nothing away until the end and everything it does is relevant to the story. I would recommend viewing the movie twice to really appreciate everything that it does, you will miss many things upon first viewing and watching it twice will really enhance the experience.<br/><br/>It is set in the early 1900's and the house, costumes and style are very well presented; they do a good job of transporting the viewer to that time. The story is all based within a mansion where a woman and her two young children live with their three housekeepers. Her two children suffer from a photosensitive disorder and are not allowed to be in direct contact with sunlight, this means that the house is constantly in darkness, offering a much more eerie experience. The daughter claims that she can see ghosts around the house, this is ignored by the mother at the start but before long she is questioning the matter herself. Is the house haunted?<br/><br/>My main gripe with many horror films is that things are revealed too early on, in ghost stories you will see the ghost before any real suspense has been able to build. In my opinion the scariest things in horror films are the things that you don't see, the things that only your imagination sees. This is where The Others excels.<br/><br/>The Others consists of around 6-7 characters with the majority of it being dedicated to Nicole Kidman, who does a fantastic job with a really convincing performance. She is a very mysterious character who seems extremely paranoid about her children's health and wellbeing; she appears as a woman who is on the edge of sanity. The whole supporting cast are fantastic and not one of them lets the casting down.<br/><br/>The Others is a film in which you cannot say much about without the fear of giving anything away, but I will say one thing, the ending is spectacular. So many horror movies struggle to get the ending right, The Others shows its fellow horror flicks how it should be done. Its certificate is only an age 12 but in my opinion it is much creepier than many age 18 films I have watched. If horror movies are your scene then I would recommend this very highly.<br/><br/>9/10"

"ElMaruecan82","9","4","5","26 February 2012"," ""They're here"" ... and so are they ...
","In a nutshell, Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" is a gripping and emotionally powerful horror film, respecting our intelligence enough not to overuse graphic elements and to make the perfect dosage between thrills and mystery. And the mystery surrounding the characters is so absorbing that it immediately plunges us into such an unnerving and harrowing atmosphere that at the end of the film, whether we found relief or our hearts were still pounding, we know we'd just have lived an extraordinary experience.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is set in a large mansion inhabited by a young mother, Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart and her two children, Anne and Nicholas. The film opens when she receives three applicants for house jobs, an elderly tacit grounds-keeper named Mr Turkle, a deaf and dumb adolescent, and the lady who seems to lead the group, Bertha Mills, played, in a remarkable performance, by Fionula Fllanigan. Mrs Mills is the kind of character that immediately strikes the viewer as very competent in her job while the eventuality of her vileness is better conveyed by the peculiarity of her workmates. what's more, Mrs Mills' personality, very calm and professional, efficiently contrasts with Grace's more natural behavior as a loving and caring mother, trying to hide her excitability behind a mask of aristocratic-like composure.<br/><br/>It's hard to figure the period of the film until Grace mentions that her husband is fighting in Europe: it's WWII, the film is set in a mysterious foggy island in Britain, and we ought to believe her. Now, why would the mother of two kids endure such a spooky location? the answer is immediately given, setting at the same time, the tone of the film. Her two kids suffer an extremely rare syndrome, they are photosensitive, which means they can't be exposed to sunlight without being victims of irremediable symptoms. Therefore the mansion's activity is driven by a special but indispensable routine implying to close all the doors with a key, whenever someone gets in or out. This information is vital, and plays as an interesting display of smart writing in the way it distracts us from many precocious interrogations, such as why are all the three servants dressed in a very old-fashion way.<br/><br/>I mentioned in the early paragraph the atmosphere of the film and, no pun intended, it's indeed the key element that drives the film. The atmosphere is so intense that we don't need to be scared, because we constantly keep our guard up, it's the kind of situations so calm we know something will happen. Yet everything remains desperately quiet, and as the movie progresses, all we have are little doses of thrills, through apparitions, voices, screams, encounters with mysterious presences, and the macabre discovery of photographs showing dead people, but no death, no gore, no fights. The secret of ""The Others"" is to works as an efficient set-up whose sensational impact would ineivtably rely on the climax, so all we have to do is to be patient, and collect all the hints in order to know what to expect and this is what communicates the thrilling effect of the film<br/><br/>The atmosphere is carried by a shadowy external photography and a powerful cinematography whose use of lights transforms the vastness of a mansion into a sum of little closed places, conveying the disturbing feeling of a suffocating paranoia. The house is so big yet feels so small while the mysterious and haunting presence of 'strangers' make the whole setting totally unsettling. And the force of the film is within the story as it features characters who are apparently forced to live in this mansion for vital reasons, and the satisfying resolution would either be a way to chase the others, or to be chased, but we all know the confrontation is inevitable. ""The Others""' suspense works on a Hitchcockian level, even more effective because we really don't know what to expect, and take it from someone who saw it each time with different persons, no one ever guesses the ending, and neither did I.<br/><br/>But it would be unfair and untrue to imply that ""The Others"" only works thanks to the ending, the narrative evolves around an emotional core within the story of a mother who tries to protect her two children. And the conflict in ""The Others"" is not just between two different kinds of presences in a same house, but the psychological consequence through the torment invading the heart of a woman, torn between her maternal instinct and a terrible secret belonging to the past and profoundly affecting the present. Nicole Kidman magnificently embodies the vulnerability of a woman left alone and totally alienated by too much responsibility. And Mrs Mills represents the perfect counterpart to Grace's hellish condition and while she gets closer to Anne, and Grace's behavior becomes more suspicious, the notion of vileness goes back and forth and we wait until the moment it will finally determine who the real antagonist is Â… if there ever is one.<br/><br/>All in all, it's hard to know who is the straight person of this series of incidents when emotions are so powerfully engaged. ""The Others"" is a remarkable chronicle of a dramatic family story involving a woman and two kids, one strong-minded and free-spirited little girl and her poignantly coward little brother. The two kids, beautifully portrayed, mirror the same contrasts between Mrs Mills and Grace Stewart and what's more, their condition plays like the metaphor of Grace's symbolic sensitivity to an even blinding and painful light. Needless to say that the ending doesn't disappoint and elevates the films to one of the greatest horror mystery thrillers of the last 20 years, working in every single level.<br/><br/>So beware of the light, whether it's of a blinding sunshine or a terrible secret"

"francois-massarelli","8","4","5","28 March 2006"," Coming to terms with one's death: Amenabar's the Others
","The third of Amenabar's features is both the most academic and the most intriguing of this trilogy of the macabre. Before next step, the critically-acclaimed Mar Adentro, the three films were a comment about death, in one form or the other. The Others tells of a family, settled in post-war Jersey, consisting of Grace(Nicole Kidman) and her two children. They were abandoned by all: the domestics have gone, the husband went to the war and never came back, and the whole island seems to be deserted, apart from three servants who one day present themselves at the door, and a strange, ghostly presence in the house... Thus taking the shape of a very classic ghost story, with plenty of creepy scenes, based on an interestingly spooky setting, the film is a success thanks to the incredible sense of timing of all concerned, Director-writer-composer Amenabar first of all, since he manages to direct his 7-or-so actors as if they were puppets while allowing them to use their talent in the construction of lovable, believable characters. This last effort is probably the most rewarding of all, since one of the most annoying drawbacks of Amenabar's Open Your Eyes, his previous effort, was the incapacity of both the director and the actor(Eduardo Noriega) to make the character sympathetic, or just nice(the same could be said, however, of Tom Cruise's over-the-top characterization in the remake by Cameron Crowe)... But despite Nicole Kidman's efforts to render Grace neurotic, obsessive, authoritarian and narrow-minded, we still care for her. She has, after all, good reasons to her behavior: her children live, and share with her, an incredible everyday hell, suffering from an incurable disease making them allergic to daylight: this is the source of multiple compulsory tasks: opening doors, closing curtains, lighting candles, that are repeated throughout the film by the main character so as to avoid contact of her children and too much light... No wonder she got to be on the edge. Besides, we learn at one point how mad she got prior to the beginning of the plot, and her killing her children and shooting herself becomes almost understandable. Another important innovation over the previous effort is the confrontation of Kidman with Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs Mills, who steals the show more than once with her mineral presence and her masterful acting that makes her both lovable and mysterious. Add to this the very solid composition by Alakina Mann as Ann, Grace's daughter, and we have a very engaging cast, that contributes significantly to the success of the film. The entire plot revolves around the final discovery that the three characters are ghosts, and the presence they felt in the house(The Others)is that of the living, not of the dead. This idea allows Amenabar to toy with an Innocents-like mood all the way through, going as far as to quote one of the most frightening moments of Clayton's film around the end, when three ghosts approach a window. This shot, by the way, is also reminiscent of a famous sequence in Tod Browning's Mark of the Vampire(1936), thus we can safely think that the young Spanish master knows his history of Creepy Classics... But the most satisfactory aspect of this film, in spite of its very entertaining use of mystery and the author's mastery of direction, writing AND music, making Amenabar the full author of the film, is certainly first the way he deals with his favorite theme, having Grace slowly, but surely dealing with her own death and that of her children and accepting the fact as relief, thus going one step further than Cesar in Open your Eyes; and secondly, of course, the parallel that the viewer can establish between Grace's obsessive Catholicism and Amenabar's identity as a Spanish author, who grew up in an obsessively catholic environment. This can't be a coincidence, and Amenabar's wit(Grace, about the book of the dead: ""How could these people be so superstitious?"")shows he has probably come to terms with what might be part of an identity crisis. Again, the torment of Cesar, in Open..., had him begin to realize he was in such a crisis; so The Others really cleared the way for Almenabar's next step, Mar Adentro, the film that looks death in the eyes."

She advertises for some housekeepers who come in the form of Mrs. Mills and co. You can tell there's something not quite right about the housekeeper's and they in their own right are quite scary.

This film is so good and different from you're typical ghost film. The acting of all members of a small cast is brilliant, especially the two children.

","This is on my all-time, top ten best scary movies list. Nicole Kidman is incredible as a stressed- out mother trying to deal with two children who have a deadly light-sensitivity condition. In addition to having to live in a neverending existence of locking and unlocking doors and in no more light than lantern light, she has to deal with the possibility that her big English Gothic mansion is haunted by 'the others'. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The creepy-but you don't know why daughter-the housekeeper who seems aware of something but doesn't give it away-the poor mute maid and Kidman's perfect teetering on the edge performance all adds to the tension. What is beautiful and brilliant about this movie is they way it unfolds without allowing the audience to 'figure' out what's really happening. Why Kidman did not win an Oscar for this performance is beyond me. An absolutely brilliantly made movie!"

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>How do you describe a film enough to keep everyone interested and without telling to many details that will reveal too much and destroy it for others? Strange question to start a review with and yet and essential one when beginning to talk about this film.<br/><br/>All I will say is  that the film is about Grace(Nicole Kidman) who lives with her 2 children, Anne(Alkina Mann) and Nicholas(James Bentley), in a remote house on Jeresy Island in the time after WWII. Her children are suffering from a rare disease that make exposure to light dangerous to them. One day Anne and later also Grace seem to hear strange voices and believe that the house is haunted and...You want to know what happened from now on, go and see the film. Telling you what happens now will deprive you from one of the film which will be remembered from 2001/2002. Because this a film to see and remember. It is good because at the end it make you think about a lot of things. Relations between parents and children. Trust and believe between those 2 parts of the family. Acceptance of things in your life. In a more philosophic level it says something about our perspective and the way we see things. How we take everything for granted while we shouldn't.<br/><br/>Kidman is excellent(2nd time this year with a strong part) and seem to be improving every time I watch her. The children and the rest of the cast are also good and complete the strong ensemble which help the movie. The direction is good and is helped by the lighting of the set and the score.<br/><br/>All in all go and see the film. The twist somewhere in the film will make you and everyone else in the cinema jump. Recommended by all means."

Why don't they make movies like this anymore? Although, it has only been seven years ago since this movie was made.<br/><br/>Grace and her children are put to a struggle because of ghosts. Grace is having a difficult time trying not to let the intruders hurt her children, and not let the sun touch them because they have an intense skin allergy that they can only stand dull light.<br/><br/>In the end, it turns out that yes, there were intruders. But Grace and the children are actually the ghosts, and they are haunting the house they live in and always will. A very creepy thriller!

","I went into the theater knowing only the premise that this was a ghost story. I left the theater thoroughly convinced I just saw the best damn ghost story ever made.<br/><br/>Despite having no special effects at all, and the absence of any hint of gore, Director Alejandro Amenabar managed to put together a truly creepy and chilling masterpiece. The dark atmosphere all throughout the movie was perfect, and the plot was gripping and very well written. The actors gave outstanding performances, especially Nicole Kidman. Alakina Mann was brilliant, and Fionnula Flanagan was creepy as hell.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Grace (Kidman) and her two children Anne (Mann) and Nicholas (Bentley), who are both suffering from photo-sensitivity and cannot be exposed directly to sunlight. This is why their unusually large house needs to be dark all the time. Following the arrival of their new servants, they begin to suspect that their house is being haunted.<br/><br/>Although the pace of the movie is slow, the rewards the viewer will get when they stick with it through the end more than make up for it.

"phonenumberofthebeast","9","6","9","13 August 2006"," Brilliant chiller
","""The Others"" is a phenomenal ghost story brilliantly told by master filmmaker Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar, who, since winning an Oscar for ""The Sea Inside"" a few years back, seems to have vanished into a ghostly netherworld.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, in what I consider her only enjoyable performance, plays Grace, a mentally frayed young mother driven to the edge of hysteria by her singularly impossible situation. It is the late 1940s on the isle of Jersey, one of the few regions of England to suffer under Nazi occupation during the war. Her husband, who went away to fight, has not returned, and she's been told to give him up for dead. She finds herself in lone charge of her vast, dusty old manor after the help suddenly disappear without warning. This is doubly difficult because her two children are photoallergic; they cannot tolerate any light brighter than that of a candle, or they blister, seize up and eventually die. No curtains can be left undrawn; no doors can be left open. The children's universe is a house-sized black cocoon. This has meant that Grace has spent most of her life alone; bringing them up in what she herself describes as a ""prison of darkness."" Not surprisingly, she suffers from migraines and cannot stand even the slightest sound.<br/><br/>With this ingenious setup, Amenabar creates an ideal horror atmosphere: an old house lit only by candles, kept in a state of near silence. It also allows him to orchestrate a series of situations governed by one of the all-time great suspense concepts: ""Whatever you do... don't do that!"" Usually in a horror film the darkness is to be feared; in this case it is sanctuary. It is the light, advancing like a predator, that is to be fled.<br/><br/>The children, brilliantly played by remarkable young actors, are left pale and ghostly by their lifetime of confinement. Their perpetual isolation has left them sullen, resentful and lonely, and the daughter in particular is beginning to rebel. Grace, realising that her control over them is slipping, literally puts the fear of God into them through her strict religious instruction. But the daughter has read her Bible, and can give as good as she gets.<br/><br/>If Amenabar had merely played this scenario as was, without a supernatural element, it still could have evolved into a superior Gothic domestic drama. But he's too in love with the fantastic to leave Grace's world unturned. At the film's beginning, a trio of housekeepers straight out of Emily Bronte show up her door, claiming to be answering an ad for help they could not have known about. Suspicious but desperate, Grace agrees to take them in. It becomes increasingly obvious that they have a hidden agenda, though what that agenda is is unclear. For a time, things go well. And then the Others arrive.<br/><br/>The children notice them first; the son claims to have spoken to them. They laugh invisibly in the halls, play the piano when the doors are locked, and, most disturbingly, draw the curtains and unlock the doors, leading Grace to conclude they are engaged in a war against her and her children. Under siege from a force she cannot locate, Grace begins to step over the edge she'd been skirting for years, and fall finally into madness.<br/><br/>This is an intricate tale, brilliantly constructed. Not a single scene or line of dialogue is wasted. Indeed, from a simple storytelling angle I would say it is superior to ""The Sixth Sense,"" to which it shares many similarities, including a shocking, brilliant twist ending. However, although there are moments of pure terror and an overarching theme of dread and despair in this story, ""The Others"" isn't quite as scary as Shyamalan's masterpiece, mainly because Amenabar perpetually pulls the rug out from under the audience's expectations, so that the Others, unlike the Dead People stalking poor benighted Cole Sear, remain a complete mystery until the film's conclusion. Are they ghosts? Human intruders? Some plot by the new ""help"" to drive Grace mad? Or simply all in Grace's increasingly distracted mind? As such it is often difficult to know whether one is supposed to be frightened or not, and for the most part this film takes on the air of an old-fashioned Gothic mystery, rather than a horror film. But when the plot finally unfolds completely, nearly taking Grace's sanity with it, the audience is treated to a sustained climax of genuine fear that leads to a mind-bending conclusion."
"sacredrite","10","6","9","28 June 2005"," The perfect ghost story
","Only the mildest of spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect. Normally, if I'm watching a horror movie, I prefer a balls-to-the-walls frightfest like 'The Excorcist'. And I'm always disappointed by horror movies with no gore. But after watching 'The Others', I think it actually might be my favorite horror movie ever. The dark atmosphere is delicious, the plot is just excellent, and all the performances are top-notch - especially that of Nicole Kidman, who despite her character's numerous flaws, manages to make you like her and care what happens to her. The dialog written for her character is so authentic; it's so refreshing to finally see a film set in the past where the characters actually use the appropriate kind of language & tone. The language in this film made me feel like I've never seen a 'period piece' with authentic language.<br/><br/>'Rosemary's Baby' is often mentioned as a prime example of a film that creates a great sense of tension without any killing or monsters or gore. But I'd have to say that 'The Others' far surpasses 'Rosemary's Baby' in it's bloodless delivery. You are not left with any disappointment at all. After 'Rosemary's Baby', I thought ""Well done, but they should have at least shown the baby."" But 'The Others' is absolutely perfect. There is nothing that they should have shown. There is nothing that could have made it any better. And how nice to finally have a great horror movie that is truly spooky that you can actually watch with your kids?"

While the twist has already been used in other films (*cough*), the film as a whole is a real roller-coaster of excitements and scares every horror buff owes himself the right to watch. <br/><br/>Look out for the spooky setting that takes place exclusively in the area of the house, making the structure a living and breathing character in the film - perhaps more than some of the real characters."

","""And all the other voices said: change your mind, you're always wrong"" (the Cure, Other Voices, Faith, 1981).<br/><br/>A few years ago, Alejandro Amenabar's third movie was prominent in the top 250 of IMDb. But today, it isn't there any more. That's really unfair. It largely deserved its place and to occupy it as long as possible.<br/><br/>After, ""Tesis"" (1996) and ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997), Amenabar goes up a notch and signs with ""the Others"" (2001) a masterful masterpiece which refreshes fantastic cinema and breathes new life into the theme of the haunted house. He largely deserves his nickname of ""new young prodigy of Spanish cinema"". With Tom Cruise, partly responsible for the production, one could fear a strong Hollywood influence in Amenabar's opus. But fortunately, it's nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, just like the great M Night Shyamalan, Alejandro Amenabar appears as a real author, on the fringe of the Hollywood industry and he's got enough character to let his style nurture. Let's hope he won't be crushed by the Hollywood machine. The movie was shot in Spain, with eventually a modest budget (17 millions of dollars) and it was a surprise to see it doing brilliantly a little everywhere in the world.<br/><br/>Amenabar had already ventured in the dreadful world of the snuff-movies with his debut movie ""Tesis"" and had succeeded in mixing several films genres in one cohesive narrative line with ""Abre Los Ojos"". But with ""the Others"", one didn't suspect a real ease in the ""In Camera"". It's a quite dramatic change of style and in the end a successful translation in the fantastic.<br/><br/>Amenabar's references are easy to guess. They're three cornerstones in fantastic cinema: ""the Innocents"" (1961), ""the Haunting"" (1963) and ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999). ""The Others"" can be considered as the meeting of these three opus. All the elements of the fantastic movie with Gothic nature are gathered and perfectly used. There's no shortage of examples: an austere mansion with a sinister architecture which hides a dark secret, big rooms half obscured, a mist which tends to thicken throughout the days, characters with sinister-looking faces. All these features blend themselves to create a nearly stifling universe. Moreover, Amenabar favors a calm and quite slow rhythm to play with the spectator's nerves as much as possible and we are entitled to real moments of fear. It is also interesting to write that a minimum of special effects is just enough for the director to maintain anxiety. He also weaves a more and more threatening atmosphere marked out by the progressive reversal of situation (in the beginning of the film, Nicole Kidman dominated Fionnula Flanagan but in the middle of the film, it's the contrary which happens). And, of course, like in a successful suspense movie, virtually all the obscure or ambiguous points are clarified making the story incredibly coherent and after the final conclusion (which of course, I won't reveal), the very last sequences have a strong emotional power and it would take a heart of stone to resist them. On another extent, let's also take down the omnipresence of religion, supposed to be a sort of protection for Nicole Kidman but which, in the end turns out to be useless. One can put forward that Amenabar had surely a strong catholic education and he must have lost his faith...<br/><br/>But the qualities of ""the Others"" don't stop here. It is visually and technically an appealing movie with a gorgeous photography (certain images are breathtaking) and there's also a careful work on sound and the original soundtrack. On of the most important characteristics from Alejandro Amenabar is that he composes the music of his own films and her, very simply, he excels himself. The delicate and disturbing sounds we can hear contribute to reinforce the threatening atmosphere of the film and makes us feel a little more ill-at-ease again.<br/><br/>""The Others"" was released when Nicole Kidman had just divorced Tom Cruise and I had thought that she gave the image of a more mature and ambitious actress. Amenabar's flick confirms it. One is really under the impression that she gives the best that she can. There's nothing to say about her role she takes with consummate skill. Her role of haughty middle-class housewife with a cold and penetrating look is sufficient to make one shudder. What is strange is that her name in the film is Grace and her hairstyle is reminiscent of Grace Kelly's. Is it a nod to the actress? Be that as it may, it would be unfair to forget the rest of the cast, especially Fionnula Flanagan who under a docile and frail appearance can easily become disturbing. At last, Amenabar made quite a creditable job of the directing of children who are, in general difficult actors to direct.<br/><br/>A chilling and great movie from start to finish. To fully savor all lights turned off. Highly recommended. Hats off to Mr Amenabar: he is one of the main leaders of Spanish cinema and his career is starting well as the triumph of ""Mar Adentro"" (2004) testifies."
"maryflowers","Null","11","22","29 January 2004"," Disappointing
","I was looking forward to watching THE OTHERS because I love good ghost films. However, by the end of it I was disappointed. The screenplay didn't quite develop some of the best ideas in the story. <br/><br/>**** SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>For instance, the ""what happened that night"" part should have been introduced more forcibly earlier on in the film. The problem for me was that as soon as I saw Christopher Eccleston (Kidman's husband in the movie) appear out of nowhere in the fog, the twist became pretty clear to me. Also, the servants' clothes gave them away as ghosts (too old-fashioned). Having seen The Sixth Sense, I just knew that if the husband and the servants were ghosts, then Kidman and the kids must be ghosts too. I quite enjoyed the ending but it wasn't half as scary as the ending of The Sixth Sense. I know it's not fair to compare films in this way, but I can't help but do it in this case, simply because they are based on the same premise and quite frankly, The Others jumped on the bandwagon in that sense.<br/><br/>As far as Kidman's much-performance is concerned, I thought she was good but not impressive. I would have preferred someone with a face that said more than their whispers. I found her a bit hysterical.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film 6/10 for trying hard and for generating a good atmosphere."

","I thought that nothing could surpass my first terrified viewing of ""The Haunting"" when I was about 15. That's when I became a lifelong fan of supernatural psychological thrillers. Good ones are few and far between -- so, I have waited 31 years for the incredible experience of watching ""The Others""! It has been worth the wait. This is the first time I have ever had goosebumps all over my head! I am usually completely unaffected by so-called ""thrillers"" and I find horror movies to be laughable. But ""The Others"" is in a class by itself.<br/><br/>After my first viewing of this beautifully-acted, beautifully-filmed, intelligently written story, I had what I call ""movie hangover"" for a couple of days. I was intrigued, and I knew I would watch it again. Scenes and lines kept coming back to me, along with the impression of all of the amazing performances in the film.<br/><br/>Tonight I watched it for the second time, sharing it with my two 13-year-old sons. They were blown away, and wanted to discuss it long after it was over. We talked about not only the movie, but also questions of the nature of life and death. For me, the second viewing was far, far richer than the first, as I was able to pick up on dozens of clues about which I was ""clueless"" the first time around. My boys can't wait to see it again.

"chris-4071","9","3","4","23 September 2006"," Tremendous movie; very engrossing
","The performance of Nicole Kidman in this is outstanding. She plays the part extremely well and had me utterly convinced that she truly was the conservative, sensible-shoe-wearing, overbearing mother in the piece, though quite captivatingly beautiful she is too. It does make quite a refreshing change from the regular formulaic Hollywood type 'horror' films that seem to be proliferating theatres and DVD shelves these days. You won't find yourself shouting ""don't open that door"" like one does in desperation at so many awful b movie characters - you'll be looking at Ms. Kidman's face and you'll be right there with her.<br/><br/>This film is set some fifty years ago. Now, normally with some type of period pieces, things start well before some character uses some modern slang/colloquialism and it pulls you right out of the movie. I can assure you that in The Others, the dialogue is simply sublime. Every detail has been attended to to ensure it is faithful to the era; from the behaviour of the children to the address of the servants.<br/><br/>The children actors here are simply outstanding. With the help of the excellent dialogue they deliver an awe-inspiring performance that absolutely makes the film.<br/><br/>Storywise, it is excellent and original in my opinion - and horror movies are my favourite, so I believe I've seen a few in my time.<br/><br/>So if you're tired of clichÃ©s, of the group-of-teens.. .camp-in-a-graveyard.. .as-an-initiation-ritual-then-get-killed type movies then perhaps you'd appreciate this eerie, evocative, and downright chilling horror movie as much as I have."

"Dark Eye","10","3","4","10 June 2002"," It's not often that a movie gets it right
","This is an elegant haunted house movie in its purest, most classic form. It relies solely on atmosphere, creepy music and sense of foreboding, without ever resorting to those cheap and overused ""jolts"" that pops up from the side of the frame to scare us. The script is well-written and in certain cases it makes you think. I recommend watching this movie without any preconceptions of any kind, otherwise it might ruin the experience and surprises.<br/><br/>I must point out that after reading several of the critics' reviews, I cannot understand those who claim that the movie is too slow. Why? Have they been so desensitized by movies with big explosions and CGI graphics that they cannot envelope themselves in a movie's atmosphere without a guiding hand? The comparison of this movie with The Sixth Sense is well deserved, and this I believe says a lot about its quality. Every frame and moment are filled with a thick atmosphere that never lets up, and the answer always seems out of reach until the very end. Interesting and hard questions are also being raised about our perceptions of the supernatural as well as religion, and the movie handled these issues very well with overlaying subtleness. I have to say that the movie is also nicely cast, the two kids are great and convincing without any hint of cliched sentimentalism about them. Nicole Kidman did a good job, she got better throughout the movie and in one scene looked positively ravishing.<br/><br/>After seeing several of those special effects-laden haunted house flicks such as the remakes of the Haunting and House on the Haunted Hill, I was so sure that nobody understands how to do this particular genre justice anymore, and that we'll just have to resort to its teen-lite version such as Scream. Well thankfully The Others proved that with the right approach and thought, substance and style always go well hand-in-hand. If you enjoyed rewarding and intelligent thrillers like The Sixth Sense, then this movie is for you."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The Others has got to be one of the best films of the year. Infact I would say that it's the best, behind that other Nicole Kidman starrer, Moulin Rouge.<br/><br/>It all starts out well and good. Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her kids are alone in their Jersey mansion. Their servants have disappeared into thin air and Grace's husband is lost at war. Then one day three strangers show up at their door. Mrs. Mills being the leader (Fionulla Flanigan) along with the gardener (Erik Sykes) and a mute girl, Lydia (Elaine Casasidy). Nicole needs the help so she hires them on the spot. She shows them the kids, Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley). The two have a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and sores whenever light hits them. So at<br/><br/>all time everyone must follow the simple rules. No door can be opened until the one you just walked through is locked and  make sure all curtains are closed.<br/><br/>Soon enough strange things start to happen. Curtains open in the middle of the nights, crying is heard from someone who doesn't seem to be anywhere in the house, whispering is heard aswell as the piano being played inside the locked room when everyone is in bed. Could the house be haunted? Anne seems to think so. She claims to of seen them. There's Victor, a young boy, aswell as a mother and father and an old woman.<br/><br/>Grace wont have a bar of it but she does start to suspect something but instead of the paranormal... she suspects the servents. And rightly so, they are damned creepy.<br/><br/>Anyway. Along the way Grace's husband returns (played by Chris Eccleson) from war and the kids discover something sinister about the new servants.<br/><br/>The movie is expertly made. Great performances by all involved (Nicole Kidman, Fionulla Flanigan and Alakina Mann being the standouts. I would love to see Nicole get an oscar for this but I liked Moulin Rouge more. A Supporting Actress nod could go the way of Fionulla or Alakina (Remember Anna Paquin got one when she was young!)). Alajandro Amenabar has created a world of haunting beauty. The interior scenes all have a great atmosphere and the rare outside scenes are given a wonderful touch or mystery by the surprisingly eerie use of fog). The directing, writing, cinematography, set design et cetera are all top notch.<br/><br/>The ending is great. I never saw it coming. The subtle clues Alajandro gives us are good enough as to not give away the ending but to make us think whether what's happening is real/fake/imagined or possibly even a big nightmare (the movie starts with Grace waking up from a nightmare, screaming).<br/><br/>Oh and there is some scary stuff going on in this film. We don't get scared anymore by the latest whiz-bang special effects (see Lost Souls, House On Haunted Hill) but Alajandro creates a sense of fear from what he are thinking. Take for example the scene where everyone in the house is asleep and then the downstairs piano in the locked room starts playing. We are unsure what is going on but we are all know something is going to happen and we get scared by that feeling. Special notice must go to the end scare with the kids in the closet... everyone in my cinema (600 people) jumped/screamed/curses/covered their eyes... everyone was caught by surprise.<br/><br/>10/10 A+<br/><br/>-SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING FROM NOW-<br/><br/>
The movie's ending, which has been called a rip-off of The Sixth Sense, is actually a lot better than that movie's ending. Where in that movie they gave it away with the obvious ""I see dead people"" line the ending of The Others is given away in a much more subtle way and is thus a lot harder to guess.<br/><br/>I was totally taken by surprise with the ending. And in aftermath only started to piece it all together. ""Mother's gone mad... again"", Grace's migraine's, the husband coming back from war then leaving again, the curtains etc...<br/><br/>excellent.<br/><br/>A must see."

But the ending of ""The Others"" will leave you satisfied and thinking how emotional the movie is. Sure, there are some scary and chilling scenes but that's not the point of the movie. After the movie's climax, the scary scenes are useless. Talking about the ending, it should send you shivers.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie is dark, unsettling and stylish. The movie looks Gothic at some points thanks to a great cinematography. The mansion is creepy enough even without ghosts. All the scenes of the movie have important information that should help in order to create a better experience. I remember that back in 2001 people were really terrified in the theater when the movie reaches it's climax. The same should happen if you watch it home alone.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Nicole Kidman's performance proves that major Hollywood stars can do great in the Horror genre. The rest of the cast is also perfect.<br/><br/>Please, watch ""The Others"" if you haven't seen it because it's an important Horror movie from the new millennium. Probably one of the best."
"filydily","10","4","6","2 September 2002"," One of the best films I've ever seen
","This film blew me away, everything was perfect.  Nicole Kidman gave an excellent performance, as did the rest of the cast, and her English accent was spot on. The location/set was attractive and wasn't too clichéd, and the music fitted with action like a glove. All the way through this film I had shivers running up and down my spine and my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to the incredible end. I enjoyed this film unlike any other movie I have ever seen, must be the best film of 2001, it's a shame I waited until 2002 to watch it. Buy or hire this now, you wont be disappointed."

","I was very unsatisfied with this movie. Rarely were there parts that made you feel insecure or scared. Sure I jumped maybe once or twice, and the setting was a little eerie, but I was never scared. The previews made this look as if it was ""the sixth sense"" meets ""what lies beneath."" Acting was good, and the plot had a foundation to build on, but it was built upon poorly. This story could have been much better than it was. Good main idea, but in the end the two didn't work out together. The ending was unsatisfying, but I'll leave that for you to find out yourself. This movie could have been good, had some more thought been put into it. Good idea, but more jumpy scares and a more explained ending are highly needed. 4/10"
"bob the moo","Null","6","11","13 January 2005"," Not that surprising or clever but still an enjoyable and effectively chilling ghost story
","There are 50 doors in Grace Stewart's house and she insists each one must be locked before another is unlocked. Her two children (Anne and Nicholas) are photosensitive and the curtains must always be drawn before they enter the room. Together Grace and her two children live in constant pray that husband and father Charles will somehow return safely from the war. Into the house comes new staff  Mr Tuttle who tends the garden, the mute Lydia and housekeeper Mrs Mills. With her mother's strict teachings and religious slant, Anne confides in Mrs Mills about her sightings of other people, where Grace would punish her for such stories. However it is not long before Grace struggles to understand the noises she hears and things she sees.<br/><br/>This review contains no spoilers but I would question why anyone would want to know more about this film before watching it; you know the genre and knowing more can only spoil it for you albeit slightly. I'm not sure why I never got around to seeing this film in the cinema but somehow it slipped my mind and I was surprised to find it on the television recently as it only seemed that it was out recently. Anyway, needless to say I watched it and at the start was a little put out by plot points which seemed to have been a little bit obviously forced in to provide the director with devices to play with (eg the darkness, the locked doors, the silence etc) but very quickly the film made me forget any reservations I may have had. The plot is a simple ghost story that is told with confidence throughout, with a consistently subtle touch from Amenabar; to me he marked himself out as being worth watching with Abre Los Ojos and this film has only made me sure that he can produce the goods. I didn't think the conclusion was as obvious (although it isn't as shocking as it should be) as others have said and, although it hardly shocked me, it was still satisfying to me  partly because it matched the quiet tone of the film.<br/><br/>He plays well with the tools he has written for himself and also includes nice ""fake builds"" with the music and plays with our expectations to good effect. The lack of gore is a good thing and, as Japan continues to show us, sometimes unsettling juxtapositioning images can be even more effective without just sudden gore etc. I was effectively creeped out by the whole thing. Kidman is very well cast and she plays very well indeed  bring the sense of fear to the screen and encouraging the audience to feel the same as her. The child actors avoid being too cute and cloying and are part of making the film rather chilling. Support is very good from Flanagan and Sykes, but you do have to wonder why Eccleston bothered in a role that is pointless for the vast majority of the film.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable film that is quite chilling and is basically just a simple ghost story. There are no major scares and none of it will take you by surprise even if you don't see things coming but it does what it does well and without fuss. Some viewers will have issues with elements of it  and rightly so, but generally it is a very effective little film that you will enjoy the less you know about it."

","'The Others' takes up way more time in the viewer's life than it deserves. It is only vaguely worth it for its trick ending, and let's face it, if it didn't have an ending like that there would be nothing to the film at all.<br/><br/>Everything plods along so slowly, and there are quite a few things which seem illogical, for example how the daughter screams wildly at some things but is very matter-of-fact about sightings of intruders in the house.<br/><br/>Because nothing much is happening, it is only inevitable that some major shock ending is coming, and quite frankly, while it is surprising, it's not really that mind-blowing, and certainly doesn't make the whole movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>Could have been a lot better."

","I appreciate the fact that people are attempting to make scary movies and thrillers without resorting to blood and violence, but it seems like they don't think they need to replace it with anything.  The Others seems to repeat the same scene over and over for the entire first half of the movie. I started to get bored with the whole idea, hoping for something, anything to happen.  This really would have worked better as a half hour episode of The Twilight Zone, so that half the movie didn't need to be fluff and just extraneous details that didn't move the story forward at all.  Ah, well. Here's to trying, at least."

","~Spoiler~ <br/><br/>Alejandro Amenabar's The Others is a film that I feel is a bit overrated, but still a good movie. It's The Innocents meets The Sixth Sense and I have to say that I enjoyed it the first time that I watched it. However, it does not hold up to multiple viewings (much like most movies with a so-called ""twist""). While I like it for bringing that old Hollywood class back to the genre, not a whole lot ever happens during the film. And that really hurts when you are watching it a second time. You know what is going on so any interest is gone and there's really no more fun in viewing it. The film in a nutshell is about a family of three living in a secluded mansion that may or may not be haunted. Are there ghosts, or is the Mother losing her mind. You can tell the film was heavily influenced by The Innocents in that regard. Nicole Kidman is perfect here as the mother, but it is the children that really shine. I'm surprised to see that at this time they haven't worked much after this film. The ending may surprise some, but others will recognize what's going on. It's a good ending, but it's been used to death by now. I would urge everyone to see The Others once, but only once."

","All of my friends told me, that this is a masterpiece. Excellent acting, brilliant cinematography, extraordinary music, great atmosphere, etc., etc.,....... So I wanted to buy the DVD without seeing the movie, because my friends are nearly always right in case we do have the same predilections. Luckily another friend of mine borrowed me his DVD.<br/><br/>As I had been very excited at the beginning, I was bored beyond believe while watching this one. It is so in lack of story, that even the brilliant twist at the end could not change my misery. Sure, technically it is great, the twist is awesome, but that does not make a masterpiece. Especially not, if the first 90 minutes are boring and stupid as hell.  The music is not bad, but when it rises up, the actress turns around and nothing happens, so I just asked myself: So what? By the way: Nicole Kidmans performence is breathtaking. I hope, that someday this gifted woman receives the Oscar she deserves so badly. Becaus in my opinion she was passed over for: To die for, Eyes wide shut(supporting) and of course: Moulin Rouge! But back to this movie.<br/><br/>Some cinematography and directing are just selfish. The plot with the husband (a totally give away of Christopher Ecclestone) could have been cut out. It is just repeating the ""pillow-story"" the third time and adds nothing new to the picture. But most responsible for killing ""The Others"" is the weak writing. But I don't want to make you think that everything is bad in this movie. So here are the good things: Sometimes great atmosphere is built up. Sometimes destroyed by the selfishness of the cinematographer and the director. Same thing with the direction itself. The music is really good composed and arranged, but sometimes unnecessary (as read above). The performances are all very good and believeable. But all in all, and in this case I keep it with Martin Landau in ""Mistress"": I think, the story is an important element!<br/><br/>So, if you like nice pictures, good acting and a brilliant twist: Go and rent it! So many people liked it.<br/><br/>But for me: I give it 4/10"

I can't even tell you how many times I looked at my watch during this movie, each time calculating how much of it had passed (i.e. 1/4, 2/5). It was that boring. The acting I thought was brilliant from the two kids (especially Anne) and from Mrs. Mills. Kidman, on the other hand, horribly overacted in a couple parts.

","Before I saw this movie today,I read the reviews & they were very positive & given high ratings,so I decided to see it. I was very disappointed in it. I was expecting alot more & kept waiting for something good & scary to happen for the first while.I found alot of it to be confusing. For example: What's the deal with the husband showing up from nowhere in the fog,and what was the purpose of him in the plot? Am I missing something? Also, how come ""Ann"" was the only one to see the intruders? I left the theater trying to figure it all out. On the other hand alot of it was copied from other movies & predictable. I did not feel scared during this film overall. It had only a few creepy moments worth mentioning. One of them can be seen on the 30 second tv spot.(Ann as the old woman with the white vail) The other is the photo album that Grace(Kidman) finds. That was creepy!<br/><br/>Everyone seems to be comparing this film to ""The Sixth Sense"" I liked that better than this but,I was disappointed in it as well. If you want to see a true classic ghost story then rent or buy the DVD of ""The Changeling""(1980) starring: George C. Scott. That blows this movie away! Lots of scares & a much better story. Also ""Dark Places""(1973) starring: Joan Collins & Christopher Lee, is another well done scary ghost story with plenty of twists & suspense. There was also an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" they did about ""Ghosts"" & one of the segments was about the ""Queen Mary"" being haunted. That scared me more than this movie! It was very well done & gave you chills up your spine & left you with a really creepy feeling.And I didn't have to pay $9:50 to see it!   I wouldn't say ""The Others"" stunk, but I wouldn't say it was great & worth seeing either. I give it a 4/10."

","Clearly, Others saw something in The Others which I missed.<br/><br/>This was billed as a horror/suspense movie, but it lacked horror or suspense. It just wasn't scary. Or interesting. Within 15 minutes of the start of the movie, I was wondering how soon it would end. I had no reason to care about what would happen to the characters, and nothing interesting did happen.<br/><br/>I should declare my bias. Other than Dead calm, and Eye Wide Shut, I have never found much to like about Nicole Kidman's acting. She leaves me cold. In this movie, she seems to sleepwalk through the part, with an expressionless frostiness that left me uninvolved. I found myself viewing the movie as a critical exercise rather than being drawn into its alternate reality. <br/><br/>Like all ""haunted house' stories, this movie depends on suspension of disbelief.

I'll say this, if you don't see the ending coming half way through this movie, or sooner, then your dumber than a post (and that's insulting dead wood).  The visuals of this movie were nice and there were a few ""boo"" parts that left a few giggling with nervous laughter in the theatre after they were scared, but on the whole I was disappointed that the ending was broadcast so far in advance. My recommendation, wait for the rental or better yet cable or rent the original version of The Haunting, The Haunting of Hill House or The Haunting with Liam Neeson (a bad version but still more scary than The Others)."

There are only really 6 characters in it so the choice was either: none of them are dead, some of them are or they all are, so it was no surprise for me, so don't expect the ending to come as that much of a shock.<br/><br/>The other criticism which I agreed somewhat with was that it took an awful long time to get to the point & not a lot happened along the way to get there. It was always watchable but at occasional point not exciting and could've done with being 10 minutes less.<br/><br/>On the plus side though, the young girl stole the show with a brilliant performance & Eric Sykes chipped in with a good role.<br/><br/>Unlike other films like this, I didn't find any major flaws or even minor ones. With the knowledge of the end, the early scenes all still work, as far as I know. The one grey area was the locking the doors. I failed to see the real relevance of it & don't know whether they were being locked really or not. I doubt it, but am not sure.<br/><br/>Whilst I found the ending no great surprise I thought it was a good ending & well done. But I would still describe it as 'An Ending' rather than 'The Ending.' There were many other avenues they could have gone down with the plot which would've worked too.<br/><br/>But overall, pretty good<br/><br/>7/10"

","I've just came out of the movie theater where The Others has been running for two months. Of course it took a little time before I could put my ideas back in order again, so I could write. This is a real horror film ! Finally someone understood that special effects and other r tricks are fine, but if you lack imagination and talent ( I'm talking to you, Jan De Bont) you will go nowhere. The superb Amenabar's script is clean and effective, grabs us by the neck , forces us to watch every second of it and slaps our face with a real surprising finale. In the meantime,if you can, notice the fantastic settings, the incredible cinematography (90% of its scenes are inside the dark mansion, with minimum lightning) and the performances of the cast. Nicole Kidman is in 99% of the scenes, and surely no actress today can match her combining beauty and talent. Impressive Fionnula Flanagan must be nominated best supporting actress this year. When they are together in the screen you cannot look elsewhere. Do not miss it !"
"khatcher-2","7","2","3","29 September 2001"," Though scaries are not my favourite genre, there is no denying we have a new genius here
","I do not usually go in for anything in the phantasmagoric line; even very few horror films have attracted my attention. This is primarily because I like theatre and cinema to be rather realist, I like it to say something about the world we live in, society, personalities, human values, and so on. I do not look for escapism as a source of entertainment, whether in books, on the stage or on the screen. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule - `Gormenghast' by Mervyn Peake, `The Lord of the Rings' by J.R.R.Tolkien (I am not referring to the film), and of course the universal `Cien Años de Soledad' by Gabriel García Márquez, among books, or Walt Disney's `Fantasia'. Such that the run-of-the-mill factory-produced science-fiction films generally do not attract me either - exceptions being Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' and Ridley Scott's `Bladerunner'.<br/><br/>Alejandro Amenábar might change my preferences a little;  having seen `Abre los Ojos' (qv) only very recently, I was persuaded rather perfunctorily to go and see `Los Otros' the other night, and did not expect much from what seemed a priori to be merely a `ghost story'. Which is precisely what `Los Otros' turned out to be. But directed and written by a young fellow who also composed the music and seems bent on updating Hitchcockian traditions: Alejandro Amenábar is an extraordinary and highly talented young man. The curious mixture of British Actors with Nicole Kidman, recorded in English, but is a Spanish film, makes it evident that Amenábar had his sights aimed at America. However, the film was not shot on Jersey Island in the English Channel, but in a large `caserón' a few kilometres inland from the Cantabrian Coast in Santander, Northern Spain. The photography at all times, but especially through the fog, is spectacular, but Javier Aguirresarobe is already a past master, having already filmed `Secretos del Corazón' (qv), `La Niña de tus Ojos' (qv), `El Perro del Hortelano', `Beltenebros' and `La Fuente Amarilla' (qv), among other titles. Nicole Kidman is pretty good; she plays the part of a mother of two children who is somewhat nervous, even hysterical, as she goes through the house opening and closing the doors as she goes. `Her' two children are very good: Alakina Mann and James Bentley play their parts with a good balance between naturalness and interpretation without exceeding too much in the latter.<br/><br/>And the music is extraordinarily good as it accompanies the different scenes, never overdoing any set leit-motif, with some fine orchestration - although in this I think Amenábar had a helping hand from others. There were moments in which subconsciously some influence could be felt from John Barry perhaps, and I also noted a brief passage that seemed to have roots in the Portuguese `fado'. As Rolling Stone Magazine says, this is a psychological thriller; a little in the Clive Barker style but without all that gore, or even certain concepts from some of Stephen King's works in which `the thing' itself is not so ominously present. But, certainly, if Hitchcock WAS the master, surely we have here a new one? Make space over there at Hollywood - a new little genius is about to cross the Atlantic. Unfortunately."

"jayjaycee","9","1","1","10 April 2020"," Twisted and uniquely scary
","""The Others"" is a 2001 mystery horror thriller directed by Alejandro Amenábar starring Nicole Kidman and Christopher Ecclestone. From time to time, I like to revisit some films with an either complicated or twisted story to see if it's even more well constructed than before. One of those titles is definitely this one. Roughly one year ago, I already gave it a spin at a film party and was blown away by it afterwards. With the knowledge of what would happen, this rewatch revealed even more of its subtle brilliance. First of all, the overall style is absolutely well elaborated. An old English mansion, seemingly neverending fog and authentic costumes make this film so tremendously atmospheric, but all of this would be in vain, if it wasn't for the general cinematography. It's the reason the film is so moody in the first place. The contrast between night and day, light and darkness make it come to life so easily. Without it, the film would be much less entertaining. Another factor the film would not work without is the central performance by Australian beauty Nicole Kidman. Not only does she nail the British accent decently, the way she leads the viewer through the subtle horror makes it so genuinely breathtaking. That's where we come to another point: Amenábar's screenplay. It creates such a creepy atmosphere although ... nothing really happens? To be honest, yes. Aside from some one or two scenes, the film completely passes on using graphic effects. There's no monster in this film, no terrifying entity that will haunt you in your dreams afterwards. It instead relies on mild scares and one might think ""Isn't that film terribly boring then?"". Surprisingly, the total opposite. The film takes place in your head and doesn't resolve what it's dealing with until the very end of the film, but before it reaches the shocking final conclusion there's Kidman who's singlehandedly in charge of creeping out the audience. It's her reactions, her terrified facial expressions that put the viewer in the same position as her and it's this helplessness that also effects the audience that make it so genuinely bone chilling. It's anything but your average ghost story with an obvious threat to escape from, because this threat in here isn't obviously definable. I guess that was what many people back in the day expected to see and why it's fairly underrated by several. It never intended to live from its graphic effects, Amenábar always wanted to terrify the audience just by his phenomenal screenplay. Speaking of which, it's even more brilliant upon a rewatch. Knowing about the mind blowing double plot twist in the end, I realized how it points out countless small hints over the course of the film that actually blatantly give away the ending. It's obvious and subtle at the same time and when it comes to a scene where it should be absolutely clear what really happened, it adds a small detail that makes it ambiguous. It gives the viewer so much information, both true and misleading, but it always makes so much sense nevertheless. This doesn't only happen once, it happens in every single case. I knew that it worked, because my brother who's never seen it before and didn't know about it was genuinely devastated by the ending while I sat there and was like ""Oh, he probably has a clue now"" a number of times. But he didn't. Another stylistic device of it is the subliminal juxtaposition of religion and atheism, as it at the same time denies and confirms the existence of God. All in all, this intelligently written film is an underrated gem that knows to frighten you without being too graphic. The main reason this film disappointed the expectations of so many is probably how it was advertised, as it is a mystery thriller with horror elements rather than a horror film with thriller elements. But if you're able to put aside those false expectations you're in for a minimalistic but definitely frightening flick that builds up its tension with a spooky scenery and by playing mind games with you. It's psychological thriller in its best form that only uses the supernatural to lead you astray. An underappreciated and well crafted gem."

","""Sometimes, the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living"". With that simple phrase uttered in ""The Others"", perhaps the greatest horror/thriller in cinema history commences.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Others"" sees Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo- sensitive (can't be exposed to any natural light) children living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe. While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house and family are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants, who have the ability to come and go as they please, sight unseen.<br/><br/>I wish I could say so much more about this incredible film, but doing so would likely ruin the overall experience. As such, I'll just say this: The only other films in this genre that even challenge this on are ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""What Lies Beneath"". Not too shabby of company, for sure.<br/><br/>Also, please--whatever you do!--do not pass this movie by because it is advertised as a ""ghost story"". It is more truly a psychological thriller with a paranormal element.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Others"" is on my ""short list"" of greatest films of all-time. Many films claim to channel master director Alfred Hitchcock, and most fail (often miserably). This one actually delivers."
"15231","10","1","1","20 July 2002"," One of the BEST ghost stories ever done
","This movie is one of the very few examples produced by Hollywood of how a great ghost story may be done without gore or cheesy special effects or dead teenagers or some ghoul jumping out of a dark corner to grab the heroine. As so many have said before, the film's story and script themselves are solid and compelling. The direction, acting, cinematography and editing are excellent. The suspense is genuine and the audience really feels for the characters and their emotions.<br/><br/>If Freddy and Jason and the other slashers are your thing, then by all means stay away from this film as you will be disappointed that no one is cut or tortured or hunted down in a screaming mayhem to die a gruesome death. If, however, you want a true, old fashioned, ghost story with well developed characters and a mysterious plot, then you will love this one!"
"crypticcrytic","Null","1","1","10 August 2001"," What about AnOther?
","Gothic horror? No. mystery? Nope. Slasher? Not even. Just a dark, dreary film set in the Channel Islands in 1945.  Who better to give us a depressing thriller than America's sweethearts Nicole Kidman and (exec. Producer) Tom Cruise. This just may be the key to their split-up. <br/><br/>Though this is not a frightening nail-biter it may engage you if you're the pulp fiction/gothic romance fan.  It's remarkably slow through the first hour, but the set and the classic characters do provide entertainment. The key to the film's fascination is its ability to keep you wondering who these Others are.  It provides a few moments of shock in the process but when you reach your destination you may find yourself looking for AnOther.<br/><br/>Grace (Nicole Kidman) mother of two young children and mistress of the house opens the film with a frightening scream setting up audience expectation for something really eerie that really never materializes. Seems that the master of the house has gone off to war but forgot to return when it ended. Three stock characters from thousands of British films turn up to carry the tasks to keep the house together and we're given a tour of the house. See the kids, like the audience must live in darkness or they'll shrivel up like prunes in minutes. The house has no electricity or telephones and is lit by oil lamps at best. Heavy drapes cover the windows and heavy Catholic mysticism covers this family. Getting the idea that this isn't light entertainment? <br/><br/>Lesser stars perform their roles admirably, the strongest of whom is Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). I saw her last in `Waking Ned Devine' and her continued strong presence helps bring the film around its plot twist. Daughter and son are cute and annoying, dad returns in a fog and remains perplexed throughout his short appearance and the remaining two characters tread lightly on screen. If you don't like Ms. Kidman, don't come since her visage remains on screen through most of this film.<br/><br/>All of the appropriate moaning, creaking, crying, shadows, frightening looks and terrorized kids can be found here. Nicole plays the part of a moralistic home schooler and this part may have been written with her in mind considering her religious convictions. You may think her paranoid but as events unfold, her fears are well placed. She's actually battling the Dyanetic demons and we expect Mr. Cruise (or maybe even Mr. Travolta) to step in as the embodiment of evil. But they don't. Though it's pretty predictable, it's worth your while as an atmospheric piece and if you're like me, you'll wonder about the derivation of the word `smother.' Though I doubt you'll be peeking behind your drapes to see if something is lurking, it's engaging entertainment for most of the family.<br/><br/><br/><br/>CyCy"

","My favorite genre has the last 10 years been horror-films. Films that chill you to the bone, films that makes you not want to go to sleep. It all started with watching ""The Omen"" when I was 12. I was scared to death, and I fell in love with the feeling. Since then I have tried to find a film that would give me the same feeling as ""The Omen"" gave me back in '92, but I have never found one. Until now... ""The Others"" is a extravagant film that we have not seen in the theaters in a long time. I was so scared I could feel tears popping out of my eyes and it felt wonderful. My girlfriend even asked if we couldn't leave because she was so scared, but I just wanted the film to last forever. To keep injecting this fear-drug into my blood. You might think we are very easy to scare, but I wouldn't say we are. This film is really scaring, the only film that can come up to this would be Robert Wise's  ""The Haunting"" from 1963. Alejandro Amenábar has made what others for so long have tried to accomplish. He has chilled us to the bone."

","I won't say much since there's lots of info on this film. I will just say that this was a fantastic film!!! Despite some people's comments that it wasn't scary, I found it wonderfully gripping and far more terrifying than any film in recent memory. Then again, I don't find the usual Hollywood Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street pap scary at all. Gore is gore and granted it can be appealing if you like that kind of film, but it's not SCARY. This is film is psychologically scary, especially if you have ever been afraid of being alone in a haunted house or even remotely scared of the possibility of ghosts. What makes this film scary is that it preys on your own fears in much the same way Sixth Sense did (another great film, better than The Others in fact, but only by a bit). And if you find it slow, then you are probably one of the sorry victims of too much MTV and instant gratification. If you like Hitchcock, Sixth Sense, or a horror film that engages your mind, then you'll probably love this film. If you hate it, then you'll probably take comfort in the fact that you can always go home and watch your collection of crappy Hollywood horror crap (ok fine it can be enjoyable in the same way a B-movie can be enjoyable, but admit it...it's crap) and unplug your brain altogether. Then again, perhaps a lot of you could fall into the latter ""sub-gerbil"" intelligence level. Often the worst films seem to make lots of money and the films of masters like Godard can't get a multiplex release."
"RolloTomasi","9","1","1","22 August 2001"," so they do make 'em like they used to
","Using absolutely no CG imagery, nor even blood or gory make-up effects, director Alejandro Amenábar goes old school here, crafting something that is truly special in a year like 2001, filled with meaningless, thoughtless work from directors who have proved they know better. ""The Others"" is the kind of picture (what they used to call this form of entertainment) that won't really course through your veins until after the end credits roll. Along the way it provides such great imagery, the kind you only see if you're really paying attention. For instance, when Grace is going through the box full of old photo albums, there is briefly revealed a ghostly face in one of them, as if it's watching her. Likewise the opening shot of one scene showing another ghostly face lit in candlelight (you remember the shot), that at first cannot be distinguished as real or a painting. All of it contributes to a singular purpose: not a shot wasted, no line of dialogue that isn't giving you something meaningful.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is beautiful, not just in the way it looks, but thematically as well. Like any ghost story, it explores the spiritual. It doesn't tell you what to believe, but forces you to question the nature of death and hell. <br/><br/>I predict that this will be the most underrated film of the year. Audiences have been programmed for too long to expect certain things. Too many films don't trust the audience enough to let them collect information and draw conclusions themselves. Too many films have spoon-fed us. Many will get to the end of ""The Others"" and say, 'what, that's it?' It's such a subtle work, it'll leave many feeling like there should have been more. For these reasons, this film will probably be forgotten before too long. And yet, it's the kind of film that should be studied for years to come, particular for its writing, direction, and cinematography. ""The Others"" looks like it could have come from almost any decade. The 'aughts' should be proud to have this film as part of its cinema history.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"SimianLogic","9","1","1","10 August 2001"," Well Crafted Ghost Story
","There's not much that can be said about this film that won't give away the ""surprise"" ending.  I figured it out about fifteen minutes in, but this didn't detract in any way from the enjoyability of the rest.  If you figure things out, you gain a different perspective on how to watch the movie that makes it all the more enjoyable.  I enjoyed the music (and often the silence), which added to the creepy mood of the film.  The lighting was very strictly controlled, which also gave a feel of something otherworldly.  This isn't as fast-paced as most of what Hollywood considers horror films (things jumping out of closets and chasing you with knives), but this is no great loss.  True horror can only come when it's built up slowly and believably. The Others achieves this in several places.  If you liked the Sixth Sense, you will probably enjoy this film a lot."

","The Others is ""obviously based on The Sixth Sense""? Because it's a ghost story? Please. Has anyone seen The Changeling? Not that it matters, because The Others is just like any horror movie: it feeds off the movies that came before it and attempts to make them better. It succeeds.<br/><br/>The Others not only succeeds in weaving the classic Hollywood ghost story (music, atmosphere, sudden shocking scenes, scenes of dawning horror), but it also succeeds in creating a very good movie. Nicole Kidman is absolutely fantastic, as are the two children, and the direction of the movie is absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>Classic atmospheric horror seemed to be a lost art, relegated to be remembered through replays of Vincent Price movies. <br/><br/>But then came The Sixth Sense, bringing back the classic ghost story with a wrenching twist.<br/><br/>Then came What Lies Beneath, adding more terror to a more realistic plot, with another stunning finish.<br/><br/>And now we have The Others, a truly beautifully haunting ghost story. A truly terrifying horror movie, one of the scariest in years. And it is much, much better than its modern-day ancestors.<br/><br/>10/10"
"phantom1515","10","1","1","17 August 2001"," Better the The Sixth Sense...
","If (when) The Others becomes a fairly popular film, then many comparisons will be made to The Sixth Sense. The only real reason that it would even be compared to The Sixth Sense is the shear fact that The Sixth Sense was the last decent psycologial horror film to come out. The Others is a completley different film, except for the fact that the children can see ghosts (or can they...) The Others, who's only star is Nicole Kidman, is a tense, creepy, and sometimes just damn horrifying, expericence. I wont give away any of the plot, it's too complicated, but I will say that where The Sixth Sense relied on one big twist to pull everything together, The Others has several. The Others is a film that was thought out, well written, and then executed with perfection. In reading other user comments, I have noticed that some didn't like the end twist. I personaly thought it was more cleaver then The Sixth Sense. But that's just my two cents worth."

","""The Others"" is a surprisingly effective supernatural thriller / ghost story from the Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (""Open Your Eyes""). It is a type of film where the less you know (about its plot), the more you will enjoy it--so, I will refrain from commenting on the actual plot of ""The Others."" However, I must remark that it is refreshing to see a horror film that taps into, and makes effective use of, the fears that are naturally ""hardwired"" into all of us (e.g. the dark, creeking doors, unidentified noises), instead of trying to induce artificialshock and terror into us (the usual method is: something suddenly jumps into frame, accompanied by a loud ""boom!"" on the soundtrack). ""The Others"" manages to generate an enormous<br/><br/>amount of claustrophobic eeriness and suspense (most of the story takes place inside a house which has its windows covered with curtains) which are occasionally punctured by real moments of surprise. Nicole Kidman is present virtually in every scene and her natural and believable performance is a large part of what makes ""The Others"" so absorbing. This film should appeal to thoughtful horror fans who prefer suspense and mood over gore and blood. It is the best example of its genre since 1999's hit, ""The Sixth Sense."""

""The Sixth Sense"" also explained the ""doctrine"" behind the parallel spirit world while ""The Others"" fails to explain the ""why"" at all.

A very annoying tendency that this director has, just like in Abre los Ojos / Vanilla Sky, which started out good, but was ruined by an ending that explained everything, and simplified the movie extremely. The movie was instantly changed from being a fairly good metaphoric movie, to a simple sci-fi flick. I felt that nothing really happened in the movie, other than when there was some dialogue, and the characters revealed a bit of their story to each other.

The plot is thin, the characters very one dimensional and the overall feeling that it gave was a huge sense of disapointment after a very long, boring build up. We have seen this before, the people you think you are after turns out to be your own self, such as Fight Club. It reminded me of the 6th Sense(another weak movie), this is of course no accident as it seems like a lot of the ideas are blatently copied from 6th Sense. I thought this was gonna be a very scarey ghost movie with tonnes of ghosts running a muck killing and slaughtering, just general terrorizing and havok. I was to say the least, extremely disapointed. For those unsuspecting renters out there, heed this warning: Pass on The Others, move on to the betters. 3/10"

","This movie wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be.  It did all the things I don't like a movie to do.  The first 30 minutes were full of false scares and unfulfilled suspense.  In the middle, there was a VERY long patch where not much of anything was going on.  Finally, an eight year old could have predicted the ""big exciting TWIST"" at the end.<br/><br/>One good point: The creators didn't use a lot of gore to make up for the lack of imagination.  I've always believed that what you don't see can be far scarier than what you do see (example, Blair Witch). <br/><br/>Sorry to say I cannot recommend this one."

","I gave this film a generous 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>The only reason I paid to see this movie was because American Pie 2 was sold-out.  I knew I had wasted my money when I had everything figured out after 15 minutes or so.  This film was so drawn out for nothing that I actually slept through parts of it, and yet, I didn't miss a thing.  The dialogue was irritating, the plot was poor and overall (spoiler coming up)this film appeared to me as a ripoff of a recent thriller with Bruce Willis.  It's been a long time since I went and saw a horror/thriller and heard nothing in the theater (i.e.  gasps, screams, etc...).  I think it was due to the fact that I was sleeping, as were the others.<br/><br/>Wait for the television premiere of this one.  It isn't even worth the $4.00 to rent it."

The children are photosensitive and can't be in direct sunlight. Grace is religious and over-protective with numerous strange rules. Then Grace hears strange noises and voices which her girl Anne says it's a boy named Victor and his family.<br/><br/>This is a terrific moody ghost story. The twist is very nicely done.

First thing the acting in it is good from everyone except the little girl. The plot is quite good with an interesting original twist however the movie is quite slow and dull for me.I thought it was going to be somewhat scary and it was not at all.<br/><br/>This movie is about a young family in England circa 1940s. The father has gone off to war and the mother is forced to stay at home and take care of her children who have a rare disease which makes them ultra alergic to the sunlight.

"Desertman84","10","2","4","12 November 2011"," Unbelievable Twist
","The Others is a psychological horror film that stars Nicole Kidman together with Fionnula Flanagan,Christopher Eccleston,Elaine Cassidy,Eric Sykes,Alakina Mann and James Bentley. It is inspired partly by the novella The Turn of the Screw.The music as well as the screenplay and direction was by Alejandro Amenábar.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Grace, a devoutly religious mother of two ailing children who has moved with her family to a mansion on the English coast while awaiting her husband's return from World War II, though he has been declared missing. Their children, Anne and Nicholas, both suffer from a rare photosensitive disease that renders them extremely vulnerable to sunlight, prompting Grace's rule of having only one door open in the house at a time. When Anne begins claiming to see ghosts, Grace at first believes her newly arrived family of eccentric servants to be responsible, but chilling events and visions soon lead her to believe that something supernatural is indeed going on.<br/><br/>The Others is another type of horror film with an unbelievable twist.It was engaging and absorbing from beginning to end.Also,it is definitely far from being clichéd and formulaic as the viewer may find oneself completely astounded and fascinated at the last scenes of the film.Aside from its unbelievable twist,one cannot help about the music,screenplay and direction by Amenábar as well as the brilliant performances of the cast especially by Kidman.<br/><br/>Overall,it is one-of-a-kind horror film that clearly exhibits Amenábar's genius in film-making."
"Theothervip","9","2","4","12 March 2011"," Effectively bone-chilling, but there's more to it than that.
","Rating: **** out of 4.<br/><br/>Sadly, there are fewer and fewer movies horror stories like THE OTHERS being made nowadays. Ask even some horror movie fans and they might pick SAW or Friday THE 13TH over THE INNOCENTS or DON'T LOOK NOW any day, and to an even lesser extent, some of the horror fans of my generation prefer the PG-13 junk to any of those classic 70's horror thrillers. Well, it's a good think that once in a while, great horror movies like THE OTHERS come out and bring us back to horror movie heaven where we truly belong.<br/><br/>THE OTHERS is one of the better horror movies to have come out in years. I can't believe I have only seen it recently! Consider this one of the movies in my ""Should have seen it earlier"" list. Director Alejandro Amenabar takes us on a psychological horror mind trip rather than the latest disposable PG-13-level release. It's scary but not in ways you expect. There are an occasional number of ""boo"" moments, but Amenabar handles them better than most; taking full advantage of our expectations and than catching us when we least expect. The whole theme of the story too is far more mature than most films of the genre. Perhaps it ain't as thought-provoking as, say, THE INNOCENTS (a film THE OTHERS takes a few notes from), but it's brilliant in its own clever, mind-blowing way.<br/><br/>Having only recently landing a role in MOULIN ROUGE as a playful, sumptuous Can-Can dancer, Nicole Kidman takes an opposite turn playing a dark, fragile character as Grace, a woman who lives alone with her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), in an old dark mansion while her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) is away at war. Grace hires a trio of helpers - housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a mute named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) - to attend to the house. Then strange occurrences start happening, prompting Grace to believe that the house is haunted by ""intruders"". Anne starts seeing a boy she calls ""Victor"", as well as an old woman she believes is a witch. Plus something may or may not be all right with the new help.<br/><br/>THE OTHERS returns to the classic horrific atmosphere of those old-school horror movies - the candelabra-lit walks through dark hallways, doors being slammed shut by other things than the wind, and specters that look even creepier without the use of gruesome make-up effects. Even without the use of a lot of ""jump-out-and-scare-you"" moments (though there are a couple here), Amenabar keeps us interested because, unlike recent throwaway fare, he has an excellent story and an interesting array of tragic, unstable characters, and an atmosphere than effectively (literally) keep us in the dark throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Amenabar has not made an outright horror outing since (he did make TESIS prior to THE OTHERS, but nothing else after), which is sad. The genre needs more like him these days, one that can perfect the balance of good writing, performances, atmosphere, and scares and delivering a ideal entry in the much under-utilized genre."

"Eternality","8","2","4","8 September 2010"," The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like The Sixth Sense and The Orphanage reside.
","Alejandro Amenabar's first foray into English-language filmmaking is a largely successful one. One of the most striking filmmakers to emerge in the late 90s, Amenabar is a skillful craftsman whose talent extends beyond directing into screen writing and also into film score composition. Born in Chile but raised in Spain, the director of acclaimed dramas such as Open Your Eyes (1997) and the Oscar-winning The Sea Inside (2004) gives us a fine addition to the horror genre with The Others, a mainstream production made with authority.<br/><br/>The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Bayona's The Orphanage (2007) reside. In an uninformed reality, Amenabar's film comes across as a fusion between the two above-mentioned pictures. That being said, it would make more sense to chronologically observe the influences each has had on one another over the years. Similar to Shyamalan's film, The Others has a climatic twist at the end (don't worry, there are no spoilers ahead) which equals in ambitiousness but strangely unmatched in terms of shock value.<br/><br/>The Others stars an excellent Nicole Kidman in the lead role as the mother of two children whom are photosensitive (read: allergic to sunlight) and must be kept perpetually in the dark (an intriguing plot device). The huge house they live in does have a sinister past of a ghostly nature. What seems like a straightforward ghost story turns into an exercise in atmospheric mood setting. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe creates lingering, almost elegant-like shots of the exterior of the house which is nearly always hidden in thick fog. For interior scenes it is mostly lit by candlelight (a requirement of the plot device), giving an eerie glow that is both warm yet chilling.<br/><br/>Speaking of chills, The Others has one prolonged spine-tingling sequence in the final third: the two children 'escape' from the confines of their room in the middle of the night only to find themselves in a small graveyard with suspicious servants pursuing them. The mood setting here achieves its pinnacle. Amenabar does stick to the rigid expectations of the genre, but he explores them with a fresh approach mainly through its unconventional plot.<br/><br/>The role of darkness versus light is reversed in this film. Here, the children seek solace in the dark but are traumatized by daylight. Their mother, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable in darkness but is at ease when it is bright. This allows Amenabar to tap on the fears of the characters and to create tension in two extreme settings. The Others is clever filmmaking, boasts artistry and is clear in its execution. At its heart, it is a film about challenging one's beliefs and the need to stand true and firm when these beliefs are challenged.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomeno.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"DiamondGirl427","4","2","4","15 August 2010"," Glad I Never Bothered....
","When this film came out...I thought it might be good..worth seeing at some point..in the theater. I am glad I never wasted my time and money to do so then. It starts off boring..stays boring..and does little to make you want to watch it until the end. It did not take long to realize the main characters were dead..and did not understand what had happened to them. The kids...the boy..is wimpy..and the girl is rather mean and hateful. No wonder..with a mother who seems to have major mood swings at the drop of a hat. The husband...a war hero of sorts..comes home..suddenly..out of the fog...unsure of how he got there...and with the idea the war is still being fought...so he must go back and leave his family again. To live in that gloomy house..surrounded by fog..no wonder he wants to leave. The caretakers of the place...they all seem to know SOMETHING...but none say a word...why? The housekeeper simply does the bidding of the woman..with a grim look on her face..as if she doesn't approve. Why doesn't she speak up? The kids are supposedly sensitive to light...so everything is kept dark..windows covered...she thinks the sunlight will kill them...how does she know that? Who told her? A doctor..? Or is it part of her delusions? She seems very uptight and almost manic at times..ranting and raving...which would have been the perfect time for someone to tell her the truth. Apparently..her husband was killed in the war...and she lost her mind because of it...killed her children and the people who worked for her...and then herself....or she was loony all along and that sent her over the edge? The mansion sits far from anything...it seems...no one comes...no one we see anyway...but when the curtains disappear...we know someone or something has taken them down...ghosts we are thinking..? Someone trying to kill her children...the woman is thinking. I never did get the idea of why the woman kept all the keys to everything. Every room had to be kept locked...another of her delusions? If she was so fearful of the place...why didn't she gather her children and leave? Fog or no fog? Any good mother would have gone for help or something of the sort. She gets a gun and attempts to shoot...another hint at what she might have done at one time to the living? I wanted to like this film...and I am not a big Nicole Kidman fan at all..but after I figured out the plot..it was no longer interesting. They called the unseen people ""The intruders""...and it scares the children. Who would scare children like that? If they have to spend eternity being afraid because of things their mother did..it seems wrong. The séance scene finally lets you in on what is going on...duh...we knew that already. What people would hold a séance to find out of the place was truly haunted before they decided to buy it? Weird. The place will continue to stay empty..because as Nicole Kidman says in the end ""no one can make us leave this house"". It reminded me of another haunted house type story..""Rose Red"" by Stephen King...which made a much better movie. Watch that instead...I think you will enjoy it a lot more."
"ferbs54","9","2","4","14 May 2008"," Haunting
","With its sterling reputation as one of the best cinematic ghost stories since 1963's ""The Haunting,"" Alejandro Amenabar's 2001 film ""The Others"" was one that this latecomer plopped into his DVD player with great anticipation. And I am happy to report that all the positive word of mouth is right on the money, and that this really is some kind of great work. As most folks seem to have already discovered, ""The Others"" takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her ""photosensitive"" children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, ""The Others"" really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three ""Star Trek"" series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes. The picture features an absolutely brilliant ending that I was not prepared for (those who have read E.F. Benson's 1923 story ""Mr. Tilley's Seance"" will perhaps appreciate this ending even more), and that final shot of Kidman and her children in an upstairs window is just...haunting. I found this film even better and deeper on a repeat viewing. More than highly recommended."

There was a movie in the 60s that was similar to this movie called ""The Innocents"". Its about a governess who comes to take care of a young girl and insists the house is haunted but can't prove it. It was a very chilling movie for its time so it should be worth the time to find it and/or watch it. You might want to consider it if you can find it anywhere.

","Who are you Alejandro Amenábar and where have you been? Your filmography consists of all foreign films save this one, so give us more.<br/><br/>This movie was spectacular and I'll tell you why. After the mega successful movie ""The Sixth Sense"" was done, no way would you figure a movie regarding ghosts and a plot twist would be done. Or, if someone was as bold as to make a movie along the lines of ""The Sixth Sense"", then you would not figure it to be nearly as good. <br/><br/>In steps ""The Others"" with a very similar story and plot twist, but oh so wonderfully different and uniquely brilliant. This movie didn't hardly get the accolades it deserves, but I am here to sing its praises. This movie was eerie, spooky, and suspenseful. Nicole Kidman, albeit not my favorite actress, did an excellent job. What made the movie even more amazing was the complete misdirection. I honestly thought the movie was headed towards a final showdown with a confrontation between humans and ghosts and the subsequent exorcism of those ghosts. Yes, there was a final confrontation, but the ghosts were not what or who you expected. This was just a great movie."
"moviewizguy","10","2","4","1 June 2007"," A Lovely Genuine Horror Movie
","I'm afraid that telling a slightest hint of the plot will already give away what's coming when you watch the film, so I'll just give you the set up: A woman named Grace retires with her two children to a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War, where she's waiting for her husband to come back from battle. The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. She then hires 3 servants to help around the house, or mansion.<br/><br/>Okay, that really doesn't give the plot, but as soon as you watch it, you'll know it's a ghost story, but this time, it's not mainstream! Well, isn't that original? I'm so glad they don't have those usual horror movie clichés and those huge amounts of gore. In fact, this movie doesn't even need special effects to make us scared because this movie is really creepy.<br/><br/>If this can't be one of the best movies in 2001, it should at least be the best or one of the best movies ever made in 2001, if not one of the best horror movies. If you're tied of those PG-13 horror movies, this won't disappoint. It's like The Ring (in as good PG-13 rated horror films).<br/><br/>I love this movie because it's like Lost, in which subtle clues are given away little by little until it reaches the twist ending. Believe me, the pay off is great, if you think this movie's pacing is too slow. I'm sure it's slow, if someone figured the twist ending already. If not, don't try to think some up or you'll get mad at the graceful pace the film is moving.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman gives a really great performance in here, as well as many other characters. The cinematography, the score, and the production, they're all great! This film really doesn't follow many mainstream movie rules. This movie doesn't need blood, special effects, scary make-up, etc. to even scare you. This film is creepy and is one of the best horror films these days have to offer. Sadly, there are only few of them."

"antra_chief","9","2","4","6 September 2006"," A great horror movie
","This movie surprised me a lot along with The Sixth Sense as their twists are rather similar to each other. What I liked about this movie is that it does not rely on blood, gore and explicit violence that most horror movies today show us as an attempt to frighten the hearts of us viewers. Instead most of the frights comes from the eerie atmosphere of the setting and scenario. <br/><br/>Most of the time the film is shot quietly which some viewers might find boring but this only adds to the suspense and tension if continued watching. The director was able to include the most basic and necessary methods of a standard classic horror movie to ensure a frightening sensation. Such method includes the use of creepy sound effects. When I say this I mean footsteps being heard, floorboards creaking, voices of little children echoing down the hallway, heavy breathing sound etc. <br/><br/>The film is mainly shot with the curtains drawn as well. This is because Grace's children suffer from a disease which does not allow them to stay in front of the sun for too long otherwise they will shrivel up and die. This is a great excuse for having dark settings most of the time and it provides a great deal of tension. If you look at the house from the outside, you would think that this family is non existence. <br/><br/>I particularly like how Grace's personality is portrayed. Nicole Kidman did a very good job at being the strict and over protective mother who follows and impose certain rules around the house. For example closing and locking every door behind them. Grace is very strict about this particular rule and its frightening, as the viewer to see her being very sensitive about it and it makes you feel the same shock and insecurity as she feels when a door is left open.<br/><br/>Also the arrival of the 3 servants serves a purpose in creating tension as well. These 3 strange servants which one of them includes Mrs. Bertha Mills played brilliantly by Fionnula Flanagan makes us doubt their existence and that they have something to do with the 'intruders'. Set during the WW2 period its to no one surprise to see Grace being paranoid at thinking that there is a German soldier in the house. Mrs. Bertha Mills constantly tries to reassure Grace that there are nobody else other than themselves in the house. She gives the impression that she is a loyal harmless servant which everybody buys until the point where she and Mr. Tuttle end up covering the gravestones. She plays a frightening character indeed and this what makes it more intense and scary.<br/><br/>The use of camera angles is well placed showing the pivotal angles of a scene. The angles which some would say shows off the most intense and frightening aspect of that scene. The close up shot of the door knob, the low down angle of the staircase all adds to the tension and suspense. The use of lighting also plays a vital role as the whole film is set around dark areas of the mansion. Since they don't have electricity they resort to using candles and oil lamps. The flicker of the flame casting shadows around the house actually provides a great deal of tension. Its almost as if these moving shadows are representing the 'others'. <br/><br/>Overall this is a great horror movie, even today it still stands out as one of the best. Its far better than recent horror releases because it actually provides you with frights and scares rather than the usual gross out sickening and disgusted look when you see a man's arm being chopped off or an eye ball being cut off. This film does not need any of those disturbing scenes to create a frightening sensation. It prefers to use old classical methods in creating tension and this is something which Alfred Hitchcock might be proud of. Top marks for Nicole Kidman in her portrayal of Grace but the star of the show to me really goes to Fionnula Flanagan."
"hosolo","10","2","4","21 July 2006"," Oooh - Australian actors
","A couple of movies I've watched lately, have all involved Australian actors. Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, Hugh Jackman in X-Men, Guy Pearce and Nicole Kidman. I completely forgot she was an Aussie. Her portrayal of an overprotective British mother is incredibly good that when I played the DVD extras, that Australian accent came back on. Kidman, Flanagan as the lead housekeeper, the two young children especially give great acting performances. And like Ledger in Brokeback, when the acting is superb, and the story well told, repeated viewings are a must. I don't know why some people call it ""slow"". From the opening scream to the surprise ending, The Others kept me involved, not knowing if the housekeepers were diabolical or ""Grace"" was really mad, as her daughter suggested. Director Amenabar wrote, directed and composed the score for the film, which greatly enhanced the mood at certain scenes. The music gave a clue of what was happening but it was still effective. A really enjoyable nighttime flick, one that will make you shudder, and very well made."
"jmmiras","8","2","4","17 May 2006"," Hitchcock influenced suspense
","Since his first feature, Amenábar has been characterized for liking the plots with suspense and a great commercial success. For this film, he fronted a minimalistic story but with lots of suspense.<br/><br/>Highly influenced by Hitchcok imagery and visual style, this film suggests more than it really shows. The atmosphere is extremely well created, the international actors are very well selected and the fit very well to their characters, Amenábar was able to create a very suggestive atmosphere with the soundtrack and the script do not have any fissure.<br/><br/>This film is clearly influenced by several masterpieces such as Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING or Hitchcock's REBECCA.<br/><br/>In my opinion, THE OTHERS should be considered as the best Amenábar film (up to date)."
"timhayes-1","8","2","4","25 April 2006"," Taut, ghost story
","To be perfectly honest, Alejandro Amenabar's The Others really brings absolutely nothing new to the ghost story genre. In fact, everything about the film has been done before. so why did I like it so much? Simple. The Others is still a very stylish and atmospheric film. It hearkens back to the days when a film had an actual story to tell and did so at its own pace. Not ruled by hyper fast cutscenes. In this way, the film slowly builds its tension as it gives the viewer piece by piece the clues to its puzzle. And all the while it keeps doling on the atmosphere until the film almost chokes from it. In short, The Others is a better film for how it goes about its business than for what its business actually is."

","Set in England after WW2, Grace and her two children, Anne and Nicholas live in a rather isolated mansion waiting for their husband/father to return from the war, but I they haven't heard from him since leaving. To make matters even more worst their housekeepers have just got up and left without any notice and the kids suffer from an illness were sunlight could cause them to badly, blister up. But suddenly three mysterious servants show up to work there and that's when strange occurrences start happening with the kids claiming that they're not alone in the house, but the uneasy Grace doesn't want to hear about it, that's until she becomes aware of the strange forces at work.<br/><br/>The sudden interest in subtle, supernatural horror flicks can be attributed a lot to M. Night Shyamalan's film; 'The Sixth Sense (1999)'. This is my second viewing of it and I might be going against the grain, but I say this film is more emotionally engaging with such penetrating atmosphere and flawless performances compared with M. Night's mixed bag. 'The Others' is an intelligently stylish, sophisticated slow burner that plays on the little things to work up the increasing intensity that slowly strangles you with its grinding atmospheric air. Director Alejandro Amenabar manages to create a rich atmosphere from the shadowy grand exterior of the house to the blanket of mist that smothers the lush surroundings of the estate. But what impressed me most was the confident and sensitively in depth performances he got out of the small cast. Nicole Kidman raises the bar with an extraordinary performance as the rigidly, fearful mother. The two kids Alakina Mann and James Bentley are convincingly good. Then you got remarkable supporting roles from Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy. Christopher Eccleston makes a small appearance too. The story sticks close to the traditional, Gothic haunted house tale with the usual set-up with dead silence making way for sudden noises, poorly lit rooms, things going bump, fake scares and so on. But what made these things such a breath of fresh air is how director Amenabar had total control of his vision with precise timing to milk out its bold, suggestive thrills, which will totally put you on the edge just like that of Kidman's brittle character. The atmosphere ventures into a dreamlike realm but still keeping a steady foot in reality. While, in the imposing Gothic mansion the darkness fills every space with it creaking with isolation and tightly knitted quarters. These striking visuals and set-pieces are gorgeously shot with such skill and a good eye for detail. A powerfully streamlined score is generally enchantingly and when it strives for creepy scares it does so in an exhaustingly tense tone. The elegant plot illustrates an very intriguing mystery tale that's psychologically demanding with secrets crossing your path and many cryptic hints to what may happen. The film's major revelation might not be a huge surprise for some, but I for one didn't think it was that easy to pick up on.<br/><br/>A chillingly subtle, but astoundingly effective suspense drama that pushes you to the brink with assured direction and very first-rate performances."

","Thought that this film was going to go down the garden path like most thriller films. However, I was greatly surprised and enjoyed an entirely different experience. Nicole Kidman,(Grace Stewart),""Birth"",'04, showed her great acting talents and charming beauty. Grace opened doors and locked them constantly and never let any sunlight into this huge dwelling of a home where she lived with her two children. They used candle and oil lamps for lighting and the children seemed to drive their mother crazy. Grace was waiting for her husband to come home from WW II since the war was over in 1945.

","Alejandro Amenabar serves up a deliciously spooky ghost story with ""The Others"", an original and haunting tale about an English woman and her two children in a remote, dark mansion during World War II. Grace (Kidman in a superb performance) and her creepy children, who are sensitive to sunlight, have to stay inside. When her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann, who holds her own strongly, playing off Kidman well) starts telling her she can see ""intruders"" in the house, Grace disregards it until she begins having terrifying experiences of her own. After the arrival of mysterious ""servants"", who aid Grace in her paranoia, it becomes clear that something is very wrong within the walls of her home, and she must take matters into her own hands or something far worse could come of it.

","Impossible to discuss this movie at length without putting a spoiler warning. Even saying it is a ghost story from the ghosts' point of view might warrant it. It begins with Grace (Kidman) waking up screaming from a nightmare - and the tone is set. With a patient, meticulous script both the mood of the story and the story itself are carefully and almost lovingly built up until the catch is sprung on you. Viewing it a second time - like Sixth Sense - it hangs together nicely. That's really all I can say except that I was impressed by Kidman's versatility here and also by the children's' performances. Alakina Mann was particularly unsettling at times as Anne, the mysterious, mistrustful daughter who first sees the 'Intruders'. A fine yarn and a fine film."

The house has a scary heartbeat and breathes on the back of the necks of its residence. The atmosphere itself is one that plays to its own script and the director Aleandro Amenabar feeds on that but camera shot that can show the life of the house. Nicole Kidman's intonation and eye can speak and play off of each other. Since The Others is not the typical horror/drama film it was able to set up its own beat that it marches to very well."

"erose001","8","2","4","23 July 2002"," A Haunting Allegory
","We are fascinated by haunted houses on so many levels:  For their paranormal factor, for their ""scary"" factor, and for the psychological symbolism with which they are filled, considering the house as the symbol of the individual persona, with its inhabitants representing the various parts of the psyche. (In Freudian terms, that would include the Id, the Ego, the Superego, etc. In Jungian terms, it would include the various ""masks"" we wear to accomplish our various conscious tasks, as well as our unconscious.  In more generic terms, it would include the parts of our personas that are controlling, childlike, stewards, truthtellers, etc.)  <br/><br/>All of these levels are explored well in this film, which makes the film a very satisfying psychological thriller until the twist at the end.  At that point, the allegory is stretched for the sake of a dramatic surprise, which for many veteran filmgoers was probably not all that surprising.  I grant that it did provide a tidier, ""Hollywood"" ending to the film, but in allegorical terms, actually made the story sadder and creepier than it already was.<br/><br/>For those comparing the story to *The Turn of the Screw* (or the film, ""The Innocents""), the comparison to the psychological allegory is apt, although updated well from Henry James' Victorian sensibilities, which makes this a worthwhile film in and of itself.  Actually any comparison to a well-done haunted-house story is bound to bear fruit, as all have the same basic psychological elements.  (For example, Kubrick's version of *The Shining* can be compared also, although the gore factor was much higher in *The Shining*.)<br/><br/>As for the comparison to *The Sixth Sense*, I see none, beyond the ability of children to see apparitions, and a twist at the end.  And there are many movies that include these features, few done in such a particularly interesting and surprising way as done in *The Sixth Sense*.  It stands on its own, it's an orange; this is an apple.  I think some make the comparison because the films came out within a couple of years of each other, and had similar marketing campaigns.  Had they come out 25 years apart, no one would think to compare them, beyond the fact that both are excellent paranormal/suspense films.<br/><br/>As for filmmaking, other commenters have made the salient points well, I needn't repeat what has already been said about the excellent acting, lighting, cinematography, editing, and, of course, directing.  For pure suspense, I recommend the fog scene.  I'll say no more as I don't want to include spoilers.<br/><br/>For those who want a mindless horror-suspense movie, look elsewhere, this ain't it.  But if you enjoy a little brain candy with your entertainment, overall, this is an excellent suspense film.  Just be prepared for the Hollywood ending."
"jhclues","10","2","4","3 June 2002"," Amenabar Achieves the Impossible
","Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise.  Moreover, films of that same school touted as being `scary,' as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  `The Others,' written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you can't swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you'll know you've arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go. By the end of the film, it's clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.<br/><br/>The Channel Islands, 1945:  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children's nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.<br/><br/>Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there's more:  Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.'  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne. And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity. If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.<br/><br/>More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds. <br/><br/>
Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.<br/><br/>Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film. <br/><br/>
The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, `The Others' is an inspired film that offers one of, if not `the' most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible:  He's made the `Super' in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.  It's an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and it's the magic of the movies.  10/10."

Well made, solidly but unspectacularly made, and technically perfectly competent, but with a story and an ambience that is nothing new. Anyone who has seen 'The Woman in Black' (on stage or TV) or any of a score of British ghost flicks of the 1960s or 70s will find everything here amazingly familiar.

","I had heard good things about this movie and arrived full of expectation but unfortunately left thinking what a complete waste of 2 hours. The film is very slow and I was constantly waiting for something to happen but it just never does. Despite valiant efforts the film failed to create any sort of atmosphere, despite the fact it commences in almost total darkness I was very rarely on edge. To me the film appears to be a feeble attempt to recreate the affect of the sixth sense but it fails miserably. The 'twist' at the end is rather predictable and even if you do not see it coming it does not fill you with any shock, you will just be anxious to escape the cinema by that time.  The only glimmer of light in this dismal production was the performance of Nicole Kidman who does carry the lead role very well, although talk of an Oscar may be a little optimistic. The film is entitled 'The Others' and I would recommend you see any of the other films available before this one."

","THE OTHERS / (2001) *** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	It must be difficult making a movie like ""The Others,"" when the entire plot is based on one final twist. The filmmakers know what that twist is, and it's probably tough keeping it a secret. Take ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Game,"" or  ""Fight Club,"" for instance.  The actors know they are playing character's with a special surprise in store for them, but their characters don't. The performances must stay true to the story after the final twist is revealed, but must not foreshadow what is in store for us in the final scenes. <br/><br/>	""The Others"" has another one of those endings that makes you want to see the movie again just to see if everything adds up correctly. Unfortunately, most people won't have the patience to sit through it for a second time. The film, directed, composed, and written by Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amendabar, contains a convincing atmosphere and knows how to build tension the audience can cut with a knife, but the timing is off. It makes us wait way too long for something to happen that will relieve the fog-thick suspense.   	 The film takes place on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of World War II, where a young woman awaits the return of her husband who went to war when his country needed him. Nicole Kidman plays this quiet, subtle woman, named Grace, who spends her days and night taking care of her children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) in her gorgeous Victorian mansion. She hires a new trio of house servants to replace the crew who mysteriously disappeared. Then strange things begin to happen. Grace's daughter explains that she has been communicating with an unseen boy. At first, Grace does not believe her child, but when Grace herself starts to hear strange noises, and witness unusual events, she also questions the possibility of an intruder inside her home. <br/><br/>	""The Others"" lingers for a long time. It does get under our skin and create a strong, spooky mood, similar to that of the old-fashioned haunted house movies. The film makes us believe we are in a dark, lonely house, and that someone, or something, may be inside with us. Nicole Kidman's performance is contagious. She infects the audience with Grace's fear and suspicion. Easily one of the year's best performances, Kidman stirs the terror with a gripping, uneasy edge. The supporting actors do not steal the scenes from Kidman, she deserves the focus, but they still give her enough material to react to. <br/><br/>	It's too bad that more doesn't happen in the movie. ""The Others"" eventually becomes redundant-it's scene after scene of Grace walking through dark rooms and closing the blinds to her house-her children are allergic to the light (a plot element that doesn't contribute much to the story). The film also stumbles when a specific character enters the picture-the event is highly anticipated, but the movie doesn't know what to do when it happens. It's worth seeing because of the final revelation, the spookiness of the atmosphere, and the performance by Kidman. Alejandro Amendabar must think that with a story like this, the less you reveal, the more suspenseful it is. ""The Others"" proves a different theory: less is not more-more is more."

","""The Others"" was the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, who was at that time best known for ""Abre Los Ojos"", shortly thereafter the recipient of a Hollywood adaptation in the form of ""Vanilla Sky"". Here, Amenábar crafted an original screenplay that managed to breathe new life into the age-old haunted house sub-genre. Following on the heels of ""The Sixth Sense"", this movie is another classy supernatural thriller that keeps audiences guessing until the very end.<br/><br/>The story's main character is a British woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in a remote country house with her two children shortly after the end of World War II. Her husband went away to war and, having not returned, is presumed dead. With the previous household staff having recently vanished, a trio of former servants arrive to offer their services. They are accepted into the household and soon become acquainted with the children's unique medical condition. The ingenious premise put forth by Amenábar is that the children are highly photosensitive and cannot be exposed to light. Thus, the house is draped in shadow out of necessity. This sets the stage for mysterious occurrences that may or may not be supernatural in origin.<br/><br/>The cast is small but well-assembled. Nicole Kidman is the focal point and she delivered an impressive performance in a demanding role. This type of movie doesn't often get recognized by prestigious awards bodies but Kidman nevertheless managed to land both a Golden Globe nomination & a BAFTA nomination. The actors that played her two children (Alakina Mann & James Bentley) were also up to the task. However, the best performance in a supporting role has to be that of Fionnula Flanagan as the enigmatic Mrs. Mills.<br/><br/>Amenábar certainly knows how to establish the proper atmosphere for a good old-fashioned haunted house story. Not only did he bring his script to life with visual panache, he also scored the movie. ""The Others"" does such a nice job of sustaining its suspense that you don't realize until it's over just how simple the story actually is. It's a simplicity that harks back to the written ghost stories of centuries past but presented with a verve that has no trouble transferring the timeless appeal to modern viewers. It's also a presentation that's elegant enough to appeal to more than just watchers of horror movies."

But at first it did not seem to indicate that the hostess was different, but that she had come across three particularly different servants there was also a strange family in the room, the presence of her husband, and so on the Qing festival hinted that the audience was not so simple. The play did not directly show that she had killed her children, perhaps such a story is sad, but think about it, she is also forced by feelings, love is not there, only she alone to look after the sick child, can think of that kind of her desire for love. The film is very logical without that common element of terror, which depends on the actor's acting and the development of the plot"

","While I watched it several times since it came out, until a moment ago I had no idea that the film is Spanish. And not only is it Spanish, but it's also the only film that has ever won the award for the best Spanish film, without having a word in Spanish. Although the original script was written in Spanish, it was translated into English, it stars an Australian woman playing an English woman, it's backed by Americans and the story is placed in Jersey, but it is filmed in Spain and directed by Spaniard. IMDb classifies him as a horror/mystery/thriller, but even though the story itself is a mystery and perhaps somewhat a thriller, and the film has an atmosphere that balances on the verge of horror, in my opinion, essentially, this is primarily a strong psychological drama. Nicole Kidman once again proves her acting size and steals every scene in which she appears, but the rest of the team are not to be underestimated, especially eleven-year-old Alakina Mann. One of the strongest features of this film should be the surprise brought by the final plot twist, but since I saw it several times, I knew what would happen, and I really can not remember whether I predicted this twist or not when I first watched it, almost two decades ago, and if I did, in which part of the film it happened, and therefore I can not comment on its effectiveness. But even without the mindfak factor, this movie has a lot of qualities and deserves a high rating.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

","ARE THERE REALLY ""OTHERS""?
For most people classic creepy movies will always be the best ones. Movies like ""The sixth sense"", ""The others"", ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""When a stranger calls"" are some of the unforgettable horror, thriller and drama movies of all time. More fascinating than the great scenery of second world war (1945) is Nicole Kidman's performance as Grace, the main character of ""The others"", a thriller movie premiered in 2001.
Grace is a devout, determined and protective woman who lives in a huge mansion in Jersey, the Channel Islands, who is waiting her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) return from the war. She's the mother of two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who suffer from a terrible disease against sun light, what makes the house always seem dark, mysterious and scary. Grace also has some weird rules in the house. Another door can't be open before the previous one is locked.
The story really begins when some new candidates appear out of the blue, even without Grace requesting them, to substitute the employees who had disappeared. The new employees, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and a speechless young woman called Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) seem to know the house very well and have a bunch of secrets.
While the movie runs, Anne starts talking to a boy called Victor and his family. She tells her mother, but she doesn't believe in her daughter. After a few times, when she listens the piano playing, even though it's locked, she starts believing there's someone else between those 50 rooms.
Besides, when Grace is looking after the invaders she finds a book with pictures of all families that had lived in that house before. That's the time all parts of the movie are connected and it goes to the supernatural world. Most characters also talk about ""the day Grace got crazy"", which makes us watch it until the end and it has an unexpected ending.
The Australian actress (Nicole Kidman) is the only well-known actor in the cast, but as well the movie is amazing. The Chilean-Spanish director, Alejandro Amenámer, in just 105 minutes, really made a mixture and a great relation between the living and the dead world, also reaffirming the real power of the connection between the members of a family. This is an astounding movie for the ones who likes supernatural stories and a little fright."

","There's something to be said for a horror film that takes its time and builds to an impressive climax. The Others is the definition of a slow burn and although it never technically pays off all that it sets up, it's certainly a well made horror-thriller. I typically look for an atmospheric or psychological take on horror stories, and The Others is one that relies more heavily on those two things than it does jump scare or creepy imagery. But there's still a fair share of those as well. Powered by a strong performance by Nicole Kidman, as a protective single mother who attempts to hide her family from the threatening outside world. It doesn't completely all come together by film's end, but most of the questions are answered in a surprising and fascinating way.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","Seldom does a film this esoteric happen. And I think that this shall not appeal to everyone. But that is the point of making a difference. The horror genre has become very frivolous in later years. And I doubt enough people can appreciate the sophisticated subtlety & introspective nature of a film which aims to create a mood, a spyglass into the past, & with devastatingly convincing performances from the 4 main characters. So it is no surprise to me that this gets underappreciated. <br/><br/>The film has me in tears every time I watch it about every 7 years. And as I get older, & regret my life choices, I can't help but let it scar me a little deeper each time. I suppose it feels very real to my own situation; lonely, heart broken, unable to move on, & destitute. It carefully switches from the suspense of being haunted, to the heart rending return of a lost loved war veteran; a father & husband. The music is exasperating in its' effectiveness. And you feel very trapped in this River Styx with them. <br/><br/>This is not an easy watch. Not in terms of gore, horror, or violence. But because you can't help but pity each & every character. Especially the children, who spend much of the time on screen distressed. And are ultimately subjected to the worst scenario you can think of, through no fault of their own. <br/><br/>There's a part where the husband breaks down in to tears as he realizes that he may have triggered the series of events by failing to profess all love for his family by going to fight in the war. It's a harsh scene that is doubly felt the second time round. <br/><br/>If I ever watch this film again, I shall be 44 years old. I doubt I'll reach that age! But if I do, this film might be the end of me ha ha! <br/><br/>Thankfully I don't believe in ghosts, gods, & gravestones. But I do believe in the imagination. And where that is concerned, all involved with this film did a fine job."

","RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, ""The Others"" is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.<br/><br/>While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there's a one-dimensional pale 'look' to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons.

","For me, the best horror films are the ones that don't come at you and hit you in the face with ghosts, monsters, or spurting blood the way a lot of modern pictures do. I think allowing the momentum to build with ambiguous characters while implying that something mysterious is going on is much better at providing tension and suspense. You had a lot of that going on here with the character of Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two young children, residing in a large, creepy house on the Jersey Channel Islands. The story takes place in 1945, roughly coinciding with the end of World War II, thereby adding another element of mystery to the story, that being the absence of Mrs. Stewart's husband (Christopher Eccleston), who's a potential casualty of the war.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman was well cast for her role here, demonstrating a wide range of emotions as she perseveres to keep her children safe in the face of a daunting medical condition. A better one might have been that of the young boy portraying her son Nicholas (James Bentley). I mean, the kid looked really creepy throughout the story, even more so than older sister Anne, played by Alakina Mann, who provided more of a conflicted sibling in light of her mother's doubts about her observations in the house. The three caretakers who arrive at the Stewart home bring even more ambiguity to the story, as they have a past with prior inhabitants of the house. <br/><br/>I didn't realize I had seen this film when it first came out but as the story progressed I started to recall aspects of it without fully remembering how it turned out. So then the wheels started turning to try and figure out the twist ending, and it still managed to arrive at a satisfyingly surprise conclusion, along the lines of Bruce Willis's ""The Sixth Sense"". If I had been making the picture I wouldn't have had Nicole Kidman's character go into that long winded monologue after the reveal though. The twist by itself was enough to make the picture a memorable one."

","'The Others (2001)' is an old-fashion ghost story, in the vein of Gothic horror like that which was popularised in the late 1800s, told in the style of the old-fashioned ghost films of the sixties in which suspense and story were more important than outright scares and special effects - a rare yet effective philosophy. It's at times a slower piece and the horror generally comes from quiet bumps in the night, so if you're expecting jump-scares or overt gore you're likely to be disappointed, but thanks to a keen focus on character and narrative technique you're always invested right up until the breath-taking climax that I'd peg as perhaps one of the best endings in any horror picture ever made. Unexpected, intelligent and edge-of-your-seat stuff that tightens its screws masterfully. 8/10"

","At first, I wasn't sure about this movie. It seemed odd and I found the ailment of the children a bit ludicrous.

","After starring in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Nicole Kidman, she now stars in The Others, your not-so run of the mill, haunted house, ghost feature, engraving its name on the tombstone of best horror films of the 21st century so far. Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely spectacular performance as Grace Stewart, the mother of two photosensitive children and the owner of an enormous manor/mansion. Christopher Eccleston provides a crucial, yet minuscule, role which is integral to the comprehension of this complicated and twisting plot which literally flips 180 degrees on itself. Rarely seen in 21st century horror films, is the dramatic build-up of suspense, frightening audiences with a simple creak of a door or rustle of a curtain. Every scene is tense with very little comic relief; you could count the number of humorous lines (or jokes) on one hand.

","The Others (2001) truly is a blood curdling, bone chilling suspense movie that will surely scare anyone watching while watching. The chills in this film stem from the unknown, and subtle noises, whispers and voices coming from within the house. Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance here as the lead, a mother of two living in a secluded home while her husband is away fighting in WWII. Nicole has a great attitude/atmosphere about her throughout the entire film. Most of the movie she has a kind of tragic look on her face, and given her circumstances in life it's completely appropriate and called for. The way she handles scenes that are very intense and frightening is not only believable, but her acting lifts up the scare factor to a new level, which the actors in films like this must do. If the cast of a scary suspense film cannot do that then the movie as a whole will suffer. The child actors did a fine job as well, very impressive for their age. The daughter especially did very good job, her role requires more screen time than the son and the daughter has some pretty intense scenes with her mother (Kidman). The ending is brilliant in my opinion and I very much enjoyed the end result, it adds to the overall effect of the film. 10/10 for the others. Supernatural thrillers like this are pretty rare so I suggest watching it if haven't already had the pleasure."

","In this film, a mother tries to educate her two children by herself, protecting them from a mysterious illness that causes them great sensitivity to intense lights, such as sunlight. While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolated in a Channel Islands mansion, keeping the house in partial darkness along with three mysterious servants. The lead role is played by Nicole Kidman, who does a brilliant performance in a character who sometimes seems very loving, almost needy, and other times seems unusually hard. But she's just a woman trying to bear a burden that seems heavy: the burden of carrying everything back while her husband is away. The children are equally interesting: played by James Bentley and Alakina Mann, two very competent young actors, they are naive, sweet but also very mischievous, and their mischief contributes greatly to the suspense, especially the girl. She seems to know something that nobody else knows or to have a particularly sharp intelligence. The father, played by Christopher Eccleston, is almost a mere figure. He is purposely an absent character who is permanently present for the simple fact of all the others are constantly speaking of him, and this absence has great importance to the psyche of his wife. But the true life of this film is borrowed by Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes who (along with Elaine Cassidy) give life to the house servants. The way they acted and how counter-acted with Kidman is brilliant, giving the film a deeply conspiratorial atmosphere. The constant darkness, the gas lights, the huge old house, the permanent haze surrounding the grounds are cliché elements that give the film a touch of elegance and help the audience to grab to the movie until the end, which is quite unexpected and disconcerting."

With an honest script, that does not try to pass the leg, but knew how to make the catch with the viewer, Alejandro Amenábar does a good job, because the complete work of the film makes him intelligent and intriguing, although he creates several subplots, and does not explain any And with several repetitions of ideas that do not compromise the experience of the film, Alejandro Amenábar uses the soundtrack the way one has to use in a horror film, high, sharp and uncomfortable.

The year is 1945 and Grace struggles to keep her family safe and her sanity in tact, even though her husband set out to fight the war a year and a half earlier and her hired helped disappeared the previous week, complicating her struggle. She finds herself not only in a world of her own, but it is a dark world, as a result of her two children having severe allergies to all light except candlelight. The seclusion is soon broken by the introduction of Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia(Elaine Cassidy), three eerie applicants for the hired help positions. The mystery begins and the casts' silent existence quickly transforms as they begin to sense inaccessible intruders in the home. This film probes the thin line between sanity and insanity and how close we all may be to crossing that line if tormented enough. In the same respect, the way we perceive existence may be completely opposite from the reality of it. This movie deals with human psyche from the opening scenes to the climactic ending. The Others is nearly flawless. Constant darkness adds the play of shadow and fog to the story and makes the audience sympathetic to the suffocating life that Grace leads. Due to a lack of pyrotechnic visual effects and blood and gore, this movie is a suspense and thriller instead of a horror flick. Throughout the entire two hours, a full cast of approximately twelve people are introduced, once again running with the theme of solitude. Innuendos all through the story leading up to a surprise ending make watching this movie a second time a must. Writer and Director Alejandro Amenabar has resorted to simplicity, creating a fresh and thought provoking mystery."

","The Others is a riveting and darkly menacing thriller, yet, during the course of the film, not a drop of blood is shed and no one dies.  It is a reflection on the talent of director Alejandro Amenabar that small things, like a door slamming shut in one's face or a ghostly hand upon one's cheek are far more frightening than any amount of special effects that films in this genre are increasingly becoming reliant upon.  A sense of claustrophobia is introduced from the outset by the thick fog surrounding the house in which most of the action takes place, and also by the permanently closed curtains and doors that prevent sunlight from brightening the rooms.<br/><br/>In this house the light must always be contained, because the two young children (who live there with their mother) are photosensitive, and exposure to daylight will make them very ill.  But it would seem that the family and their three somewhat mysterious servants are not the only inhabitants of the darkened house.  Footsteps are heard, doors are opened, curtains are removed, but search as they may, nobody can find the perpetrators of these actions.  And it would seem that whatever these beings are, they bear an ever-increasing amount of malevolent ill will towards the family.<br/><br/>The film's conclusion is unexpected, even for those viewers who have managed to second-guess an earlier plot twist prior to its revelation.  The surprise factor is at least partly due to the outstanding performances by the cast; special mention must be made of Alakina Mann, who is a young actress with a very bright future.

","What at first glace looks to be an example of a classic ghost story soon shapes up to become one of the most memorable spine chillers of recent years.<br/><br/>Set during the 1940's in Jersey The Others' is the story of Grace, a woman living in a secluded manor house, caring for her photosensitive children and struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband in the battlefields of World War II. When three new housekeepers arrive, sinister happenings in the house force Grace to question her Christian beliefs and her sanity in this atmospheric supernatural thriller.<br/><br/>Because of her children's allergy to light Grace is forced to live in almost complete darkness, which makes for a gloomy and sinister mood. The pace is unhurried with Director Amenabar deftly and subtly developing the story right to the finale, keeping the audience guessing all the way. The cinematography is excellent and plays a key part in the psychological delivery of the movie, really building on the claustrophobic atmosphere. <br/><br/>
Kidman is on top form playing a proud but desperate woman with belief and a lot of sensitivity. The supporting cast provide strong performances without over doing it allowing and doing enough to let Kidman to play off them well and provide the emotional aspect. A particular mention must go to Alakina Mann who plays Grace's young daughter Ann, who stands toe to toe with Kidman in many of the films more dramatic scenes and proves herself to be more than a competent match for her elder in all respects.<br/><br/>Despite all of it's merits, this won't suit all tastes as it opts for well crafted and intelligent suspense as opposed to cheap frights and crude shocks. The tension is racked up right to the finale where there is a shocking twist, which I did find a little anti climatic however still satisfying, tying up the story well and not leaving any loose ends.<br/><br/>I am sure there will be comparisons made with The Sixth Sense', however while I agree that the style is the same and the success of M. Night Shyamalan's debut may have aroused new interest in the genre, The Other's far surpasses it. <br/><br/>Overall I was pleasantly pleased with the end result and found it to be a haunting and sombre new twist on the ghost story.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

I knew it was going to be good. If you liked the Sixth Sense, let me say now that you would love The Others. <br/><br/>From beginning to end, there is a sense of isolation and desperation.  There are children who cannot be touched by sunlight, a mother who is trying to hold together what's left of her family after her husband doesn't return from the war, and three mysterious servants who show up to work in this large echoing house.  You want them to be able to reach out to people, but they can't.  Why?

","No blood and guts needed, just atmosphere, quality direction plot and acting is all that's needed to make a movie creepy. Better than ""The Ring"", almost as good as ""The Shining"". Kidman proves that she's more than just a pretty face with good support from the other actors with Eric Sykes, renowned as a comedian, playing well against type. This movie will scare you - go see it but not by yourself. Probably Kidman's best, along with ""To Die For"" (haven't seen ""The Hours"" yet)."

","PLOT SPOILERS: I guess I should have seen it coming, what with the sixth sense it's almost like a new trend in plot twists.  But I never even guessed that they were all dead.  And I'm usually pretty good with that kind of thing.  And the equally amazing thing is I liked the child actors.  I usually hate child actors.  Especially those of the home alone and ET variety.  Maybe it's the fear thing, but the last three underage performances I could stomach were Osment, Ricci, and now Alakina Mann. Maybe it is the hope that she could blossom into another Jodi Foster that colors my perceptions.  Maybe it was the overall creepiness that brings a warm glow to all the performances.  Maybe it's the Fred Astaire factor, he could dance with a hat rack and make the hat rack look good.  Acting opposite Kidman makes it all seem easy.  Kidman did it all for me on this one.  Loved the book of the dead.  Had some minor difficulty with the time code though - what year was this what year was that - I suppose ghosts have no way of keeping track of time - but I seem to remember her wearing a watch."

","Like I always do, I see films like this one trailered and I rush to the cinema in the vain hope that I'll be frightened out of my socks, ignoring the little voice in the back of my head that says ""it will be a let down"". Well this time, I wasn't frightened, but the little voice was also wrong! More of a psychological thriller than a horror (wrongly hyped), the characterisation in the film was so incredible that I stopped caring whether or not the film was chilling.<br/><br/>This is Kidman's finest role I have seen to date and I have always been a fan of her acting.  Her accent was brilliant and her portrayal of a strict, principled mother who is ultimately the most vulnerable person in that house is mesmerising.  Of course, the unique relationship with her children could not have been adequately portrayed without the fantastic performances from Mann and Bentley.  Altogether, the characters were realistic, funny and sympathetic.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film was predictable, but it was more complex than a cheesy one-dimensional horror.  That is not to say that the film did not have its chilling moments, such as when Mann is possessed by the medium (or vice versa), but it drew its suspense from the emotional rather than the visual.<br/><br/>A fine film with unique individuality and intelligence."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>This movie has the perfect atmosphere a highly successful ghost story. It reminds me of the old english tv films which always scares the s++t out of me. It has this typical big old spooky house placed far away from any sivilisation in the english countryside(although actually shot in Spain), a lot of fog and almost no SFX(except for the fog that is), just plane old great acting and a chilling atmosphere.<br/><br/>I´ve read that one of the Director´s favorite movies are THE CHANGELING and some elements from it are in this movie. The ending with the psychic old woman is very similar(also brilliant scene in THE CHANGELING) and the old man´s name is probably taken from it also.<br/><br/>The ending is a blast. I don´t think many people see that coming. Earlier in the film you thought maybe the tombstones belonged to the woman and her two children, or the servants.

","While waiting for her husband to return from the war, Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children live in a secluded island mansion.  Because of the children's incurable condition, the three of them are forced to live a lonely existence behind locked doors, drawn curtains and dim candlelight. Then one day, when a three mysterious servants arrive, strange things begin to happen within the house.  Soon, Grace finds herself in a terrifying battle to save her children from these daunting intruders, and to keep her sanity at the same time.<br/><br/>Out of everything in this film, the thing that stands out the most is Nicole's flawless portrayal of Grace, a woman pushed to the edge, by something she can't control.  Nicole Kidman has always been my favourite actress (watch Moulin Rouge and you'll understand why).  She is truly one of the best actresses in Hollywood today.  The way she inhabits the character, and really lives in her skin is incredible.  As Grace struggles to uncover the truth about these scary intruders, she becomes quite frightening herself.  But towards the end of the movie when she begins to understand, you really see true emotion in her undying love for  her children and her willingness to risk anything for them.  The rest of the cast also pull off strong performances, especially the children, since they are big parts of the story.  Another thing that really stood out was the role the atmosphere played in the movie.  Darkness and silence are key to the suspense, tension and mystery of the whole picture and are both well orchestrated well. Overall, not one of the most scariest movies in the world, but definitely full of enough suspense, tension, shocks and surprises to satisfy anyone."
"whiteeurosun","Null","0","0","24 July 2003"," 3rd viewing and still entertaining
","*** / ***** (GOOD)<br/><br/>My post-virginal viewing of this film was surprisingly entertaining. Usually, horror movies are never as scary as they are on first viewings. Okay, while this film isn't frightening enough to be considered a masterpiece of horror, the fact that it is effective at all, considering my familiarity with it, is really cool.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman's portrayal of a housewife raising two kids, at first, feels over-done; over-the-top. But during my last viewing, I began to realize that maybe writer/director Alejandro Amenábar intentionally convinced Kidman to ham it up.<br/><br/>You see, Kidman's character, named Grace, has been raising her two kids all alone, ever since her husband, who has been ghost for a long time, went off to war. Grace is sexually-deprived, over-whelmed by the kids, and claustrophobic (she never leaves the house).. and maybe some other unhealthy adjectives. If THE OTHERS makes a statement about anything, it is that a woman, or single parent, should not have to carry the burden of raising children alone.<br/><br/>This is pretty similar to Jack Torrence's conflict in THE SHINING. Deprived of the ""finer"" things in life: sex, alcohol, friends, an exit out of the house, etc... Jack ultimately went cabin crazy. You know the story. If not, you should see it, along with this film. They're, like, the brother and sister of each other, giving male and female perspectives on the experience of deprivation.<br/><br/>Many of the film's most chilling moments are suggested. You hear sounds, and then you hear nothing.. and then the goosebumps arise. Then you get defensive, preparing yourself for the sudden entrance of a horrible being. Wickedly, the film toys with you. Sometimes you're shocked with images, and other times you're not. Without revealing anything, there's a scene involving a painting, hiding in the darkness. I swear, that image gets me every damn time that I watch this picture.<br/><br/>Also worthy of note is Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's daughter, Anne. She's totally convincing as the older sibling who gets a kick out of frightening her younger brother. Fortunately, she even sends chills up our spines, with her suggestions of eerie things behind the curtain, or right beside you, breathing on you, waiting for the right moment to scare the living daylights out of you."

"Nicholàs","9","0","0","6 July 2003"," Very cleverly-conceived movie (contains spoilers)
","Alejandro Amenábar did a superb job on the screenplay for this movie. Also, the set, casting and acting were near-perfect.<br/><br/>Many people have complained how this film was a ""rip-off"" of the Sixth Sense, but I disagree. For a start, the screenplay for The Others was apparently written before The Sixth Sense even came out; and secondly, the twist contained in The Others was superior.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense for me contained only one point of shocking realisation -- only one critical moment where everything you saw previously got turned on its head.<br/><br/>The Others, however, contained a whole series of such moments. For instance, the first minor revelation came when the whole attitude of Mrs Mills changed -- it was at this point that I became very suspicious of the three servants. Such suspicions were confirmed when I heard the servants' comments about the gravestones and the difficulty of ""convincing"" the children and their mother.<br/><br/>The second revelation came when the two children escaped the house and Anne saw the names on the three gravestones. Only half of the twist registered with me at this point.<br/><br/>The third revelation appeared when Grace meets up with ""The Others"" -- and then I finally realised that the true nature of Grace, her children, and the three servants was indeed all the same.<br/><br/>But the final revelation was the one that completely turned everything on its head. It took me a couple of seconds after Grace's confrontation with<br/><br/>""The Others"" before the true gravity of this astounding twist registered with me.<br/><br/>Overall, The Others is a film that I enjoyed thoroughly. It does not rely upon your stereotypical Hollywood special effects to cause fear, but rather it relies upon the psychological impact that it creates with its incredibly sombre, haunted atmosphere. It is a movie which must be watched at least twice so that you can go back and see how the whole twist fits in flawlessly with the storyline.<br/><br/>I give this film 9/10."

"Clive-Silas","7","0","0","21 May 2003"," Did there have to be a séance?
","Without spoiling too much I will say that I was slightly disappointed that a séance was performed at one point in this movie, with the implication that a genuine connection with the, shall we say ""spirit world"" was made. Even the movie Ghost knew better than that! All ""professional"" mediums, without exception, are charlatans and con artists, and promotion of a rational viewpoint in life is not helped by otherwise intelligent movies falling into this particular trap.<br/><br/>And it is an intelligent movie. For the most part the film manages very well to tell its story in little revelatory bits and pieces, whilst keeping the tension high. It even manages well the part where the returned father actually being dead is so obvious to the audience, although Grace and the children (of course) don't recognise it. It is handled in a way that it doesn't matter. He's there for character and plot development, not shock value.<br/><br/>The problem arises in the final act of the film. It's at this point that, not simply because of the plot, but something in the way it was written, lit, shot, acted, edited together: somehow one is suddenly no longer watching a movie, but an episode of television melodrama. Maybe it is because the movie doesn't finish with a cathartic climax with, say, the house burning down or something, but rather one of those ambiguous twists which reminds you of ""Tales of the Unexpected"" or ""The Twilight Zone"". But also (again without going into too much detail) there is a marked increase in phoney looking period detail, and the look, acting and writing suddenly puts one in mind of a rather sub-par episode of ""Poirot"".<br/><br/>Despite all the praise received from professional critics, my view was that Kidman's performance was the weakest of an otherwise excellent little ensemble (particularly Alakina Mann as the daughter who is just fantastic). I was especially keen to see the magnificent Eric Sykes, who seems to be getting more work as he gets older. For non-British readers (and indeed anybody under 30), I would like to point out that Eric Sykes is not just a consummate character actor, he is also one of the funniest writers and performers this country has produced, beginning over 50 years ago with his collaborations with Spike Milligan on the legendary Goon Show, and right up to the 1980s with his own sitcom, ""Sykes"". He's still acting on stage and screen, despite having been profoundly deaf for many years."

One day three mysterious strangers call at the House,claiming to be responding to Graces advertisement for servants.She duly hires them.But soon after Anne begins to claim that there are strange apparitions moving about within the Mansions many rooms.Grace,strong in her faith,chooses not to believe her daughter,until she herself experiences strange noises and events.Could the house indeed be haunted?And what significance do the three new servants have?<br/><br/>I will not say too much more.This movie is very complex in it's progression yet very subtle in it's delivery.It is the sort of film you HAVE to see at least twice to pick up on everything that in the end summarily binds together for a satisfying resolve,if not a somewhat sad one.<br/><br/>This has quickly become my favourite movie,and I don't hesitate to give it 10/10.The cinematography creates such an atmosphere that it almost envelopes you,and the performances,especially those of Nicole Kidman and Alakina Mann are absolutely mesmerising.Definitely one of the best Ghost stories ever filmed."

","In my entire movie-going life (and I go back to the original ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS)I have never found a movie so engrossing, moving,heart-rending, fascinating, overwhelming, cathartic, and a hundred other things along these lines which you always read in movie reviews and until now always seemed so pretentiously overblown to me...<br/><br/>And yet I'd give it only 3 out of 4 stars. I can see how others would find it overlong, repetitious, and structurally ill-conceived in spots.. But it is absurd to say that this is a bad movie, or a Horror film which is not horrifying and so on. It's simply NOT a Horror or Suspense Film or a Ghost Story. It belongs to another genre entirely. Quasi-Augustinian Creepshow.<br/><br/>I haven't seen much mention of Religion in reviews I've read. Odd, as Angela Lansbury would say. With the very first audio a recitation of the very first verses of the Holy Bible? With an extended reference to the not especially well-known martyrs SS Justus and Pastor? (That's the Spanish influence, by the way.) With countless scattered references to Limbo, Hell, the Rosary, priests, Holy Communion, the Virgin, Christ,God, and Noah? And with all that, a main character named GRACE? At the risk of seeming patronizing...<br/><br/>THE OTHERS is basically an ambiguously ironic (or ambiguously confirmatory? But the BOY should then have been SEVEN, not FIVE or SIX) look at Roman Catholic Theology concerning God as Ruler of All generally, and more particularly, the Fates of various categories of Immortal Souls in the Afterlife . If you're not at all interested in that subject you are bound to be constitutionally bored by this movie. If you are utterly captivated by that subject you are bound to be at the least fully engaged by every frame of this magnificently photographed, acted, and scored film. (The screenwriting is not SO magnificent.) If you are a strictly orthodox Catholic you will probably be offended. If you are a  strictly orthodox Catholic wannabe for whom ""things have just not worked out"" this movie will come as something of a painfully gratifying shock. <br/><br/>Yes, I would definitely say that this is one movie reaction to which will depend greatly on predisposition towards thematic content. Unfortunately, interest in that content as regards THE OTHERS is about on the level of interest in the development of Esperanto.<br/><br/>So again, I can sympathize with the ""two star"" reviews. But it's hard for me to see how anyone could fail to be sufficiently moved by Nicole Kidman's character and performance that they wouldn't find a satisfying emotional pay-off at the end. For me, her performance here is one of the ten best I've ever seen in a movie. That conflicted reaction to a simple offer of a nice hot cup of tea in rather odd circumstances... Amazing. Beautiful. Heart-rending. Cathartic..."

Most of it are indirect or off-screen, resulting in something that is more of the bone chilling type of scare.<br/><br/>I don't think every piece of the puzzle connects at the end, but nobody is trying to follow some rule here like the way they were trying to in The Sixth Sense, which by openly defining what one could and could not do, and following that rule on the screen does not mean the character could function as if they are normal and not detect their state.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good movie if you want to get the chills.

","6.5 out of 10<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, an overly protective mother of two whose children have a rare disease that demands they be kept from bright light.  She hires three new caretakers to help around the house (actually, a mansion), but not long afterward, that's when the ""others"" arrive.  This old-fashioned chiller set in the late 1940's is a decent attempt at emanating the filmmaking style of the haunted house movies of the 70's.  The film is undeniably atmospheric and there is a quiet tension that's almost impeccable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite a terrific performance from Kidman and the child actors who play her children, the movie is coldly impersonal, never developing truly likeable characters to sympathize in this understandably maddening situation.  Even worse, the movie is ultimately little more than an excericse in crafting an eerie mood; by the end, you'll note little of importance has occurred and the climactic plot twist, while ingeniously executed, is somewhat obvious and doesn't quite add the extra spiritual depth writer/director Alejandro Amenabar was aiming for."

","Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Others"" is a somehow melancholy, leisurely exercise in slow-building suspense.  Unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" where those properties were used to good effect and contrast with the modern setting, ""The Others"" places its characters and their various sadnesses in post-war England.  The film, although clearly modern, and extraordinary in its production values, feels and moves like a classic ghost story.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly amazing.  Like Haley Joel Osment, the child actors in ""The Others"" are accomplished beyond their years.  And though I'd always liked Nicole Kidman's charisma, this was the film that made me truly respect her acting.<br/><br/>Finally, make no mistake: slow-paced though it is, dependent on twists and turns it may be, but this movie is truly frightening, in a way that ""The Sixth Sense"" was not.  (And I don't get scared in movies very often.)  As I'm typing this, the film is in my VCR; I originally saw it on the big screen.  Despite my knowledge of the plot, it's creeped me out enough to have to pause mid-film for a web-surfing-and-review-writing break.<br/><br/>See ""The Others.""

"JuguAbraham","8","0","0","27 November 2002"," Amenabar and Kidman concoct intelligent, scary entertainment
","This is the most intelligent and scary film since Kubrick made ""The Shining"" and Hitchcock made his humorous murder thrillers. Like Hitchcock, Amenabar is able to make you laugh at yourself at the end of the scary film--while Kubrick could only made you sigh with relief at the end of his intelligent work.<br/><br/>This is my first Amenabar film. The early scene of Kidman's screaming face switching from the vertical to the horizontal gives you a clue of what will follow--intelligent viewing, constantly requiring the viewer to re-evaluate earlier impressions. This is mature cinema. This is the stuff John Berger would love to include in his ""Ways of Seeing"" if he were to re-write the book. <br/><br/>It is not without reason that in the DVD interview Amenabar says that he was most impressed by Kidman's eyes. It appears to be a frivolous comment. Yet Kidman's eyes are not only providing the impression of being terrorized or her character's steady descent from normality to lunacy, but they become the central sensory organ to a film in which light and darkness assume unusual importance. <br/><br/>Amenabar is the Svengali. For a young director it is impressive to see the director working on his own story and composing his own music, to be able to get such topnotch performances from Kidman, Flanagan, Sykes, and the kids. Watching this film reminds you of Orson Welles' cinema, though Welles would have loved to be in front of the camera as well.<br/><br/>The way Amenabar has crafted the story is so intelligent that you cannot help admiring how his story works backwards, with the end providing the pivotal point for the beginning of real entertainment and correct perspective. You begin to love the film after the movie ends--somewhat like the narrative structure of ""The Usual Suspects."" The prologue on the Creation, narrated by Kidman to the kids, would in retrospect be the appropriate epilogue. The film continues to entertain the viewer after the film has ended as the viewer is forced to pick up the clues thrown at the audience as the film progressed on the impending end.<br/><br/>This is a European film in style and far removed from Hollywood's predictable approach to mystery, supernatural, aliens, etc. This style is what makes the film outstanding in the genre--it provides entertainment by teasing your senses and perception of what is real. Even when dealing with a supernatural subject it exudes a pristine charm of children and Bible readings. As the film progresses you note that often initial elements of charm hides a not-so-innocent mind (Flanagan's character Bertha Mills, Kidman's character Grace, etc.).<br/><br/>Kidman is lovely to look at. Yet she is only truly impressive when a good director is in charge (first Kubrick in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and now Amenabar).<br/><br/>The strengths of this film also lie in the art direction, sound editing (superb), and cinematography.<br/><br/>The film does leave holes in the story. What happens to the postman? What happens to the first batch of servants that preceded Bertha Mills et al.? Were the children really having a medical problem? What were the pills that Grace was having and what was Bertha giving her that Grace found suspicious? Probably these unanswered questions add to the richness of the film.<br/><br/>This is a major film of the decade because of the narrative structure, which would put off conventional viewers of Hollywood products. The special features of the DVD are below average (e.g., interview with cinematographer is in Spanish, some of the English interview snippets are pedantic) while the sound recording is top notch."

","I'm such a wimp when it comes to horror movies.  I was 8 when I saw Poltergeist and I have been deathly afraid of clowns and under the bed ever since. (Even though I'm 14) So, seeing this movie was extremely frightening for me! In it we follow this depressed woman who has lost her husband in the war. She lives in her dark secluded mansion with her 2 children, who can't be near the light because if they are exposed to it they will die.  So, the movie is all dark, which is freaky.  In the movie Grace Stewart (the mother) played by Nicole Kidman is slowly going insane and she has hired some new servants to replace her old ones, who just disappeared one day!  Grace is noticing all these strange things happening in her house and she suspects Natzis are hiding in it, though soon the suspicion turns to ghosts because of the freaky pale faced daughter, who can see one of them.  The servants know what's up, though they are acting like they don't.  Then, Grace begins investigating all of this, and looks at old books and tries to find out if the house has a bad history.  She even finds a book of the dead, which has pictures of dead people in it, all dressed up.  grace gets really freaked out, and tries to walk into town to get help from the church, but during her walk, fog surrounds her and she finds her husband!  She takes him home, and he's all depressed, and doesn't seem to know what's happening, though again the servants do.  The children are absolutely ecstatic to have their daddy home, but then begin telling him terrible things that their mommy has done to them.  Because, children, mommy went crazy!  So, the next day the father disappears, and more terrible things start to happen.  Grace knows the servants know something so she sends them away because she thinks they are evil.  Then, that night, while looking through the book of the dead, she sees that the SERVANTS are in there!!!!  They were ghosts.  Her children, who have snuck outside, have just realized this because they see their gravestones in the yard!  And the servants are creepily following them!  So the kids run inside to their mothers arms, and Grace tells them to hide upstairs, while she tries to stop the 3 ghosts.  But, while upstairs, hiding in the closet, the kids notice that there are even more ghosts there!  And then you see this horrific old woman's face open the closet!  Meanwhile, downstairs, the ghosts are telling Grace that they just want to help.  She runs upstairs into the room where her kids are hiding, and sees a group of people at a table.  The old woman is writing some stuff very fast, and the kids are telling her what their mother did to them!  Grace screams, and takes all the papers and throws them in the air and destroys them. Suddenly, the scene changes and we see it from the other people's point of view!  The papers are flying up by themself, and they are trying to reach the ghosts that live in the house!  So, now we find out that Grace and her children, and the servants, and the lost soul of the father are ALL ghosts! Apparently, one day while they were alive, Grace went crazy and suffocated her children with pillows and shot herself in the head.  It appeared to Grace and the children that they had survived and that God had given them a second chance!  But, sadly, that was not the case.  They were ghosts.  It ends up with the servants telling Grace that they didn't know they were dead either, and wanted to break it gently to her.  They also say that once in a while they will make contact with the other world, but only sometimes.  They decide to stay at the house, especially since now the children can be exposed to light, (because they're already dead) It really made you think and it was a great horror movie.  All great movies make you think, not like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, both of which are terribly predictable.  There are so many twists and turns in this movie, and it was really freaky in the theatre!  Go see it, or if you have, watch it again!  Out of 5 stars: 4"

","I hadnt heard anything about this movie until at the theater when I couldnt find anything good playing and someone said to see it. This was one of my favorite movies of the year. (i`ll try not to spoil anything, i dont think i will) The movie is about a woman named grace, who enjoys everything quiet and simple because of her migranes, and her two children, who are deathly sensative to light, living in a secluded mansion, waiting for her husband to come back from the war. After their recents maids or, yeah maids and groundskeepers leave unexpectedly, grace put a letter out for maids and groundskeepers. A older man and older woman and a mute girl soon show up and start with their duties. Though out the movie alot of things goes on with alot of little clues and hidden feature that you probably wont even tink about till after you watch it or untill you watch it again, or maybe for some people they wont. What was really good about this movie was the way it continually built up the intensity and then exploded at the end, and the way it made you feel kinda empty and dark, or just gave you the feeling they had. Another thing that was very different was how it hardly used any specials effects and just used the story to be scary instead of having people with their heads cut off or things jumping out from behind people, like other scary movies like 13 ghosts or whatever. The acting is brilliant, Nicole Kidman is one of my favorites and the kids were incredible. The Direction was very unique and different, very elegant and dark, and the story was awesome, different entirely from the sixth sense and if this is said to be like sixth sense then pretty much their isnt a ghost movie that isnt like the sixth sense. All in all an excellent movie which will give you an erie feeling for long after the twisted ending."

There is generally way too much screaming, gore, special effects, and worst of all, these movies tend to take their ridiculous premises way too seriously. <br/><br/>The exception has always been ""Poltergeist"", because so much warmth and humor was part of the story of a middle-class American family under siege in their nice suburban home, and because it definitely had some really scary moments. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, one more time!<br/><br/>So, when I first saw ""The Others"", I was not expecting much.  Was I ever blown away!  First: Nicole Kidman gives one of the best performances of her career in this movie -- better even than ""To Die For"" -- so why was she nominated for an Oscar for that pathetic role in ""Moulin Rouge""?   Second: This movie throws out all the other haunted house and ghost story cliches. The premise of the story is actually quite simple and believable if you believe in ghosts, and it cannot be repeated here.  See it and enjoy it. There is no blood or gore.  There are, quite frankly, no special effects. It is just a great story, within the confines of a ghost story and a haunted house setting, with a dynamite twist ending, with fantastic acting from the entire cast (especially Kidman as the strictly religious, super-control-freak mother of two very different children, and kudos to the little girl who portrays the daughter who knows too much and to the elderly lady who plays the wise nanny-housekeeper who also knows more than the mother).

","Having seen The Sixth Sense before, I can assure you this is not a ripoff of that movie. First of all, The Sixth Sense was NOT the first movie to use surprise endings (see Se7en, Carnival of Souls, any Hitchcock movie). Yes, there are some similarities but overall, this a far superior movie. Nicole Kidman plays her greatest role yet as a single mother guarding her two children. Should you feel sorry for her at the ending? No, but this is a movie- should you feel sorry for Norman Bates in Psycho- no, but it still doesn't make it any less of a great movie. Having said all that, I must say that the subtle use of sounds and noises are frightening. Even having watched the film numerous times, there are still parts in this where I am startled.

The mysterious sounds and voices that disturb this family, led by Kidman, ultimately come from more than one source.  Their deepening confusion, and struggle to maintain sanity, is what propels the plot. Obviously, this is the type of movie that demands to be seen and not spoiled by too many revelations here. I think Kidman is cast perfectly in this role.  This is her best performance. In some respects, this is a story about seeking redemption. Can eternal love achieve forgiveness for a heinous sin?  There are some interesting questions posed herein by the director. This movie has a wonderful cast, excellent acting and terrific cinematography.

","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Before I saw this movie I was one of the few people who couldn't stand Nicole Kidman. But with Moulin Rouge and The Others, she has became one of my favorite actresses to watch.<br/><br/>It is important to realise that this movie is all Nicole Kidman. She obviously headlines the cast, and despite fantastic performances by her supporting cast, it's Kidman that drew people to this film, and will undoubtably bring new fans to the cast.<br/><br/>The movie follows Grace Stewart (Kidman) and her children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who suffer from a rare disorder that forces them to avoid sunlight at all costs.<br/><br/>Desperate for help, and perhaps company Grace employs the mysterious Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flannigan) and her companions Edmund Tuttle (Eric Skyes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy).<br/><br/>But as things start to go wrong in the house, Grace becomes more and more paranoid and begins to suspect her help, more the mute Lydia who seems to know more than she is letting on.<br/><br/>The movie builds up to a brilliant twist that I for one, never saw coming and appreciated fully.<br/><br/>Kidman is brilliant as Grace, accent and all, and mixes paranoia with strength and determination. Fionulla Flannigan, Eric Skyes and Elaine Cassidy are suitable mysterious, Flannigan particularly and Cassidy put in a brilliant performance for a simple role, though she does look tired and worn and pale. The kids are utterly brilliant, specifically Mann as the suspiciously defiant older sister. Christopher Eccleston appears for a short time, and the movie's only other big name puts in a quietly impressive performance as Grace's MIA husband who turns up in the fog.<br/><br/>9/10."

The Innocents, like the original The Haunting, is a truly terrifying film. It almost wraps you up like an old musty blanket and won't let you go until the end.

","I have to say I saw The Others before the Sixth Sense and I have a few comments to make; Sixth Sense fans who say that The Others is a rip off of the Sixth Sense, don't flatter yourselves- the Sixth Sense wasn't THAT good.The Sixth Sense wishes it was this good. Think about the twist. It isn't at all the same as The Others' twist.<br/><br/>Stop comparing two different and unique films just to be bitter and cause annoyance to The Others fans. This is a BRILLIANT film,last year's best and one of the genre's best to date. Nicole Kidman gives what can only be described as a spellbinding performance in this critically acclaimed and haunting shocker.- definitely her best performance to date. With more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and a suffocatingly intense atmosphere, The Others is undoubtedly a winner. Fionulla Flanagan is superb and the two child actors are on level footing with, dare I mention Haley J Osment and overall, this film is not to be missed. Sixth Sense fans, get over yourselves !!! The Others is an elegant, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker.<br/><br/>Truly unpredictable, with spectacular performances all round, particularly from Nicole Kidman who gives an unforgettable performance- without a doubt her best ever. She is truly mesmerizing as Grace and definitely deserves the huge amount of critical acclaim that she's received. She plays the part to perfection and her English accent is superb. This film is a flawless masterpiece. A wonderful cinematic experience that's not to be missed! Just view the reviews below for a taste of the acclaim it's received by fans and critics alike! The Sixth Sense is an extreme let down compared to The Others. Nicole deserved an Oscar for this!"

","""The Others"" can be considered the festival of quotations. There wouldn't even be the need to mention ""The Sixth Sense"", which Amenábar said he has seen when he had already achieved the script. From the plot reminding ""The Haunting"" by Robert Wise to the Victorian atmosphere which sends back to ""The Innocents"", the film Jack Clayton took from Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"" in 1961; from the ambiguous mix of reality and reverie which prevents during large part of the film to distinguish the world of the living ones from the world of the dead ones, like in ""The Other"" by Robert Mulligan, recalled even in the title and that a few have noted, to the soundtrack, composed by Amenábar himself, full of echoes of the works included in ""The Shining"" (the ""Music  for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta ""of Béla Bartók and the quartet for strings by Krystof Penderecki), this film assume the shape of a glamourous, well crafted collection of quotations that a young unquestionably skilled director dedicated to (or stole from, it depends on your point of view) his favorite authors. Therefore we are dealing with the work of a director who probably doesn't have anything to say, but he says it very well. In that being very modern."

","I must admit that the beginning and the middle of the movie were quite disappointing to me.  Because in spite of all the good criticisms which I had heard of here and there before seeing the movie, in some points of the movie I felt that critics have played a trick on me or maybe there are some artistic sides in the story which I can not figure out!!  And because the setting of the movie belongs to the 1940's, it was hard to imagine that it can have a modern ending.  But of course I was wrong.  What makes ""The Others"" a noticeable movie is exactly the climatic ending.  In the last minute,  all of your thoughts are mixed, and you should just sit there and see the credits with your mouth wide open!!  Where are the others?  BOO , Actually we are the others!!<br/><br/>And in the end you understand that this is not only a B-Movie which only depends on some adrenaline-rush scenes...  It is far beyond that...  It's a movie which makes you sit in the cinema for one hour and a half wondering: ""SO WHAT?""  but in the last ten minute, it gives you an answer which you can think about all the way back home, and even for days...<br/><br/>Setting and acting reminded me of 1960 classical movies.  But what is obvious is that Nicole Kidman was not the one whom always a bunch of  guys can sing ""HIP, HIP, HOORAY!!"" for during the movie.  It was a ""PORTRAIT OF A LADY"" kind of performance for Kidman.  So I guess it was a little bit boring for those Kidman fans who want the erotic Nicole Kidman of Eyes Wide Shot, with some extra hanky-panky scenes.<br/><br/>Generally, the conclusion is that although the movie was in the genre of horror, but it was not for fun or just spending time...  It was a movie which can easily be seen for the second time for more pleasure.  Quite like ""The Sixth Sense"", it must be so interesting to see the movie for the second time from another angle.  Because when you know the end of the story, you go searching for other details.<br/><br/>The philosophy of Alejandro Amenabar about life and death, the living and the dead was somehow sarcastic.  And also it should be mentioned that some lines of dialogues were very intelligent (like the ones about the world war and that all English folks are right in their deeds!!).  Such dialogues are not common in movies of this genre.<br/><br/>For more sharp gossip lovers,  the attractive part of the credits is Tom Cruise as one of the executive producers!!  No further comment ;)<br/><br/>I would give the movie 7 of 10"

","The key to a good ghost story is in the telling.  The pace has to be just right  not so leisurely that the audience loses interest, but not so fast that the intriguing details are lost.  There is a good, spooky story in this film, but the film takes too long to get to the resolution.   The performances are very good (Kidman is plausibly mad), and there are some legitimate shocks; there is zero reliance on bloody special effects. Unfortunately, by the time all is revealed, I was just bored.   This would have made an engrossing 30 minute Twilight Zone episode."

","The Others is the scariest film of 2001 and right up there with chilling films such as The Changeling, Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark, The Omen and The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays what I believe to be her best role ever as she plays Grace Stewart who lives in a large house with two young children. Her husband has been missing in action since the end of the second world war. Grace is a strict Christian who can't let her children leave the house because they have a rare condition which causes them to react fatally to sunlight. One day three servants show up to start work at the house after three other servants left unexpectedly. Then, the horror starts.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is set in an eerie darkness where you never know what's hiding. I don't want to give anything away so I'll try to be vague. Grace believes there are intruders in the house and that is when the real horror starts. The film gives you a few clues (and a few red herrings) throughout and you are constantly wondering what the hell is going on? Is it all in the children's minds? Is the house haunted? Is there a more scientific explanation?<br/><br/>The ending of the film is extremely chilling and totally surprising. When the movie ended I had to quickly turn on the light because it sent a cold shiver through me. It was very original but downright scary and it stuck with me for awhile.<br/><br/>It's good to see that movies can still scare us without having a drop of blood shed.

","The Others, the first American film by the young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (Open Your Eyes), is a low-key, psychological horror story that achieves its creepy results without using in-your-face special effects. The film takes place in an old British mansion (you guessed it) on the fog bound Isle of Jersey in 1945. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the owner of this spooky house who, as the film begins, hires three new servants to replace those who have mysteriously left without leaving a note or saying goodbye.<br/><br/>
Grace's two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), have a rare ailment that requires they cannot be exposed to light. Thus, all curtains in the mansion must be drawn and each door in the house shut and locked before a door is opened to another room. The house has no electricity, no radio, TV, or phone, and Grace must look after her children by herself. Grace's husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) hasn't returned home from the war, and she hasn't received any word as to whether or not he is still alive. Grace is icily distant and rigid and has given her children a strict religious upbringing.<br/><br/>When three servants arrive, the elderly Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), the mute, young Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and an aging gardener, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), it soon becomes apparent that they have some knowledge that Grace doesn't. Anne begins to hear voices and tells her mother she has conversations with a young boy named Viktor. Grace refuses to believe her daughter until she starts to hear the sounds and voices of intruders in the house herself. ""Sooner or later, they will find you,"" Mrs. Mills murmurs. When the mother discovers photo albums filled with snapshots of dead people, she's ready to start believing Anne.<br/><br/>Practically the entire film takes place in shadows bathed in an ethereal glow, creating an eerie and dreamlike atmosphere. Amenabar uses the darkness to increase the tension and feeling of claustrophobia. Nicole Kidman is effective as the emotionally constricted mother trying to protect her children and maintain her sanity. The Others is a highly suspenseful thriller with a shocking plot twist that will make your heart go bump-bump in the night."

","The movie scared me to death, and that's why I liked it so much. The shadows and coloring gave the spooky effect that the movie needed. The camera never went crazy, and it never did do those annoying close ups like so many other horror films, where it's as if the camera is eating the person or something. The music was very eerie and spooky. The only thing I didn't like was the way Nichole Kidman would whisper, than I would have to turn up the volume. The next thing you know, they would be screaming, or loud music would be playing and it would be way too loud. Finally I gave up, and just put it on captions. The sound quality might be a problem for people who buy the movie on VHS. Keep that in mind incase you want to buy the movie. Of course if you don't like loud startling sounds in horror movies, the DVD player would be the way to go. Other wise, it's a wonderfully scary movie, that proves you don't need blood in a horror movie just to make it scary."

The only good moment is the way the twist is revealed but it can't redeemed the 100 minutes of tediousness leading up to it.  How this managed to get on the Top 250 list here is beyond me.  I think I'll go watch 'Signs' again, to see how slow build and creepy atmosphere can be done well *and* pays off with genuine scares."

","I was able to get around to viewing this film for the first time just the other day.  And it is one of the most beautifully made movies of the past several years.<br/><br/>As I viewed it, this film struck me quite quickly as a cross between ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999, M. Night Shyamalan) and ""The Haunting"" (1999, Jan de Bont).  The eerie sound effects are reminiscent of the latter, with a plot that loosely follows the former (Grace's daughter Anne is able to see and talk with the spirits in the house, while Grace herself cannot see anything at first, much like Cole Sear and Bruce Willis in ""Sixth Sense"").<br/><br/>The things that attract my attention in a movie aren't so much the dialogue, but the look of the film, the way it feels and flows and the way the actors portray themselves.<br/><br/>The look of the film, just from looking at it, must have been very difficult to photograph in such low light.  Although it features a production crew made up of people I've never heard of, they managed to put together a magnificent set and managed to be able to photography every single square inch of it.  Photography was obviously well rehearsed, with the low-light visuals and excellent angles used throughout the film.<br/><br/>The feeling of the film is very emotional and has a religious theme.  It's really quite amazing to see how much influence religion has in horror/suspense films.  The emotions flow primrily from Kidman, who excellently plays against her usual roles to play a very protective mother in 1945s post-WWII United Kingdom.<br/><br/>The fact that Kidman looks a great deal like Grace Kelly was, if intended, a magnificent choice for the film.  Grace Kelly, for those that don't know her, was a deeply family-oriented woman who even quit her movie career to dedicate herself to her new family shortly after marrying the crown prince of Monaco.  In the movie, Kidman aggressively tries to keep her children in line and under control, and for the most part, succeeds.<br/><br/>This is one of the most striking films I've seen in a long while.  It's fresh and masterful approach to a familiar subject is a welcomed refreshment."

"FlickJunkie-2","9","0","0","25 July 2002"," A triumphant American debut for Alejandro Amenabar
","Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film.  The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with `Abre Los Ojos', a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as `Vanilla Sky', starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.<br/><br/>This film is outstanding in almost every respect.  With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film.  As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story.  There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively.  It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.<br/><br/>Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense.  He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors.  While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.<br/><br/>The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict.  The use of the séance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach.  He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen.  Often compared with `Sixth Sense' because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.<br/><br/>As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date.  She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house. Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance.  Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film.  Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother.  James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well.  Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future. While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate.  I rated it 9/10.  Don't miss it."

","Alejandro Amenabar (writer,director) has used all the appropriate elements (light & dark, Noise & silence, action & reaction) as tools to create a masterpiece of film making. Using an Old English Mansion as the back drop to a ghost story maybe cliche'd, but it's meant to. This movie, like all great thrillers, works on our assumptions. And this is a great super-natural thriller. Amenabar's story is pure genius. It has been compared to the 1995 title 'Haunted' directed by Lewis Gilbert and starring Aidan Quinn. It has also been compared to M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' starring Bruce Willis. In my opinion 'The Others' makes the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' look Second Rate. The story, the directing, and the acting is far superior. Kidman is brilliant as the lead (In my opinion her best performance). And she is well supported by Flanigan, Sykes & Eccleston. The children are played by Mann and Bentley and are quite remarkable. Especially Mann, who is going to be an absolute star (even bigger than Haley Joel). This Movie is an all-time classic. It deserved higher praise from the critics. If you enjoy quality film making you will like 'The Others'. Quite simply it leaves THE OTHER movies in this genre looking amateurish. Check it out."

I'm not sure when this movie would be Academy Award material, but it should be or should have been. I see no flaws in the movie whatsoever.  Just fantastic performances by Kidman and the two children who play her kids--and the mansion staff.  Also the photography is as perfect as it gets--lighting, angles, etc.--all simply incredible.

","I would dare to say that one of the best films of the last decade is `The Others'. `The Others' has a very interesting and original plot. It tells the story of a young mother who lives with her two photosensitive children in a house, somewhere in England, after World War II. After the arrival of three servants, the family starts to suspect that the house which has to be kept in darkness because of the kids' illness is inhabited by an other family. In other words it's haunted. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is first of all the unexpected, totally unforeseen ending which really renovates the horror film genre. The performances of the whole cast and especially of leading actress Nicole Kidman are natural but brilliant. The photography with its game between `light and darkness' is excellent and the settings are perfectly attached to the chronological period represented. The mysterious, sentimental score and the well balanced direction of Alehandro Amenambar give this film its unique atmosphere. This is undoubtedly a film worth seeing as it combines drama with horror. The movie leaves us with a bitter taste afterwards and questions which remain unsolved. What it teaches us for sure is that hell  - if it really exists - is never the Others. What scares us the most is the ability of human beings to cause terrible pain to those whom they love most."

","THE OTHERS was written in the year 2000 by a Spanish guy named Alejandro Amenabar. Yes, the same guy who wrote the Spanish film that VANILLA SKY was based on. So, instead of just making a film that rips-off of THE SIXTH SENSE, he also makes it in Spanish, titling it ""Los Otros"". Touche!<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman did an okay job of acting and we soon understand that her two children have the rarest of rare diseases. They are allergic to the light. So, when three mysterious servants arrive, strange things begin to happen. The cast is basically English, which is definitively odd since this film was written by a man of Spanish origins. The story moves along quickly and as everything is happening, it all seems to make sense. But then we wonder to ourselves, why is all this happening now? Why did it not happen years earlier? These questions are never explained and that is what helps make the film retched. Better examples of the genre would be the all-time classic, THE SIXTH SENSE, and many more consisting of WHAT LIES BENEATH, DRAGONFLY, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES and about a hundred others. In fact, most of the above films are somehow cliched in the film, so that might be where the title came from. THE OTHERS can mean that the film is consisted of stolen material from ""other"" movies. But, that is only my interpretation. See it for yourself and see what you think. It is okay on a level of spookiness and chills. But that is about it. There are some creepy twists and turns which help the story stay thrilling enough to keep the viewers awake, but after it is over, you will be wondering the same very questions that I was.

","THE OTHERS is certainly one of the best-looking ghost movies in years. Rich with atmosphere, you easily feel as if you really are inside a WW2-era English mansion. Without a doubt, the atmosphere is the next best thing in the movie besides Nicole Kidman. She scores a bullseye with her performance as a mother of two young children living in a mansion on one of the English Channel islands, a mansion which appears to be haunted. Her daughter claims to have seen some of the spirits, and the new team of helpers who have arrived know more than they're letting on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the well-set up film fails to deliver. The story meanders seemingly forever, and I can't even recall how many times I found myself glancing at the clock to see how much time had passed during the first thirty minutes alone. The pacing is terrible. Some scenes go on too long. Others just fail to be effective. The suspense is almost non-existent with the possible exception of a few moments here and there, but even then it's rather lackluster, with only some good performances to keep you awake.<br/><br/>Alakina Mann and James Bentley are good as the kids, though why must one of them always be a little brat who likes to torment the other and mouth off? It's getting tiresome. Fionnula Flanagan is the next best element of the film, but otherwise, there's not much to get out of the movie. The story drags and drags until the final ten minutes or so when things finally began to pick up, only to lead to a twist ending that (while unexpected) seems just as much of a cop-out as the ending to THE SIXTH SENSE. Thanks to that overrated film, ghost story movies now feel they must offer a ""shocking twist ending."" At best, this could have worked as a short film of about fifteen or twenty minutes. But as it is, it's just like THE SIXTH SENSE: nice to look at, but ultimately completely unsatisfying."

The movie itself is very brilliant visually, and Amenábar has made the eerie music that goes with it, too.<br/><br/>
Though the story takes place on a british island in 1945, the location (a house) was found in northern Spain. The house, that is the 'frame' of the whole story, had to have some gothic elements without being a stand-out cliché. The house they found was perfect for this story. One final thing I have to praise, is the acting of Nicole Kidman, but also of the 2 children.

Notice that for the duration of the film, the setting is always foggy and dreary, one of the time-honored spook staples. While there are some creepy scenes every now and then, none of it is showy or special effects-laden. It's surprisingly minimalist for a modern horror film, taking the ""less-is-more"" approach. When something otherworldly happens, it's usually off-camera; giving us the eerie feeling of unknowable things happening just around the corner or above our heads. <br/><br/>Have you ever been alone in a dark house at night, and had the feeling that unseen, scary things were around you? That is the feeling that ""The Others"" tries to evoke; while the viewer rarely sees anything, the power of imagination goes a long way. There is an interesting deviation from convention: darkness is a friend, light is the enemy. If we are honest with ourselves, we will agree that--in a way--we feel the same way when watching a horror film; dark, gloomy scenes are just more interesting than bright settings. <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman gives the best performance, needless to say. She successfully runs the gamut of emotions, from love to anger, faith to doubt, calm to panicky; all these emotional transitions are accomplished without ever striking a false note. The best supporting performance comes from Fionnula Flanagan, whose quite strength and grace provides an effective counterbalance to Kidman's hysteria. Alakina Mann also comes off well as the independently-spirited daughter. The remainder of the cast turns in decent work. <br/><br/>I doubt that ""The Others"" would have been financially successful, at least to the degree that it was, without the presence of Nicole Kidman. However, it's not just a ""star vehicle."" It's an honest, legitimate ghost story that just happens to have a name actress; quite frankly, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. Much has been made of the twist ending; I won't reveal it here, but in retrospect, it was inevitable. As a whole, the film does a solid job in achieving its stated goal. It isn't one of the horror greats, but it works.<br/><br/>*** (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Dimension Films"
"Poseidon-3","Null","0","0","9 June 2002"," Moody, intriguing Gothic thriller
","Kidman gave the second half of her one-two punch of 2001 (the other being ""Moulin Rouge"", of course) in this Gothic thriller. She stars as a wan, highly detailed and regimented mistress of a huge, virtually abandoned mansion on the island of Jersey in 1945. Her husband has gone to war and has not been heard from. She and her two young children are joined by a trio of servants just as strange sounds and occurrences begin to happen in the house. The children suffer from a rare (and real) disease that causes them to be sheltered at all times from harsh light. Before long, it becomes clear that something mystifying and disturbing is happening in the house. The film hinges on several things...the vision of its director (who wrote, directed and composed the music!), the atmospheric cinematography/sets and Kidman's striking performance. Clad in well-tailored dresses and with a Grace Kelly-esque hair-do (he character's name is even Grace), she makes a stunning figure in the claustrophobic and sometimes creepy surroundings. She does a magnificent job in the role (though to nitpick, her accent doesn't always stay in line with the character) and the audience is along for the ride almost immediately. She is matched by a terrific Flanagan as a wise, yet enigmatic servant. The children are also very solid and expressive. Eccleston makes a brief appearance, looking something like a more ravaged Ralph Fiennes if he'd starred in ""The English Mental Patient"". There are a few times in which the pace might seem that it could use a shove, but the overall texture and feel of the film is based on a deliberate mood which is set by this pace. Some people may be able to see one or more of the twists coming, but regardless, it is fun and suspenseful getting to them."

Kidman has only one face the whole movie but the talented children make up for her limited acting. Making a movie of mixture should be thought over i cant help but think it was rushed.

","Being Australian I have been a huge fan of Nicole Kidman since the early 80s. Since the 90s she hasn't been able to show the world what she could do as her performances in some Aussie movies and mini series were absolutely mesmerising - Dead Calm, Bangkok Hilton, just to name a few.<br/><br/>Last year she stepped out of the shadows with her brilliant role in Moulin Rouge and now with The Others, she's finally showcasing her talents.<br/><br/>The Others is not a film to watch alone. I love movies like this one where you don't know what to expect or how it'll end and this certainly didn't disappoint and it definitely sends chills down your spine.<br/><br/>The performances of her children were wonderful as well and I think Nicole should've been nominated for an Oscar for this film as well.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best films of 2001 and one not to be missed."

"Slime-3","Null","0","0","1 June 2002"," Chilling supernatural jigsaw that really grabs the viewer
","One of the best chillers to emerge in the modern era, this moody and nerve shredding tale is well worth anyones time to watch. It combines an intricate story line with wonderful ensemble acting and intensly moody direction. The plot borrows some of it's neater twists from other recent Hollywood ventures into the supernatural and the visual style is very much that of Hitchcock (Kidman bears an uncanny visual resemblance to Grace Kelly in REAR WINDOW for instance)but the sheer strength of story and performances are what you will remember most. Kidman, playing an upper class English woman, with considerable conviction, only lets the cut glass accent slip slightly here and there. Her character's increasingly frantic situation draws out a career best performance with it's wide eyed incredulity and overbearing religeous zeal. The children she so desparately tries to protect (they have a lethal allergic sensitivity to daylight so live behind closed curtains)  are both superbly portrayed, a rare occurrence for such young English actors who, as a rule seldom behave as naturally on screen as their American contemporaries (and I say this as an Englishman born and bred). The curious trio of servants who arrive apparently looking for work at the beginning of the film never seem quite ""right"" and this aspect is central to the story itself. In fact nothing seems to be quite as it should be, from the continual foggy weather to the piano that plays itself - or does it?. This clever, and subtle displacement of reality keeps the viewer guessing constantly throughout. Just what IS going on here? Of course it all becomes clear at the end in time honored style and you will either pat yourself on the back for having worked in out or kick yourself for not doing so.Either way it will be satisfying. In this respect it's a film that has combined the elements of both a classic whodunnit and a supernatural chiller with great success. Are the children really at risk from the light? Are the servants working to some hidden agenda? Has the lead character become divorced from reality behind those closed curtains, alone with her dependant children and her deep religious beliefs ? Just why did the previous staff walk out and what has happened to the father who went off to war and has yet to return?<br/><br/>Perhaps the sense of time and place isn't quite achieved. The location is the island of Jersey, shortly after it's liberation from years of Nazi occupation but aside from a few references to power cuts and having to make do, this could be anywhere at almost anytime from the 1920's to the 1950's. The whole film is set in and around a large country house and the fog keeps out any picture postcard scenery, the staff don't have local accents or backgrounds that we are aware of and such things as fuel and food rationing are never even refered to, although they would have been very much a part of life at the time.<br/><br/>Aside from that it's a rattling good yarn and the small cast are all convincing in their roles. The atmosphere is built up strongly from the very beginning and it's carefully paced to keep the viewer thinking all the time without becoming bored at any point, even if things do, by design develop very slowly throughout. Top marks to all concerned, a film that has lived up to it's word-of-mouth reputation."

","Warning, this is more of a Trumpeting review.  Not much story line or other such discussion here.<br/><br/>This movie was great!  In my opinion it is tied with Sixth Sense as the best movie of it's type.  The ending is as good as Sixth Sense where it really all hits you at once, and there is not much chance of guessing it using foresight.<br/><br/>A good friend of mine pretty much summed up my current feeling on movies: The longer the movie goes before you ""get it"" the better the movie is; until the ending, where if you don't ""get"" everything, it becomes a very bad movie.<br/><br/>Following that line of thinking I think it is one of the best movies lately. However, about half of the people that I have talked to now, I have had to explain the ending.  My guess is that if you ""get"" the end, you will put it along with your favorite movies, otherwise you will feel like you have wasted your time.<br/><br/>I would have compare the movie along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"" for it's general direction, and surprise ending.

","The Others is not a typical horror flick.  Instead of scaring us with the dark deeds of Lucifer and his minions, as is typical, it takes us into the personal hell of a devout believer, who has managed to create her own damnation out of the very fabric of her religion and faith.  And it's so effective because we've all known people like that.  Some of us can identify with her, having lived life in a similar religious hell.  It's a gripping story about someone who thinks of her supreme being as an angry, vindictive old bastard. She creates her personal reality out of this fundamental, unexamined assumption.  The main character's name, Grace, is a beautiful irony:  she has no grace with herself, or others, which is, ostensibly, the essence of her faith.<br/><br/>Adroitly played by Nicole Kidman, Grace is a woman oppressed by religiously induced fantasies about what should and shouldn't be, to the extent that, when it isn't so, which is most of the time, her pious aspect shows its righteous and terrible wrath.  She's a `pocket' angry deity, a miniature Jesus of the book of Revelation, p***ed off, with a sword and a big white horse and eyes blazing and just itching to raise whoop-jamboreehoo against the ungodly.  Though a clever woman, her mental abilities lie dormant on the fallow ground of `thou shalts' and `thou shalt nots,' which she uncritically absorbs from her blessed catechisms.  Not only does she torment herself with externally derived notions of personal perfection, but she persecutes everyone else with her anally conscientious moral rectitude.  If she showed up at your office cocktail party, you'd probably find yourself on the opposite side of the room.  She just has the cork in way too tight.<br/><br/>We ask ourselves throughout the film, `What's with this obsession?'  And then we find out with the movie's surprise ending, which, I confess, caught me like a good left hook.  Wham.  Right on the chin.  It's a very clever variation on an old theme."
"mhelmsing","Null","0","0","30 May 2002"," Political/historical metaphors in the film
","I liked the movie -- I'm not going to offer any spoilers or subjective criticisims about the style or look of the movie. I'm not going to compare it to the Sixth Sense or to the old Hitchcock movies either.  What struck out at me the most ALL THROUGHOUT the film was the political and historical undertones that served as a subtext to the action and dialogue of the characters.  The film takes place right after World War II - in Ireland - during the period that the British Empire was beginning to see the restlessness of its colonies and the rumblings for independence.  It is unmistakable that Kidman's character can be likened to that of the imperial British Empire, which no matter how hard it tries, cannot shelter or protect Her colonies forever. For Grace, she is beginning to lose control of her life and the authority she holds over shielding her kids from the outside world. Her son and daughter play the roles of the long-suffering colonies under the British autocracy. Then along come 3 wise old 'veterans' who can see what's in store because they remember from the past.  They are akin to the revolutionaries and free-thinkers of the colonies that try to cry out for freedom and independence.  After World War II, Britian's empire (like Grace and her family) was dying or perhaps already dead.  With the independence of Her colonies, Britain was beginning to come to grips of their ""new"" role in an ""old"" world (Grace's vast mansion). Whether you buy into my crack-pot idea or not, you should still see the movie. DO NOT watch it in hopes of gory special effects or teen-slasher elements.  Watch it rather for some genuine suspense, sharp dialogue, brilliant cinematography, and a stunning score.  Rule Britannia"

","Since the teen horror flick genre was revived in the mid 90s by the success of Scream and its many imitators, Hollywood has in turn again found a market for the sophisticated horror thriller. The Others fits into the sophisticated horror thriller category that brought instant success to The Sixth Sense writer and director M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, a lady of leisure in a big estate house in Jersey, England, who has two children suffering a disease which makes them ultra sensitive to sunlight. Her husband has gone off to fight the war and her domestic staff has deserted her. The children live under strict supervision and must not be touched by sunlight, otherwise they will die. When new domestic staff arrives, the threesome find strange things occurring in their house and their day to day regime is threatened. The story unfolds slowly but with enough tension to keep you wondering about the varying motives of Grace Stewart and the domestic staff. The late great director Alfred Hitchcock would have been delighted with the dark set pieces and the visual nuances, including the swirling fog that constantly enshrouds the country house. However, it is also highly likely the master film maker would have tied up a few of the loose ends that do take a little bit away from The Others. Kidman is great as the seemingly neurotic mother, while Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who play Anne and Nicholas Stewart, make good feature film debuts as the scared young children. Bentley in particular looks authentically frightened during the entire film. Outstanding British actor Eric Sykes, who plays the gardener, gives an excellently understated performance as the working partner to nanny Bertha Mills (played by Fionnula Flannigan). The Others has been compared, sometimes unfavourably, to The Sixth Sense, and in many ways it is very similar as the story unwinds and the characters come to terms with their fate. Maybe it's not as good as The Sixth Sense, as predictability and a number of indifferent scenes remove some of the drama, but this does not take away from the wonderfully eerie aspect created by the old British tradition of a haunted country house. Definitely one to watch on a cold, dark night."

","Seems like when folks talk about the good old days of movies, they talk about movies that made you think, movies that scared you not by showing you something scary but by not showing you something at all. The fear of the unknown, conventional wisdom holds, is the ultimate fear. We do not fear the dark because it is dark; we fear it because of what it masks.<br/><br/>The Others harkens back to those oldtime scary movies, a haunted house movie that answers some questions, invites many more, and always keeps you on the very cusp of collapsing into hysterics. It's not just a neat ghost story told well; it's practically dripping with atmosphere.<br/><br/>Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a gigantic old mansion with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, waiting for her husband to return from World War II. The kids have developed a sort of photosensitivity disease, and cannot be exposed to any light more than that of a candlelight. This leads to the house being shrouded in darkness much of the time, and Grace even goes so far as to direct that no door may be opened without the previous door being closed, so as to prevent extra light from shining on the children.<br/><br/>Grace hires a troika of housekeepers and handyman to help around the house and with the kids, but the three older people seem... well, a little off to her. And soon the Stewarts come to believe they are not at all alone in the expansive manse, as daughter Anne insists she has seen and spoken to a little boy named Victor.<br/><br/>Who's behind the spectre appearances? Is it the hired help? Are the kids fibbing to their stern mother? Or is it all in the mind of Grace herself? Adding to the confusion is the return of Mr. Stewart to the house - like the help, he seems more than a little bit off-center. What is going on?<br/><br/>The mood is positively eerie, and it's accomplished by a pronounced lack of musical accompaniment. In most horror movies, one hears a melodramatic chord or two, leading up to the victim being slaughtered. Not in The Others. Silence is deadly and heightens the tension and suspense immeasurably.<br/><br/>
This is probably Kidman's finest work, and in my mind it mostly erases the painful memory of watching her attempt to act in Eyes Wide Shut. Stripped of the baggage known as Tom Cruise, Kidman is simply superb, mesmerizing the viewer to the point of feeling a deep empathy for her plight. The plot's no slouch, either, full of twists, including an incredible denouement. As ghost stories go, The Others is one of the best I've ever seen."

","Lord of the Rings??? Ha! This was the best movie from that year, hands down...better than Moulin Rouge, Monster's Ball, Shrek, In the Bedroom, A Beautiful Mind and all the rest. Many people have compared this movie to The Sixth Sense, but note: this movie was written BEFORE the Sixth sense ever came out. Alejandro had this eerie little gem planned for years, which makes it even more of a marvel.<br/><br/>This is also the superior movie because of the all-around great acting that Sixth Sense lacked in places. Fioluanna Flanagan -- an all-time underrated character actress -- plays the maid with stunning precision. Compare this to her other great ""maid"" role in the TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden. And Eric Sykes as the bumbling-yet-creepy Mr. Tuttle does extremely well, delivering the movie's funniest line...you'll know what I'm talking about. It's made hilarious simply because of his pitch-perfect delivery.<br/><br/>Also, these child actors, Akina Mann & James Bentley, are unbelievable -- I kept wondering where on earth the casting director found them. They're sort of a dark version of the Mary Poppins kids and every bit as good if not better. Bentley, especially, manages to be cute and terrified without also coming across as annoying and over-the-top like other, more-acclaimed child actors.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is gorgeous here. She's really hot. Besides that, I do believe Kidman's performance here is inferior to the role in Moulin Rogue -- people simply think this one is better because it's a dramatic film (most people do not realize how hard it is to do comedy well, let alone musical-comedy). In fact, this movie is more of a dramatic chilly family melodrama that horror. It's not really scary or even suspenseful; that is, even if you figure out what's going on early on, the tension and the dramatic storyline will still keep you watching, as happened to my best friend when we saw it. However you count it, Kidman is definitely a goddess, starring in the two best movies to come out of one year. <br/><br/>The Others is just well-done, nothing fancy, but with a few brief moments that will have you screaming at the screen. Well-acted, extremely well-written (very, very rare nowadays), and brilliantly directed...this is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion."

","Alejandro Amenábar is going to be one to watch in the future and may we all (movie-lovers and not)wish him a long fruitful life to give us this sweet end of entertainment.  For the reader who doesn't know, he is the writer/director of some other great films already rated in the tops of all time at the ripe old age of thirty (such as Abre los ojos-""open your eyes""-which so inspired and captured Cameron Crowe, writer/director of ""Almost Famous"" etc. etc., that he rewrote it for American audiences in ""Vanilla Sky"").

Couple a little originality with some sound solid acting and voila, we can step away from the mundane without too much of an art house feel that steps away from reality.

She is very protective of her children, considering they suffer from a rare malady that forces them to refrain from sunlight. However, the arrival of a trio of servants begets the arrival of some sinister forces, and her world starts to unravel.

"Tommy-5","10","0","0","22 May 2002"," A masterpiece
","The Others is a great film, excellent in every way. Every now and then something truly outstanding comes along and so it was with The Others. Nicole Kidman, quite possibly the most beautiful woman of our time, checked her ego at the door and dressed down to portray a depressed war widow with two young children. The mood and atmosphere are perfect and one waits with eager anticipation the next offering of the film's young director, Alejandro Amenabar. 	The time is just after World War II and the place is a gloomy house sitting in the mist of the Jersey Isle. One is reminded of Wuthering Heights with the constant sense of Gothic dread and unease which Amenabar so capably created. Grace's (Kidman) children are ultra sensitive to light and the house must be kept dark at all times, a point which Grace hammers home to the new house servants who unexpectedly show up at her doorstep to offer their services. It seems they have worked in this house before and know it well -- too well as we soon see. Grace's daughter claims to see visions of others in the house and Grace worries about her emotional health. The daughter is precocious, her son unhealthily timid and it is obvious Grace is a very burdened woman. 	Grace becomes convinced that the house is indeed haunted and the suggestions of hauntings are what make this film a masterpiece. Unexplained sounds, sightings, shadows and timely creaking doors come along at just the right time. By the film's last few minutes, we have learned about the mysterious house servants and Grace's husband. We are now on the threshold of learning a dark secret and experiencing an interesting plot twist. 	The use of shadows, lighting, sound, music and the body movement of the players (I have not mentioned what a fine supporting cast appears with Ms. Kidman, another important reason this is such a fine film) bring back memories of the conventional haunted house stories of days gone by. 21st century technology is an asset, not a burden here, and that is, sadly, not always the case. It is interesting to note also that The Others is every bit as atmospheric viewed in your living room as it was on the theatre big screen and  that is a credit to Amenabar's skill. You may even say his genius, because this is one fine piece of work. It may very well be that this becomes his signature offering, for it will be very difficult for him to top The Others."

","`The Others' comes from a short line of well made, serious-horror films since the early years of cinema history.  It scared me!  It filled me with awe as to the power and effectiveness of film (today, many filmmakers are truly clueless)   <br/><br/>Among these aforementioned serious films are `The Uninvited,' `The Innocents' (based on Henry James' novelette `The Turn of the Screw') and, most recently, `The Sixth Sense.'  <br/><br/>`The Uninvited' (itself a film based on Dorothy Macardle's novel, `Uneasy Freehold') offered a plot twist (one good ghost, one bad) at the end of the story, answering the audience's possible question, why is the ghost trying to kill her beloved, living daughter?'  <br/><br/>`The Innocents' were motherless children (one boy, one girl) who, suppressing their knowledge of the possibility of ghosts ended in the death of one of them, somewhat indirectly, at the hands of their governess, a sexually frustrated, yet well-meaning heroine.<br/><br/>Along came `The Others.'  This is a clever reworking of  Turn of the Screw' (the governess' here is now the children's religious, overprotective mother) and continues the cleverness in plotting, as seen in `The Sixth Sense.""<br/><br/>Watching `The Others' I quickly realized that the director relishes good, old-fashioned ghost stories, and doesn't make a habit of insulting the general intelligence of his audience.  Throughout the production, we are given hints as to the very super-nature of the narrative (the fact that the curtains must always remain closed, hints at the metaphor of the mother's unwillingness to see the light' of the truth).<br/><br/>The Others' cast rises to the transcendental occasion.  Flanagan is a seasoned stage veteran, and years ago appeared in the excellent television horror film `The Legend of Lizzie Borden,' here again playing a house servant.  Doesn't the young actress (playing the mute girl ghost) look something like Anna Paquin (although I know she's not her)?<br/><br/>

","This is a superb and scary thriller, yet there is no gore, no bloodshed. In fact, there's barely a ghost to be seen, and yet, you sit in your living room scared to death the entire time the film roles. Nicole Kidman stars as as the strict and fearful Grace Stewart, who, along with her two children, live and wait in a huge, old, spooky estate house, for her husband to return from the war. Her servants have inexplicably run off in the middle of the night, although the children think they were frightened away. Enter three new servants who ""just happen"" to be looking for work and the fun and the spooks begin. Alakina Mann is completely plausible as Kidman's daughter, who tries to convince her possibly psychotic mother that the house is haunted. Kidman's performance is absorbing and chilling, as Grace tries to figure out if the house is really haunted and if so, by whom. Are the children playing jokes? Are the new servants trying to scare Grace and the children away? Or, is she simply going mad (again)? Add to this a surprise ending and you'll be starting the disc over or rewinding the VCR to watch it again. This is truly a downright good and scary movie that doesn't succumb to the use of gore or violence seen in so many ""thrillers"" today."

","I've read many of the comments on this movie and while they don't ""spoil"" the story completely, they do make too many references to other movies, one in particular, which could make the impact of this story less effective.  I think The Others is unique.  When you consider how predictable storylines are today, after seeing this one you'd have to give it some credit.  I give it a lot of credit.  And, this is on the story alone.  The movie is beautiful.  The use of lighting is fantastic.  Pay attention to the scenes in the dark, especially when Kidman is carrying a candle while searching for the others.  The candle could not possibly create the lighting you see.  To me it's like a painter on a canvas with the light, but it's transparent and skillful, so you hardly notice it.  It's difficult for me to explain.  It's unapologetic and true to life, the story and the occurrences, which I find rare in film today, especially in the States.  There are no judgements on what happens or what happened in the storyline.  The ideas of morality and good and bad seem to be dead and buried once the movie ends.  This makes the story even more chilling.  There are no clear-cut endings or explanations. This is why I find it so good.  It seems the majority of the viewing public want popular justice and easily understandable and predictable endings and plots.  The references to this movie being like another movie, I think, are true because the stories are of a similar topic, but more importantly because they're both powerfully independent and true to themselves.  You know when you see these films because they affect you profoundly and are difficult to shake off.  You find yourself thinking about them for days and watching multiple times.  Horror/Suspense is my favorite genre and I'd easily say I've seen every popular horror movie and many, many of the rarer sort in the genre.  This one is great.  10 out of 10."

Kidman and the cast demonstrate that it doesn't take gore and chainsaws to create a true horror movie.  This film is intelligent and skillfully filmed.  Every nuance; every scene is perfectly crafted to recreate a mystery.  There is no red herring, yet the complex story keeps you guessing.  I'll have to see the movie again to appreciate how much the storyteller does give away and how obvious the mystery's solution seems in retrospect.

This was reminscent of The Sixth Sense when things start to all fall into place and you say to yourself ""I should have known that."" It's shot in very low light so it's very dramatic throughout. The other thing I really liked about this movie was that there was really only 6 main characters so you could really focus on what's happening without all the distractions of a lot of extras milling about to fill up space.

What it is, is an atmospheric, eerie and claustrophobic scare the pants off of you haunted house ghost story.<br/><br/> The story involves a young mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two light-sensitive children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) who live in an isolated manor in the middle of the countryside in 1945. The father has gone off to war and has not returned. Along come three mysterious house servants, Bertha Milk (Fionna Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), who show up unexplainably to apply for the vacant servant positions. Elaine and the children then begin to hear voices and things that go bump in the night. Are there ghosts or intruders in the house? Are the servants who they say they are? Can Grace protect her family against the evil forces?<br/><br/> Director Alejandro Amenabar keeps us guessing throughout. He presents us with a creaky old mansion with all of the haunted house cliches (slamming doors, unexplained noises, creaking floors etc.) but does so in a style reminiscent of the classic ghost stories such as ""The Uninvited"" (1944), ""The Innocents"" (1961) and ""The Haunting"" (1963). He gives us a slam-bang ending, with a few surprises, that you won't want to miss.<br/><br/> Nicole Kidman, after playing second fiddle to ex-hubby Tom Cruise is finally receiving the roles and recognition she deserves. Always a beautiful and talented actress, she proves in ""The Others"" what a fine dramatic actress she can be and does so without any of the trappings and glamour such as she had in her previous film ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001). Alakina Mann and James Bentley are excellent as the children. Veteran performers Flanagan and Sykes as well as, virtual newcomer Cassidy stand out as the servants.<br/><br/>  Take it from me, you won't want to miss this one."

But, if you've seen this movie and don't understand (like I did the first two times) I'm going to explain it to you. And if you don't want me to spoil it for you please do not read ahead. Ok, I'm going to attempt to explain: Nicole Kidman lives with her two kids who seem to be haunted by a family of ghosts... but, Nicole Kidman and her two kids ARE the ghosts to the other family. In the final scene the family sits with a psychic trying to contact Nicole Kidman and her two kids when the psychic DOES reveal that Nicole Kidman had killed her kids and shot herself, which did happen... Nicole Kidman's family was haunting the other family. I found myself saying ""Ohhhhhh!"" at the end when the family (NOT Nicole Kidman's) decided to move out they put a ""For Sale"" sign up. So what I'm trying to say is that Nicole Kidman's family are the ghosts actually haunting another family, though we are lead to believe that the Nicole Kidman family is the ""good living"" family, they are actually dead because Nicole Kidman went crazy and killed them all. Okay! You probably can't understand that but if you can it will help you. I had to buy this movie after seeing it and I give it a 10/10.

","The Others is not a great horror film, but it's an effective thriller, and as a showcase for the ever-evolving talents of Nicole Kidman, it's pretty near perfect. All this film lacks are one or two genuinely frightening moments -- there are plenty of little shivers, but nothing that puts it into Shining or Exorcist territory as far as terror goes. The script is a marvel of narrative ingenuity, though -- it's amazing that Amenebar gets away with as much as he does given the cynical, questioning nature of most horror fans -- and the photography, which deserved at least an Oscar nomination, is so stunning that it makes even the lulls diverting. Probably the best film of its kind since ""Jacob's Ladder"" -- a pyschological thriller with meaningful themes and a satisfying, unforseen resolution that, rather than simply pulling out the rug from under us, imposes logic, and, yes, significance what came before.

","In a horror market filled with useless gore and pointless plots, it's a breath of fresh air to see a quality scary movie. Looking back on the film, there wasn't an abundance of frightening scenes. Instead of the usual ""visible"" ghost activity, the writer/director Alejandro Amenabar relied on an eerie atmosphere; you get the feeling something supernatural is occurring, without being shown what ""it"" is. There are no flashy special effects or CGI monsters. At times, the expressions on the faces of the characters, heightened by an eerie soundtrack, composed by Amenabar himself, are enough to chill the viewer.<br/><br/>If you have read any review of this film, you know it has a surprise ending. Thus, you may spend the entire duration of the film trying to add things up and figure it out before they reveal it. I did this, and managed to only figure out part of the surprise. The rest shocked me.<br/><br/>Fans of Polanski and Shyamalan will love this movie. Many critics have compared it to the ""Sixth Sense"", but I don't think the two come close to eachother, plotwise. They are related only in the use of atmosphere to scare the audience.<br/><br/>This is probably not a movie for the ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" lover. It requires a lot of thought and imagination.

"ectoplasmicspace","10","0","0","13 August 2001"," Classic Ghost Story
","I was really waiting for a good ""horror"" film to come out, because I don't think I've seen a good one since the 80's (and even that's questionable.) It seems every attempt at the ""horror"" genre has been plagued with its slew on teenage fodder who scream & yell and are snuffed off, one by one. Well... the only entertainment value in that is seeing these useless snots being mutilated in various ways... but it's fake... so who cares... they just bought a new car with the profit!<br/><br/>So that brings me to my thoughts on ""The Others.""<br/><br/>This was FABULOUS! I haven't seen anything this classy in the ""horror"" genre since Alfred Hitchcock was still making films! No blood, no gore, pure suspense... classic ghost story... and unique! Perfect twist in the end... I felt it had the same kind of ""twist"" that ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Stir of Echoes"", & ""Unbreakable"" all had in common... one that throws you a total curveball. Thats the way a horror film should be! Suspenseful, & mindblowing in the end. It doesnt have to be gory... if its gory... its not scary... if it stirs up your senses, and you get edgey... and you get embroiled in the<br/><br/>plot... and the slighest noise makes you jump... THAT'S HORROR! That's what ""The Others"" did.<br/><br/>I'm not even gonna say what happened... I dont want to spoil it... just go see it!<br/><br/>This was by far the best film I ever seen Nicole Kidman in (of course I have yet to see Moulin Rouge!)  10/10!"

"baumer","8","0","0","15 August 2001"," Who are the others?
","Warning, may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Although I can't say that The Others is as good a haunted house film as The Changeling and even something like Amityville Horror II, it is still a very atmospheric, dark and well done film that most horror films only wish they could emulate.  This is a film that accentuates psychological terror and atmosphere over blood and machetes.  It also takes its time getting to the point but along the way you are treated to a film that wants you to figure out what is going on, literally behind closed doors.  I had heard from people that there is a great twist at the end of the film and that made me keep my horror senses open.  I really tried to figure out what the catch was, but about a third of the way into the film, I ceased trying to figure it out and I was just enjoying the film for all of it's artistic merit and style.  And what this film lacks in the area of genuine scares and chills, it more than makes up for in the aesthetic of the film and the make-up.  I recommend this film to anyone that is tired of all the Scream rip-offs and films that have no idea what the difference is between gore and raw primal fear.  I can, in a way, compare this film to a film like The Blair Witch Project.  It's not what you can see that frightens you, it's what you can't. We are always afraid of those sounds that go bump in the night. But not necessarily what makes them.  The Others never forgets that concept.<br/><br/>When you make a film about a haunted house, the first thing you have to do is have a great setting and an ominous looking house.  The Others accomplishes that by having it take place in the 40's, just after the war, in England.  For some reason, English haunted houses just seem ripe with history and they create an atmosphere conducive to the chills and fears that haunted houses produce.  This house is no exception.  <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays Grace and she and her two children live alone in this ominous house.  Her two children are both photosensitive, which means that if sunlight, or any strong light touches their skin, they could break out in massive hives and die.  This is a clever plot device because it means that the entire film has to be filmed with the lights off and only dim candles burning for light.  Other film makers would kill for a premise like this because it actually gives the director a legitimate reason for the lighting to be the way it is.  And lighting is one of the key components in any horror film.  <br/><br/>As the plot moves along, we find out that Grace's daughter, Anne, seems to be able to see and talk to ghosts in the house.  Grace, being a devout religious believer, doesn't believe in ghosts and tells Anne that she is lying.  She also tells her that when you lie, you don't go to Heaven, you remain stuck somewhere in purgatory.  Harsh words to be telling a 12 year old no less.<br/><br/>Suddenly, three servants come knocking on the door and tell Grace that they are there in response to the ad that she put in the paper (but what are their real motives for being there?).  Grace hires them and they go about their business of making sure the shutters are closed and all the drapes are shut.  It is also a strict rule that before one door is entered, the other has to be locked.  This presents some problems for the caretakers as there is some 50 doors in the house.<br/><br/>The Others plods along and drops hints every once in a while to assist us in trying to figure out what is happening and what the so called secret is. But not enough to make it obvious.  The imbroglio just keeps getting stranger as the film prods forward.  <br/><br/>Director Alejandro Amenabar has a keen eye for detail and he does a good job of keeping us interested.  Some eerie looking pictures show up and then are brought back later in the film and before you realize it, the conclusion is upon us.  And when the twist comes, you are almost glad that it ends the way it does.  This is similar to The Sixth Sense where you may want to see it again to see if you missed anything the first time around.  I have only seen it once, and although it is a good film, I don't planning on seeing it again.  I am satisfied that I picked up everything the first time around. And as I said at the beginning of the review, if you are more interested in a film like Urban Legend and I Still Know What You Did.... then perhaps this is not the film for you.  The payoff is worth the wait, but you have to be patient.<br/><br/>8 out 0f 10-- Much more in the style of Sixth Sense than Friday the 13th. And as much as I enjoy the Friday films, I will take a film like this any day over a film like Halloween 10 or Nightmare on Elm Street 9."

","I should have been more analytical.  I consider myself somewhat of a legitimate critic.  However, I never start taking the movie apart until after the fact.  Perhaps that's beneficial, in that I always enjoy movies more while watching them.  But then again, I feel like a fool when I totally love a movie and then it hits me as I walk out of the theater, ""That was just like another movie I saw!""  So was the case with me when I saw ""The Others.""  It was a very nicely made and fun movie.  I don't know if I can recall a movie where the audience was more into it than it was with this movie.  Perhaps there was even more audience surprise and interaction than there was with ""Sixth Sense.""  And that's where the comparison comes in. Though the ""others"" had that rather genius touch of the lighting to it, I can't escape how similar to ""Sixth Sense"" it was.  Except for the difference in story line and the fact that the dead people could only SOMETIMES see the living, it was just another case of the leads actually being dead people the whole time, not realizing it until the end and ""only seeing what they wanted to see"" until that final realization.  There was the brilliant(in my opinion) stroke of having Anne actually ""possess"" the old woman.  The way they did that scene was great.  However, in the grand scheme of things, I feel like ""The Others"" was more of an ""other era"" adaptation of Shyamalan's masterpiece than it was an original work.  Though I will always enjoy ""The Others"", it will never be an equal with ""Sixth Sense"" in my mind."
"corelli","7","0","0","12 August 2001"," A lesser ""Sixth Sense""
","The similarities between this film and everyone's favorite Haley Joel Osment vehicle are too numerous to mention.  And the key difference between the two movies - one that allows ""The Sixth Sense"" to stand out despite Ms. Kidman's command performance - is that it was a viable movie prior to the whiz-bang surprise ending.  ""The Others"" (what a dull title) managed to scare and entertain me most of the way, but it didn't make much sense until our requisite surprise ending came out.  This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but my appreciation of the movie was blunted by its incoherence much of the way through.  That's my two cents, anyway."

I am not a Nicole Kidman fan (especially after MOULIN ROUGE, ugh), but I thought she was sensational in this, or as Tom says, ""Nic is pitch perfect."" She really is, capturing her control-freak, jittery, yet deeply maternal character to a ""T."" With another, less mesmerizing lead performance, the kids would have totally stolen the show. Instead, they just add on to the fun--the little girl is like a BAD SEED aspirant and the boy is adorable. You feel for his terror as he's tortured by his big sis, his controlling mom and the house he lives in.

"superjenn","Null","0","0","12 August 2001"," Slow, but it kept the movie from seeming contrived
","Briefly: comparisons to The Sixth Sense, while warranted, are unnecessary. The Sixth Sense was a mediocre film with an ending that - as worded by the New Yorker - made the audience think they had just seen a better movie than they actually had.<br/><br/>The Others is vastly better, combining elements of atmosphere, sound, mysterious dialogue, &c.  Nicole Kidman, by whom I am seldom impressed, was amazing as a woman clearly gone off her rocker.  Two talented kids, a cameo by Eccleston, and three servants-gone-Goth later, we are granted an elegant, no-cheap-shots suspense story that literally made the audience I sat among both audibly gasp and outright scream.  Not bad for a movie that does so little - The Others, criticized for plodding along at a terribly slow rate, does seem to shuffle its feet at times.  But to the movie's credit, the story simply sits back and lets scary things happen here and there, at their own pace.  As a result, not a single instant seems contrived: the audience always has time to catch up with the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps you'll figure out what's going on before the rest of the audience. If so, good for you, now shut up, enjoy the movie, and stop telling the person next to you what's going to happen next - you might be surprised."

Nicole Kidman commands her scenes rivetingly, and the child actors are natural. The movie is dark, both in tone and lighting. One finds oneself watching the shadows nervously.

"kpyatt","Null","0","0","10 August 2001"," Simply the most stunning ghost film I have ever seen
","I just got back from a sneak screening of this, and I have to say I am absolutely breathless. My heart was pounding in my ears toward the end, and that hasn't happened since ""The Gift"", coincidentally another ghost film. But ""The Others"" is riveting in the classic sense that absolutely no special effects were involved, except for a few papers in the air briefly, which worked. I sensed no studio intervention. The brilliant writer/director was able to make his film the way he wanted, which comes across clearly in the remarkable, original, and stunning way this film is written, shot, acted and directed. A truly terrifying ghost story. All of the details are there that make it perfect: the children are dependent for their lives on the curtains; they can't bear the sunlight or they die. The mother gets migraines easily at any loud noises; one of the houskeepers is a mute. Every day is thick with fog, shrouding the house in even more of a sense of forebodness and confusion. While I knew early on what the twist was, this is not to say that it was predictable at all, only that I have read plenty, and I do mean plenty, of ghost stories, so I pick up early on a lot of the time. But that doesn't change the fact that this film is sheer and utter brilliance. Perfect camera angles involving the ghosts, which I, of course, will NOT be revealing here. Dark figures walking through fog to dark, spiraling gates, with rotted trees next to graveyards, postmortem pictures of the dead in the house. Absolutely PERFECT. I tip my hat to the director, who was talented enough and lucky enough to make his film with practically zero intervention of any outside force. Do you realize how little that happens nowadays? But then again, I can almost be sure that everyone who read this spectacular script knew it had to be made the way it was. It just had to be. And it was. And I will watch this film and love it for the rest of my life. It was simply the most stunning ghost film I have ever seen."

But The Others would have been a mediocre Hitchcock, and is above average modern American flick.  A lot here is taken from the Sixth Sense school, but not done as well.  Surprisingly, it's the story that's a bit weak and predictable here, bogging down excellent cinematography, directing, acting, etc.  The mechanics are wonderful.  Way too many scenes of Kidman in a gloomy hallway with an oil lamp... Enough already.  There are no secondary plots here of any interest - the main one may be enough to carry the movie, but not make it great.  As for the amazing surprise / plot twist at end --- I honestly had it pegged in the first 1/2 hour, and I normally am pretty darn dumb when it comes to ""figuring out"" surprise endings.... Maybe I was lucky on this one, or maybe there was just so much dead time during the film that I had the chance to think about it too much..."

The ending might be a little similiar to the Sixth Sense, but I think the Sixth Sense had a whole different plot to it.

"supertom-3","9","0","0","9 May 2002"," Narrowly better than the sixth sense, which itself was excellent!
","The Others is a film similar to the Sixth sense, and like the Sixth Sense is very good. The Others in my opinion is narrowly better. I think that the film is so wonderfully shot and Kidmans performance is so good it narrowly beats Bruce Willis's flick. The gorgeous Nicole (you idiot Tom!) Kidman steals the show here as the mother of two children, the kids are photo sensitive and will die if exposed to light, after excuciating pain and suffocation that is, and their conditon makes way to create the chilling atmosphere of the film by the fact that the house is in near constant darkness. The films lighting is very spooky and the direction was very good, I was very uneasy watching this and I must say that it takes a lot to scare me but I nearly had a heart attck on a number of occasions with some very well timed jump moments. The film is scary, it makes you feel so nervy because of the dark atmosphere built up through brilliant cinematography and an eerie score. The other actors are good, the three people who play the mysterious house keepers were good and the two kids were a very high standard although do not compare to Haley Joel Osment but then again he is so far better than most child actors he is almost un-naturally good for someone his age. As I said before Nicole Kidman is excellent, she really earned some desreved respect in this film and Moulan Rouge. The film is very good with some great twists one of which I did see coming although it is not blindingly obvious, I just followed the classic rules of the movie world that most films of this type usually go by. If you stop and think you'll probably guess the main twist because the film makers will always go for the jugular when it comes to a plot twist. Overall 9/10 make sure spare undies are readily available before watching."

And while it is along the same vein as other movies like The Sixth Sense at parts, it's original, not the same idea with both movies.<br/><br/> Nicole Kidman never does cease to amaze me, and wow did she give a great one in this movie as Grace, the mother of two children living in a mansion in 1940's England. And the children happen to be allergic to light. The plot is also such a good one, one that I can't give too many details about, if you haven't seen it already see it when it comes to video. The movie as a whole as gave me the great feeling of an almost throw-back to older, classic, almost Hitchcock-ian thrillers. Ones where extreme violence reigns suppreme and gratuitus nudity is all over.<br/><br/> Concluding, The Others was a great classy and smart thriller, please do yourself a favor and see this movie if you haven't.

","Yes! This movie eschews all the special f/x, cheap scares, gore and viscera. None of the typical big budget Hollywood scare tactics in movies like Scream and the hideously bad remake of The Haunting.  The Others is a genuinely creepy, suspenseful movie that uses psychological cues to increase the terror.  PG-13.  Can you believe it?  This is actually a scary movie that an adolescent can watch.  But take my word for it, it will creep you out even if you are in your 40's.  The atmosphere is dark and unsettling, and the acting by Nicole Kidman, and the two child actors are convincing.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, after some reflection, nothing particularly ""terrifying"" or ""scary"" ever actually happens in this movie. It is the acting by the characters that really makes you frightened.  Their fear is palpable and it conveys itself to the audience.  You feel as if though you are there with Grace in that big empty house, hearing voices and footsteps, and seeing things in the corner of your eye.  You can actually sense the slow burn Nicole's character is going through as she creeps toward possible insanity.  Magnificient.  Kidman should have been nominated for Best Actress for this role as opposed to her role in ""Moulin Rouge"".<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie for ghost-movie and scary story fans!"

","It has spooky atmosphere, a wicked twist of an ending and an ice-cold grabber of a performance by Nicole Kidman as Grace, a mother who isolates her two children in a Victorian mansion on the British isle of Jersey near the end of World War II. Grace, who fears her husband (Christopher Eccleston) has died in battle, keeps her two kids - Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) - in the dark. Literally. She tells the new housekeeper (the expert Fionnula Flanagan) that daylight will cause fits in Anne and Nicholas. Curtains must always be drawn and doors firmly locked. Then the noises start, and the visions and the strange voices.<br/><br/>No fair revealing more plot details. But you should know that The Others is the American feature debut of the gifted young Spanish director Alejandro Amenebar, whose 1998 film, Open Your Eyes, has been remade as Vanilla Sky by director Cameron Crowe and stars Tom Cruise, who served as co-producer on The Others before his marriage to Kidman went kaput. It's not hard to see what Cruise sees in Amenebar - this is a filmmaker who knows how to hold an audience with artful stealth. Only some bumpy, arid passages in the script keep The Others out of the master class occupied by the likes of The Sixth Sense and, my favorite, 1961's The Innocents, based on Henry James' The Turn of the Screw. When it comes to turning the screws of psychological terror, Amenebar is an expert technician."

","""The Others"" is surely the most superbly executed movie I have ever seen. The film tells the story of Grace, a hypochondriac Catholic mother who tries to protect her children from their morbid allergy to sunlight, despite the schemings of three new servants, and a mansion gone suddenly awry. The terror of ""The Others"", unlike other horror movies of the ""spooky old house"" brand, relies not so much on flashy special effects as it does on perfect timing, a suitably chilling soundtrack, and, most noticeably, the believability of its actors: Nicole Kidman delivers stunningly as a fiercely devout British mother who seems constantly on the verge of some horrifying fit of insanity. Alakina Mann and James Bentley never fail to frighten as the precocious and decidedly innocent children of Grace. And Fionnula Flanagan, veteran Irish actress, stretches thin the line between amicable housekeeper and fearsome hag with an ulterior agenda. From the unsettling opening scene, through a tightly wound web of suspense, intrigue, and a select few well-placed scream-packed moments, to the genuinely chilling conclusion , ""The Others"" never fails to terrify and amaze its audience with its innate sense of style, and a simple, but ultimately gripping, plot construction.

"Sinnerman","10","0","0","16 March 2002"," Haunting yet sad.
","Post WWII Horror Film starring Nicole Kidman, 1 missing husband, 2 kids, 3 new servants and 4 or 5 'others'. Grrrrrgh....<br/><br/>This is a very creepy film. THAT old woman was very scary...  But ultimately, one can't help but be strangely moved by this understated piece of cinema. Nicole's subtle but no less piercing performance for this ghoulish yarn should have been rewarded with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>
But in a world when a cheese burger can cost more it used to yesterday, and deserving films get chewed up by big budgeted crap, nothing is fair. Just think about it, isn't losing husbands (a real one, and a reel one) already a bad enough punishment for this woman? Imagine all those years of neck damage from having to look down all the time? Is it all worth it? Such injustice, the ways of the world, such utter injustice!(But I digress. Can't helpit. Sorry.)<br/><br/>Anyhow, all is not lost as this eerie little movie earned so much money(close to US$100 million, and US$1 million more than Vanilla Sky at that! ITS TRUE!), it went on to become one of 2001's biggest surprise hits.<br/><br/>
Miss Kidman is now hotter than ever before. And of course, she did garner a nomination for that other film(Moulin Rogue!). You know what they say: ""Unlucky in love.....""

"Spleen","9","0","0","12 March 2002"," A superb ghost story
","SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD.  If you haven't seen the film don't read so much as a single word below. ...<br/><br/>As with ""The Sixth Sense"", I believe you're MEANT to guess halfway through. When Grace meets her husband it's a ""Vertigo"" gesture: we now know the central truth that's eluding the main characters, they don't, and the tension comes from us waiting for them to find out.  Anyway, it's not as if the series of broad hints we are dropped during Grace's walk in the woods reveal ALL secrets, or clear up all mysteries.  We weren't told at that point that the caretakers are also dead, or that Grace murdered her own children, although the film plays fair with us and tells us all we need to know to work these things out.<br/><br/>The list of clues I failed to see the significance of at once is an embarrassingly long one (although the chagrin was pleasant): the undelivered letter, the mysterious departure of the servants, the day that ""mummy went mad"", the fact that Lydia underwent some trauma that rendered her mute... But in addition to all these clues there's one EXTERNAL to the narrative, a matter of technique, which I failed to read correctly even though I saw it mentioned before I saw the film, and noted it while watching.<br/><br/>It was in a review by New York critic Godfrey Cheshire.  It wasn't favourable.  An essential component of the haunted-house story, Cheshire argues, is ""daylight reality"", which means that in order for the spookiness to work we MUST see the people who are about to be haunted doing ordinary things in broad, unthreatening daylight.  And he's right: ""daylight reality"" IS an essential component of any story of this kind.<br/><br/>So when the film opens with Grace emerging from a nightmare, breathless with terror, in a dark house surrounded by fog, it DOES appear to be a stylistic defect.  But it isn't.  Grace, it will eventually turn out, is a ghost, a haunter rather than a hauntee.  ""Very well,"" I thought to myself when I discovered this, ""but what about the caretakers?  Why don't we see THEIR daylight reality?""  The answer to this question is the same: because they, too, are ghosts (you think by this stage I'd have got it).  Not until the very end, when we meet the ""others"", does the sun come out.  This hard-won ""daylight reality"" is no less effective a part of the ghost story for coming last rather than first."

","The best thrills and chills are those inside our own heads. Everyone knows it but Hollywood keeps trying to outdo itself with more gristle, more gore and ever bigger vats of blood. Not the case with this film, which is almost a throwback to the ghost stories of the 19th century and the B&W mystery films of the mid 20th century. Revisiting that territory, in a film as tidily put together as this one, is refreshing.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is radiant as Grace, the isolated, migraine-prone mother of two perturbed children (Alakina Mann is wonderful as the older child Anne, James Bentley is good too). Both children suffer from photosensitivity and Grace is meticulous in protecting them from the daylight. But all is not well. They are marooned in a mansion house (Grace appropriately compares the house to a ship at one point), the place is eerily fog-bound, the postman hasn't come, three new servants have arrived unexpectedly and the children are noticing that they don't appear to be the only ones on the house. Then Grace starts noticing things too...<br/><br/>The most trivial things become objects of fear and suspense in this film. A face in a picture, shadows, a moving curtain, a door that moves suddenly, a bump upstairs, half-heard whispers, a piano playing behind a closed door, dense fog. The atmosphere is developed superbly and Kidman plays her part - when required, she looks utterly s*** scared. But don't expect gory shocks for there are none."

When she doesn't have some definite emotion to convey, like anger or terror, e.g. in a plot set-up scene, she can't carry it off. Moreover, she has to shoulder a great deal of the movie by herself, and I felt her pain a bit -- it looks like hard work. <br/><br/>It's not all bad however. The gimmick of the light sensitive children provides some embellishment and amusing filler. And it does have some creepy, spine tingling moments. The two children and the rest of the supporting cast give impressive performances. <br/><br/>This as a haunted house/ghost story with only one arrow in its quiver.

I had the ending figured out too soon for it to be a really good movie experience.<br/><br/>That said, Nicole Kidman is fantastic in the movie.

It's not like one of those Hollywood blockbusters where all you do is sit back and let the special effects, explosions etc. carry you along. In this movie, the story unfolds through the dialogue from scene to scene. Nicole Kidman's performance is wonderful. The supporting cast is also good as well particularly the children. This movie is a definite must see!!! The frightening parts may be few and far between but there is always a sense of eeriness, which is unsettling throughout the movie. And probably the best thing about this movie is that most of the scares are provided not through gory or frightening visuals (such as a blown off head, a scarred face, people hanging from ropes ala The Sixth Sense) but rather through simple visuals such as a photograph or a hand reaching out."

The servants being ghosts and all, but the second one sent my brain reeling in all directions!!! WOW!<br/><br/>***This film is a great film. It uses the simplest of techniques to achieve the highest desired effect - to scare us witless! Doors opening and closing on their own. The piano being played in a room with no-one there. This might all sound familiar to the avid horror/thriller/chiller fan, but it is dealt with very careful means. And anyone expecting a slasher film, go somewhere else.***<br/><br/>In hindsight, if you actually sit down and think about what you have just witnessed, the twist makes sooooooooooo much sense, AND it holds water, unlike the Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>Take the two worlds - the living and the dead. As Grace (Kidman), in the world of the dead, keeps closing the curtains during the day to keep her children safe from the sun, and closing every door behind her so none are open, to the living, it seems that they have ghosts. If the 'intruders' keep opening the curtains during the day and leaving doors open, then to Grace, SHE has ghosts. This is so clever and really plays on a person's perceptions of events. God, I can't even put into words what I'm trying to say. But you who have seen this will definitely understand!!!!<br/><br/>***No beating about the bush, Kidman SHOULD get the Oscar for this film. I havn't seen Spaceck's performance yet, but so far, Kidman deserves it. She nails the British accent, she gives a powerful performance, and she is believable.<br/><br/>The two children are also outstanding, the girl was genuinely creepy at some points - when she was doing the 'red-rum' style two voiced exclamations in the room with her brother.<br/><br/>I'm still in shock I think after seeing this film, it does make you think. Which is always welcome when I watch a film.<br/><br/>Great direction. Very controlled. He knows when to keep us on our toes, or scare us half to death with tension.

Nicole Kidman is wonderful and convincing in the part of a woman who gradually begins to lose her take on reality. The children were also great, although the girl was a little bratty. The somber colors and musical score keep you on edge as does the constant shots of the mist shrouded house.

","The most accurate explenative which springs to mind when I ponder the 101 minutes I wasted watching this movie is ""crap"". Now, before I get  flamed into the next world, I should qualify this statement by first saying that a) I didn't really want to see this movie to begin with b) horror films aren't really what I go for (and when I do I expect to actually be scared by them) and c) there are way too many people who've posted comments here saying that this is a ""superb/brilliant/must see"" movie (what drugs were they on?).<br/><br/>That said, and I'm trying to be objective here (and believe that I have a some what educated eye when it comes to judging movies), this movie is like a stunning study piece done by some one in training in the classical arts, which then proceeds to receive a poor to average mark from the teacher because while the technical execution is good to excellent, the interpretation/emotional aspect of it is near non-existant.<br/><br/>The location manager and the lighting people should be complimented for their achievements (cool house and realistic lighting - considering the curtains were drawn most of the time), the special effects guys should get an award for their ability to keep a thick blanket of fog directly in front of the camera for the duration of the movie (in all outside shots - although it might have been an improvement had they done the same for the inside shots) and the screen play writer should be made to sit and watch episodes of Barney for two weeks (the lowest form of material that raises a blip on the entertainment-o-meter).<br/><br/>There are exactly two scary parts in this movie (totalling about 2 seconds of movie time), the rest of the time is spent focusing on a fruit loop of a mother who spends her time locking and unlocking doors, drawing curtains and lighting oil lamps (the annoyance factor of which tends to dampen any sense of fear that the director tries to build up).<br/><br/>As a friend of mine said, if this film were to end up as a DivX/VCD download somewhere (a cruel waste of hard drive space), it could most probably be compressed so much, due to the lack of action and change in scenery, that it could most probably fit on a 1.44MB stiffy disk."

"showdown","7","0","0","27 January 2002"," Good enough to see once, but will it become a classic? (Last paragraph: possibly spoiler)
","For me this one is a ghost story in the most traditional way: it creates a frightening atmosphere, there are few very well set shock effects without any blood/gore. The story is quite good, but could have been asking more questions (and some of them being answered).<br/><br/>After seeing a movie I ask myself mostly the same key questions: Did I like it (and why/why not)? Was it so good that I would want to see it again? Can I recommend it? Was there something new/original in this film? Yes, overall I liked it and I can recommend it, it is worth looking. I would watch it again, but only after a longer period of time and not in cinema (although the surround sound effects were really impressive). Maybe it is not quite fair, but the similarity to ""the sixth sense"" is close at hand. Compared to ""the sixth sense"" this one loses a bit, and not only because I saw ""the sixth sense"" first. There were not enough new things to make it a classic of the genre. Unfortunately I could not sympathize so closely with the characters as I did in ""the sixth sense"".<br/><br/>
! Warning: possibly spoiler ahead! I think the story is incomplete in some ways: for example in the end the question ""why did Grace do it?"" comes up, but there is no hint of an explanation (""crazy"" is not satisfying enough) and I could not detect a sufficient motivation for it in her acting before. But I see this as a lack in the script, not in the acting of Nicole Kidman."

It's the way the idea was expanded and executed by a very talented writer-director. <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman handled her role extremely well, but I was expecting her to, having read a ton of positive reviews. Also, I've always considered her a very talented actress. But I was just amazed by how well the two children did: they were simply brilliant, especially the girl.

"Thomas-58","Null","0","0","30 January 2002"," Excellent combination of the Sixth Sense and Beetlejuice
","MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:  In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" raised the bar for the modern day horror/suspense film.  Now, despite the disappointing similarities to Shyamalan's arguable classic, ""The Others"" raises the bar higher.  Like Shyamalan's film, director Alejandro Amenabar clutters his film with many subtle details to sink your teeth into.  For example, the religious overtones of the film (from Grace's stern biblical morals that she instills in her children to her belief that the living and the dead will coexist ONLY at the end of eternity) are not just intriguing as character traits of people in a horror film but as pieces that assemble together and form the film's story.  Since the film is told through Grace's eyes and since the film ultimately builds up to Grace's realization of herself and her family, it is imperative that we the audience experience the same feelings that Grace does.  And, thankfully, the acting is superb all around, anchored by Nicole Kidman's flawless portrayal of the hopelessly tormented Grace.  She manages to pull off the tough task of convincing the audience that while she is grounded by her religious convictions, she is internally conflicted by the madness around her.  When can she trust her daughter?  How can she keep her sadness directed toward her husband away from her innocent children?  When does she have time to rest?  It seems as if this woman always has something to worry about, but has nobody to talk to about her problems.  Even so, the audience never is unsure of what Grace is feeling inside, and this is because of Kidman's tremendous performance. Unfortunately the film's payoff is not as tremendous as the film sets it up to be.  Now, there is nothing wrong, per se, with the film's resolution. But, like others have pointed out, one can not pretend when critiquing this film that ""The Sixth Sense"" does not exist.  In fact, I repeatedly attempted to predetermine the film's twist ending, and was unable to conjure a satisfactory conclusion.  The film stumped me.  But when the last minutes did unfold, I felt as if I were cheated.  Basically, if I knew the filmmakers did not mind retreading the twist to 'The Sixth Sense,' I would not have tried so hard to think of an ending that was not similar to that of ""The Sixth Sense.""  As it is, in relation to ""The Sixth Sense,"" the ending is too similar even to warrant one's forward perception.  Along with this drawback, add to it the fact that, ahem, the ending admits that the whole time we were watching just a serious retelling of part of the ""Beetlejuice"" concept (Grace and her children are just like ""Beetlejuice""'s Maitland couple in the beginning of that film) and the ending turns out to be a real downer.  Therefore, the best advice I can give is to see this picture before ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Beetlejuice.""  Nevertheless, even if you have seen those pictures, the strong performances (Kidman deserves that Golden Globe nomination) and the film's first 95 minutes make for one taught, thrilling, dense, and sometimes tense, ghost story.  Final Grade: A-"
"a-trane","6","0","0","20 January 2002"," Dejavu in many ways
","Not very original and in terms of the acting little convincing, yet stylish flick with a twisted finish that reminded me (and some of the other reviewers here) of ""The Sixth Sense"". Rumors spread that Amenabár wrote the script before ""The Sixth Sense"" came out, but even if that would turn out to be true, it wouldn't make ""The Others"" a more valuable film.<br/><br/>
Amenabár evolves a very conventional haunted house plot, with Nicole Kidman in the centre of attention, as she gives an above average but not compelling performance as a strict and at the same time desperate mother, concerned about her two kids. The youngsters are over-sensitive to light of all sources as a result of a rare disease. Since they can't be exposed to daylight, all windows of the inhabited mansion are permanently darkened. Three domestic servants move in and strange things start to occur, like the floor board creaks without anybody walking and the kids begin to hear voices and so on.<br/><br/>The film is too much about Nicole Kidman's character and the kids aren't believable for most of the time, showing once again the difficulty of finding talented low-aged actors. All in all ""The Others"" looks somehow dated and creates tension just in a few good moments. The photography is quite good though.<br/><br/>Rating: 5-6/10"

"ertank","Null","0","0","16 January 2002"," A political film?
","Let me tell you my personal experience with the film. It was all too ordinary for me when I left the movie theater. I was thinking 'Yeah, it was good, Kidman was good, kids were good, and Amenabar had a good film.' I had my shopping, some other daily routines, etc. But when I was returning home, everything suddenly began to open one by one in my mind, forcing me to the conclusion that this was quite a political film as well. How come? Well, anyone familiar with the theory of postmodernism might start even from the name of the film. The concept of the ""other"", in fact, has been carried into the intellectual agenda by so-called 'postmodern' thinkers such as Foucault. The film marks the fragility of the establishment of a concept of 'the other', for the grounds of this very establishment cannot escape from relativism. In other words, how can you prove that in some other context, some other time and/or space, you would not be 'the other'? The postmodern criticism doesn't end here. I think the fact that the story goes through in the end of Second World War is not a mere coincidence. As you know, there is a consensus that Nazism, fascism, atomic bomb, mass massacres have been marked as the signs of the end of rationalism, a sine-qua-non of modernist way of thinking to that time. And the concept of 'light' in the film can be read as a critic of the concept of 'enlightenment'. Well, these are parts of brainstorming; but let me remind you that Amenabar's previous film had obvious traces from another postmodern thinker, Jean Baudrillard, on the concept of 'reality' and 'hyperspace'. As a summary, I have to say this is a successful film, moreover, not a mere horror film, but a political film, which could have been shot by a director that has a considerable intellectual background on the political issues I have mentioned above."

When I went to see The Others, I had no idea that it was actually supposed to scare you, and that made it even better than I first could imagine.<br/><br/>Basic story: Nicole Kidman lives alone in a very large house with her two small children. The children are sensitive to light, if exposed, they will develop skin complex and eventually it will kill them. One week prior to where the movie begins, all the servants of the house they live in just disappeared. When the movie begins, three people arrive at the house as to be the new house help. They are told how to handle the doors in the house - ""no door must be opened without the previous one being closed first"". The reason, of course, is that the children must not, at any time, be exposed to light. ""This house is like a ship, where the light, as water, must be contained at all times""...or something like that (can't quite remember exactly what's being said).<br/><br/>Anyway, I was frightened by this movie - I had to see it twice in as many days just to get a better look at it.

"okane","10","0","0","8 January 2002"," A beautifully realised, scary film
","A quick comment first: I loved this film.<br/><br/>Of course that should be apparent from my review, but lets not leave it to chance.<br/><br/>The Others is a reminder that a lot of work goes into making a film and that, at its best, cinema is art. The director, Alejandro Amenábar (try saying that three times after a few drinks), has done a superb job of crafting this film.<br/><br/>The basic plot line involves a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who lives with her two photosensitive children in a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War. They live alone with their newly hired servants as they wait for the return of the husband/father from the world war. Needless to say, there is a suspicion that the house is haunted and the tension skillfully generated in the film is a result of this suspicion.<br/><br/>

","First of all, I have to say that I have admired Alejandro's work since he made his first feature length film, Tesis.  The Others, even though it's his third film, it's his first english spoken film, and what a thrill ride it is.  As the film goes deeper into the plot you feel totally immerse into it.  The casting was great and even though I personally don't like Nicole Kidman as an actress she excels in this role as well as the two kids that play her son and daughter.  this unique film comes from the mind of a practically new film maker who has taken Hollywood by surprise with this moderately budgeted film that earned millions at the box office. Alejandro has a way of telling a story by images, words and music (he directed the film, wrote the script and also composed the score) that he seams to be ahead of the audience all the step of the way.  He uses cinematic techniques that film makers now a days have forgotten or refuse to use and that is what makes him special.  The film does not require stunning special effects, or the overuse of sex to involve the viewer.  With simple lighting he was able to create an atmosphere which lots of films fail to produce.  In these days films often have twists and turns, but few have the creativity of a genius behind the scenes.  Besides the suspense, the jumping out of the seat and the twists and turns of it all, I enjoyed the cinematic work of art the most.  I Highly recommend this film if you're into it.  I also recommend ""Open your Eyes"" and ""Tesis""."

","Warning, spoilers ahead--please don't read unless you've seen the film!<br/><br/>Predictably, a lot of know-nothings are complaining about the twist at the end of The Others, claiming that it ""rips off"" The Sixth Sense. Well, guess what, the-protagonist-who-is-already-dead surprise was *hardly* introduced by The Sixth Sense; this plot device has been around since at least the old days of The Twilight Zone television series of the 50's, and as recently as in an 80's movie called Siesta, which was directed by Mary Lambert and starred Ellen Barkin (oops, looks like I just gave away the ending to that--sorry!). Besides, I have to admit that the twist here (actually the DOUBLE twist) completely threw me, and I was one of those who managed to figure out The Sixth Sense's big surprise midway through the film. Anyway, surprise endings aside, there is much else to admire in this fine ghost story. Nicole Kidman gives a very good, sensitive performance, and she has an excellent supporting cast behind her, particularly the two children, who are entirely believable. The film is rich in atmosphere and uses all the trappings of the classic ghost story (the isolated house, mysterious strangers, darkened rooms, etc.) beautifully. If you like ghost stories (and like me, are happy to see them back at the box office thanks to the success of The Sixth Sense) then hie thee to this fine film."

","As a fan of Amenabar (""Tesis"" & ""Abre los ojos""), I went to catch this film as soon as it opened in Paris cinemas. He didn't fail to deliver. ""The Others"" is a traditional, well-crafted horror piece; Amenabar excelled in creating the atmosphere for the film, clever, simple, dark and creepy, with no over-indulgence in special effects unlike some of the recent ""horror"" films. The setting was just perfect. Nicole Kidman was excellent in executing the role of the lady of the manor. Clearly, this must be one of her best performances. For me, Fionnula Flanagan stood out exceptionally as Mrs. Mills. Having watched her in various TV-movies in the past, I must say that she almost outshone everyone else in the film although she played a subordinate part. The parts of the children were very-well and convincingly portrayed. Amenabar, at only 29, and with just two films to his credit prior to making ""The Others"" must be lauded for this latest effort. However, my disappointment lies in the revelation at the end of the film; the climax was superbly executed but it reminds one of a very recent ""déjà vu""....UNFORTUNATELY. It could have been a little more original. But I still recommend it for the wonderful performances,  direction and photography."

Everything changes until the day Grace receives the visit of 3 strangers who come for a housekeeper job being announced and by coincidence, after this hiring, she starts feeling the sensation of being haunted by ""ghosts"" in this old house. This situation takes us to a journey of emotions, most of them scary, breathless and claustrophobic to get to an end which will be unexpected, very chocking and surprising. The others is a very deep original production so smartly written, effectively and elegant directed and so amazingly acted that it is definitely one of the best horror movies ever. <br/><br/>Amenabar takes good care of every single detail of the movie, taking them to a magnificent level that only masters like Hitchcock were known for adding such a deep suspense and make a film so intriguing and very unpredictable.<br/><br/>Robinson Almanzar"

"tripwires","9","0","0","27 December 2001"," The chills haven't stopped
","I'll admit straight out that I get scared easily. I couldn't sleep for months after watching ""The Sixth Sense"", and I really want to watch ""The Exorcist"", but I fear my heart wouldn't be able to take it. ""The Others"" is one of those movies that I know would scare me senseless, that I should avoid if I want to sleep in peace, but the more I realise that, the more I want to see it. It's a funny thing, human nature, it's almost masochistic. I can never understand why I enjoy scaring myself so much.<br/><br/>(spoilers) ""The Others"" concludes on basically the same note as ""The Sixth Sense"". Like I said, the latter film scared me, but I found ""The Others"" somewhat more chilling and thrilling. In ""The Sixth Sense"" (a very good film too), I was scared by the images of the ghosts, like the woman in the kitchen. But in ""The Others"", I was scared by the POSSIBILITY of what haunts the house. We don't get to see who's behind the mysterious closing and opening of doors and things like that until the very end, and it's a good thing, because it allows the viewer to exercise his/her imagination. The film doesn't show the audience its scares; it suggests them, and it's a lot more effective than creating a CG ghoul that floats about and have it boo at the audience every few minutes.<br/><br/>I have another confession to make: I screamed out loud at possibly the scariest scene in the movie, during the climax. The last time I did that was during ""Scream 3"", which wasn't scary, but everyone in the theatre was screaming, so I thought it would be fun to join in (it was). But here, I didn't scream for fun; tension was building up, and you're dying to see what's behind the closed doors (I wouldn't say what doors), and when you finally do, you see a sight that is so...grotesque that you can't help but scream. Needless to say, I got laughed at by my dad, but even he admitted that that scene sent chills down his spine.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie I kept feeling goosebumps all over my body, and in fact, still do now, when I think back to the film. Its geographical and period setting, its small cast, its music, its cinematography, everything contributed to its creepiness. I was surprised to see that Kidman was actually good in this, after her unintentionally comical performance in Moulin Rouge!. She displayed a range of emotions and daringness that I did not expect. Very much like ""The Sixth Sense"", the truth that was revealed was more tragic than scary (though it did scare me), and Kidman, along with the two kids, evoked a pity in me that almost made me forget how scared I was. That, I think, is a real accomplishment.<br/><br/>The movie boosts some of the greatest props I've seen in a while. I absolutely hated the photographs of the dead. They're old and yellowed and the most important photograph made me want to hide behind my cushion. The film also doesn't have any special effects or elaborate CG images. It's all atmosphere and mood, and it works very, very well. This is a brilliant and subtle horror movie that is well worth watching."

I didn't hold my breath in anticipation of what would happen to the characters in the next scene because the plot never nurtured an emotional bond between me and any of them.

","A beautifully constructed film, which relies on suspense and psychological inference to convey its romantic brand of terror. There is no question that there is Hitchcock here, but so to are there influences from the 1940's 'Gaslight' and a host of other romantic ghost stories from this era.<br/><br/>The film is as much a tragedy as it is wilfully frightening and Kidman's isolation and despair whose only respite is her desperate adherence to strict religious piety is powerful and heart wrenching.<br/><br/>Emotional turmoil and spiritual awakening have always complimented each other well but here the relationship between them is pulled off with great originality and flair.<br/><br/>Strong performances all round pull this essentially simple film (note the short credits to cast and crew at the end) up a level and certainly make it a contender for one of these years' best films.<br/><br/>In the 1940's directors relied on the psychology of fear tapping into the emotions and often-subconscious fear of an apparently fast secularising society. The loosening of censorship guidelines brought us the Hammer genre of increasing gore and a sexual dimension. Sadly the mixture of psychology and gore which peaked in the mid 1970's deteriorated so that by the 1980's we were treated to a blood bath which was disturbing but quite frankly cheap, vacuous and most of all not very scary. The postmodern outlook of Wes Craven was certainly refreshing but The Others like 6th Sense resurrects a genre where fear and emotion intertwine. Where impact is complex and haunting for loss of a better word. Rightly so, the modern cinemagoer is both educated and complex something which Hollywood would do well to understand and in this case has. Cool, intelligent, thought provoking and tender The Others is a fine attempt at resuscitating the golden age of the romantic ghost story."

In The Others, the worlds only cross over occassionally. And The Sixth Sense is just blunt and obvious, (""I see dead people""?? Well there's the clue with a big flashing sign on it), The Others is much more subtle, using migraines as pointers, and that's about it. Everything else can be explained by ghosts, and, strangely, the living.

","THE OTHERS, I must reluctantly admit has its moments. However, it is not a ""classic"" horror film, it isn't in fact a classic anything. It is a well photographed, flawed psychological thriller, a tad low on thrills.<br/><br/>The ""Once upon a time"" opening is a major mistake first-up as it telegraphs clues to the point of striking the viewer between the shoulder blades...""excuse me....this is a clue!!"" A curious threesome, by way of Mrs Mills, mute Lydia and gardner Mr Ed Tuttle (the rarest of oddball roles for Brit once-was-a-funnyman, Eric Sykes) turn up at her door, curiously just as she is looking to replace the last help which disappeared into the night. Successful in gaining employment (or re-employment as it turns out, hint, hint!) Mrs Mills and the audience are introduced to Kidman's light-sensitive children, feisty daughter Anne and mega-wuss, her younger son Nicholas.<br/><br/>
For most of the remainder of the film, well actually....nothing really happens when you come to think of it! Doors slam, we are given to believe that Anne sees dead people, the sound effects crew are given carte blanche to wring every last wrench, rip, tinkle, slam, shriek and ghostly presence you could hope for. Oh, and her lost-at-war husband turns up during a sequence that blatantly telegraphs what's going down here, IF you're paying attention.<br/><br/>Now, it has been common knowledge from both critiques and advance press on the flick, that it borrows heavily from the SIXTH SENSE (a better film in my opinion) and therefore I would have thought the general outcome would be obvious to most anyone, the only question is - which?????? The film answers this poser long before the last few scenes which subsequent to the denouement, are actually the best in the film. For my money, Nicole Kidman though credible mostly, yet almost 40's Crawford at times, is just over the top and downright ""hammy"" once in a while. Her best scenes are undeniably at the conclusion of the film.  Fionulla Flanagan is flawless as the kindly housekeeper Mrs Mills and simply acts Kidman off the screen....sorry fans! Alakina Mann all but matches her stride for scream as the daughter with attitude and a rather fetching look beneath that veil!<br/><br/>*****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD *****<br/><br/>Clues are littered throughout, with such ludicrous gems as ""Mummy's gone mad...again!"" and multiple references to ""that night.""  Even if you DO work out the basic premise and I have to be honest, I did quite early (Half is obvious almost immediately....the other half later!) the ""actual"" explanation at the end is acceptable without necessarily being logical - you can put up half a dozen  ""Yeah, but what about's"" In the end, not so much derivative of the sixth sense but an arguable rip-off, dove-tailed with Henry James concepts in TURN OF THE SCREW. The latter being filmed in 1961 as THE INNOCENTS which leaves this for dead (excuse the pun!) <br/><br/>Chilean born Amenobar has undeniably turned out an ""interesting"" film (only his third) with strong European influences, never more obvious than from Aguirresarobe's gothic-inspired cinematography. The buzz that THE OTHERS may be in Oscar contention, may be a little premature. One person could well live with that, is Executive Producer, the ex Mr Kidman, Tom ""let me get on with my life"" Cruise."
"Dark Hellion","7","0","0","28 November 2001"," Good, but...
","By the time I got around to seeing this movie, many of my friends had already been to see it, so I had a pretty good idea of the spread of opinions out there. Some claimed it was the best thing since sliced bread, but upon examination, it turned out most of these people were self-confessed Nicole Kidman fans. And hey, us Aussies tend to be a bit parochial at the best of times. <br/><br/>But an upswelling of opinion worldwide that's enough to propel this movie into the IMDb's top 250 is something you simply can't ignore.<br/><br/>
The first thing I noticed about this movie as a whole was the art direction. The cinematography was not necessarily anything to write home about--it was above workmanlike, but not as outstanding as other films I've seen this year--but the set design, the layout, the costumes, the lighting, the sheer *beauty* of this film really made me sit up and take notice.<br/><br/>
Perhaps unfortunately, for me art direction is a means by which plot can be expressed. In films where it's appropriate to think about the plot (and as a cerebral horror/suspense movie, this one falls squarely in that category), Plot Is King. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Okay, if you're still reading and you don't want to ruin any surprises, STOP NOW!!! <br/><br/>Right. <br/><br/>When we reach the end of the movie, we learn that Nicole went mad and smothered both her children before shooting herself with a rifle. They've been seeing 'ghosts' throughout the movie, but these 'ghosts' are actually real live people that have moved into the house. At first only the Nicole's little girl can see them, but as the truth becomes more apparent, that the only real ghosts are the protagonists themselves (and their servants, but that's a side-plot), the real people become properly visible.<br/><br/>
Obviously, this is always going to draw parallels with The Sixth Sense...and if you haven't seen *that* movie and don't want it ruined, stop reading now too! <br/><br/>Bruce Willis discovers he's dead at the end of that movie--murdered by an intruder to the house he shares with his wife. Some have said that The Others handles the revelation better, others have said it's worse. I fall into the latter camp. <br/><br/>The thing is, when you're watching The Others, you're wondering where it's going throughout the entire movie. There's no sense of purpose. There's definite interest, and you don't get bored, but there's no secondary plot to keep the audience engrossed in a storyline, nothing to stop them from picking the movie apart at each step. The psychologist/patient relationship between Bruce and Haley in Sixth Sense offers that. Plus you get a greater sense of backstory in the history of Willis' character's life.<br/><br/>
Also, unlike Sixth Sense, The Others refrains from having subtle pointers to the real truth. Instead, it opts for one big pointer, and then a lot of red herrings. Where the path to the truth in Sixth Sense was obvious once you knew how, the path to the truth in The Others is littered with what appear at first glance to be inconsistencies and plot holes. <br/><br/>Put simply, I preferred Sixth Sense on its ability to *draw* the audience into the storyline, to bring out an interest in the characters' situations and for its masterful working of the backdrop behind it. Sixth Sense is a less beautiful movie, that much is true. However, there are so many little things that could have tipped you off to the truth in it.<br/><br/>
Sixth Sense brushes you lightly with a feather every now and then in an effort to make you see the chicken. The Others tries to bludgeon you with the entire chicken once or twice and then throws fish at you just to make you think about something else for a while. <br/><br/>Having said all that, it's still a very good movie, and one I'd recommend going to see. A pity that it's just not quite as good as it might have been.<br/><br/>
Pros: Atmospheric, beautiful, highly suspenseful, and well worth going to see. Plus the two kids are the best I've seen on screen since...well...Haley Joel Osment, really. <br/><br/>Cons: It just doesn't *quite* get there. <br/><br/>Likely Oscar nominations: Largest budgetary allocation for light bulbs, 2001. <br/><br/>Verdict: If Sixth Sense was on the highest salary in the country, The Others can still put its kids through private school, university and afford braces for them both. However, it'll never afford the mansion on the hill. Good...but could have been better. <br/><br/>7Â½ out of 10."

The photography is rather gothic, and since the beginning there is a sense mistery around this ""haunted"" house. The lack of light which is a ""leit-motiv"" of the action helps you to enter into Amenabar's world.

"mikerichards","10","0","0","25 November 2001"," The best horror movie in a generation
","A big claim? Well yes and no. Firstly I should define what I DON'T mean by horror - men in rubber suits or teenagers with outsized cutlery. If these movies were ever scary it was in the early 1980s when 'Alien' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' defined those particular genres to such an extent that no one has ever matched their standard. <br/><br/>What I consider horror is something much more subtle and far older - the fears that we all carry inside of us whether we admit it or not.<br/><br/>The terror of death; the ache of loneliness; the fear of a believer that there might not be a God, the worry of the most convinced atheist that there may well be one; the committed rationalist who outwardly denies the unknowable; the constant temptation of evil - those have been the staples of horror from the dawn of time and they still have the power to influence us.<br/><br/>
	Who hasn't lain awake in the small hours with their heart pounding?<br/><br/>
	Has anyone not glanced behind them when walking down a lonely country road?<br/><br/>
	Is there anyone who can honestly say that they haven't thought of doing something that they know to be wrong - just for the sake of it?<br/><br/>Unfortunately these ideas have been out of fashion for a long time. No one has come close to the superb horror of Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' which made a terrifying movie out of banging on the walls and a shaky staircase. Perhaps it is only 'The Blair Witch Project' that has recently attempted a minimalist approach to horror, but that film could not hope to live up to its advance hype and consequently was something of a disappointment. Fortunately 'The Others' arrived in the UK with mercifully little hype and is something of an unknown quantity.<br/><br/>'The Others' takes the staples of a traditional ghost story from the pen of M.R. James and most particularly from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw' and produces something that manages to be very familiar and at the same time wholly original. The opening is a wholly discordant voice from childhood radio 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.' <br/><br/>It is the end of 1945, the war in Europe has ground to a halt and a world where the living and the dead are intertwined is trying to recover from the devastation. A young family is trying to settle into a large old house, unsure if the soldier father is alive or dead. The opening shot follows Grace (Nichole Kidman) as she walks to answer the front door. There she finds three servants looking for positions in the rambling house. Apparently the previous household staff had got up and left the house without rhyme or reason, Grace escorts the three through the house, insisting with fragile urgency that they always remember to lock doors after them.<br/><br/>She offers to introduce her children Anne and Nicholas to the new housekeeper, Mrs. Mills. This is the first of many deeply unsettling moments. The curtains *MUST* be draw and lamps lit. Grace disappears into the children's bedroom and wakes them; what monstrous things are going to emerge? The suspense is drawn out until breaking point and then Grace reappears with two angelic looking children. not for the last time the movie throws you off your balance. The children suffer from a form of acute photosensitivity preventing them ever experiencing daylight, hence the locked doors and shuttered windows. <br/><br/>These are the simple props used to support everything that follows.<br/><br/>
People and a place on the edge of reality begin to slip into another world entirely. Doors open and close of their own accord, the protective curtains are thrown open, furniture moves, a piano plays in the middle of the night and Anne claims to have seen other people in the house. Throughout, Grace tries to reconcile events with her own deeply-held Catholicism, a terrifying construct where Hell and Purgatory are very close at hand. It is this belief that comes under attack, gradually at first, but as the movie progresses, her world begins to crumble. With control always shifting towards the increasingly sinister Mrs. Mills.<br/><br/>A slight tale to be sure, but then the best horror stories only provide a skeleton (real or metaphorical) for our own fears.<br/><br/>The house is just as much a character as the human beings that live in within; it appears to be adrift from the rest of the World. There might well be a world beyond the massive wall but equally there might be nothing at all. With the curtains constantly drawn the house is filled with a perpetual twilight, but even those times when we are able to glimpse through the windows there is precious little to see with an unchanging grey fog shrouding the autumn countryside. <br/><br/>The movie reeks of death; there is persistent question of whether father is alive or dead; the belongings of departed former occupants are covered by shroud-like dust sheets, antique photographs of unknown people (including a particularly macabre photograph album) look out from shelves, whilst the garden is covered with autumnal leaves. Mortality is a presence in the house, even the hope of an afterlife is coloured by Grace's firm belief in the fate awaiting sinners and the less penitent.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is as pale, brittle and delicate as porcelain in the role of Grace. As her grasp on the control of the house slips with ever-increasing speed, her world begins to falter and it is entirely possible that Grace will shatter under the pressure. She believes in a loving God yet he appears to shun her when she needs him most, whilst the fight against evil appears to have robbed Grace of her husband. Outwardly she tries to maintain the restrained chill expected of an upper-class woman in the 1940s, yet inwardly this is a loving mother and distraught wife, desperate for some form of emotional support.<br/><br/>The children are central to the film - there is none of the preternatural adulthood offered by Haley Joel Osment, these are very real children. Nicholas (James Bentley) is at the age where he is still<br/><br/>trusting of everyone and tied firmly to his mother, a very real innocent. Anne (Alakina Bentley) is older, just at the stage where she is starting to show independence and at an age where children are capable of very real cruelty. Much of the narrative is driven by Anne's interactions with the remainder of the cast, and Bentley proves more than adequate for the task, sometimes frighteningly adult, at other times a helpless child.<br/><br/>The servants are characters from the pages of Dickensian fiction, the slightest of the roles is Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) a disconcerting mute who clearly knows something about the house's past, but cannot, or will not let on. Eric Sykes plays Mr Tuttle the gardener and manages to cast off a long history of comedy roles to give a subtle, almost otherwordly performance. However it is Fionnula Flanaghan's Mrs Mills who provides the counterweight to Grace. She gradually unveils herself as the movie progresses, starting off as the sweet-smiling, efficient servant, but slowly transforming into the centre of power in the house; threatening, all-knowing and truly terrifying. Mrs. Mills is a worthy successor to Judith Anderson's legendary Mrs. Danvers from Daphne du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.<br/><br/>Extraordinarily, this very British movie is directed by Spanard - Alejandro Amenabar who has redefined the genre with complete mastery much like Ang Lee's take on 'Sense and Sensibility'.<br/><br/>'The Others' is an astonishingly beautifully made movie. Each scene is set and lit like an oil painting. Shadows and the darkness play just as important a role as the warm glow from oil lamps and the fires. Daylight where it is allowed to intrude is a frigid blue-white colour, bleaching life and colour from everything it touches. <br/><br/>Sound plays an important part in telling the story, there are plenty of minor chords and shrieking strings to set your nerves on edge, but it is the quiet that is the most memorable. Entire scenes are played out in near silence serving to heighten the almost unbearable tension of the latter part of the movie.<br/><br/>So is the movie scary? Undoubtedly yes, the pacing is perfect with enough false climaxes and unexpected shocks to keep even the most demanding horror fan happy. It takes its time to set up all of the pieces, but as the whole story is put into place, the screw is gradually being tightened. Situations becomes increasingly claustrophobic, Grace's nerve falters and Mrs. Mills appears to feed on her weakness - where is it leading?<br/><br/>
Fortunately the end of the story is extremely satisfying and comes quite unexpectedly. In retrospect, or on a second viewing you will see all of the clues to the solution littered through the narrative, but none are so obvious that you will put the whole thing together until the director is ready for you. <br/><br/>Oh and I didn't sit comfortably at all."

The end is excellently thought through and transforms the entire film from a shock-horror into a well crafted tale of misinterpretation and retrospective reasoning.<br/><br/>I felt the acting throughout was strong, with especial mention to Nicole Kidman, who not only commanded the English accent and demeanour of the mother brilliantly, but also gave to the audience a character whom they could follow, as we discover the truth as she does. The children were entirely convincing, and delivered their lines with the skills of someone much older and more experienced.

Her highly strung characterisation only serves to complement the sense of foreboding that flows through the film. Brilliantly, the film gives nothing away, and throws nothing at you, but leaves you to do the work - acknowledging that the viewer's imagination is far more vivid than any film-maker's art.

","`The Others' is, in essence, a typical ghost story.  Swirling mist, eerie green light and mysterious piano playing all contribute to creating an effective ambience in which the characters experience strange going-ons.<br/><br/>
Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, lives in a large isolated house on the island of Jersey in 1945.  Her two children suffer from an allergy to light, doors are kept locked and curtains drawn in Grace's attempt to protect Anne and Nicholas from the sun's rays. (As a result much of the film is in dim light and the suspense is built up with the fumbling of keys trying to get in and out of rooms.)  When three 'visitors' turn up at the house Grace receives them in and is grateful that they can now take the place of the servants who `mysteriously disappeared a few days ago'.  Unfortunately not all her problems are solved when she discovers there are 'intruders' in the house.<br/><br/>The Others is not a bad film, on the contrary, the acting is faultless, the atmosphere suitably chilling and certain touches in particular are very effective; such as Grace's frantic search for the intruders to the backdrop of her daughter's bible reading, and the beautiful image of Grace as she stands against the wrought iron gates.  The story line does, however, lack the structure and definition which have made similar films (namely The Sixth Sense) so memorable.  The film seems to waver somewhere in the middle and as it nears the end the audience are almost craving a final momentous twist.

Me and the friends that watched the film together even laughed at several scenes. I think that in a good horror film this isn´t suposed to happen.

","'The Others' is a movie that is extremely rich in atmosphere.  Kidman's character, Grace, and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a mansion that is constantly surrounded by a thick fog.  Plus, most of the movie is candle lit.  The light, and lack there of, plays a huge role in much of the movie, and creates a thick sense of tension and sometimes dread. <br/><br/>     However, no matter how good the atmosphere was, the pacing was a little awkward.  It was generally slow, sometimes bordering on being to slow, all building towards a supposedly startling conclusion.  I will admit that I thought it was decent, at least somewhat original and smart.  In a lot of ways however, it just wasn't worth it.  <br/><br/>    You could probably talk to your friends afterwards about what made you jump, what didn't, and what you thought of the ending.  All in all it was a movie that had great potential and lived up to most of it.  It was good, but I wouldn't highly recommend it.  7.5 out of 10."

","This really surprised me. When I saw ads for it I thought what a load of tripe. Another Horror movie which makes you laugh like crazy. Seen enough of those thanks. This isn't really a horror movie though either its more of a suspense thriller. And it really did keep me in suspense the whole movie through. I do think however the experience would be greatly diminished if not seen on a big screen with great sound. As far as strong points go this had lots really I thought the story was good it really was interesting and held you just in the right place to knock you over at the ending also kept you guessing the whole way through. The Atmosphere was also very good with only simple directing and not many amazing camera shots. The acting surprised me the most because I have not liked Kidman at all up to this point. She just seems so weak and pathetic normally but in this she really holds up very well and plays a very convincing paranoid mother. Finally I think this movie deserves Brownie points just for this, I hate movies where the director and the writers all conspire against you to completely obscure a truth and send you're mind of in a million different wild goose chases to find out whodunnit or whats going on only to turn around at the end and 'surprise' you and contradict all the feeling of the rest of the film just so the director can be right you can be wrong and you can't say oh well I knew that was going to happen. However in this movie there is a big twist in the end and it does sort of bend from the feeling of the rest of the movie but with a subtle twist which is very clever and innovative if not inventive. You'll have to see the movie to see what I mean though. By the way the movie is not fast but I really like slow paced movies. I pay good money to watch films and I don't expect to be whisked out of the theatre ASAP. I gave it a 9 out of 10."

","Set in Jersey at the end of World war 2 and filmed in Spain, The Others is a good old-fashioned ghost story with all the classic ingredients - tinkling pianos in deserted rooms, doors that slam themselves shut, strange whisperings and sinister servants. The film is lifted onto another level, largely due to a superb performance by Nicole Kidman, ably supported by an excellent cast.<br/><br/>Like 'The Sixth Sense', the film is deliberately slow, ponderous and very atmospheric with finely judged 'scary' moments. The twist at the end is totally unforseen and very effective, though as with the Sixth sense, it doesnt really stand up to close scrutiny. A very welcome change from the tedium of latex-filled monsters, gore and computer generated fx."
"Phoenix77","10","0","0","12 November 2001"," Nicole Kidman is having a good year
","The Others is a scary and well-executed ghost story with a great script and excellent acting. It seems that Nicole Kidman is having a great year movie-wise despite the split-up with tom cruise, putting in her best performance to date (in my opinion) in this movie. The character of Grace is complex and of a nature not often seen in movies. She is elegant yet near-hysterical at times, with a hint of mystery about her that suggests she is not what she seems, which of course she isn't. The brilliant twist at the end (which works a lot better than that of The Sixth Sense) would probably lead people to hate Grace if she wasn't played with the skill that Kidman uses.  She carries the movie and gives her character the extra layer of emotion that cannot be written in words and is the resposibility of the actor. The film has some very scary moments.  Though it is slow to start, the movie would not have worked at all with the fast pace of most horror movies which takes away all scariness.  The Others becomes downright creepy at times (ie the part with the old lady with the girl's voice, and when the servants are standing at the door to the house after the first twist) and the scary parts only come when they are needed to advance the story. Fionulla Flannigan makes a great semi-sinister nanny, with just the right amount of menace mixed in with friendly motherly qualities.<br/><br/>The children give very apt performances, particularly the girl, although the boy is occasionally grating. The Others does have a few humorous moments.  One part in which the little girl informs her mother that only children who haven't been baptised can go to limbo, is quite funny and the expression on Kidman's face is classic, as she displays the comic ability and timing that was ever-present in To Die For. Overall, The Others is definitely worth watching (a few times even) and contains some scary moments that actually make a lot of people in the audience scream aloud, and top-class performances.  I really think Kidman will get an oscar nomination for this, and Flannigan has a chance as supporting actress.  The photography was brilliant too and sacrifices flashy visuals for moody shots and ambience."

","Although""The Sixth Sense"" was a very good movie, the histrionics it generated were largely due to the performance of the child actor, and the supposedly unguessable twist.

And yet it is not as if the film needs such a performance to carry it. Everything, from the lighting, to the fluidity of the camera, and the mesmerising music, knits perfectly to a truly magnificent whole.

","I think this film was the best horror film I've seen in ages.  The performances were excellent.  All of them, were able to relay the subtleties and depth of their screen personalities to a great extent.   The set lent itself very well to a film of this nature; the spooky old mansion and the ever present fog helps to create a feeling of isolation and an out of this world quality.<br/><br/>The only thing I would say about this film is that it was a bit too similar to sixth sense and so i can see why there are so many comparisons.  It is just a shame that The Others was not released first because it is a far superior film.  Sixth Sense relies too much on that typical Hollywood over-sentimentality which, rather than make you warm to the characters more, actually makes you want them to get it.  The Others conformed less to the Hollywood stereotype, the characters were not wholly likeable but ALL had enough depth and mystery that you were really interested in finding out what happened to them so .  This also meant that the film had less need for special effects to keep the audience interested.  Also, the slow pace of the film, in my mind, actually made the film as it built up the suspense .  In that way it reminded me of blair witch.  you never actually see anything in Blair Witch but that is it's strongest point;  you are always imagining what might just be around the corner.....  I think the fear of the unknown can be very scary and these 2 films portray this to great effect.<br/><br/>I think you need to have a vivid imagination to enjoy The Others as you never actually see anything,.  If you are someone that is not affected by something until it is hitting you in the face then this film is not for you."
"bazina","9","0","0","11 November 2001"," a plea for visceral enjoyment
","Firstly, I'd just like to say I've read many of the other comments here, and I do not understand why some people feel the need to belittle the intelligence of those who enjoyed a film, when they themselves did not. Enjoyment of a film can be visceral - it gets you in the gut, your adrenaline rushes, or you may be overcome with waves of inexplicable dread or melancholy. This kind of enjoyment does not need to be intellectualised - it is felt or it isn't. Even a technically bad film can produce such affects in some members of its audience.<br/><br/>So your wife fell asleep in the film, and you were bored. Does this make you a superior being to the people who sank low in their seats, voraciously absorbing the gloomy atmosphere, and feeling our insides turn to ice water? I fell asleep once in Jean Luc Godard's 'Breathless' (however I've managed to stay awake during Tarkovsky films - no mean feat according to some). And yet that film is considered a masterpiece by many. It just didn't resonate with me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think you can tell that I loved 'The Others'. It's haunted me all weekend. I saw some things coming but resisted the temptation to 'second guess' the plot, allowing the film to reveal itself to me in its own time. The children - let's not compare them to Haley Joel Osment for that kid is a freak of nature - were pinched faced and touching, reminding me of my relationship with my own malleable younger brother when we were that age, and I could make him believe anything (hehehehe).<br/><br/>In a time when most films with a supernatural bent rely on what is seen and what horrors can be made visible through special effects, it was refreshing to find a film which relied on what was hidden. It was more about sound than vision. I'll be seeing it again, hoping to recapture some of the delicious ambivalent dread of my first viewing."

The Others was a film based in the 1940's during the war, the house is haunted by ""Intruders"", the mother (Nicole Kidman) resides with her son and daughter, the daughter often complains of seeing ""Ghosts"" in the house. The chill factor in this film is pretty low, yet one with patience must watch this film.<br/><br/>The Others is a ghost film after all, so dont expect blood and gore, if thats what your looking for...Jason, Freddy & Michael are all waiting at your local video store, this movie was scary, not frightening but the eerie camerawork and environment was enough for me. In terms of the plot, it was very well thought of, the script was fabulously written and the acting was flawless, what more could i say? This film deserves to be in the top 5 movies of this year, infact...Number ONE is a good number!<br/><br/>ACTING: The acting was fabulous in ""The Others"", infact it was Flawless, especially by Nicole Kidman, such beauty portrayed on film, also the kids did a good job, especially the young girl, delightful to watch!<br/><br/>ACTORS: Good, a few new faces in this film, but definantley not to waste, Nicole Kidman doesen't chose the best movies, but this time around she made the RIGHT choice, good range of actors, and good new-comers.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Terrific, this movie couldn't live without its great script, everything flowed in very well with the movie, the film had a dramatic twist at the end, could be predictable, but worth the wait.<br/><br/>CINEMA: Brilliant, the use of the fog effects was breathtaking, the mansion was fantastic, the use of lights was brilliant, the camera-work was top notch material! Awards must be won.<br/><br/>SUSPENSE: Quiet low unfortunantley, yet it is a ghost movie, it did have a couple of jumps, yet most of the film could be said to be ""Slow Paced"", yet the thrills actually make you jump they are very effective the moment they approach.<br/><br/>MUSIC/FX: Nice, especially during the scenes where Nicole Kidman gets tormented by the ghosts, the music was used well and the music did add to the suspence, very enjoying.<br/><br/>OVERALL: ""The Others"" is definantley better than ""Sixth Sense"", infact the Sixth Sense was way over-rated, this film is much better.

"SwingBatta","5","0","0","11 November 2001"," Sluggish ""Others"" saves its best for last
","An ambitious disappointment, ""The Others"" is one reason why I hardly take word-of-mouth from critics and viewers, positive and negative alike, into account when I go to the movies. <br/><br/>Directed by Alejandro Amenabar (and featuring an executive producer credit for Tom Cruise), this film's strong points include solid but unspectacular acting that is enhanced by the cinematography and production design that nicely enhance a foreboding, isolated English mansion and spacious surrounding grounds (which were all filmed on location in Spain), but it is overshadowed by its incredibly slow pace and thin, recycled plot (which unfortunately has led to inevitable conclusions to ""The Sixth Sense""). It is backed up by a flimsy score that descends into silliness during tense moments, thus killing their effectiveness.<br/><br/>As she should, Nicole Kidman provides the film's best performance as Grace, who, despite the insistence of her young daughter (Alakina Mann), refuses to believe that there may be ghosts inhabiting her house, where she pines away every day while waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to return home from the war.<br/><br/>She takes in three new servants - a codger (Eric Sykes), a mute (Elaine Cassidy), and a crone (Fionnula Flanagan, who, for some reason, reminded me of the maid portrayed by Hermione Baddeley in ""Mary Poppins""), after her previous help mysteriously disappears, but there is a lot more to this strange trio than she could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Mann and James Bentley, respectively, make their first big screen appearances as Anne and Nicholas, two youngsters who have a potentially fatal allergy to light - or who are ""photosensitive,"" as Grace verbalizes it - which results in an exhausting routine to make sure every door and shutter in the house is always shut and every curtain always drawn. It's a subplot that doesn't have much of an impact on the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Despite ""The Others"" being hailed for its suspense factor, all the suspense is couched into the last thirty minutes. The early scenes in which Anne insists that there are indeed supernatural visitors lurking about (in particular a little boy named Victor), which lead to Grace's eventual inspection of her surroundings, have no punch at all - save for one sequence in which Grace discovers an old photo album - because it's too predictable and...well, boring. It's something we've all seen a million times before. The music repeatedly hams up the ""scare that's not really there"" schtick, which quickly became tiresome.<br/><br/>But there's no denying the impact of the ending, which saves ""The Others"" from becoming a total disaster and what makes the needle spin on the adrenalin meter. I can't speak for everyone, of course, nor will I reveal any details, but the unexpected swerve completely dispelled anything I had theorized.<br/><br/>One thing that this film should be commended for, despite its failure in the scare department, is the fact that it succeeds for the most part in presenting a ghost story that doesn't rely on intense special effects or blood and gore (in fact, there's not one drop of the red stuff to be seen anywhere), instead relying on good old fashioned storytelling.<br/><br/>While ""The Others"" didn't work for me - and don't knock me for not understanding the plot; I grasped it plenty, thank you - it definitely will do the trick for horror/suspense fans who are sick of the ineptitude of dreck like the ""Scream"" series and who yearn for the days of good ghost stories once shared around the campfire. 6/10"

He deserves an academy award for this film. I have seen ""Open your eyes"" and also ""Thesis"". Thesis was pretty good, but I can't say the same for ""Open your eyes"". I really didn't like it that much since the story wasn't as brilliant as the others. The others is an excellent movie. You must see it if you like horror, mystery and thriller movies. I was reading some comments on it and saw that many people compared it with ""Sixth sense"". The others is much better than sixth sense. In fact I didn't like ""Sixth sense"" at all. It was so simple and wasn't scary at all. I just laughed at it. I didn't understand why it won some academy awards. I don't think it deserved them. Anyway it's not important to keep making critical remarks about it. I hope ""The others"" will win academy awards, because it really deserved them. It is amazing to see Nicole Kidman as a mother who loves her children with her whole being. She truly knows how to act. What a tremendous actress!!. I was delighted to see her a while ago in ""The portrait of a lady"". She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood. I never forget her wonderful movies. ""The portrait of a lady"" by Jane Campion is my favorite movie, She did an excellent work as Isabel Archer. It's definitely her best performance. She is always beautiful and talented. She must be an academy award winner for best actress in a leading role either in Moulin Rouge or in the others. Grace's children also acted very well. it's unbelievable that two kids could do this. ""The others"" is about a family (Grace and her children) who lives in a very big house after the war. Grace's husband went to the war, but he hasn't gone back to their house yet.  Her children are photo sensible, it means that they can't see the light day. They can't even go to the garden. It might kill them. It makes this movie a dark one. Some people go to work to that house (Mrs. Willis, the gardener and a girl who is mute). You'll know why she got mute at the ending. I bet it'll frighten you. Many odd things happen in this house. It seems that there are others who are living with them. The little girl tells her mother she has seen other in the house; However she doesn't believe her until she gets to see them. When you see this movie, you'll think you're living in that stylish, dark and big house. Anything can happen in this movie. Things are not always as they seem. Appearances can be deceiving.

The actors performances are all good, especially kidman who once again demonstrates her versatility and skill as an actress. The cinematography is excellent, bettered only by 'Traffic' this year IMHO.<br/><br/>The screenplay and plot appear to be the bones of contention amongst others. As far as I am concerned, of any movie in recent times, what the viewer gets from this movie depends a lot on their personal imagination. There are no special effects; the suggestive camerawork, the intense acting and the subtle (deliberately) slow-burning storyline are designed to allow you plenty of room to scare yourself in your own imagination. The film is a masterpiece at building tension in the audiences minds. The visuals are intelligent in this regard, and the sometimes minimalist script contributes nicely at suggesting there is more to some characters than they let on.<br/><br/>I can only assume that the people who have criticised the movie as 'drab' and 'slow-moving' are the kind of people with minimal attention span and inactive imaginations who don't enjoy reading books for much the same reasons that they dislike the movie.<br/><br/>In my book, the best tension-builder since The Shining."

While I fawned over last nights offering 'Moulin Rouge', I have to say that this left me feeling a little cheated. 'The Sixth Sense' had reminded us to think about a film while it's showing rather than after it has finished, or you may miss something important. This comes too soon after that wonderful film. The outcome too obvious and one too many ends not tied up evenly enough for my liking. Excellent performances from most though the children (bless them) were not up to anything like scratch, especially after seeing the likes of Haley Joel Osment at work. Jersey - 1945. Two sickly children and their mother are holed up in a mansion,  never seeing the light of day due to a rare light sensitive condition. The husband had failed to return home from the war, though he does make a cursory appearance later on. It seems that they (and the servants) are not alone in the house. The eponymous 'Others' are visiting them. Much roaming about in the dark ensues and there is much made of locking doors and things that go bump in the night. Needless to say, in an effort to match the previously mentioned Shalaman picture, there is a surprise at the end. It may have stood in greater standing if it didn't if the truth be known. The audience is expecting a twist these days and these people should know this and not make the surprise so darned obvious.

See it again to appreciate what the screenwriter and director are trying to say. As for Nicole, the kids, servants and her husband...they did their part...you just might not get it the first time!

","Having read comments by other subscribers, I can only assume they're relatives of the cast trying to drum up business because,in my opinion it's athird rate melodrama! It uses every known cliche of so-called ""spooky"" films including gloomy old house surrounded by fog,a cemetery in the front garden (which no-one appears to have noticed), pianos that play themselves and doom-laden servants - including Eric Sykes who could not be taken seriously in this type of part by anyone in the UK - a masterpiece of miscasting! Frightening it was not, relying on a few loud noises for a ""jump"" factor and even these corny effects failed to keep my wife awake as she dozed off halfway through the film! As to the so-called shock ending, well this became patently obvious long before then and whilst the cast made the best of the trite dialogue it still rates as a turkey that barely justifies it's ""12"" certificate."

","This really is a good old-fashioned ghost story. It dosen't use special effects to scare (using visuals to scare dosen't work usually anyway) this uses atmosphere. For instance creaking doors etc, maybe your saying to yourself thats not scary thats a clice. But if you do think that way I would still think you would like this- no electricity, no phones, no radios. This is a deep and haunting tale. Nicole Kidman gives a tour-de-force performence. While the childern Alakina Mann as Anne and James Bentley as Nicholas give truly excellent performences- but theey're still not as good as Haley Joel Osment. All the cast are good really. Now the flaw many will have is its resemblence to another film I won't tell you what film- but really I over-looked that because I don't think the writer Alejandro Amenabar set out to steal from the other film. I highly reccomend you to get to your cinema to see this, if you haven't already you don't know what your missing out on. **** out of five."

","What a brilliant film. I was impressed from beginning to end.<br/><br/> All the characters built up the suspense brilliantly, with their constant shifts from hateable to likeable or vice versa. I didn't think any of the characters were out of place. All of them fitted into the plot perfectly.<br/><br/> Nicole Kidman is a very under rated actress. Her performance as Grace was wonderful and she bought out the whole atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/> I don't just want to praise Nicole though, the child actors gave a solid performance that was believable and spine chilling.  Every other actor involved was very convincing and Eric Sykes was an unexpected bonus to the cast list.<br/><br/> The film itself is well written and beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar. The story is interesting and the 1945 setting is an interesting choice. It will make you jump a few times, but along with the rest of the audience you'll nervously laugh it off.<br/><br/> A fact I noticed was that there was barely any special effects. Frankly the film would have been ruined if special effects had been put in.<br/><br/>I respect a film that relies mostly on acting ability and plot to build up atmosphere and horror rather than having someone hack a limb off someone else just to frighten you.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers below<br/><br/> I won't give away to much of the ending (because I hate people who do) apart from to say it is unexpected and leaves you guessing right up until the final 5 minutes.<br/><br/> End of spoilers<br/><br/> Finally just to say If you're hesitating about going to see it go and see it anyway you'll probably love it.<br/><br/> 8/10"

The key elements: no gore, minimal special effects, twisty plots, pervading atmosphere of foreboding, scary young children.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is a bit of a weird hermit whose kids are allergic to light. She's not a terribly nice lady: she seems to enjoy locking her kids in the dark all day and scaring them with stories about hell, purgatory and limbo. She's also done something quite nasty - something we don't find out the truth about until the very end of the film. Her kids are allergic to light, so naturally they are very pale skinned and a little bit disturbed - particularly the girl, who seems nice enough, but has a strange tendency to turn into an old woman from time to time.<br/><br/>Into their cosy little world come three strangers, who may or may not be the ""others"" of the title. They seem nice enough, but they have a strange tendency to cover all the gravestones in the garden with leaves and wander around looking shifty.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because there's not much of it anyway, and what plot there is would be spoiler material if I posted it here. Most of the movie is given over to building the creepy atmosphere and setting up the denoument. If all this makes the movie sound dull, sorry - it's certainly not dull.

","This has to be the most entertaining movie i have possibly watched at the cinema. This and 'Saving Private Ryan'. The Others I can assure will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The suspense is excellent almost straining on your senses to just give you that big scare that you actually want. The jist of the plot is fairly straight forward but the film itself is truly out of this world.<br/><br/> Nicole Kidman is a mother of two living in a huge but pretty much scary house who is waiting for her husband to return from war. Her children have some sort of condition where they cannot be exposed to direct sunlight which can harm and possibly kill them. Therefore for the majority of the film they have to stay in dark rooms with candles as the only light source almost living like vampires.<br/><br/> The candles in the house only add to the intensity of most of the scary scenes eg. was that shadow moving something or was it just a shadow flikering from the candle. These questions you cant help but ask your self throughout the film. Even during the day you cant escape from the scary atmosphere with the curtains pulled in every room and the lingering fog which never lets up.<br/><br/> On the whole this film is fantastic. it's not just an excellent horror film it's an excellent film. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and is a very sexy women and her kids do there job especialy the small girl who was the better of the two also the the actress from 'Waking Ned' Mrs Flanangan was also great.<br/><br/> On a whole again this film you should watch.

As such, the quality of shocks and tension on offer has similarities with the original version of 'The Haunting' (rather than the inferior Catherine Zeta Jones remake.)<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is Grace who lives in a mansion in the middle of now where with her two children who suffer from a rare photosensitive skin allergy which means the house has to be kept in near darkness most of the time. When three new servants appear out of the fog one day saying they have answered an advertisement. But did they?  Things take a turn for the weird when one of the children starts seeing ghostly figures in the house, doors close on their own and pianos start playing themselves.<br/><br/>The tension is cranked up slowly and the fact that this is a house where the curtains are closed all the time adds to the atmosphere.

The kids are pale with dark hair.

","'The Others' is a strange sort of film. It's neither good nor bad, and, oddly, I can't say 'it could have been much better' (as with many other movies) as I doubt if it could, given the subject matter and the enclosed arena, in which all of the film is set. I know nothing about the story's background, but it is very theatrical, so maybe it started life as a play(?) It's one of those films whereby you can't say too much about it, for fear of spoiling it for the others, but suffice to say it is a ghost story, and, although it contains no sex, violence or expletives, definitely merits the '12' certificate. With the ghostly ingredients of a spooky house, two frightened children and a quirky performance from Nicole Kidman, I expected to enjoy this so much more than I did. I think the main problem is that the story has no real 'middle'. It starts and finishes adequately but drags in the middle, and, as I said, I doubt if, with the subject matter, this could have been improved upon. Overall, middling entertainment."

She's beautiful as the mother and she has not disappointed with her performance.  I saw this film after I had seen Moulin Rouge and so I carried a certain level of expectation of her here.  She was certainly impressive there and just as much here.  I didn't really notice her at all previously; I kind of remember her in Batman but there was really not much there to remember anyway.

Please see the face of Fionnula Flanagan: she's obviously thinking on another things (the true secret of the others and themselves) when she talks. Also, is the daughter telling the truth or a lie? This film doesn't tell a story like another films do. This film is giving us information about the past life of the characters from the beginning to the end. It's a discovery movie. It has got the most perfect scares I've seen in a movie in years. It's full of suspense too. Amenábar is a very clever guy. And the best of all: he's young!, he can do a lot of masterpieces like this in the following decades. We the Spanish are very proud of him.<br/><br/>The end is not only original, is wonderful too, plenty of humanity. I've cried with the final family hug, when they find all out. It's a very beautiful story about a family. Can you see? Crying in a scary movie! Because of that this is a very different film. Finally, the cast is simply perfect. Can a woman be so beautiful? (I'm talking about Nicole Kidman). Can a laugh be so innocent and frightening? (I'm talking about the daughter).

","I walked into The Others not expecting much. Most 'ghost stories' today are just bloody messes with no real plot, nothing to keep you interested. I constantly find myself looking around the theater to see if anyone else is as bored or disgusted as I am. Not The Others. First let me say, I am a huge fan of literary ghost stories, well done, frightening tales that don't use blood or gore or any other media than written word and your own imagination to scare you. I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was amazing, the plot very well thought out, and remained true to what I consider real Suspense. This film proves you don't have to be a bloody gore-fest or a plot-less, mindless killer-kills-all-girl's-friends-in-really-bloody-ways-for-no-real-reason. No suspense, no intrigue, no thought needed the only thing that scares people in those films is the gore, not the story. The Others really takes you into it, I forgot completely I was in a cinema, and was completely engrossed. Having read, as I said, a great many 'suspense/horror' novels I kept mentally trying to see where the story would go, but while I did guess a few things, I could not guess it all and was thrilled beyond words by the cleverness of the tale by the end. I was truly held in thrall every moment waiting to see what would happen next and was blissful with the style it was carried out in when I left the theater. I cant say enough good about this movie. Nicole Kidman (who I thought was amazing in Malice and Moulin Rouge, and Far and Away) really astounded me. Her performance was stupendous. I dislike Tom Cruise as an actor and a person, and I don't want to give him any credit for this fantastic tale, especially since he was just one of 9 producers and they really don't do much but pony up some cash, so give the credit where it is due, the actors (especially Ms Kidman), and the writer and director, Alejandro Amenábar. A truly worthy tale of suspense and intrigue that Rod Serling, Shirley Jackson, and Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of."

","After suffering through two of the worst films ever made that fall into the same subgenre as The Others (if you had to guess, its The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill- the remakes) I was definitely starved for a subtle and spooky ghost story. So, why didn't I like The Others? It had a good cast, great set, a whole lotta fog. I guess what it really lacked was a feature length story. Not much actually happens in this film, simply because the story could have been told as a high brow episode of Tales from the Crypt. Too many of the shocks turn out to be nothing, simply because the movie is just dragging you along to its twist ending, and has to spend at least an hour and a half getting you there. Another detraction to the film is the characters. Not the performances mind you, just the characters being portrayed. As a filmgoer I do not demand moral, pure or saintly protagonists, just ones who I do not wish to throttle every time they speak, or don't speak in the case of one character. The lady of the household is a fussy witch. Her children are just a mild step up from brat. The servants are so docile and old they might as well be dead. I guess the servants were alright. For those in the mood for a quiet and haunting cinema experience, The Others may be just what they need. Me? I'm still looking. 5/10."

","It's almost impossible to discuss The Others without bringing up 1999's already classic ghost thriller The Sixth Sense.  Both are films that move deliberately slow, drawing in the audience with a fine eye for details and no special effects, creating a brooding atmosphere and getting frights from suggestion and small effects.  Still, Amenabar's The Others goes even further with his minimalist style, constructing a film that becomes increasingly creepy with the slightest sound effect or plot point.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, in a bravura, chilling performance, stars as Grace, mother to two children with a rare disease that makes exposure to sunlight deadly. She lives in a mansion on an island, fog smothering their secluded existence, when one day three servants come looking for work. She hires them, and suddenly strange noises and occurences start descending on the house. Slowly, it becomes evident that they are not alone when her daughter begins to describe her experiences with a mysterious ghost boy named Victor.<br/><br/>The Others is an elegantly mounted film, and Amenabar succeeds in building an uneasy tension with striking cinematography that makes the light and darkness seem to come alive, as if it were a character in itself.  At times, the look and feel of it seems more like a macabre Merchant-Ivory production than a haunted house movie. Amenabar's pacing is perfect; it's refreshing to see a summer movie that slowly and confidently ups the ante to the point where the audience doesn't know where the story is going to go. When the film finally reaches it's end, its quite a spine-tingling climax.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Rarely have I been so impressed with a movie's wry, knowing, and uncanny ability to produce a story of such wry, intellectual, spiritual, and haunting power.  There is much and many things going on in this flick- and it will surely tapped for a few Oscars, especially Cinematography, Set Design (check out those props and chairs and house lights- they're the real 40s stuff!), and even perhaps Best Original Screenplay.  On an even more impressive note is the emotional scope and raw energy with which Nicole imbues her portayal of Grace, as well as the uncannily adult and responsive acting ability shown by the supporting characters. (Check out those child actors!  what are they, adults in kid suits?  I've never seen anything like it!  Haley Joel doesn't hold a candle to these kids' ability)<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Let me first start off by addressing some of this film's many themes.  The whole idea of Nicole having to ""lock"" each individual room's door when entering and exiting creates the whole idea of barrier and isolation, as well as emotional barrenness.<br/><br/>The whole idea of ""lighting"" takes on a surreal effect in this film, not only in its importance to Nicole's children and the exquisite, special cinematography to be found here, but also in the creation myth that begins the film and the idea of ""light"" and ""darkness"", of ""other"" and ""us"".<br/><br/>Exquisite is a hard word not to use when writing about this one.  It's the real thing- ""The Others"" is a movie at once brilliant without drifting into the land of the quasi-pretentious, as Memento has a tendency to do, (being so ""smart"" that it's oftentimes impossible to follow and understand).  ""The Others"" is at last an emotional look of the bonds of a three-membered family, of human interaction, of spiritual explanation of death and the paranormal, and a wry inquest into what ""ghosts"" in of themselves have to say about us the living, us the dead, or, as this film may have us believe, the very thin lines that separates the two.<br/><br/>All in all, will definitely garner some Oscar recognition, as I stated before, and even (who knows?) get Nicole that Best Actress nod she's deserved for some time now."

","Nicole Kidman stars as a single mother of two, left alone in a large mansion as her husband goes off to war.  Their home is completely isolated and it is constantly smothered in fog.  To make matters worse, their home has no electricity, and her children are deathly allergic to sunlight.  In the first five minutes, this movie had all its ducks in a row, to create a chilling thriller.  It could have been so good, but writer/director Alejandro Amenabar failed to turn this wonderfully eerie setting into a scary movie.  It was like the haunted house that looks creepy and scary from the outside, but has nothing frightening once you get inside.<br/><br/>Early on in the movie three strangers approach the house seeking work. Grace(Kidman) welcomes them in to work, commenting that her previous staff had recently disappeared.  Immediately we are aware that there is more to these three than we are being told. Grace's daughter Anne has seen people in her house that nobody else can see. Are there ghosts?  Or does an simply have an active childish imagination? The remainder of the movie seeks to answer these questions, with Kidman's character seeming to lose more and more of her sanity along the way.<br/><br/>There are a few very excellent qualities about this movie, the first being the previously addressed setting.  Also there are very strong performances throughout this movie, which is extremely important sice the movie revolves around a very small cast.  Firstly, I am not normally a Nicole Kidman fan, and so to say that she was fine, is to say that she did not annoy me.  That is quite a compliment in itself.  Secondly, her children are wonderful. Particularly Alakina Mann in the role of Kidman's young daughter.  There were scenes between her and Kidman that I thought that she completely stole. Finally, Fionnula Flanagan as the elderly maid Mrs. Mills held this movie together.  Every time I got bored and disinterested, she would come on the screen and renew my interest.  I know that these are not familiar actors, but they were wonderful with what they had.  The problem was that they had very little.  This movie plods along with nothing really happening.<br/><br/>The one other very strong quality this movie offers, is the final ten minutes.  These final minutes are wonderful and priceless.  I only wish that all of the writing leading up to it had been as interesting.  Unfortunately I can not recommend sitting bored for 120 minutes, only to enjoy 10 of them. If that ratio is fine with you, then enjoy those last ten minutes.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a movie with much promise, much potential, but sadly lacking in substance.  Thrillers must either create tension, or scares, and there are too few of either one for me to recommend this movie.  Wait until it's out on video and then you can fast forward as necessary.

If you don't particularly enjoy Nicole Kidman, it will damage your enjoyment of the film as she is in almost every frame, looking like a Hitchcockian version of Grace Kelly -- LIke the filmmakers weren't aware:  her character's name is Grace.

","""The Others"" sets with the right intentions, to make a classic horror flick, but gets lost in a fog somewhere along the way. <br/><br/>This film had the potential to be of a quality and scare caliber not seen since Kubrick's ""The Shining"" but it veered way off target. The scares were few and far between and it took entirely too long to build up to the few scares that were in the film. In fact the audience was visibly restless, waiting for something substantial to occur until well into the film. The fact that the film looses its grip on the audience is the only reason more people didn't get the poorly hidden surprises before they were explicitly spelled out. <br/><br/>The overall concept is an extremely good one, its just not translated well into the script. The direction was a high point, brilliantly contrasting light and dark and harkening back to an older era of film-makers. If you're going to see this film make sure to drink lot's of caffeine, and lower the bar on your expectations."

","Is this Nicole Kidman's year or what? First she stars in the dazzling, cinematic spectacle that is ""Moulin Rouge"". Then she takes a turn and releases the ""The Sixth Sense"" for summer 2001, ""The Others"".<br/><br/>""The Others"" takes place in 1945. Grace (Nicole Kidman), a widow and single-mother, lives in a secluded home with her two children, Anne (Alakia Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). She is forced to live in darkness, for her children have a severe allergy that causes them to break out and blister when exposed to mass amounts of light. All is going well, but soon, Grace begins to learn the she, her children, and her servants are not alone in her house. Grace becomes determined to find out who the intruders are...and drive them out to regain her home.<br/><br/>This movie was just beautiful. The story was sharp and original. It wasn't just some cliche`d haunted house movie with spooky sounds and bumps and creaks in dark rooms, with boring ghosts that you seen any old day. The story used the idea of the haunted house, and twisted the story to make ""The Others"" into an original, creative, and new telling of the famous tale. This practice of taking and creating is what made ""The Sixth Sense"" so remarkable, and therefore makes this movie great as well.<br/><br/>The acting was just as great. Not only is this Nicole Kidman's year for her movies, but for her acting as well. She has managed to give Oscar-caliber performance in two movies for this year alone. She convincingly plays the strict but caring mother, who is torn between the logic of the beliefs she grew up on and the apparent happenings in her house. You almost forget that she is acting. Alakia Mann and James Bently also deliver key performances as well. In fact, there wasn't one cast member that let me down.<br/><br/>""The Others"" was also cinematically beautiful. The dark tones on the movie set the perfect mood for this movie's theme, giving regular scenes the right amount of light and sinister scenes the deserved amount of darkness and horror. The camera angling and positions also wonderfully gave the ""oomph"" needed to make the scenes be seen in the proper mood.<br/><br/>A well-crafted dramatic thriller, ""The Others"" is a must-see for thriller-lovers and movie-lovers alike. While not quite up to ""The Sixth Sense""'s calibur, the movie is still a must-see.<br/><br/>9/10, A-"

    Pros- A very scary and mostly fun thrill ride through a haunted house. Decent performances, by a good cast; and an interesting, somewhat original story-line help the movie. The ending is also very creative.<br/><br/>    Cons- Some performances are weak. The story is VERY complicated and confusing at brief points. A little disturbing in some areas. The setting is god-awful, which really makes the stroy less interesting.<br/><br/>    Bottom Line- A fairly good horror film with a decent cast and some spine-tingling sequences.

You could watch the sixth sense and skip the ending and still enjoy the movie because of its plotline. The ending is just the kicker that makes you want to see it again.<br/><br/>Like UNBREAKABLE though, THE OTHERS has very little plot. It spends the entire movie with a setup for a ""surprise"" ending (which is not very surprising). Without the ending, the movie just states facts about its characters and the situations they are in (not what they are doing).<br/><br/>This would have been better suited for a short (like a TALES FROM THE CRYPT type story). Stretched over the course of 2 hours, it is very thin. There are also some ""plot holes"" which took of a point for me.

","This movie knocked the wind out of me. I was GLUED to the screen and could not look away and that's a feat in itself. It seemed to zip by and felt like only 30 minutes. In fact, I didn't want it to end. I am a big movie critic and 98% of the movies made in the past few years are trash, dumb, and a waste of time. It's wonderful to see that there still are a few chair-gripping, CEREBRAL (to the dense, ""cerebral"" means ""boring""), good scripts out there.  Another good thing is that ACTING involves facial expressions, eye expressions and (heaven forbid) emotions instead of blood, gore, and cursing, flying around amid shallow car chases set to bombastic and robotic ""music"" that is used to overwhelm and distract the viewer from the lack of script and acting abilities.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is a fantastic find. Nicole Kidman is excellent in this. I never gave her much of a chance before, but now see that she is very talented. Julia Roberts couldn't have pulled this off. Nicole's expressions and eyes screamed volumes as she made me feel what the character felt without having to say a word. The children's performances were some of the best I have seen by kids. The other three main characters were perfect as well! They kept me guessing!<br/><br/>I find most movies completely predictable and the soundtracks to be overblown and distracting. That is not the case with this one. I loved the quiet moments that were used to build up the suspense and to allow the viewer's mind to race with ideas---------something that has been sorely missing from films for years. The music ENHANCED the movie!! What a nice change that is! It was perfect and added mystery, eeriness and helped solidify the aura and tone of the film, instead of banging you over the head and being annoying and obnoxious.<br/><br/>""The Others"" has terrific acting, a wonderful story line, an enhancing soundtrack, is full of feelings, emotion and fear.

As long as this movie is a ripoff of Shimalayan's great movie i bet Shimalayan himself had some big influences....

She acts like a real diva and she is pregnant with the seed of GOOD acting. She is the attraction of this movie, she captures attention and gives her feelings to the audience, literally.

Basically, it gets you hooked, without giving away key elements of the story.<br/><br/>However, in the era of media, The Others falls flat. It was hyped as ""The Sixth Sense of 2001"" or ""with a twist ending that will make you want more."", etc...<br/><br/>In truth The Others is an interesting movie because instead of being a total horror movie, thriller, detective story, or period piece, it instead borrows elements from spine-tingling horror thrillers and constructs a fable about a lapse/period of time where familial strength and the elements that can pull them apart are in the shadows for us, the detectives, to dicipher.<br/><br/>Yet, Alejandro Amenábar does not just borrow the ""surprise ending"" from elements of past thrillers and chillers, instead it is a blatent rip-off of the theme of the 1995 movie ""Haunted"".<br/><br/>The Others is destined to get more press than ""Haunted"" ever did (except for Kate Beckensale fans)and ""Hauted"" is probably a movie that will sit dormant at rental stores for 90% of the year. ""Haunted"" really isn't a better movie, but it had the original shock of finding out that the people you thought were real, were really the ghosts and that the others were actually real people invading the ghost world in varying degrees.<br/><br/>While The Others does not take the entire ending of ""Haunted"" (i.e. there is no fire and no living to dead marriage proposal), the thematic elements are there and for me at-least the media droped the hint of the ending.<br/><br/>After hearing that there was a huge ""twist ending"", I thought, there is no way that then ending of ""Haunted"" would be used, that would be a cool idea, but a cop-out.

Take ""The Innocents"" (1961) mix with ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) and add a drop of ""The Night Has Eyes"" (1942), and you have ""The Others"". Much of this film is derivative -- the religion-obsessed maternal figure, the sheltered young brother and sister, and the oh-so-accommodating hired help all set in a nice spooky old house perpetually surrounded by an eternal fog.

","I have seen this film three times with a total of 9 different friends.  Out of the 10 of us, only one person didn't get completely frightened out of his wits, but every other person I saw it with couldn't stop talking about the film after we saw it.  We couldn't stop thinking about the film after it was over.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is a difficult film to describe but not give away.  For this reason, READ AS LITTLE OF ANY REVIEW AS POSSIBLE.  I will attempt to keep this review concise and spoiler free.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a mother who has been left alone with her two children after a mysterious event that forced her house maintenance workers and daycare helpers away from the house.  Alakina Mann and James Bentley play Nicole Kidman's children Anne and Nicholas.  The brother and sister are apparently unable to leave the house due to a mysterious skin condition. This is all of the plot that is fair to give away before seeing the film.<br/><br/>The film is obviously a labor of love for director/writer/composer Alejandro Amenabar, and never have I remembered seeing a film that the screenwriter had such malicious fun writing.  There is a great amount of mischievous glee in seeing Grace reveal the rules of the house, the other characters revealing what they know about the house's secret, and in Amenabar slowly turning the screws of terror with his masterful compositions of visual cues and sound effects.  The first time seeing the film is one of the most terrifying film experiences I've had in my life.  There is just so much here to get worked up over.  Even as Amenabar turns up his orchestral hits, its evident he's not doing it just to get a scare out of the audience.  Each scene has one character in the middle of the scares who is in absolute terror, and the music represents his/her fright at that moment.<br/><br/>So, the film has about a dozen little scares, about 2 or 3 real big ones, and a general undying creepiness that lasts throughout the entire film. Happily, there are also a few laughs and loving moments thrown in so it isn't a completely dark experience.  There is also a strong intelligence and development of themes in the entire film, giving it a true importance, allowing for endless thought and discussion about the film.  The film asks difficult and meaningful questions about conditional/unconditional love, religion, and the nature of existence.  Of course, during the first viewing, none of this will go through your mind as you will be scared out of your wits.  Any question you are likely to have the first time will relate to ""What the @#%& is in that house?"", so the other themes will likely enter your mind after the film and during subsequent viewings.<br/><br/>Also, the film's three lead performances rank as the best performances I've seen this year from any film.  Nicole Kidman is outstanding as Grace and I would rank this as the best performance so far this year, perhaps tied with Haley Joel Osment's performance in ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"".  Alakina Mann and James Bentley also give exquisite performances, and, after Osment's last performance, I would say they give the best English-speaking child performances I've ever seen.<br/><br/>In summary, I would say that ""The Others"" ranks as one of the few films this year that could be deemed ""unmissable"".  It is a eerily beautiful film that releases its nuances slowly, during the course of its plot and also over subsequent viewings.  I've also never been as scared during a film as I was in ""The Others"", and every audience I have seen it with couldn't help but randomly scream and jump during every part of the film.  The more I analyze the film, the more I am in awe of its technical wizardry.  The film is so dense and complex that it is worth more thought and discussion than the typical horror film, or even the typical Hollywood drama.<br/><br/>While I haven't mentioned it yet, I believe that Amenabar's motive for making this film was the same reason Baz Luhrmann made ""Moulin Rouge!"". This film was meant to be an ode to the ghost-story film, taking every piece possible from every well known ghost film and fashioning a very thoughtful puzzle of artwork out of the pieces.  The film is a movie lover's tribute to ghost stories.<br/><br/>This is a truly wonderful film experience.  I give it **** (out of 4)."
"bacoby13","10","0","0","15 September 2001"," Not as familiar as some would think.
","The beautiful thing about this movie is its slow pacing. Most would write it off as boring, but to many, the pacing only adds to the tension. ""The Others"" is a slow-paced thriller that offers some familiar territory, but if one re-examines, realizes the differences are abound.<br/><br/>First off, Nicole Kidman's performance is dead-on perfect. She enchants, much in the same way as earlier this year with ""Moulin Rouge"". She is one of the greats as far as actress go, and this movie displays her at her best.<br/><br/>The story is confusing, but rightly so. So many unanswered questions that leave you wondering where this movie will go. Although sometimes it is a little obvious, the way they are presented never fails to surprise.<br/><br/>
Another bright point of this film is the mood. While most thrillers/horror movies rely on the dark to frighten, this movie uses light. This is due to the conditions of the children, where they are sensitive to light. There are many particularly frightning scenes in which a spot of sunlight sends chills down our spines. The film has a noir-ish look to it, and at some points, almost looks black and white. <br/><br/>The twist in the end is what turns most off. But, to those who ponder it, they will walk away satisfied. At first you may think your experiencing deja vu, but relax. Its a lot more clever than you think.  <br/><br/>I've never been to a film that had the audience so attached to their seats, screaming and laughing at the same time. This is a rare gem in a particularly drab summer. See for yourself why this movie is so fantastic. 9/10"
"claudinev","10","0","0","14 September 2001"," A chilling and unique experience
","I have always been an avid fan of horror films but despite of this, I still can decipher which are the good ones and which are the bad ones. Personally, this is one of the good ones.  I extremely loved this film! It's story is truly original, one that you thought you knew how the story goes, and then suddenly you find out that your wrong.  And then from there you think you know how the story goes, and then BOOM, you're wrong again. This is one of the things you don't expect in a horror film.  In most horror movies, you expect to be scared from right to left with the bombardment of visual effects, scaring you with what is on the surface.  Werewolves, vampires, witches, ghouls, or ghosts and the looks of them and how they mingle with characters in a film are mostly what keeps a horror film going. But this one had an added element, a good twist!  The twist of the story line is very good.  It came rather unexpected and surprising which made this film worth seeing.<br/><br/>It is also because of this, that personally, I believe why The Sixth Sense was such a success. Something new and something that wasn't just merely a kid who saw dead people.  We've seen a lot of films where people can see dead people and that somehow they find out that they need to help the spirits of these dead people.  But personally, I think what made this movie good was something that no one was expecting, the nature of the character Bruce Willis played.  But between the two films, I liked The Others more in that I never guessed the outcome.  In The Sixth Sense, I've had friends who said that somehow they got the twist of the movie, but with The Others, they, including me, didn't.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film and I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed with the performances of Nicole Kidman, Alakina Mann, James Bentley and the rest of the cast.  The spooky backdrop, the sombre costumes, terrific performances and the great twist made watching this movie a chilling and unique experience."

","This movie appears to be one of those that you will either love or hate. Generally I think you might love it if you thought that the original The Haunting (1963) is one of the scariest films ever made while the remake (1999) is one of the worst films every made.  You might like this film if you are bored with all of the gimmicky variations on slasher horror films. You might like this film if you liked The Innocents (1961).  You might like the film if you like a slow well-structured plot rather than a thrill-a-minute ride.<br/><br/>You might strongly dislike this film if you thought that any of the above or Unbreakable and 6th Sense were booring in comparison. <br/><br/>
The Others is old-style psychological gothic horror with a twist. Beautifully directed, beautifully acted.  No stupid men in rubber masks jumping out with big knives."

","I just saw ""The Others"" last night, and I must say that although I found hints in the movie that reminded me of at least three other movies I've seen within the past thirteen years, I feel ""The Others"" can stand on its own, mainly because it brings something new to the table of films of its ilk. Alejandro Amenabar should be commended and hailed as the next Alfred Hitchcock, because he was able to direct a suspense thriller without any gore.  This film works on the mind, and does its job brilliantly.<br/><br/>Special kudos to Nicole Kidman and her supporting cast, Mr. Amenabar's effective score, the cinematography, sound editing, costumes, and sets.  And just when I thought I had everything figured out, more details came to the surface to jolt me some more!  In a year of woefully substandard movies so far, ""The Others"" stands out as a film of intelligence and real chills without flashy special effects.  It is a return to solid storytelling, intriguing characters, and the mark of genius, in that it transported me to another time and place and involved me so much, that I thought I was part of the story.  For a few moments, I was able to forget the problems of the real world, as I got lost in the world of ""The Others.""  Go see it with an open mind...you'll get lost, too."
"baseballfanjm","10","0","0","13 September 2001"," A Brilliant Movie
","""The Others"" is all around a superb film that I loved. I've seen many complaints that the movie's plot is too slow. However, the way the movie is made you simply can't rush it along or it just wouldn't work. It isn't a slashing gorefest without much plot that needs to have nonstop action and violence but rather a subtle film that focuses on the fear of silence and what you can't see. The film never jumps out at you but rather maintains a frightening atmosphere throughout the entire movie. The acting in ""The Others"" is excellent all around. Nicole Kidman truly shines in her role as a mother of two sick children who hasn't seen her husband since he went to war. She grabs your attention as soon as she appears on screen and never loosens her grasp. She deserves an Oscar nomination. Heck, I'd even say she deserves the Oscar. The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially the children who are very realistic as a brother and sister.  Everything else about ""The Others"" is excellent as well. The cinematography, score, screenplay, and direction all range from very good to Oscar worthy. So all in all, don't listen to the film's detractors and see ""The Others"" for yourself. And if you are among those who say it is to slow, watch it again try to see why it can't be rushed. I give it 10/10"

","Alejandro Amenábar has created another masterpiece of film. ""The Others"" is an incredible production with everything that a film needs: brilliant story, incredible creepy atmosphere, brilliant recreation of the '40s and outstanding performances of Nicole Kidman and the rest of the crew.<br/><br/>I didn't find the film slow at all. I went to the theater thinking of what I heard from lots of people: ""The film is good, but it's incredibly slooooooow"". But in my opinion, ""The Others"" needs a deep atmosphere, with dark scenarios and only with candle lights. That's how Alejandro Amenábar has included the tension that keeps you frightened from the start till the end of the film.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is incredible (in all the meanings ^_^). She performs her character (Grace) with a lot of credibility. Also the two children, specially Alakina Mann, do incredible performances.<br/><br/>A thing that surprised me is that there's no blood on the film. At any time. We don't find terror movies without blood&guts these days. Also, there're no CGI or modern special effects in ""The Others"", a thing that must remind us that the special effects are an addition to a film, not the main event of the production.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD:<br/><br/>""The Others"" is pretty close to ""The Sixth Sense"" in different points. The plot is quite similar and the end too. Also the kind of atmosphere is really similar to Shyamalan's film. Even though, I'm not saying ""The Others"" is not original.

","I see dead people? Yes, I did; No, I didn't!  Indeed, this movie is incredibly spooky.  Two thumbs up for Alejandro Amenabar.  He has crafted a great script to direct on screen.  This is a great thriller that combines intelligence with fear in an incredible cinematic style.  Everything about this movie has a haunting, yet elegant, quality.  No cheap shocker, insulting joke, or crudity to make this thriller a success. Neither a male doppelganger nor a chick flick!  Simply a schematic flick filled with eeriness! And I love it. And it's confronting the very dark side of human nature in the midst of frustration and insecurities. The cast of talented actors allows each of their roles to intertwine perfectly with each other to build up the suspense and creeps.  Refreshing! In a sense, this is `The Haunting' cradled with the Hitchcockian terror and apparitions and it has the usual cool, icy blonde! No kidding! Nicole Kidman has performed well to sustain the viewer's mind consistently on a wild goose chase!  She wrangles up beauty, charm and spirit and angst. But her hoity-toity and condescending Grace character sends chill right down my spine. Fionnula Flanagan's performance is equally phenomenal. Troubled relationships, anger, mistrust, deceit, spirituality and mood-swings to add to the intense drama within the confinement of an isolated and austere mansion!  It's simply impossible to allow any of the characters to slip out of one's sight. Watch them carefully and they become very part of your being! Even the Vals Opus background score supports a sense of mystery and hidden violence."

But it's because time has really stopped. I won't do any spoiler about the film, but all the ""slowness"" that people find is the way to show how is Grace suffering, you have to live with her every second of agony. The film is superbly elegant, and this ""slowlyness"" is a important part of it.<br/><br/> I really think that the only mistake is the trailer, it's trying to sell a horror movie, and it's really not. It makes you jump a couple of times, but it is not so scary. It's by far a drama, with a suspense atmosphere. And it's great.<br/><br/> And about the final, it's by far the better I've seen in years. Predictable or not, I won't complain on that, because there are SO many clues all about the film. And it's not like the Sixth Sense, its simply the other point of view!

For example, I think the husband's visit could have been longer, and his reactions more telling of his VERY mixed emotions re: his wife and her horrific misdeeds, not to mention more on his own confusion of how/why he suddenly appeared there.

","There is no way you can walk out of a theater where you've just seen ""The Others"" without making an association with the simply brilliant ""Sixth Sense"". That's the first connection you make: Others-Sense.Soon enough, however(and thank God)you decide to go deeper into that primal thought and you realize the wide gap between the two movies. Indeed, ""The Others"" is a movie of medium if not high quality, but the images, thoughts, and feelings Shyamalan and his cast create are on a far greater level. ""The Others"" might have been more than just a fresh breath of air in a summer full of ""chokers""(excluding a few truly good flicks), but it lacked four basic elements that made ""The Sixth Sense"" a classic: the cast, the suspense, the idea, and most of all- the timing.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is not a bad actress, but she can never achieve the impact Jodie Foster(think of Clarice Starling in 1940's England) or Julianne Moore(back to redheads) could've had on this film. Ms. Kidman's role is not shallow ,but she can't quite achieve the image of the distressed mother that Toni Collette creates. Moreso, ""The Others"" doesn't impress with a memorable cast(except for Alakina Mann- God bless this child) whereas the trio Willis-Collette-Osment leaves a wide mark on your mind.<br/><br/>Probably the most important question surrounding ""The Others"" was- is it scary???Well, if you are expecting a new exorcist, you're in for a disappointment, but on a whole basis, ""The Others"" does have its moments. The problem that AmenAbar and his cast fail to overcome is the slowness of the action- you can't have a masterpiece where one really good scene is followed by two extremely boring(I understand the ""husband"" episode is important, but did it have to go for soooo long- and with Christopher Eccleston???). That's basically ""The Others""'s main problem- slow plotin which the really important points might be missed by the half paying attention viewer.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm sorry I had to compare this movie with ""The Sixth Sense"", but that's the final problem AmenAbar has-time. This movie simply came out too late and it turns out there are ""other"" movies that belittle this one."

","""The Others"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller, full of suspense, frightening scenes and surprises that are guaranteed to blow your mind. Honestly, I never thought that they could make a better ghost movie than the ""The Sixth Sense"". I was thinking, ""why bother making another ghost movie while there isn't much left you could possibly add? It has been done already!"" I couldn't possibly be more wrong. It begins like an ordinary ghost movie but it develops into something purely unimaginable to the point of making ""The Sixth Sense"" look like ""Sound Of Music""! I assure you that ""The others"" will become a classic in a short time and be a HUGE SUCCESS. This is an extraordinary movie, a magnificent cinematic achievement. Its suspense excels any other movie I have seen (except maybe ""Alien"" and ""Silence Of The Lambs""). This movie is EVEN better than ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Sixth Sense""<br/><br/>Why is it better than ""The Sixth Sense""? 1) It has a better plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat -at times while it doesn't make you jump out of it. 2) There are more suspenseful scenes and they are MUCH scarier than the ones in ""The Sixth Sense"". In fact, the scenes are so scary that they make audience LITERALLY jump out of their seats! 3) It also has more surprises (In ""The Sixth Sense"", there was only one big surprise at the end). 4) It also has more characters that make the plot more sophisticated whereas ""The Sixth Sense"" had only two main characters (or maybe three, including the mother). 5) It keeps you guessing right to the end and the pay off is quite magnificent. 6) The camera and sound effects are used in much superior and advanced ways. The scenes are shot from a perfect angle in such a masterful way; they actually add more tension to the already suspenseful situation. You could almost hear the whispers of ghosts as if they were whispering in your ear. Even when those ghostly sounds overlap with the sounds made by the characters in the movie, there is a sensible distinction that creeps you out. 7) The location of the story is also much more perfect for such a story than in ""The Sixth Sense"". The whole house itself, its interior designs, and its massiveness gives you the creeps. <br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie: You may find some inconsistencies if you think how the elements of the material world can share the same platform with the otherworldly, but there is no infallible way to overcome this in a ghost theme anyway. I loved the movie in its entirety. The Best Scene Of The Movie: The scene where Nicole Kidman faces The Others at the end of the movie. Line of the movie: ""Sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living."" spoken by the nanny, Mrs Mills. Possible Academy Awards Nominations: 1) Best Screenplay, 2) Best Sound, 3) Best Sound Effects, 4) Best Performance by a leading Actress (Nicole Kidman) and in my opinion, 5) The Best Picture. You will like this movie if you like: The Sixth Sense, Jacob's Ladder, and other movies with ghost theme.<br/><br/>

We believe that there are ghosts in the house, but are there?  Nicole's character went mad, so her madness could be returning and using her daughter's ghost stories as her means to express it. If you have seen and enjoyed Sixth Sense, you would enjoy this movie.  I am thinking that you might have to see this movie, again, to fully comprehend it.  It has many questions.  Like a maze, the movie has many enjoyable twists and turns.  The movie is spooky, so you might have to prepare yourself to be jolted by some of the scenes.  So, after watching this movie, you may have to see the movie again, but using something other than your eyes :-)  The tagline should be  ""Believe in ghosts because they believe in you!"""

","`The Others' embodies all there is that makes the suspense' genre so popular.  The isolated mansion, the fragile woman alone, the sinister servants who know more than they can or will tell and  the darkness inevitably combine in unworldly ways.<br/><br/>All of these elements are used superbly by the director to create a movie that is scary with out being bloody.  No bodies hang from trees and no skulls fall from the closet shelf.  Yet something is wrong, very wrong. It might be the voices that the daughter of the house hears or pretends to hear.   It might be in the new servants who conveniently showed up shortly after the prior employees vanished without giving notice.  It might be that there really are intruders in the house, people long dead with issues unresolved.  To the lady of the manor the one unthinkable option is that the isolation and strain could be wearing her down and causing her mind to play tricks on her."

","I know a movie is creeping me out when I feel like someone or something is going to grab my ankles from behind my seat.  This film did that, with gusto.  I found that the incredible performances all around, most notably Nicole Kidman's turn as the frazzled lady of the house, made up for a VERY predictable ""twist"" ending.  The scene that I found the most unsettling was when she found the photo album, and it stuck with me.  The setting was incredibly ominous, and the shocks kept coming, even though I correctly predicted how it would end halfway through.  A film this predictable has to have some very strong merits in other areas to get a good review from me, and this one has plenty.  Destined to become a classic, because it already feels like one.  This is a film that could easily have come out 40 or 50 years ago, and that's a great compliment.  The  lack of special effects HELPED the movie, in my mind.  I remember giggling insanely at the ""ghosts"" in 1999's ""The Haunting"", and thankfully, the effects were muted, if not non-existent here.  This is a classic haunted house movie, and it delivers."

The movie is set in a large manor house with curtains on all the windows to protect the children from the sunlight (they are photo-sensitive).  A constant supply of fog, austere costumes and actors who could sit for American Gothic complete the setting.  Frankly, by the time the real intense part of the movie started I was already inured to the setting.  And that was one of the great failures of the movie.

"quatloos","Null","0","0","6 September 2001"," Well meaning but predictable
","The makers of this film sought, in part, to create a mature and intelligent blurring of the line between the ""living"" and the ""dead.""  Unfortunately this formula has become trite, and this is what inevitably causes ""The Others"" to be compared with movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" (which I found equally predictable and disappointing). I had hoped for more originality, a new ""Haunting of Hill House,"" perhaps, or ""Turn Of The Screw."" Alas, 20 minutes into the story, the ending of ""The Others"" was obvious. And its ending is depressing. Stories involving supernatural themes edify us most when they are uplifting as well as thought-provoking (e.g., ""The Secret Garden""). If they are not uplifting, then they chronicle a descent into madness, and we already see too much of that in everyday life. A voyage through hell is only valuable when it is used to reveal the Light. This is especially true today, for as a society we are not bored and wish to be deliciously scared; instead we are stressed out and wish for some indication that peace and sanity are still possible. No such indication is provided by ""The Others."" <br/><br/>Regarding the movie's set decoration and camera work, these are passable but not on par with even so much as the recent ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow."" And the use of relentless white fog to suggest inter-worldly limbo has been around at least since 1944's ""Between Two Worlds."" No real originality there. Nonetheless, the trashier a summer-cinema season, the more elegant any alternative like ""The Others"" becomes by sheer comparison.<br/><br/>
The main value of ""The Others"" lies in what it reveals about our culture's growing pessimism about virtually everything, including life after death. ""Ghost"" had a positive ending, but since its release in 1990, almost all stories involving supernatural topics (other than gratuitous horror flicks that entertain because they are hilariously awful) do not have characters going to Heaven, or even hell. There is no longer any Light, God, or Savior. The afterlife consists only of an endless, dreary, solitary limbo. The basic difference between this world and the next is that in the latter, we are each exposed as neurotic losers after all. Thus, movies with Satanic elements fail today because we have no divine elements to look forward to. Death only brings us eternal drabness and solitude. Even cinematic romances today mostly hinge on doomed love (e.g., ""The English Patient,"" ""Bridges Of Madison County,"" etc.) All we can do any more is hang on and grapple with our mounting anxieties. ""The Others"" might have used this reality as a springboard to suggest some fresh pathway to salvation. Instead, we have another example of political correctness applied to a supernatural theme, wherein we are asked why we and ghosts ""can't just get along"" in our mutually mirroring limbos. What a downer."

","Warning: SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Alejandro Amenabar has created one of those Hollywood rarities - a film that can warp time.  Unfortunately, this film makes its 104 minute run time feel like 3 hours.<br/><br/>The film is clearly an attempt to recreate vintage Hitchcock.  Like a 1940 suspense/horror classic, Amenabar attempts to using pacing, lighting, and atmosphere to create suspense.  It fails.  Instead, we get a slow film lacking any suspense and with an unoriginal if not predictable ending.<br/><br/>I first glanced at my watch 45 minutes into the film, certain that we were around the 1.5 hour point.  I stayed for the whole movie mostly because I was curious which of the possible endings the director had chosen.  Given the lack of anything compelling, I was also sure that it would be an ending I had seen before.  I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Let's start with character development.  There is none.  As a result, its very hard to care about these people.  Why did Grace go mad and kill her children?  Frankly, the kids aren't that appealing anyway.<br/><br/>All through the script you keep asking, ""why?"", and never get an answer.  The script is just bad.  With ""Sixth Sense"", the second time you watch the movie you realize how brilliantly it handled Bruce Willis' character.  The clues are all there.  In this movie, very early on the ""Sixth Sense"" ending is on your list, but the clues aren't there to support it.  So much is just wasted.  It makes no sense.<br/><br/>What was the point of Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) being light sensitive?  It's just not that relevant.  What's with Grace's husband (Charles - Christopher Eccleston)?  His appearance neither moves the plot along nor gives you clue's into Grace's psyche. Why did she go mad?  Why did Charles leave again?  What's the story of Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy)?  Why are they still at the house?  Why are they trying to enlighten Grace?<br/><br/>This movie manages to run for 104 minutes and still when its done you know virtually nothing about the main characters.<br/><br/>Wait for the video so you can make liberal use of the fast forward button."

","Remember seeing The Blair Witch Project for the first time, and wondering what all the hype was about? You know, just a bunch of kids running around in the dark, screaming at twigs and stuff. Well, this film has the kind of creepiness that BW was going for -- but this one actually works!<br/><br/>The Others is just a fine, simple, well-told haunted house/ghost story. Most people probably know the plot by now, so I won't bother here. Suffice to say, the story doesn't break new ground and, in fact, uses one of the oldest clichés in the book for the big payoff (which you may recognize from another recent scary movie). However, it does it with enough style and Grace (heh) that you won't even care. There's no gore in this -- well, there's one bit that utilizes makeup very effectively, but it pretty much doesn't count as a gore scene, really -- and the lack of light and the antiquated setting are really well used to make you think that stuff is indeed going bump in the night.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a sometimes slow movie (especially near the start), but I liken The Others to Alien. Nothing happens in either movie for the first 45-minutes or so either, and it just made you all the more paranoid when things *did* start moving.<br/><br/>My only complaint is I was able to figure out 90 per cent of the climax half-way through the film (right around the fog scene in fact) -- although there is one *final* twist that is sheer unexpected genius. And the acting, writing and cinematography are all quite brilliant and above par. Barring any major competition in the next four months, I'd dare say that this film has a good chance of picking up quite a few Oscar nods.<br/><br/>Really, go see this one. It's the only movie so far this year worth paying full price for and, truthfully, I judge a movie by how many times I check my watch. I never looked at it during The Others. Not once."

","(Spoilers . . . ?)<br/><br/>To liken this movie to _The Sixth Sense_ is almost to give too much of this away, but the similarities are all too obvious once you've seen it.  In other words, if you liked _The Sixth Sense_, you may like this one even better.<br/><br/>The only question is: what are you overlooking the entire time that would give away the secret?  I was thinking that myself about halfway through, as I really KNEW something like that was coming, but what exactly that was, was pretty hard to tell.  For the most part it's a mystery with a seemingly incongruous plot line, and if you haven't guessed already (and you'd already guess about 20 minutes in), there is something about likely interactions between living and dead -- only this does _The Sixth Sense_ one better, in that it really doesn't give you much in the way of clues (until the end) about just what is the nature of the interaction.<br/><br/>As the movie develops, though, there is quite a chilling sense about it, given the way that the mother and her two children living in the mansion (the characters and location around which the movie centers) live their lives.  A couple scenes are downright macabre, a term Nicole Kidman's character uses in just one of those very macabre scenes, without the need for the oft-used tactic of the instant scare to make you jump in your seat (though it's employed a couple times here).  The movie builds up the suspense quite well as it progresses.<br/><br/>All in all, I came out of the theater pretty satisfied, though -- like _The Sixth Sense_ -- once you've seen it, you've seen it as many times as you need to in order to get the suspense.  One thing that counts against it for me is my aversion to heavy reliance on the supernatural in a film to make sense of the plot.  (I don't believe in anything supernatural myself, but even if I did, I doubt I'd appreciate its use as a significant plot device.) Unlike Kubrick's _The Shining_ (my favorite horror film, and perhaps not incidentally, one that places little to no explicit reliance on any supernatural elements), it leaves little room for mystery/ambiguity/wonderment at the end, and becomes all too similar to the standard ""ghost story.""<br/><br/>In any event, being that this is quite good overall (it might even get Oscar consideration, just as _The Sixth Sense_ did), but not profoundly great, I give this one a 7 out of 10."

Fans of slashers and the like usually will not like films of the more subdued supernatural genre. If you're a thrill-seaker expecting another ""Freddie's Dead,"" or any number of slasher films, skip ""The Others"" -- it is not intended for you, and I guarantee you will not like it, or any other film of this genre. And here's another thing people just don't ever seem to get: just because you don't like it does not mean it's a bad film (or genre)."
"mr composer","10","0","0","2 September 2001"," Atmospheric, brilliant
","This is a great, chilling film.  I won't mention anything about the plot, because the less you know the better.  There are SOME similarities to ""Sixth Sense,"" but to compare the two films or judge this against the other is not fair.  ""Sixth Sense"" was a classic, but ""The Others"" stands by itself as a great work.  Alejandro Amenábar is an enviously talented guy.  Besides the brilliant script and direction, he wrote a score that darn well should be at least nominated come oscar time.<br/><br/>Also, you may hear about how ""slow"" this movie is.  I completely disagree. First of all, it's not an action movie.  But, if it developed any faster than it does, it would be silly.  I can also say that I felt tense at least 90% of the time, all the way up to the finale.  In fact at 114 minutes, I almost wanted a bit more, ALMOST.  The great direction, close-ups, acting, low-lighting, and creepy cinematography allow you to feel the fear as the characters do. There's not an ounce of gore, and none is needed.  Definitely among the best 3 or 4 films of the year thus far!"

I couldn't understand how anyone could think the movie could have stunk.  I heard many people complain about the ending, saying it copied too much on ""The Sixth Sense"".   But I thought this movie was better than ""The Sixth Sense""  so I didn't care.  I thought this film was much more innovative than ""The Sixth Sense"" and not to mention creepier.  I think the problem was people were expecting another ""Sixth Sense"" type film with lots of jumpoutofyourseat thrills, which ""The Others"" did have but not as much as ""The Sixth Sense"".  ""The Others"" was a slower film that had a few thrills and in the end succeeds in giving the viewer a feeling of dread, which is good.  ""The Sixth Sense"" has a happy ending while ""The Others"" has a much more darker ending.  <br/><br/>With great performances from all of the actors, magnificent cinematography, art direction, and costume design, ""The Others is a smooth flowing, carefully paced, and innovative ghost story.

","Talk about a ghost story. This one has an interesting twist to it. Living in isolation in an old manor along the British shores is a prim young woman(Nicole Kidman) and her two children. The children are allergic to sunlight and all the windows in the estate must be shaded. It is apparent that this woman lives for her children. An odd trio arrives to help with the upkeep and day to day living. Mrs. Mills(Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle(Eric Sykes),the gardener and a young mute, Lydia(Elaine Cassidy)turn out to be no strangers to the homestead.<br/><br/>This film is very slow and I am not certain that more viewers will not feel satisfied with the less than power packed climax. The movie is creepy and is sustained by the eerie mood and atmosphere. High suspense makes up for the small helping of horror. Some of the camera positioning made me think I was watching Grace Kelly instead of the equally beautiful Miss Kidman.<br/><br/>This movie will keep your interest from the opening scream. Miss Kidman's talent is tested and she comes through with flying colors as usual. Suspense and a few chills. Nerve wrecking fun. Don't miss!"
"mmintz","7","0","0","2 September 2001"," Another movie completely reliant on ""twist"" for validation
","SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>Okay,  I kinda liked it.  True, it was slow but it was interesting.  Note, however, while interesting, it was not even remotely scary...at all.  And believe me, I did what I could to talk myself into being scared but to no avail.  I did, however, jump once when a door slammed.  GEE!  Had to admire the restraint that characterized the movie (in comparison with many of the other contemporary horror/thrillers) but might've hoped for a little more of ""the good stuff.""<br/><br/>Kinda liked the theme that life is a little more complex than we think and will continue to defy our little systems of thought with which we try to pin it down.  I also liked the fact that the message was given gently.  Grace's religion and parental stringency were shown sympathetically.  Nevertheless, while useful and helpful we saw that they were inadequate to explain EVERYTHING.  <br/><br/>Once again, this movie (like many others) was completely reliant on its ""twist ending"" to validate it.  I really don't like that.  A good twist should deepen things and give you that little ""more than you bargained for"" bonus.  When it becomes the only point of the film, it ceases to function as it was intended.  This is especially so with ""The Others"".  The two twists: a) Omigosh, the cleaning crew are really ghosts! and b) Omigosh, the family is really ghosts! were pretty lame.  Perhaps had they beaten ""Sixth Sense"" to the screen they might've worked but THEY DIDN'T.  The only reason I hadn't already figured it all out as I watched was because I thought, ""No, they wouldn't be that dumb.""  They were though.<br/><br/>Okay, finally, in order to end positively, I'll say this:  The post-mortem photos were great.  Having already read about these in Clive Barker's A-Zs of Horror I thought their film treatment was appropriately eerie.  As Grace said, ""How macabre.""<br/><br/>So, in summation, I'm glad I saw it but I will probably never watch it again."

","From the looks of the previews, this movie looked like it was going to be a bit scary, but not too much. Wow, I was in for a treat.<br/><br/> It takes place in 1945, after the war. Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children live in an old, large house on an island in England. Grace hires 3 servants after the others mysteriously vanished and makes a few things very important. Whatever room the children are in the curtains must be closed, as they are allergic to light. All 50 doors must be locked at all times, no door can just stay open.<br/><br/>  Soon Ann (her daughter) starts hearing and talking to Victor, a boy who claims he and his family live there. Ann insists he isn't a ghost. Grace tries to block the fact that they may be sharing the house with other people, but soon catches on...<br/><br/>  This movie is excellent, it will have you on the edge of your seat.

","Spoiler! Don't read unless you've seen this film.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This movie won't please the same crowd that enjoys horror movies like Halloween and Scream. There is a feeling of tension and suspense throughout the film, and an interesting twist at the end, but no blood or gore. Although the movie is about dead people who don't realize they are dead, the story line is far different from the Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>However, like the Sixth Sense it is fun to think back and remember various clues.  Twice a character said, ""Stop breathing like that, stop breathing like that. Stop breathing.""  Possibly what Grace said as she suffocated the children.<br/><br/>Grace also refers to loud noises triggering her migraines.  Later we find that she died of a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head.<br/><br/>Her husband says, ""Sometimes I still bleed.""  He probably died of blood loss on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The three servants who died of tb appear in a death photograph.  Not too unusual as there are documented cases at the Princeton tuberculosis web site of household members succumbing to tb within a day of each other.  And the photo sure had scare impact.<br/><br/>In one scene the daughter's eyes become weirdly opaque.  (Other than the scene when she's wearing the communion dress and the medium channels her spirit).  It appears the medium is watching through her.<br/><br/>I have read the reviews by posters stating they were bored.  All I can say is the dramatic tension easily sustained me, and I find myself replaying scenes of the film long after it's over.  A terrific film!"
"wetfloorproductions","Null","0","0","27 August 2001"," Huh? *SPOILERS* The Others from a filmmaker/screenwriter's point of view
","*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>As having been a Hollywood screenwriter for more than twenty years, the popularity of dreck like this confounds the mind. Nicloe Kidman, a very overrated actress, does her best with the material, but is left in the dark by a poor script.<br/><br/>Character development? Never mind that. The emphasis is on atmosphere. The plot twist is EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE, both myself and my viewing partner caught it early on. This is no Sixth Sense. The film lays out too many clues; and when Kidman's dead, confused husband enters into the mix halfway through, it is all to predictable.<br/><br/>The fact Kidman's children have a light deficiency disease never factors into the story at all, in fact, it has no relevance. The pacing moves backward and the overbearing music belongs in a darker, more suspenseful film, ala the Changeling. Granted, there are a few decent set pieces, but this is poor at best.<br/><br/>Most comments on this film are very positive. To be truthful, none of the plot makes any sense. If they are dead, where does the food come from? How do they cook? How did they get the keys from the living? How do they wash clothes? Are they sleeping in beds with the living? AHHHHH!!!! It's confounding!!!! The Sixth Sense handled this masterfully by having Bruce Willis appear from nowhere, never opening a door, never moving a chair. In The Others, there is no explaination. Recycled idea, poorly executed.<br/><br/>3/10<br/><br/>Bottom line: Bring a pillow. The Others is a long, dull nap that is offensive due to it's egotistical ""ha, ha, fooled the audience"" attitude. I despised it."

","I saw this film over the weekend which was prescribed by some close friends who promised a ""chilly feeling"" that would persist in the back region and the nape of the neck that would last for about 1 to 1 and a half hours.<br/><br/>The Others is set on an island near post WWII England where a neurotic mother played by Nichole Kidman lives alone with her two kids in a huge dark house. She hires three strangers as housekeepers who soon learn that her children are afflicted with a rare disease that causes their skin to boil in the sunlight and thus must keep every door and curtain in the house closed at all times. Things start to get creepy when her daughter starts seeing ghosts and the strangers seem to know a secret about the house.<br/><br/>While I found the film to be original, entertaining, and shot very well, I was also a little disappointed that every once in a while they would throw in these scenes that would basically telegraph to you what was really going on which made the whole ""secret"" very obvious early on in the film.<br/><br/>Still, I WAS entertained and there were some genuine scary moments in the movie that made several people in the audience scream and jump. The plot is pretty basic although the filmmakers try to pretend that it's not.

","I saw this yesterday night, and wondered if only more advertising was done for this movie...It is so much better than the hoards of inane movies thronging the theatres. Many here have blamed this movie for being ""too slow"", but I always figured it was building towards something. How could you call it slow, when at every turn the plot cleverly, shifted the gaze of suspicion from one set of characters to others.<br/><br/>HUUUUGGGGEE Spoilers Below:<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Yes, I said HUGEEE, so tread forward at the risk of ruining your own film experience :P<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Plot was full of these subtle twists and excellent exchanges. For instance, Initially my suspicions were about Mrs.Mills, Mr.Tuttle and Lydia being just ordinary humans who probably came in there to scare Grace and her family away. (Which was kinda reaffirmed by the fishy exchange of dialogues between Mr.Tuttle and Mrs.Mills (Mr.T and Mrs. M from here on..) Then towards the end when they figured that Mr.T, Mrs.M and Lydia(L) had been dead for so long, my hunch was that they want to get rid of Grace and her family, but the trio of L, Mr.T and Mrs. M are obviously not human. Then the scene towards the end when, those 3 are standing outside the door of the Mansion and they say that, we know what's to be done, right now you are in there with intruders and your kids. I thought the ""intruders"" must be ghosts and Grace and her kids are in danger.... but the climax was awesome...the whole scene where the realization sets in was as good as the SIxth Sense climax.<br/><br/>
MY QUESTIONS: 1. Movie didn't give and explanation as to why Grace killed the kids (with the pillows). Not that it is very relevant, but I Think the clue to this was when Anne said to Nicholas ""remember the last time mom had gone mad""...Maybe she was depressed at the loss of her husband or felt cheated by his absence and missing love. Although all this perfectly explains, why she was overprotective of her kids and actually said that she was happy to see Ann still alive after pillow episode and was thankful to the lord for giving her aother chance.<br/><br/>2.Also, although we could figure that Grace's husband was dead too (No image in the mirror,when they were talking on the bed), and also the fact that he didn't eat even once despite being so weak, or Slept with his eyes open. Then why did Grace and her family do the normal human things like eating and sleeping. My hunch is that because they still had not realized what they were and there are no obvious harms of doing those things."

","If your kind of scary movie is ""I know What you did Last Summer"" or ""The Haunting"" where most of the suspense comes from special effects or blood-thirsty killers, this is not the movie for you. It's an old fashioned ghost story plain and simple. There are not many visual effects at all, it forces you to use your imagination. Kind of like the original JAWS when you knew there was a killer shark in the water, but until a good way into the movie you never saw it; it was left up to your imagination to ponder what lurked in the deep, blue abyss. What I found most intriguing about The Others, however, was the symbolism. I assume since the director is of Latin descent that he is most likely Catholic, which makes the mother's near-obsession with the faith quite intriguing. Her whole speech to the children about what limbo is and where you go when you die, makes the ending that much more powerful (in my opinion) because you begin to wonder: were they in limbo, or did they just enter limbo? The mother says Anne needs to learn to ask for forgiveness and then we hear her asking the same from the Lord when the truth is revealed, and also from her husband when he discovers her. I would like to go back and see the movie again to try and uncover some of these seemingly small clues and discover, hidden in the midst of a bone-chilling ghost story, a touch of religious commentary and certainly a fair amount of symbolism."

The writing of this movie was brilliantly written and was undoubtedly portrayed from the opposite side and/or ""Other"" side.  It was suspenseful, yet boring if you can understand that.  The mom (mum) (Nicole Kidman) was one of most uptight, dead ghost I've ever seen in my life.  I mean, get a grip, lay down already. I guess she was the ghost with the most!  The daughter definitely had issues and the son, if not already dead, would have definitely needed therapy and a good psychiatrists couch for the rest of his life.  I pretty much figured out what was going on during the first 15 minutes of the film and I really was not surprised.  It was kind of stupid that the husband would come back and be sitting on the bed right across from the mirror and have no reflection, and in the same instance, in the attic, Nicole Kidman has a reflection and they are both dead.

Many claim this movie is too slow, remember, this generation is use to the mindless slasher teen flicks like ""SCREAM"", and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer.""  These films are filled with brainless plots, and even more brainless charactors that are more concerned with pimples and condoms. <br/><br/>     I was THRILLED to see a film with STYLE and the ability to tell a story without the use of expensive effects or sensless gore.  The chills are created with classic lighting, a wonderful musical score, and characters that are realitic, not manufactured.  Nichole Kidman played her character with a suprising ability to evoke fear with just  her reaction to the ""bumps"" from the house.  The young girl who played her daughter displayed a wide ranch of emotions, and was a strong source of conflict to Nichole's Character.  The elderly woman who befriended this family with their strange and quirky needs, did a fine job of making us comfortable one moment, and suspicious and frightened the next.      Great acting, incredible story-telling, and just the right amount of creepiness and chills to put it alongside the great classics."

This movie doesn't use over-the-top (stupid) CGI rather it uses the absence of light and noise to unsettle the viewer and we really start to inhabit that drafty old house. I also was intrigued to see Catholicism strictly portrayed by Nicole Kidman's character throughout the film as a disciplinary tool for her children. It's a film that works best on the first viewing and would be more effective in the theater than at home (unless you have a $20,000+ home theater)"

","Those who complain that ""The Others"" is too slow should get off the ADD merry-go-round and relearn the ability to adjust to the tempo of a good story.  This is the film that the vile re-make of ""The Haunting"" ought to have been, made with cinematic style, emotional resonance, psychological depth, and restraint: no gore, no flashbacks or flashforwards or dream sequences, and almost no special effects.

","Movie Review:  The Others (2001)<br/><br/>Towards the end of World War II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives in a mansion near the English Coast with her two children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) where they are waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to come back home from the war.<br/><br/>Grace is unbearably religious and does not believe in nonsense like ghosts which her independently minded daughter Anne likes to talk about, claiming to have seen and spoken with them.<br/><br/>Anne and her brother Nicholas have an allergy to light; so the curtains must be drawn and doors must be closed and locked before the next one is opened, to keep the light out because the light will hurt the children; beautiful, pale sad children.<br/><br/>There are no great special effects in this movie, it is very slow and i do not recommend it for those who need action.  Most of the time i need action and i do wish this movie had more movement to it, but i still enjoyed it. It is a moody and broody movie.  It is wonderfully heavy on atmosphere.  And It has a story.<br/><br/>All the servants have disappeared into thin air and replacing those servants are Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Mills,  Elaine Cassidy as Lydia, and Eric Sykes as Mr. Tuttle.   They play the housekeeper, the nanny and the gardener.  But one quickly learns they are not what they seem.  Why do they return to this house?  What are their motives?<br/><br/>Soon after the arrival of the servants Grace begins to hear noises and to sense something diabolical is living in her home.  Is Grace imagining these things?  Is Anne creating these effects in order to gain attention?  Are the servants trying to undo her in order to take control of her home and to hurt her children?<br/><br/>Grace despite her rigidness and strictness has a vulnerability to her. Maybe too much vulnerability since according to her daughter she has once suffered madness.  Nicole Kidman plays her perfectly.  She can express feelings and thoughts with a mere look.<br/><br/>All are perfect in their parts; and the dialogue is excellent in it's poetic feel.  This movie is not a special effects movie, it is a movie which takes place in your imagination.  It's a movie of feeling."

","This film gets points right away for being able to scare me. I don't mean something that will keep you awake and thinking like ""Rosemary's Baby"" The Others scares as you watch. This is rarely done now adays with success, it has just become too predictible after all the Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels. However, The Others pulls it off.<br/><br/>Now to the idea that it is slow...I disagree. The entire film felt intense for me. If you think THIS is slow then you really need to work on your attention span. I am only 14 years old, but I read reviews from people I assume are grown men and women complaining of boredom. That surprises me, shouldn't it be the other way around?<br/><br/>The moment in this film that will stay with me is the book of the dead. As Grace (Nicole Kidman) flips through the pages I automatically felt uncomfortable, unsettled. The images will stay with you. Another great moment is when the house is being searched for an ""intruder"". Grace is looking around a room when we notice something behind her, eyes, staring out from the darkness. She does not notice at all and just when it comes apparent to us they are there, a light moves and we discover the eyes are part of a painting. That was perfectly timed, genuine.<br/><br/>Now to the ending, I'm talking about the ending-ending when we discover who Grace and the children really are. Well, I guess there was some element of surprise there. Unfortunatly, it didn't seem all the shocking since it isn't a new concept. The line ""This house is ours"" seems to come from no where. It wasn't like they loved the house, they were being put through hell. So the ending-ending wasn't the films strongest point. However, when Grace discovers a page that was missing from the book of the dead, that sends chills up your spine. That was frightening.<br/><br/>The Others proves that special effects are not needed to scare. It also proves that no matter how many horror movies you have seen (And believe me I have seen LOTS) it is still possible to have a few scares. The Others will take you on a journey that you won't soon forget."

","This is definately going to contain spoilers....so read on at your own risk.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ok. Let me clear up an issue about the sixth sense thing I've been hearing. I LOVED the sixth sense. I did not know the ending until it happened, and was shocked...then it made me think back to say ""Oh yeah. I saw this and this and this...why didn't I come to that conclusion earlier??"" the kid was kind of creepy (Great actor!! Love this kid!!) My skin crawled, I was gripping the edge of my seat. I mean, even predictable things happening, like the little girl grabbing his foot from under the bed, was scarier than heck. I mean, this was a good movie. I love movies that not only shock you and keep you in suspense, but make you go back again to see what you missed and make you really think about the clues you didn't give second thought to, but should have because they told you what to expect in an off side way. It thrills you and makes you think a little.<br/><br/>The ""Others"" almost exactly like it. Two kids who thought they saw a dead boy that turns out to be a boy who saw dead people. They thought they were alive through out the entire show...then ala Bruce Willis, they turn out to be the ones who were dead. Gee, and people are saying there is no connection between the two, and still insist this movie is original??<br/><br/>And come on...how scary is it for a mother to punish her braty kids by making them read from the bible out loud? You think that's eerie and thrilling...go to church. You're in for a real thrill there!<br/><br/>When the husband arrived the first thing I thought....He's dead. After the husband arrived, the first thing I thought....I bet they are all dead. When they talked about the graves...I got that wrong. I knew the housekeeper and her buddies were dead...But I thought the graves would have Kidman's character and her children's names instead.<br/><br/>A few loud bangings upstairs from unseen feet, overdoing the banging noise if you ask me. Creeking and lighter stomping would have been kind of eerie, but to go all out and BANG BANG BANG. oh come on! a book of dead people, been done before in movies, not that gross and spooky anymore, and oh I love how people thought the piano playing was so eerie. Um...yeah. Its scary when potential ghosts play a riviting sonata.<br/><br/>These were the most intense moments in the movie as they were the only time you thought there was ""a ghost"". and the old lady in her daughter's dress speaking with her daughter's voice...that would have been slightly weird, IF that wasn't part of the tv promo for the movie so we all knew it was coming.<br/><br/>
Trust me...if you are not easily entertained by a few halloween type bumps and bangs, and look for a more deeper, intellectual thrill that chills you and makes you think...this is not really for you. This is so predictable. I hate knowing how it ends minutes into the movie. And for as good as Nic Kidman is as an actress, she seemed just a tad stiff. But it must have been uncomfortable for her knowing she was playing Bruce Wilis. If she wins an award at the emmy's...it better not be for this movie. It should be for a REAL original like Mulan Rouge. THAT was a good original movie.<br/><br/>And I can't believe the people who thought this was better than the sixth sense. For crying out loud it IS the sixth sense. The kid who sees dead people, the dead who thought they were the living ones but weren't, leaving that ""twist"" for the end. And the rest of the movie was just so long and dull because you knew every step, what would happen.<br/><br/>My theory...this movie is a sleeper, not a creeper. Sorry guys. It stunk!! Rip off, Copy, Stolen, recycled with poor quality, re-done but poorly written. Bring your pillow. You'll need it.

","What's really a shame about this movie is that it could (and should) have been a sleeper hit. But because of it's slow pace and lack of any scary jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the film falls to mediocre. The atmosphere was perfect for this film. Located on an abandoned island sits an old manor house with a cemetery next to it. It doesn't get much better then that for a ghostly atmosphere. We learn that Grace and her husband Charles are the owners of the house and live there with their 2 children Anna and Nicholas. The husband had left to fight in the England / German war and has not returned. There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. The daylight can actually injured her children and cause swores and burning if they stay in the light to long. Three strangers appear at the door looking for work. Grace had put in an ad for servants to cook and clean the old manor, or did she? Now, with all of this going for it you would expect at least 3-4 scary moments with the first hour, right? WRONG!! Besides some creaking doors and floors, a piano that plays by itself and won't stay locked and a paranoid Grace and her son, there wasn't a single scary moment in the first hour. There are only 2 scenes that will have you jumping out of your seats, and that just isn't enough. I was literally dozing off during this movie and my girlfriend was ""sighing"" wondering when something interesting was going to happen. As for the acting, Nicole Kidman did an admirable job, but little Alakina Mann who played the daughter Anna (in her very first movie), literally stole the show. This girl was brilliant. Not only was her dialogue spoken cleaning with precise timing, but her facial emotions were dead on. At times she looked very erie and subdued. Even the little boy who played Nicholas (James Bentley) did a wonderful job. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who did an outstanding job in Waking Ned Devine was perfect for this role and showed her acting talent very well. Nope..it wasn't the acting that killed this movie, it was the script.<br/><br/>Everyone is calling this a Sixth Sense clone and in some ways, it is. Most people will figure out the twisted ending long before it gets there. I did! If the writer had let the cat out of the bag half way through the movie and then provided a new interaction between the characters, things could have been a bit different. Instead, the solution was told and the movie ended, just like that. Definitely wait for this to hit the video store. If this movie came out back in the 50's or 60's it might have been worth a look, but with everyone expecting a modern day ghost story, the film just doesn't live up to anyones expectation. Take a pass on this and wait for the next haunting movie."

","The reason Kubrick's THE SHINING is the one successful haunted-house movie of recent times is that Kubrick went at the yin through the yang. Shorn of Gothic effects, the movie situates Gothic horrors in the stark fluorescent lighting and stainproof rugs of a Radisson Hotel Luxury Suite. A beautiful woman deliquescing into a rotting hag is somehow all the more primally horrific under cold all-around white light. All the old-dark-house cliches Kubrick and his co-scenarist, Diane Johnson, swept off the table in THE SHINING have landed in the lap of this elegantly directed thriller. (Those Kubrickian crumbs piled up in abundance in the absurdly overpraised, and overpopular, SIXTH SENSE.)<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is a single mom in a big creaky house in the moors. She has two kids who, she tells the eyebrow-raising new nanny, are ""allergic to light."" This has the convenient side effect of making most of the movie Caravaggio-dark; it also gives the director the opportunity to exercise his fluffing-sheets-over-the-windows and sudden-shock-of-daylight muscles. The kids have a dad who may or may not be alive, and may or may not be a soldier at the front. And soon enough, Mom, Junior and Sis' creepy, claustral little home-schooling world is interrupted by banging noises upstairs, clangor on the piano, and mysteriously self-unlocking doors...<br/><br/>Alejandro Amenabar, the writer-director-composer, swirls up a tasty, classy, early-Hammer-horror atmosphere--Hammer before the pandering to sex. The Catholic mania of the mom is very cleverly built into her possible madness, and Amenabar deftly juggles all the possible layers of irreality and illusion that may be taking place at any moment. He's also lucky to have Nicole Kidman as the mother: not yet really a great actress, she is a great star, and she brings to the role a quality surprisingly similar to that of Piper Laurie in CARRIE--a raging sex-mad succubus underneath the church-white linens. Unfortunately, the movie is a veritable encyclopedia of creaky-door cliches. (The only one missing is the jowly, friendly constable who stops by and notices that...something isn't right.) The ending, a little evocative of Lucio Fulci, is nicely joined, but also a little too evocative of another, recent popular horror movie. (This being Anti-Spoiler Central, I won't give it away, but...it shouldn't take too much imagination to figure out.)"

","Having looked at the last couple of comments, it seems that the viewers must come from the Michael Bay/Bruckheimer school of film studies-explosions, dumb characters and enough noise to deafen people. What makes The Others unique is that it is quiet. It isn't Scream or even Blair Witch, but rather a somber film that takes it's time to build up to the climax. The best horror films-Psycho, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, Halloween-take the same approach of building up the tension through characters and mood, not computer generated creatures. The Others also succeeds thanks to the characters not being cliched. They all have personality, unlike the nameless bimbos who populate Friday the 13th and other type of films. Sadly the naysayers seem to be winning, since such ""is this trip necessary"" sequels like American Pie 2 and Rush Hour 2 are ruling the box office. Let's hope that word of mouth spreads, because it would be a shame if a fine movie like this makes less money than such brain dead travesties like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes and the aforementioned.

","Quite simply, The Others is a quiet & powerful film about ghost that occupy a house. Unlike the dumb teen-slasher flicks of recent years, ""The Others"" is not your typical horror movie, but rather an intelligent film that never resorts to the cheap scares of most films within the genre. Nicole Kidman has never been better in her career as her performance here is powerful & heartbreaking all at once. Though she probably won't, she is well deserving of an Oscar nomination. Her strongest scenes are with actors who play her children (Alakina Mann & James Bentley) who in terms of acting are right there with Kidman. Alakina especially is fantastic as the daughter who's more astute than her mother gives her credit for. The relationship between brother & sister is spot on as well. Director Alejandro Amenabar sets the tone of the movie immediately & thankfully never wavers. Much like ""The Shining"", Amenabar gives the house its own personality & feeling of danger that always remains just out of sight. In this 2001 summer of big budget FX popcorn movies, The Others reinforces yet again that a 200 million dollar studio film with 2-3 ""Movie Stars"" can never substitute for a fantastic script, great directing & powerful acting. The Others is the best films I've seen this year & is one of the best ""Horror"" films of all time.

A dark tale of a religious fanatic during WWII, taking care of her two photosensitive children and a dark, isolated old house. Nicole Kidman spells the word ELEGANCE.  Yet in this movie she is done up very plain.  Her accent is FLAWLESS.  Kidman has been BLESSED with a gift and is showing it well this year in particular.  First with the blockbuster story/musical of ""Moulin Rouge"" where Nicole was able to show her SINGING talents as well as ACTING talents.  The people are anxiously awaiting ""The Hours"" starring opposite Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore.  ""The Others"" is no normal ghost story -- but a psychological drama/thriller about a woman's fear and deterioration as she starts to fear her secluded house is haunted. The director is a visionary.  Setting his scenes inside only by candlelight -- and the fog adds an amazing effect.  The dark sound and haunting score make it the more eerie. I always try and imagine other actors or actresses in certain roles to see if their performances are worthy of awards or attention.  Nicole Kidman has baffled me.  I can't for the life of me see anyone portraying the role any better.  The movie is better in all aspects than ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""What Lies Beneath"" (both of which tried to frighten with ARTIFICIAL scares). ""The Others"" never reverts to special effects for scares, only tense scenes, haunting music, amazing cinematography, stellar acting, breathtaking direction and ATMOSPHERE.

","***Warning: Spoilers Ahead ***<br/><br/>Since I saw the Sixth Sense first, I had an idea of how this movie would end around the time Grace (Kidman) mentioned the absence of the letter carrier. Having been a paperboy in my youth, I would definitely avoid a house like that.  My idea about the ending suddenly changed during the middle of the film thanks to Kidman's great performance.  She convinced me that Grace's sanity was in question.  I started thinking that she might have been imagining everything ... even the children.  I was preparing myself for an ending where the people who bought the house would barge in with several policemen, point at Grace, and say ""She's the one.  She's crazy.  She talks to herself, locks herself in the house, and refuses to acknowledge we are the new owners.  Officers, take her away!""  For me, that would have been scarier because it shows that people are the ones who ""see what they want to see"".  Especially true when they have lost loved ones.  I must admit that I wanted to see the film just for the ending.  The ending was just not as scary as I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the film because it was soo mysterious.  The build-up was done really well.  Setting and acting were all well done. Just a note about another post that commented on why we can't stop ghosts with guns but doors work.  I believe that the gun Grace was using was not really there.  A ghost gun perhaps?  But the house and the locked doors are real. The director might also be putting a spin on the old myths about evil things being able to enter only if they are invited first.  Something Grace does in the beginning, and possibly at the end after she discovers the truth."

When the beginning credits began to roll, I was delighted by the black-ink drawings depicted on old, yellowed pages. I felt this could be a fun movie. However, at 25 minutes into the film when the plot had yet to truly surface, it was evident that this movie was lacking in a lot of things. The plot did finally surface, however amidst in the middle of massive plotholes, poorly developed characters, and bad scripting. When we finally reach the climax of the film we are actually subjected to some scenes that, while meant to be frightning, the entire crowd in the theater I was in laughed like they were jokes. I will give the movie one bonus, however, The final 10 minutes of the film were actually well done. It was almost as if someone else wrote the final 10 minutes, or the writer had a good idea and used 2 hours of poorly-written filler. My main thought throughout this film was it seemed like it was something that one would expect to see on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" due to its gaping plot-holes and poor dialogue. If you plan to see this, be forwarned, BRING A PILLOW. Myself and the others I were with almost fell asleep."

","The Others absolutely stunned me as a genuinely scary film.  I am not one to write spoilers, and I will not do that here.  It is sufficient to say, very briefly, that it is well acted, the sets appear high quality, and the plot noteworthy.  Although this has been said before, it is  similar to The Sixth Sense in the effectiveness of its execution. <br/><br/>Most notably, The Others possesses a brilliant, eerie mood that all the actors contribute to, and is carried off without a hitch.  This is certainly the scariest, most suspenseful movie of the year.  <br/><br/>Though there is, admittedly, not much other than throw-away-Hollywood trash circulating through theaters at the moment (Jurassic Park III, Rush Hour 2, etc), this is probably the only flick that I would recommend to someone.  It is reminiscent of early horror movies from the pre-gore days, and is definitely worth your money."
"RestlessRust","9","0","0","21 August 2001"," One of the Scariest Movies I've Ever Seen
","Perfectly directed, well written and well acted, ""The Others"" is an old-fashioned horror movie in the best sense.  Clean and simple (it could almost be rated ""G"" if it weren't so scary), we don't get ambushed by special effects and excessive makeup.  No, ""The Others"" plays with our heads, and it pays off beautifully.<br/><br/>In a movie Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of, eerieness abounds, and we are left constantly wondering just what is up with this house. Photographs of dead men, women, and children tucked away in an album.  Loud noises in empty rooms.  A young girl strangely calm about all the supernatural events she claims to have witnessed.  Servants with something to hide.  And a heroine on the brink of madness.<br/><br/>If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.  My fourteen-year-old son was giddy with fright, sometimes even tempted to look away from the screen, but always drawn back to make sure he didn't miss a moment.  Me, I never looked away--this movie is far too much fun."

","When I went to see ""The Sixth Sense,"" I had read MANY reviews referring to the ""twist ending"" so I went in looking for it, had it figured out in the first 10 minutes, and it ruined the experience for me.  Thank goodness I hadn't read much on ""The Others,"" and what I did made no intimations about the plot turns and surprises.  It is so refreshing to see a film that actually left me guessing and wondering where it was heading.  I've gotten so tired of the endless parade of formulaic movies in which you know EXACTLY what's about to happen.  It is certainly also VERY refreshing to see a well-scripted, filmed, stylish ""haunted house"" film that doesn't rely on computer-generated demons and gore.  As many reviewers and users have commented, it is much scarier NOT seeing what's behind the door...<br/><br/>The only reason to compare ""The Others"" to ""The Sixth Sense"" is that it shares some significant plot elements.  Other than that the two films, both wonderful in their own right, belong to two very different genres - ""The Others"" is a throwback to some of those wonderful old black-and-white gothic thrillers that relied on the door that closes on its own and odd noises upstairs.  In fact it felt much like a classic novel - speaking of which, how many others found it remarkably similar to Henry James's novella ""The Turn of the Screw""?<br/><br/>If you love and miss classy, artful, and genuinely frightening old-style psychological thrillers, this is the one for you.  If you've gotten brain-numbed by special effects, car chases, and gore and find these kind o f movies ""slow"" - I feel sorry for you.  You're missing out on a whole lot of what movie-going used to be!"

","Many reviews and comments liken ""The Others"" as a psychological horror film in the vein of ""The Sixth Sense.""  While this is readily apparent, I noted that this film shares much of the ambiance and structure of Roger Corman and Vincent Price Poe adaptations such as ""House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  I sometimes expected Price himself to pop out from behind a door to deliver some trademark macabe lines.  Like Price and Corman's films, ""The Others"" takes place in the clearly defined environment of a creepy old house and functions with a minimal cast.  ""The Others"" also share a wonderfully rising tension that truly scares the viewer, instead of relying on cheap scares such as ghouls popping out.  Perhaps the twists of ""The Others"" remind the viewer of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Stir of Echoes,"" but in my mind ""The Others"" is a wonderful reconstruction of some classic horror."

The one thing that surprised me was that I didn't get bored. For the past couple months I have been getting bored and impatient towards the end of movies. But this one is paced very slowly and I didn't even get bored once. The Book of the Dead was one of the very creepy things about this movie. Those pictures were just scary. And one thing that I liked about this movie was the fact that special effects weren't used. I myself prefer special effects but I'm glad none were used here. They weren't needed. They just used creepy noises. The Haunting was all about special effects and I hated it. Now any one who says the ending was predictable was very wrong. I was very surprised. Unlike the Sixth Sense(5/10) I couldn't see it coming. This movie is way better! I am probably going to see it again. I'm surprised that this didn't make more at the box-office. 11/10"

","Solid but predictable, especially if one has seen other recent ghost movies. The resolution left a number of loose ends which could have been more imaginatively brought together.  The core of the film--the relationship between the living and the dead--could and should have produced something more than a not-very surprise ending.  The historical background--the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII--was merely used as a prop, not at a part of the narrative.  Similarly, the use of Catholic imagery and theology (which was often oddly misstated) seem to have little or no bearing on the story or its resolution.  The Others has the ingredients of a classic, but fails to blend them into a satisfying whole."

","Those who see ""The Others"" with the intent to be scared witless by figures leaping suddenly out of dark corners or by axe-wielding maniacs are in for a big disappointment. This film is much smarter than that. It is quietly moody--the anxiety level is almost subliminal, and for that reason all the more compelling. Nicole Kidman, looking eeriely like a reincarnated Grace Kelly, carries the film as the increasingly distraught mother of two precocious but mysteriously odd children, flanked by three kindly but equally unusual servants. The film opens with Kidman awakening early one morning with a blood-curdling scream--a primal scream that seems just barely sustained at the base of her throat for the rest of the film. She is at once icy and nurturing, in a bravura yet understated performance that I can only compare to (and I am honestly sorry to do this) Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense"". Kidman proves, if nothing else, that she is an accomplished actor who is in complete control of her craft. The children are also excellent--the film wouldn't work if they were not. Nevermind if you guess the outcome of the film in advance, as did I--the ending is still fully satisfying and chillingly thought-provoking. Beautifully photographed."

","""The Others"" is full to the brim of wondrous and surprising things -- First and foremost, a script that opens like a Venus Flytrap -- exotic, seductive, deadly -- It dares us to look away, tantalizes, takes its time, invites us in, then closes like a vise on a simple, terrifying conceit:  Do the dead haunt the living, or do the living haunt the dead?  Amenabar's graceful, powerful writing and directing deserve our praise.  The cinematography of The Others is breathtaking --every shot seems composed from a nightmare, but one just out of the reach of true memory.  Fans of Christopher Eccleston (I am) will be delighted with his astonishing, almost wordless appearance. Fionnula Flanagan (Mrs. Mills), and the two children give performances that can only be described as delicious.  NICOLE KIDMAN accomplishes something very rare here.  Not only does she serve the story, fitting the character like a glove, she conjures forth the bewitching image of GRACE KELLY in her prime.  This coincidence is not lost on Mr. Amenabar, whose camera captures Kidman in that rapturous, Hitchcockian way:  swirling down staircases, hovering at waist level, gliding like a predator, circling upward to the precise moment of profile.  Indeed, Ms. Kidman's embodiment of the late Grace Kelly is so startling, so uncanny, I was convinced there were two ghost stories unfolding simultaneously:  one in a haunted house; the other being a legendary actress reaching across decades to possess the soul of another."

This time however it was a completely different story ...

Instead of enhancing the characters, this emphasized de-styling separates the viewer from the characters, keeping him from sympathizing with the story.

"moonspinner55","7","1","2","9 December 2016"," Effectively spooky and gloomy presentation...story itself is less satisfying
","Atmospheric but somewhat unsatisfying tale of a woman and her two sick children in 1945, living in a gloomy mansion in the Channel Islands, doesn't offer many new tricks in the haunted house genre (even the colorless title warns you of that). Writer-director Alejandro Amenábar has visual imagination and panache to spare, yet his screenplay (which has an overlay of James' ""The Turn of the Screw"") is stuffed with red herrings that only serve to weigh down the ultimate explanation. Nicole Kidman is imposing and impenetrable as the proprietress of the manor who can't seem to explain the absence of her husband--and who keeps her precocious kids out of the sun because they're allergic to ultra-violet light. Kidman is one of the best actresses we have today; her film selections continue to be intriguing (she isn't afraid to take risks, which is clear with her work here), and she is also very lovely to watch. Fionnula Flanagan is flawless as the new housekeeper who has arrived mysteriously (with a mute assistant and a gardener in tow) after the previous staff has vanished into the night. Amenábar stages a grand scene near the end in a graveyard, but he's less successful at paring down the dross and giving viewers a really good fright (instead, piano music at night drives Kidman into hysterics, while her taunting daughter teases her endlessly with facetious comments). The picture does work on occasion, mostly due to the acting and the handsome production. *** from ****"

If it doesn't then I suspect no movie can give you a breathless moment. <br/><br/>Actually the build up is very slow and feels dull but curiosity kept me watching, was she an abusive mother etc. MAny things will come to mind on what is going on as it can seem confusing in its understatement oxymoronic as that sounds...<br/><br/>Then BAM! Chills like no other film have ever given me. Nothing to do with the excellent ambiance or script to give this a 10 just the plain simple fact that it gave me a shock like no other film has ever done. Not since I was a child watching horrors on the sly has a movie made me feel such dread.

The sound effect could have been more horrifying given the environment in which the movie is shot. The screenplay is just awesome linking the various events of the movie to give an unexpected ending. Horror movies should scare the audience and its not about the bloody bodies or dancing demons or distorted faces, its about the plot and story which should give you the creeps. This movie definitely has those points and it is a must watch for it's storyline. It is the uncertainty of the events which brings this movie to one of the must watch horror plots."

","The Others (2001): Dir: Alejandro Amenabar / Cast: Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes: Not the great spiritual thriller that The Sixth Sense is yet it is somewhat compelling in its view of the afterlife. Nicole Kidman plays a mother whose two children are allergic to sunlight to the point where drapes are drawn at all times. She brings them up on strict Biblical teachings and hires three servants to work in the house. Two of them are elderly while the other is mute. Suddenly strange things are happening that has Kidman questioning the behaviour of her children. Intriguing with numerous twists but a climax that leaves more questions than answers. Director Alejandro Amenabar sets up suspense with a fine technique that involves lighting and shadows. Kidman holds strong as a mother questioning everything around her and set on protecting her children. Unfortunately she carries the film by herself because supporting roles aren't so lucky. Fionnula Flanagan and Elaine Cassidy plays two of the house keepers. Cassidy in particular is the mute. Christopher Eccleston plays Kidman's deceased husband who decides that appearing as a spirit is the best way to reunite. Yeah, right. Perhaps he should have fired her a written message first. Whatever. Although it doesn't always work it is a chilling ghost story about the haunting past and those who played a part in it. Score: 5 ½ / 10"

","Clever supernatural-thriller.<br/><br/>Very different to your average supernatural-drama/horror movie. In fact, just calling it a horror movie degrades it.

She usually stars in pretentious roles, and often in pretentious dramas (eg Moulin Rouge). Her character in this is quite stuck up and stuffy (ie true to form) but her presence belies the intelligent and thrilling nature of the movie.<br/><br/>This said, she puts in a solid performance, in a genre which would be foreign to her. <br/><br/>Good supporting cast too.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense, you'll enjoy this."

I'm a huge fan of the horror genre but 90% of the time I'm disappointed with the quality of the movies that are available.<br/><br/>This one has some of the classical problems of almost all horror movies. While the actors weren't terrible, or even bad, it was obvious from the start that they were just actors there to play a role. You don't get attached to any of them. Also, if an actor is going to have to fake an accent, then that actor needs to be able to pull it off. The mother was obviously trying very hard to mimic what she thought was ""old south"".<br/><br/>As for scares there really were none. Everything was rather predictable. But that may be a problem I have from watching so many horror movies. There are just only so many plot twists that can be done."

","This is not your typical ghost movie, where Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, who retires with her two children to a mansion towards the end of the Second World War. Her children are photo and sunlight sensitive and she hires three servants to care for them and the house; however, strange things start to happen shortly afterward and Grace believes her house is haunted.<br/><br/>Filmed in the Channel Islands, Spain, England and New York, this movie captures the brilliance and beauty of each place and the subtle aftermath of post-WWII. Alejandro Amenábar wrote and directed the movie, providing us with an eerie story full of mystery that will have you guessing where the plot turns and have you surprised at its unpredictability. Just the Mrs. Bertha Mills character, played by Fionnula Flanagan (who always look strange and mysterious to begin with), provides enough uncertainty and chills to the story, enhancing the overall suspense. However, there are some parts where the plot lines do not quite intertwine, which may confuse the audience, and is notorious in American ghost/horror movies.<br/><br/>Kidman did a fabulous job in her role, nonetheless, providing enough drama to captivate the audience.

"hall895","7","1","2","18 November 2013"," Stylish, subtle scares
","The Others is a ghost story but in this haunted house the scares are quite subtle. This is a movie which, to its great benefit, is more about the story than shocking, scary moments. To be sure there are some good frights sprinkled throughout. But nothing over-the-top. This movie is more interested in making you think than in frightening you. What exactly is going on in this house? It's a mystery the audience will be trying to solve right along with the characters. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, mother of two young children. The three of them live alone in an isolated house on the island of Jersey in the days immediately following the end of World War II. Grace's husband is presumed dead in the war. The family's servants just up and left in the middle of the night. Three new servants arrive at the house. And here things begin to get very interesting.<br/><br/>From the moment we meet them there is something slightly off about these new servants. An aging nanny, an elderly gardener and a mute young woman...they're quite the odd trio. But they know the house, having worked there before and Grace welcomes them in. But first Grace must explain the rules for the house, rules designed to keep all sunlight out as the children are so sensitive to the light it would kill them. This makes for a dark atmosphere which adds so much to the film, especially once things start to go bump in the night. Grace's daughter Anne sees the ghosts but Grace herself refuses to believe it. The servants, especially the nanny Mrs. Mills, seem to know more than they are letting on. It's pretty clear these servants hold the movie's secrets. What are those secrets? The fun for us is in finding out. Grace needs to find the answers too but it seems unlikely she'll find much fun in it.<br/><br/>Kidman is excellent in playing the loving, protective mother who is thoroughly harried by the unseen intruders in her home. Fionnula Flanagan is also terrific playing the mysterious Mrs. Mills who is somehow creepy even when she's not trying to be. Or maybe she is trying. Also notable are the performances of the young actors playing the children. James Bentley is quite good in playing the boy, Nicholas, but it is Alakina Mann, playing Anne, who is the true revelation. Mann turns in one of the best child acting performances you'll ever see, mature far beyond her years in playing a girl who sees ghosts and is not even freaked out by them, taking it all in her stride. Kudos to director Alejandro Amenábar for coaxing such fine performances from his cast and for creating such a creepy atmosphere. The movie's story is a smart one, building slowly but surely toward its big climax. There are enough hints sprinkled throughout that may let you figure things out before the characters do. So maybe when the ending comes it doesn't pack quite as much of a wallop as it would if you were totally stunned by it. But it is still all in all a very satisfying movie-watching experience. A good story with enough subtle little scares thrown in to keep happy those who are looking for chills and thrills."
"AterAlbus","7","1","2","11 November 2013"," Good ghost story with the style of an old movie
","In a time where most horror movies consist only on cheap scares and are not patient enough to build an appropriate atmosphere, ""The Others"" is a breath of fresh air and a welcome return to old-school horror.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a post-war era in an isolated house in the countryside. The Gothic aspect of the house helps to create a ghost novella feeling, with small rooms and doors closed that give a sense of claustrophobia. Added to that there is no electricity at the house, so all homework must be made old-school. In the house lives Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, who have an uncommon disease so they can't be exposed to the sunlight. One day three servants arrive at the house, disposed to help in the housework while Grace takes care of the children. Her husband never returned from the war and the old servants left the house weeks ago. Even so the arrival of these new persons make Grace suspicious, because in the moment they enter the house strange happenings begin to occur.<br/><br/>One of the surprises of ""The Others"" is at its style, similar to an old horror movie: the scenario, ambient, characters, even the storytelling. The film also seems to take elements from the classic novel ""The Turn of the Screw"", a book that inspired ""The Innocents"", an old horror movie reminiscent of this. I find it admirable the fact that Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar tries to take the audience into the old times, allowing the events to build slowly, even if this could be a problem for viewers accustomed to fast-paced modern horror movies. <br/><br/>""The Others"" is a solid haunted house story with a good script and interesting twists, but the highest point here is Nicole Kidman. She plays her character naturally, showing herself as a normal person facing difficulties, and not as the typical hysterical woman found in recent horror flicks.<br/><br/>Concluding ""The Others"" may be a good choice if you like old horror movies, suspense or want to see a good story. The film contains a revealing twist over the ending. I can assure you will be surprised, but I can't assure you will like it.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.4"
"mjcfoxx","8","1","2","7 July 2013"," The Turning of the Kidman
","It seems pretty apt that Kidman would replace Kerr in this subtly lifted inspiration from Henry James to the mind and talents of Alejandro Amenabar. Never mind that Cruise and Kidman were going through a divorce at the time, Tom still helped with the funding, probably feeling like he owed Amenabar one for letting him recreate Abra Los Ojas into the lackluster Vanilla Sky. The stirrings are creepy without being over-the-top, and the twist ending is plausible which makes re-watch palatable... though there's not quite enough character in the characters to see anything more than plot polishings when it's all said and done, Kidman does a fine job of providing an aura to the mother that's all but mostly absent from the script. We're never sure what makes her as she is and the history behind the family is as foggy as the island they can't seem to get away from. Oh man, another ten minutes of scenes just to flesh these characters out and we'd have a something of a Gothic masterpiece on our hands. So close!"

","This is an old film but I was just reading a few of the reviews. Personally I think Sixth Sense was a very good film with excellent performances but the so called twist was a little obvious. Surely it was obvious that Bruce Willis was already dead, he got shot at the beginning? He then had no interaction with anyone in the entire film apart from the boy, who could see ghosts, not to mentioned that he said halfway through the film that he sees dead people, but they don't know they're dead...<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed The Others more but Sixth Sense is really good film. Ghost stories are often associated with haunted & old houses The Others had atmosphere & great performances, particularly from Nicole Kidman. & the ending... I think Its rare that an entire film is taken from ghosts perspective so that was interesting & a different take on a familiar story. Some people may have seen the twist coming but it wasn't obvious that an entire family lived in the house & clairvoyant was trying to make contact."

","I love this film, have watched it so many times and never tire of it. A couple of things do annoy me slightly like some of the plot is just spelt out too obviously but apart from that I really cannot find fault.The acting is very good, even the children - especially Anne are exceptional. The constant low lighting and over panning really help the over all eerie feel and sense of the severity and urgency regarding the children's ""condition. It also gives a very claustrophobic feel to the point where you can see how much the lifestyle would drain anyone to the point of distraction. And I genuinely felt for the characters in this one, many emotions portrayed very well. ""The twist is fantastic and you really do not see it coming till the end unlike many films that have tried to re create this since. <br/><br/>SO, to sum up-I would recommend this highly to anyone and I don't recommend horrors lightly as I'm very picky and don't frighten easily!"

","I'm not usually a horror film fan; they tend to be schlocky, clichéd and full of characters that absolutely deserve whatever they get. But I am a fan of the more psychological horror films; The Others ticks all the right boxes for me. It has no special effects or gore for that matter, so it relies on moody lighting, a tense score, great acting and storytelling - at some points in the film, a combination of these things actually make broad daylight seem creepy. My only snagging point is the disease that the children have - they're photosensitive - so any exposure to sunlight will kill them. This is the basic set-up that the whole movie is based on, at first it may seem like a poor excuse to keep the house in perpetual darkness, but gradually it becomes a revelatory plot point. Now, if you're sharp, this light-sensitive ploy will be a dead giveaway right from the start."

It's a shame--and folks who do this sort of thing deserve to be tied up and forced to watch every episode of ""Three's Company""! The same can be said for those who insist on telling everyone about the twist in ""The Sixth Sense""--a film which, fortunately, I was able to watch before some dummy told me the spoilers!

","Talking about ""the others"" we're talking beyond any doubt about the best thriller movie ever! And not only! We're talking about a movie which twists to such an unbelievable extend the idea of what this kind of stories in art and literature represent, that makes you wonder if it could ever be possible in the future to have another example in this field that would add anything to what seems to have reached its absolute perfection. In ""the others"" we don't just have a story with threatening ghosts. We have an amazingly inspired twist, which through a breathless series of doubts and huge wonders, questions, and events which do not at all deviate from the scheduled flow of a very solid script, lead you finally to such a bitter, dark and – consequently yet surprisingly- extremely unexpected ending, that leaves you – and every other spectator- speechless on your sit. Yes, unexpected, because, though in a very artistic way indeed, the movie makes believe that it doesn't want to hide the truth, it gradually leads to it's perfect doubt, till it finally comes to its shocking, twisting revelation. There's no question that we're talking about one of the very best movies of all times! It's certainly the best for the ones who have a strong preference for thrillers. The double ""version"" of the scenes near the ""revelation"" and the ending, are really shocking and are exactly the ones which literally make any ghost story you have seen (or read) in the past, look and sound banal and trivial"
"daykaseya","8","1","2","25 October 2011"," Wicked storyline
","There aren't many negatives to ""The Others"" especially in terms of plot development, imagery, and acting/casting. The only thing I can say is that if you are a huge blood/gore horror movie fan, bypass this one. If you like eerie atmospheres and spooky ambiance, you'll be pleased with ""The Others"". <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays overbearing and religious mother, Grace Stewart to perfection. She's obviously overprotective, due to her two children's medical condition: xeroderma pigmentosum, or a sensitivity to sunlight. The two children, Anne and Nicholas are delightfully frightening in their own right. Grace's husband has left to fight in WWII, leaving the family alone in a large, and apparently haunted, house. Grace is alone with three, also frightening, housekeepers. She is overbearing, and her rules are extensive which leads to tension between Grace and all of the other characters in the film.<br/><br/>As Grace becomes more and more aware that there is a presence (or several) in the house, thanks largely in part to her daughter, her behavior becomes more and more erratic. ""The Others"" is full of delightful plot twists, and the children themselves are so hauntingly accurate in their portrayals of light and socially deprived children that the blood and gore so common in today's horror cinema is not missed. <br/><br/>The film picked up in the last half, which is when I caught on to several of the subtle hints that lead you to a not-so-obvious conclusion. Even though I swore I had the entire plot figured out, I was still delightfully shocked by some aspects of the ending. Viewers will be satisfied, I'm sure, and horror fanatics will be delighted by a film that strays from the norm of the genre. Easily an 8/10, which is only because of the rather slow-moving beginning. Happy haunting!"

","Alejandro Amenábar is among the brightest young filmmakers today. Though he has ridiculously been labeled, by some, as the next Pedro Almodovar, Amenábar surpasses Almodovar because he gives his all to a film and always stays true to the story rather than succumbing to meet studio standards. Amenábar is a passionate filmmaker. He really seems to believe in his work. His talents are not limited to directing as he is a successful screenwriter and music director too.<br/><br/>'The Others' is his first Hollywood movie and yet there is treated in a non-Hollywood way. In this day and age when special effects like CGI are used in every film, Amenábar goes the old fashioned way and perhaps the only bit of 'contemporary special effects' he uses is the green-screening. In an interview, he once mentioned that the expressions he has drawn from Nicole Kidman's eyes are much better than what any special effects could have done and this is actually quite true.<br/><br/>'The Others' is an atmospheric film. The director is clearly influenced by the likes of Kubrick. He succeeds wonderfully in creating a gloomy and chilling atmosphere using lots of subtlety. Lighting plays a key role both metaphorically and literally. Most of the scenes are either set in full daylight or sheer darkness. The noteworthy cinematography brings out the claustrophobia and loneliness and the breathtaking score adds to the spookiness.<br/><br/>Often compared to 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Others' goes steps further with its subtle multilayered storytelling. It is much more than just a horror film because there is plenty of psychology and philosophy included in the story. Amenábar has written a solid screenplay with intriguing and thought-provoking dialogue.<br/><br/>'The Others' is further blessed with remarkable performances. Fionnula Flanagan is terrific as the suspiciously creepy servant with a hidden agenda. Eric Sykes brings some humour to lighten up the very intense atmosphere. Elaine Cassidy too impresses with a subtle performance. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are awesome as the bratty mean sister and the scared little brother respectively. Christopher Eccleston too is very effective in a small role. However, it goes without saying, that top honour goes to Nicole Kidman. Kidman is sublime. The intensity with which she displays Grace's despair, fragility, anguish and maternal dedication is astonishing. It is a marvelous performance.<br/><br/>'The Others' may arguably be the best in 'horror' movies but it will be wrong to classify it in a specific genre because it works on so many levels. It is an absorbing film experience and something that has worked for me even after multiple viewings. I have lost count of how many times I have seen this amazing film."

I saw this movie for the first time in theater when it first came out and I must say I'm really glad I did, because its one of the finest thrillers I've seen. The movie has a thick atmosphere, especially because of the foggy surroundings and the mysterious mansion. The cast is small, but they sure give their full 100% because the acting never fails to deliver the great script that gets more intelligent as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Some people have been comparing this movie to The Sixth Sense, but they are not exactly the same. Yes they are both suspenseful thrillers and have a similar story-twist but I think The Others is better in terms of atmosphere. But overall if you love movies that get you on the edge of your seat the whole time, then this movie is definitely for you.<br/><br/>I just saw this movie recently again and I am just as impressed as I was 8 years ago when I first saw this film in theater.

It has a few contact points with other movies involving ghosts and children like for instance ""The Innocents"" or ""Shining"" though maybe not so scary like the latter(nevertheless of course a bit scary anyway like any ghost story worth of its title). But it has the advantage of having a very surprising end that will leave you almost breathless though not exactly horrified since it's even somewhat poetical. The acting is great not only by Nicole Kidman as the main character but above all by the two children that do extraordinary performances. The interior scenery of the old mansion where the story takes place is quite convincing and very much fit to the general atmosphere of the plot. A good movie indeed though not exactly a masterpiece because the story doesn't give great occasion to that classification in all its details since in these stories that mix natural with supernatural it's always difficult to make things logical and illogical at same time."

","There's no way in hell ""The Sixth Sense"" will ever gain my approval as a modern horror movie since he forgot to mention people that he based it on a kid's show called ""Are you afraid of the dark?"" with the episode being ""The Tale of the Dream Girl."" A month later in 1999, more ghost movies followed where there was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon proving to be more of an effective and original thriller. Other ghost movies followed but none will ever come close than ""The Others."" Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a widow to a soldier during the events of World War II who shelters two of her children, Anna and Nichols, in a mansion all by herself. Not only is she a fanatical Christian where she gives lectures and wants the children to remember certain things, but she doesn't allow the children to leave the house due to a skin disease they have. She hires help from Fionnula Flanagan who plays Bertha Mills, along with Eric Sykes (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) and Elaine Cassidy to assist her. Grace soon discovers weird things going around in her mansion before asking the children if they been horse playing and the housekeepers if they've been touching things and moving objects around that weren't suppose to move.<br/><br/>Suspicion turns to threats, threats lead to clues, and everything will be unravel sooner or later with a shocking ending.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Alejandro Amenábar's work, but as soon as I say ""The Others,"" all I have to say is that it's one hell of a movie beating the hell out of ""The Sixth Sense"" with its amazing cast and its edge of your seat/heart pounding moments making it one of my favorite horror movies of all time.<br/><br/>Like ""Alien,"" don't you dare see this film alone or in the dark."
"jzappa","8","1","2","6 February 2008"," Unusually Thoughtful and Affecting Ghost Film
","The reason Amenabar's work on The Others is so above the fare of a given ghost film is because it turns out to be a beautifully philosophical musing on death, how death is something even the dead are not prepared for, because the psychological fear assumed on earth overpowers the physical seamlessness the real thing may have. There is also an honest undercurrent of perspective on how religion may effect the mental state of afterlife, complemented by another concept that may or may not be hopeful or comforting to people, which is the idea that spiritual and materialistic connections in this life may carry over into the next.<br/><br/>The film flows gently like the English countryside it portrays, patiently executing a brilliant build-up of seemingly purposeless events and phantom motives that serve as exterior for the perfectly coinciding ones that later reveal themselves.<br/><br/>The multi-talented Alejandro Amenabar, who wrote, directed, and also scored the film, has crafted an unusually thoughtful and affecting ghost film. Nicole Kidman's nerve-shattered, heart-ravaged performance as the strict Catholic war widow who spends her life protecting her two photosensitive children gives just the right conservative, classical yet realistically drawn upon approach. Christopher Eccleston, playing Kidman's husband, may be quite dull, but Alakin Mann and James Bentley, playing Kidman's children, are either not from the assembly line of cryptic horror movie children or they're from a fresh batch."

Other than that, is it a brilliant story that offers subtle hints to point to the ending but you'll still be surprised.

","Not much time to write, but wanted to say that this is a first class ghost film, for people who like genuine suspense/chills, and a clever twist and interesting storyline. Most importantly for me, it is realistic and fulfills my belief in ghosts without overdoing the connection between 'living' and 'dead' worlds i.e. the whole thing is believable if you believe in ghosts unlike many so-called horror films which rely on silly sudden 'shocks' or effects or people with half their face hanging off but forget the underlying realism that is needed; you could probably find faults with it if you wanted to but if you want a creepy ghost film which has a sinister undertone throughout, and a few, although I would say enough, real shocks, then this is highly recommended. Yes there is a similarity between the endings when compared to The Sixth Sense, but that does not detract from the originality of this story; the ending in my opinion is absolutely superbly done, not a let-down at all. Also, well-directed and acted. The maid has a wonderful ambiguity about her, she is warm and understanding while also distant and a bit spooky - fantastically done. Sorry, need to expand more on this but gotta go. Simon"

","There has not been a decent horror movie like this one done in years. Today, horror movies have been replaced with splatter, blood and gore, redundant scenes of sex and nudity and million dollar special effects. This movie goes back to when you hid behind the comfort of your fingers over your eyes. It's done practically in the style of M. Night Shyamalan; it's taut, dark, riveting and has a thick atmospheric style with a touch of the macabre. Nicole Kidman gives an Academy Award performance as does Fionnula Flanagan who I have not seen since the ""Legend of Lizzie Borden."" I was expecting a simple end, but then it went one step further than my expectations. The excellent flawless score enhances the emotional state of the characters. All I can say is it's about time a horror movie was made that reflected the intelligence of its actors and creators and not the idiocy of tarnishing the intelligence of the audience."

I enjoy a movie that does not need to be done up in special effects or filled with cursing and nudity. You will not find any of this in this particular movie. Grace lives in a secluded mansion with her two children. Her husband went off to war and never returned. One day, three strangers appear at the doorstep of Grace's house. She hires them as servants and then strange things start to happen. The movie has some great scenes which scared the pants off of me! There are many twists in the movie which add a nice flavor to it.

","From time to time strange things happen to you. A strange desire, an urgent passion, or, who knows what else! One of the strangest and most macabre urges I've got is watching scary movies. Yes, you know it. That chill running down your spine, your heart pounding so loud the person next to you can hear it, eye lids closed, screams of terror, quickly followed by a shamefully amused giggle. That's the ride a good scary movie delivers for you. That's what ""The Others"" keeps you through.<br/><br/>It doesn't have a brilliant plot, the twists aren't ""dementially"" cool as in The Sixth Sense, but it's got a feel of terror embroidered on its frames. Yes, it gets that horrific in the best of ways! A mother and her children live in a huge house, alone, until a some new servants pop up in front of their door and commit to their housekeeping tasks. But there's something wrong about the whole thing from the very beginning. The fog, the house, the children, the words...it's a feeling that takes hold of you and doesn't really let you go until near the end. It's authentic psychological horror, brilliant in all regards, not showing any truly obnoxious images. And I've never seen anything like it. Even ""The Sixth Sense"" relies more on imagery and as I well recall, it wasn't all imagery there either. But - if I did start comparing it to The Sixth Sense - there's one more thing I need to add. There is a reasonable difference between the movies, especially regarding the emphasis. Shayamalan's movie relies on the ending and the ending is more than just the Cherry on top. Some will make the mistake to criticize ""The Others"" for a sloppy conclusion, but this simply can not be regarded as the movie's strong point. It's the inner force that thrives through its intense tale. The movie itself forces you to admire it, not a simple gimmick.<br/><br/>Nicole, I hate to admit it, is pretty damned good and the kids go just marvelous together. However, there will be those saying it's not ""that fresh"" and not ""all that original"". Even if there is some truth behind those statements, it's still the best film of its genre in years...and years to come, probably. A definite must for fans and a scrupulous ride for those weak of heart. Great Amenabar!"

","THE OTHERS (Los Otros) <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br/><br/>1945: While awaiting her husband's return from the war, a lonely young woman (Nicole Kidman) locks herself into their remote, fog-bound mansion to protect their children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) from a condition which renders them ultra-sensitive to natural light. But a number of strange occurrences lead her to believe the house may be haunted...<br/><br/>Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, THE OTHERS marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as THESIS (1996) and OPEN YOUR EYES (1997). Amenábar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.<br/><br/>Like THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) before it, THE OTHERS prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amenábar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjamín Fernández, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.<br/><br/>(English version)"

","This movie, starring Nicole Kidman as Grace, a deeply religious mother with two photosensitive children (Alakina Mann as Anne, James Bentley as Nicholas), starts with a mysterious trio of new servants (Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy and Fionnula Flanagan) being employed to look after the house, the garden, and to look after the children. The house is only lit by candles and the curtains must always be drawn in daylight, adding to the creepy feel of the piece.<br/><br/>The music is minimal and help the effect when strange things happen. The twists - first we find that the servants died fifty years earlier of TB and are buried in the garden, then (twist on twist) we find that Grace killed her children and then herself and their spirits live on. The intruders are not the people we think they are! There are several hints to point to this when you reflect on the film - Grace's husband Charles, who was at war, appearing out of the fog in the garden and then disappearing; the curtains being taken down by persons unknown; the boy Victor squabbling with the ghost children over the light; and the photographic 'book of the dead' (the one photo missing being the one of the three servants).<br/><br/>Does all this work? I'm not sure. There is certainly atmosphere throughout, and some shocks - but the ending felt like a cop-out in many ways. An interesting idea that just misses the mark."

","Before deciding to right this review, i read the reviews on Amazon and on the IMDb. After reading these, I got so wound up about people saying that this film is not scary or is boring that i wrote this. This IS a horror film, granted not an obviously scary film or a slasher film. If you like films like Friday 13th then the chances are you won't like this. This is a very intelligent film and granted very slow, however this enhances the tension and the ambiance of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is near perfect with Kidman putting on a fantastic performance. However for me Flanagan is the stand out star. She is both genuine yet creepy at the same time. <br/><br/>Another reason why this film is so clever is that it is completely unreliant on special effects which is a very pleasing to see, and the isolation the character feels is emphasized by the location on a Gothic country house on Jersey.<br/><br/>There are only a handful of characters which is another pleasing sight so you are not always trying to remember names. The children are very well acted although the boy has a tendency to be rather annoying especially in the last two scenes. You genuinely felt empathy for the characters and you cared about them unlike in recent films.<br/><br/>As for the twist at the end, anyone who says they predicted the twist in the first twenty minutes, is lying. The ending is truly surprising and appropriate.I love this film and the DVD is one of my favourite in my collection. The film has replay value but is best watched when its dark. Happy Viewing"
"Bergmaniac","4","1","2","17 May 2004"," Boring, slow and overrated
","Why this movie is rated so high on this site will remain one of the misteries of the Universe to me. The only reason I can think of is because of the people's obssession with the twists at the end. But even so, the ending of this movie is not that good either. But even if it was excellent, it still couldn't have been able to make up for the boring hour and twenty minutes before that.<br/><br/> Possible SPOILERS:<br/><br/>I would also have to make the comparison with ""The Sixth Sense"" which had very similar plot twist and story. But the difference is that ""The sixth Sense "" was still interesting and engrossing movie even though I knew the ending before i started watching it(a stupid newspaper review spoiled it for me). It had characters who were very well developed, smart dialogue, great acting, superb directing. All those those things were sorely missing in ""The others"". And for me, ""The others"" had a lot more plotholes. I figured out most of the famous twist about 15 minutes into the movie, although it took me much longer to guess the other part, and it still surprised me a little bit in some details. But really it's not that good and when you think more about it, doesn't really make sense. END SPOILERS<br/><br/> Leaving the twist aside, it should also be said that for supposedly horror movie this one wasn't scary at all for me. It had all the classic elements(the haunted house, ghosts, the constant fog, the suddenly booming music) but couldn't make it work. The  mediocre camera work also didn't help. The only times I got scared a little bit was because of the sudden sound ""explosion"", which combined with the constant whispering in the dialogue created some scary, but in the most boring and non-creative way, moments. I don't like being scared by such cheap tricks, and it was more of a surprise than a real scare. The acting wasn't that good too. I love Nicole Kidman, she's a great actress which gave some stunning performances in ""The hours"", ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Dogville"", but here she's far from her best, whispering and shouting all the time, looking too rigid and wooden and didn't gave me the impression of being really scared when she was supposed to be(you can hardly blame her for the last bit though, those ""scary"" scenes were pretty lame). The children were good, but nothing special. I must say that this film was moving extremely slowly, even though it's only an hour and a half long. Too many repetitive scenes, too much repetitive dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, this movie had one of the worst I have seen of late. One example of that is the fact how many times the characters said to each other ""Stop breathing"" or ""Don't Breathe"". Overall, a big disappointment for me. 4/10"
"kintopf432","6","1","2","29 March 2004"," Another disappointing ""twist"" movie
","Yet another movie that seems to believe a good twist at the end can make up for a multitude of sins.  This one is little more than poor man's Shyamalan, though it takes for its inspiration `classy' horror movies like `The Innocents,' `The Haunting,' and `The Changeling' instead of the pulp that fuels M.N.S.'s celluloid nightmares.  And certainly `The Others' can't be faulted for poor taste.  On the contrary, it approaches its Gothic subject matter with great sobriety--it has whispers in the dark, and mysterious footsteps upstairs, and a sinisterly knowing staff, and a fog so unvarying that you wonder why anybody's the least bit worried about sunlight. Unfortunately, because this straightfaced approach doesn't coincide with any particular directorial style or verve, it only serves to make the creaky haunted-house subgenre feel even creakier.  None of the characters are particularly well developed (Alakina Mann at least gives a performance that's convincing, bratty, and fun, but Nicole Kidman, whose two modes of line delivery here are Severe Hiss and Severe Shout, has been almost as overrated for this as she was for `Moulin Rouge').  When the twist comes, it's certainly a good idea, but then the script has to go and explain it and explain it and explain it.  And the biggest problem is the same with this as it often is with Shyamalan--it's all too obvious the twist came first, and then all the rest of it was just shoveled in more or less haphazardly.  To be fair, `The Others' is never laughable or unbearable, exactly, but it never gets all that scary either, and it's disappointing to think what a good creepy movie might have been built (even working backwards) from this particular twist premise.  6 out of 10."

","The performances are all marvelous -- most especially the young girl and Fionnula Flanagan.  Kidman was just a tad too flamboyant for me in spots, one scene in particular conjuring up images of Nancy Kelly in the Bad Seed -- but overall, she was more than up to the task at hand.  The suspense is real, and the visuals are quite well done.  The sound track, sound effects, make-up, and costumes are all first-rate.  <br/><br/>But, for me, the flimsiness (these days called delicacy and cheered by critics -- all things run in cycles) of the storyline and transparency of the twists make this an unmemorable time-killer.  If you're into this kind of movie, it's probably worth an 8/10 -- for me 6/10 was the right number."

","and by that, I mean Alfred Hitchcock.  Just watched this for the first time, without knowing anything about it, on DVD on our home theatre system.  This movie makes full use of the back channels, so if you're just watching it on a regular TV, you're going to miss the full surround experience of hearing things go bump behind you.  The plot twists and music reminded both my wife and myself of Alfred Hitchcock.  I thought it was slow at first, but it just pulled us in a little more at a time.  Lovely scenery, and a reminder that you can make an interesting horror movie without gallons of gore."
"jpozenel","8","1","2","22 June 2003"," Excellent acting, very good story
","Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan were both excellent in this movie. The story was quite good, but the interaction between their characters made the movie for me.  I never paid much attention to Nichole Kidman until just recently.  I guess it was because she was married to Tom Cruise who, for the most part, I consider to be just an awful actor.  I was wrong to discount her acting ability because of their association. Still, I can't see what she ever saw in him and I'm not surprised that it's over between them.<br/><br/>
As far as other people's comments about the story being a rip-off of the Sixth Sense, I feel that kind of thinking is ridiculous.  Both movies where very good and I enjoyed them equally (maybe the Sixth Sense a bit more.)  It never even crossed my mind until I read some of the other IMDB comments. Why can't people just allow themselves to be entertained without being so negative and looking for fault with everything?  They remind me of the people that used to write letters to the editors of the Superman and Batman comic books when I was a kid, that were always trying to point out errors. They just can't allow themselves to be happy."

"glgioia","Null","1","2","13 March 2003"," M.R. James, Finally Done Justice in Film
","Excellent ghost story set at the close of the Second World War about a widowed mother, and her 2 children living on a huge, classically creepy estate. Things begin to go astray when a mysterious trio of servants moves in. Wow, pleasantly surprised at the reaction on the board to this, I expected people to hate it. Thought I was one of the few who still appreciated gothic horror. Of the spawn of The Sixth Sense, you have the abysmal Dragonfly on the one end, this, The Others, at the opposite. Might even be better than The Sixth Sense for sheer creepiness. It lacks the gore, and obsequious visual shock of TSS, but more so than TSS, sticks to the original game plan; to frighten us. I have found, the fright element in TSS by the end of the film is all but beaten out of it, as it becomes more of a human drama piece. Not so here. The Others is a more narrow ranged, and I mean that positively, exercise in good old-fashioned atmospheric horror. It builds slowly and brings you closer and closer to a very effective, and frightening climax. It relies heavily upon scenery, weather, lighting, costume...all of the old forgotten tools. Most if not all of the fear is implied, and left for your imagination to fill in the blanks. I like that. This honestly could have been rated G, and the only reason, I'm sure it wasn't simply an attempt to spare it doom at the box office, is that film is just too frightening for kids. Highly recommended."
"sexy_grandpa","10","1","2","10 January 2003"," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! FLAWLESS!!! AN EASY 10/10!!!
","I think I can positively say that this is easily the best movie of 2001! Definitely one of the best ever made! Where do I begin?<br/><br/>ACTING: The acting in this film is absolutely amazing! Kidman puts on an extremely convincing performance as Grace. By far the best she has ever done. Fionulla Flanagan (is that what it is) is also exceptional and Ed Sykes is great and adds some humour to the movie without being stupid or ridiculous. But the absolute stars of the show were Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Graces two children! The acting these youngsters put on is absolutely MINDBLOWING!!! Mann (who plays Anne) is unspeakably brilliant as Anne and is totally convincing. It is very difficult to describe her performance. It is brilliant beyond words. Bentley, who plays Nicholas, is absolutely jawdroppingly brilliant also. He looks genuinely terrified in the suspense scenes. These two actors deserve a future in acting. But as we all know, most of the best kid actors end up going nowhere (see Danny Loydd from The Shining or Linda Blair from The Excorcist.) But enough of that now.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: Alejandro Amenabar does outstanding direction in this film. The angles are all appropriate and add to the atmosphere. Not one is out of place.  The lighting is in my opinion the best ever in a film. The atmosphere of this film is truly intense.<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY/SCORE: As well as directing the film, Alejandro Amenabar also wrote all of the screenplay and the score. These are both outstanding. The music adds to the creepy atmosphere and fits together perfectly.<br/><br/>OTHER: One of the things I admire most about this film is the fact that it doesn't rely on Gore or visual effects of any sort to scare. There is not an ounce of violence in the entire film. Suspense is what scares the most, and this has it in bucketloads! There are a couple of shocks, but that doesn't make it at all less scary!<br/><br/>MATTERS OF THE SIXTH SENSE: One thing about this fim I can't understand is the fact that people can possibly compare it to THE SIXTH SENSE, let alone call it a RIPOFF!!! The only thing that they have in common is the (!***SPOILER***!!!)twist at the end. Its like saying Apocalypse Now is a rippoff of The Deer Hunter because they were both set in the Vietnam war! I read a review on here saying it failed to capture the spirit of the 6th Sense. This is ridiculous! Its not even trying to catch that spirit! It is unique and IMHO is FAAAR superior to that movie!<br/><br/>Another thing I fail to understand is that people say it is long, boring and slow. This is completely insane!!! The movie is only 100 minutes! I found every moment completely engrossing and entertaining! The people who thing it is slow must have a serious case of A.D.D!!! If you want slow and boring, watch the English Patient, because THE OTHERS is NOT SLOW!!!<br/><br/>So if you havent seen this movie, I don't know what you could possibly be waiting for. Because in my heart, it is beyond classic status!"

","Strong performance and good cinematography are the only real redeeming values in this film.  The plot really goes nowhere, trying to rely on only moderately creepy atmosphere.

"KelticKarma","Null","1","2","29 August 2002"," Watch it twice...
","I really loved this film.<br/><br/>In ""unbiased observer"" mode first of all, the things that most stood out for me were the performances of the two children; I felt that they were given great lines (credit to the writer, of course) and, most importantly, they delivered them so well. The relationship between the children was very real, teasing and loving by turns. Haley J Osment, look and learn !<br/><br/>Kidman did a great job on the accent. I had the misfortune to watch Jodie Foster try her posh English accent out in ""Anna & The King"" the night before, and I can tell you now, being a great actress (as Jodie is) does not automatically endow one with the gift of tongues.<br/><br/>A lot of things didn't sit right with me when first I saw this film. I couldn't work out the reason for the animosity between Kidman's character and her daughter Anne, and between Kidman and the ""sinister"" servants. This is why I say watch this film twice. Although the ending resolves all issues, there are so many subtle nuances in the interactions between the characters prior to this that are very easy to miss the first time around. And make so much sense on a second viewing.<br/><br/>-SPOILERS (if you haven't seen this film yet - shame on you !)-<br/><br/>I know there are people who have posted here who have said they worked out all the plot within five minutes. I find this hard to believe. I am a fairly intelligent person, I watch a lot of films, and I must say that I was taken in.<br/><br/>I can't accept the verdict of other posters that this film was a rip-off of Sixth Sesne either. Yes, SS was a very good film too, but not nearly in the same league as Others. Sure, you have the same base ingredient - people who are unaware they are dead - but I would always have put SS into the same league as ""Ghost"". The Others is much deeper, in that Kidmans character is an infanticide, and unaware of this horror; she plays the role perfectly, so protective of the children she herself killed. The sinister servants turn out to be helpers, subtly guiding her and the children to a realisation of their state; this latter strand put me in mind of the chiropodist/angel from ""Jacobs Ladder"".<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but won't.<br/><br/>I think that how one was brought up plays a great role in how one views a story like this. Some people go to see a horror film hoping to see CGI ghosts leaping from cellars. What these people are really after is gore, and would be much more satisfied with Russ Meyers' movies.<br/><br/>What really got me about this film (and this is where the ""biased"" observer part comes in) is the memories I retain from my own childhood. When I was in my very early teens, my parents took me to stay in a house which was very similar to the one featured in this film. It was an old Manor House, in the grandest of Anglo-Irish traditions, with few guests, and few servants. One evening, I went to the top of the house, and found a small doorway just adjacent to what would, I think, have been the servant's quarters at the turn of the last Century. Going in, I found before me an attic corridor stretching ahead for some distance - this was a big house !  Being in the eaves, the roof was just above my head, and all was painted pure white. There were four rooms to the left, and four to the right. The place was clean, and tidy, but obviously hadn't been occupied for a long time. Each room was tiny, and painted white, and contained nothing but small mementoes of the past, untouched and unarranged; a doll's house in one room, a rocking horse in another etc. And in each tiny room, a cat, sometimes two or three, peering out from behind these artifacts. As a child,  these images were disturbing, but I couldn't for many years figure out why. It was only as I got older that I began to appreciate that the disquieting thing about these abandoned rooms was the lack of children, and, at the same time, the overwhelming sense that they were still there.<br/><br/>""The Others"" struck a big chord with me, not least because it stirred memories buried for a long time, but also because it is full of great scenes, is brilliantly characterised, and the performances throughout ring as true as they possibly could in a ""ghost story"".<br/><br/>But... watch it twice....."
"Mephisto-24","10","1","2","29 August 2002"," Truly haunting
","THE OTHERS is a superbly scary film.  Its intelligent script rivals that of THE STONE TAPE or THE SIXTH SENSE, and the performances and production values are even better than in Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING.

Anyone who has seen HAUNTED with Aidan Quinn plus the episode ""My So-Called Life and Death"" of the short-lived TV anthology NIGHT VISIONS will not be surprised by THE OTHERS.  And there are probably many other previous tellings of the same basic story.  It all adds up quickly: No electricity, no telephone, the postman never comes, and the priest doesn't visit anymore.  It's not too hard to figure out the ""twist"" and where Victor and his family fit into it. ********END SPOILERS******<br/><br/>Despite finding the story predictable, I'd recommend this movie to people because the story is told well and with atmosphere.

It was a pretty routine ghost story in many ways (except for the predictable plot twist that I won't describe because trying to figure it out might be the only thing that would make this worthwhile for some folks) which means that since the genre has been done to death (no pun intended) it wasn't particularly frightening, unless strange noises from upstairs, and piano playing when no one's at the piano and doors slamming into Nicole Kidman's face frighten you.<br/><br/>Ho hum is the best way to describe this effort, which (I'm feeling generous) I'll give a 4/10."

Kidman, her kids and the servants are disturbed by this and the movie shows us the fight on how they try to solve the problem. But the movie is deeper. It is about trust and believing. It is about what the past, present and maybe even the future can tell us. What is present anyway? It's all relative. > Kidman's son in the movie is really convincing and makes your hair raise on your arms and your head. Really worth watching.

","War World II has finished, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a huge foreboding mansion. Grace sadly, and perhaps naively, awaits the return of her husband, who went off to fight. Currently Grace has no home help, but she doesn't have to worry for too long. One day three people knock on the door and offer to be her servants. Grace not only needs help for the garden and cleaning but also for her children, who are photosensitive, which essentially means they are allergic to light. Keeping the children away from all light, except for dim candle-light, is a hard job, and this has taken it's toll on poor Grace. But soon Grace will have something else to worry about.<br/><br/>A weird noise here, a bizarre occurrence there. Strange things are happening in the house. Is it ghosts? Is it Grace's imagination? Or is she going mad? And do the three servants have anything to do with this, or are they innocent bystanders?<br/><br/>When the credits started rolling, I didn't know what to make of this film. I had enjoyed it for the most part, but near the end I started to wonder whether the film really was as smart as it thought it was. I had heard the film contained a nice twist, and when I watched what I thought was supposed to be the twist I was greatly disappointed. But I was wrong, and the film had a little bit more to go. I enjoyed the twist, but I don't think it's of jaw-dropping quality. Which is quite like the whole movie, very understated. If you only like big action movies, this isn't for you. I enjoyed the slow pace of the film, and the score is very nice, along with the cinematography. I enjoyed all the performances, with the children being stand-outs, and Nicole Kidman as good as ever. One complaint is that I would have liked more scenes with Lydia.<br/><br/>In the first half of the film there were several scenes, that while not boring, I thought weren't as amazing as the movie seemed to make of them. However, upon finding out of the twist I feel these scenes would have a bigger impact on me. So I certainly will be going back for a second viewing.<br/><br/>
I have seen the other film by writer/director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los ojos, and enjoyed it greatly, and I look forward to seeing more films from him.<br/><br/>Whether this is a good or great film doesn't really matter, have no doubt, this is a very fine film. I just didn't know how good it was. I couldn't decide whether to give it an 8 or 9. If I could, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. But I can't, so...<br/><br/>8/10"

Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance as a protective mother of two photosensitive children, as does Fionnula Flannagen as Mrs Mills, the housekeeper.  The film is brilliantly shot and the old house in which the story takes place makes for a dark (because of the children's sensitivity to light), almost gothic setting, complimented by Ms Kidman's gorgeous porcelain appearance.  The Spanish director, whose name eludes me, creates a beautifully chilling environment and employs some gloriously creative cinematography.<br/><br/>Final kudos must also go to the veteran British actor, Eric Sykes, who despite his well-known deafness gives a well timed and classically executed performance as the rather dead-pan gardener.  However, my biggest round of applause belong, unquestionably, to the two child actors.  Both of them will go far.  They were both brilliant, but particularly the little girl who played Anne (she was hilarious).<br/><br/>The only criticism would be Christopher Eccleston's short little cameo. Getting such a big actor for such a tiny bit-part, for me, just seemed to distract from the story.<br/><br/>8/10!"

","'The Others' may be Alejandro Amenabar's most conventional film to date, but it is an effective and creepy old fashioned supernatural thriller, and continues the promise shown by his first two (highly recommended) movies 'Tesis' and 'Abre Los Ojos'. While I can't stand Nicole Kidman at the best of times I must admit she convinces as a nervous and overly protective mother trying to figure out the increasingly unsettling situation she finds herself in. This is arguably her best performance since 'Dead Calm' all those years ago. She is supported by two talented child actors (Alakina Mann and James Bentley, both making their film debuts), and a solid cast of character actors - Fionnula Flanagan ('How The West Was One'), veteran British comedian Eric Sykes ('The Plank'), Elaine Cassidy ('Felicia's Journey'), and (briefly) Christopher Eccleston ('Shallow Grave').

And many cliches later, you have the ultimate cliche, which would, yes, be that funny little cute little twist that smacks of The Sixth Sense. I liked it with Bruce Willis. I was ready to walk out after enduring an hour and a half of Nicole Kidman in one of the worst-scripted roles I've seen in a while. (She chases ghosts with a rifle - yes, it's true - and I was trying hard not to laugh out loud and disrupt the theater.)<br/><br/>Not that she can act very well, either, but that's beside the point; i'll give her the benefit of the doubt here and put Eyes Wide Shut, and this bomb of a script, out of mind.<br/><br/>What's good?

I knew it would come out why the girl is mute, i knew they would tell us the big deal with all the ghosts, it was just a matter of time. It's usually the responsibility of the director (and writer; in this case, the same unfortunate soul) to make sure we care why the girl is mute. In this case, feh. You know, I liked the candles but I didn't like Kidman drawing out the explanation, like it's some big mystery, like maybe we won't find out. Of course we find out. So tell us up front. Waiting on something like that does not make a movie. And that waiting WAS the entire movie.

","Agree with other reviewers here that this was one of the best ghost stories to come out in a long time.  Why Kidman did not at least get an Oscar nom for her performance is puzzling.  The two young child actors were great too. Moreover, it's amazing Alejandro Amenabar not only wrote and directed the film, but wrote the score as well (with its heavy echoes of Bernard Hermann's VERTIGO score throughout -- most excellent!).<br/><br/>While ostensibly a supernatural thriller ala THE SIXTH SENSE (which I also enjoy for different reasons), this story is really one big parable -- it's message is that organized religion does not hold all the answers for us in this life.  It's a subtle theme but definitely there, illustrated by two scenes:   when Kidman's character admonishes her son to pray with his crucifix and tells him that all will be well; and when she chastises her daughter during the school lesson for making the choice to deny Christ and that those who do end up in limbo -- these scenes are paid off brilliantly in the ending when Kidman's daughter asks, ""Where are we?""<br/><br/>For any of this to make sense, you'll have to rent it and keep an eye out for the above scenes.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Oooooh, scary movie? Well, not in the vein of, say, ""Carrie"" or ""Halloween"". (Scary gore-fests are a bit passé, aren't they?) No, this is an intelligent ghost story. The premise is not an original idea, but it's extremely well presented. Nicole Kidman turns in another effortless excellent performance without outshining her fellow actors, so we also get the full benefit of the fine contributions from unknowns (at least to me) Fionnula Flanagan as the housekeeper and Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Kidman's character's children. After seeing the faithful -but-tedious ""Potty Harry"", it's very refreshing to see child actors doing their job really convincingly and movingly. Meanwhile Eric Sykes as the gardener brings just the right combination of gravitas and ""Ho ho, I know what's going on and you don't"".<br/><br/>The direction is mostly subtly effective, and very occasionally not-so-subtly effective, in particular during the ""Oh so *that's* what's going on"" pharyngoedema[1]-inducing scene near the end.<br/><br/>Most of the time this film rolls along nicely at 8/10, but it briefly hits 10/10 with the afore-mentioned revelatory scene so I'm prepared to overlook the utter implausiblity of the premise and give it 8.5/10. Not an absolute must-see but definitely a pleasure to have watched it.<br/><br/>[1]: a made-up term meaning approximately ""lump-in-the-throat"""

The whole point of a suprise ending is that you don't expect it.  It wasn't suspenseful so count that out.  It was obvious through the whole movie that something didn't fit.  Maybe that's what they were trying to accomplish: showing us how obvious it should have been but how hard it was for them to realize the truth.  It wasn't a bad movie but it certianly wasn't a good movie.  It copied Sixth Sense in so many ways but totally failed where Sixth Sense succeeded so dramatically.  I just couldn't wait for this movie to be over and I'm shocked at how high the ratings are on IMDB."
"Steve-176","Null","1","2","12 November 2001"," A mother and two children are living alone in a large Jersey house. Things seem a little strange. Very well crafted, moody haunted house thriller.
","Who hasn't known ghosts? I grew up listening to a man breathing in various cupboards around my house as I went to sleep. Both my mother and I heard him clearly. We didn't consider him malevolent, he was just there.<br/><br/>	My wife and I have heard a very unhappy, spectral woman, in broad daylight, weeping loudly in a corridor of our former house, repeatedly, over two days.<br/><br/>
        I certainly believe in ghosts! And I'm not particularly psychic. I've also known of a tall old cupboard that independently spooked certain guests to the house we were living in at the time. They'd back out of the room, uneasily. I'm sure that many of you can tell similar stories.<br/><br/>	The Others is a very neatly made, subtle, measured, haunted house thriller starring Nicole Kidman. <br/><br/>        It doesn't rely on digital effects to scare or unsettle the viewer, rather putting emphasis on strangeness. The early cues are auditory. We know we're in ghost territory when those violins start screeching in that time honoured spooky way.<br/><br/>        There aren't many sudden bangs or shakes in this strange house, not extravagantly anyway, but we're led to expect that something nasty and frightening will happen. That's understood, hinted by the mood of this beautifully crafted film.<br/><br/>        Nicole Kidman plays Grace, an overly protective mother looking after her children Anne and Nicholas in a large rural house on the island of Jersey just after WW2. <br/><br/>        She's waiting for her husband to come home from the war. The children are apparently photosensitive and can't be allowed to come into contact with sunlight so all of the curtains are closed in the house and the doors are sequentially locked as Grace, the children and the staff move through the house.<br/><br/>        The staff headed by Mrs Mills (fine Irish actress Fionnula Flanagan) get about their business within the rules set by their mistress. <br/><br/>         Writer/director, Chilean born, Spain based, Alejandro Amenabar has created a moody, thriller. He also composed the music.<br/><br/>        Nicole Kidman gives a fine performance again emphasising her superior acting skills. Grace is forceful but fraught, elegant but severe.<br/><br/>         The tension rises. Fifty women screamed together while I was in the cinema. I jumped. I might have screamed too.<br/><br/>4 Grey Flys Out Of Five"

","I've never been a Nicole Kidman fan, but found her disturbingly authentic here as a prim and proper widow on the edge of her coping skills.  Her neurotic orthodoxy and nunnery-brand discipline are simply crutches to carry her character through what would be a ghastly existence of having to raise children in a large, necessarily dark and gloomy mansion... while silently grieving the loss of husband and father killed the war.  Who wouldn't go a little nutty under such circumstances?<br/><br/>The Others does borrow from the plot of another recent hit movie, but is different enough in style and execution that it certainly warrants a movie theater viewing.  I don't hold myself out to be a professional critic, so take it for what it's worth when I say that The Others is intricate, occasionally plodding, but certainly chilling."

","I suffered this over-rated film last night, so now you don't have to.  The plot is thin, shabby and largely second hand.  Plot points are delivered with granite-slab subtlety, and things happen that defy even the story's own fragile, self-contained reality.  Why does the husband appear at all?  How unlikely and contrived are the McGuffins buried under the leaves?  People seem to have confused lack of pace and creakingly dull storytelling with ""atmosphere"".  All reviews mention ""the twist"", so you're going to spend a good minute and a half trying to work it out - and you'll be right!  And while I admit one scene did actually make me jump, if you lock me in a dark room in front of something this dull almost any loud noise will startle me awake.  Despite the hymns of praise to the contary, Nicole Kidman is also quite weak in the lead role."

","I went to see this movie last night, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance throughout; she is really quite remarkable. While the movie does sag in many places, losing its flow and opening the door to boredom, it more than makes up for it with the twists towards the end. Obviously the film-makers were quite aware that many people are familiar with ""The Sixth Sense""'s twist ending - and the movie hence plays on this, introducing one twist, only to find out that that twist descends into another one. The acting throughout is flawless, particularly Kidman - who gives an air of dignity and class to her character. Comparisons to Henry James's ""Turn of the Screw"" are inevitable. Recommended."
"Falcon-43","10","1","2","1 November 2001"," Wow, what can I say. The best movie I've seen all year.
","It was with some trepidation that I went to see the Others. Although I'd heard a lot of good things about it, I've just recently seen Jeepers Creepers, and had begun to fear that all of this years hallowe'en movies were going to suck. Over the first 45mins, I really thought I had made a mistake, little did I know that the film was slowly and cunningly drawing me deeper and deeper into the story. Although it is very slow to build, without this, it would have fallen flat on its face very quickly. You can't help but begin to feel for the characters and you also find yourself terrified of the house.<br/><br/>Not only does this film encourage you to second guess the events as they unfold, it is constantly revealing tiny snippets of plot which throw you straight off the scent. In fact, it is so clever that any more mention of the plot will spoil the entire film. Suffice to say that the Sixth Sense'll never know what hit it when this film opens.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman was excellent. She really is a good actress, the nuances of her performance, and her interaction with her children and the servants is superb. Mrs Mills (can't remember the actresses name) was also great. The real revelation of the movies was the two young children. They gave great performances laced with terror, but with a humourous touch. Their childhood naivety conflicting with the things they have read and seen.<br/><br/>Recently, I've noticed a trend for the studios to reveal far too much of the story in the trailers for their films. For example, all of the funny parts of American Pie 2 were in the trailer, slightly dulling their impact in the film. Those of you who have seen the trailer for The Others may think that you've seen most of the plot and that it will have been spoiled. Don't be fooled, the trailer hardly scratches the surface of this wonderful piece of film-making.<br/><br/>Overall, I can hardly fault it. The acting is fantastic, the direction is superb. The lighting was uniformly excellent. But most of all, the plot and story were thrilling. Go see this film. But if anyone tries to talk to you about it, cover your ears and run away. You really want to enjoy it in all its glory."

","I liked this movie.  It wasn't great, and falls far short of the Sixth Sense, to which it is often compared, but it was still a good movie.  The scene is England, 1945, and revolves around a woman (Kidman) who has lost her husband to the war and is isolated in this mansion with her two children afflicted with a condition which makes them vulnerable to light.  The children must spend their lives in candlelight.<br/><br/>The movie has a few surprises, and there will be no spoilers here. I will just comment that the movie moves rather slowly for the first two-thirds or so, but does pick up at the end and did provide me with some jumps.  You are rewarded in the end for allowing the movie some character and plot development.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, and I was impressed by the two children's performances.  Kidman was fine, as was whoever played the old lady servant (OK, I'm too lazy to look it up now).  The movie was more spooky than scary for the most part.  The scary parts are due more to timing and development than gratuitous violence (there is none of that here).  <br/><br/>My warning is that the movie is not for those with short attention spans, or for those who need a shock every two minutes to keep their attention.  This movie unfolds like a good book, introducing the characters and slowly giving you the stories behind the people and withholding most of the action until the end when you better understand who the events are happening to.  I gave it a 6/10, which, to me, says it is better than average."

I think the people who say this is because they went to the cinema alone and they were simply greedy of the couples that were scared and holding each others hands and arms very tight because of the fear. For those who say that its a copy of the sixth sense, let's remind them that the story was written long time before the release of this film (just check out). NIcole Kidman is the actual ""woman on top"" (of her career). She's at her best in this film, as the rest of the cast. The name of the character (Grace) and her style is a clear homage to the late Grace Kelly, Hitchcock's muse. The whole film looks like an all time classic, like Rebecca or Vertigo. Its photography is near perfection, the music and the timing make your heart nearly stop, the story is really well thought and it makes you suspect of somebody, then of somebody else, then think one thing, then another, and at the end everything make sense...I can't tell yo more than that you have to go to see this great movie... Anyway, time will tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if Amenabar will be considered, in a few years, like a new Hitchcock or Welles.

","Only once in a very long while does an excellent horror flick happen to be playing in that cinema that you swore was offering a horror flick when you paid that ticket price.  More often that not, what you are offered is a special-effecstravagansa that's like that cold spaghetti you stuck your hand into at the carnival when you were a kid.  It's sensuous, definitely horrible, but not really all that scary.<br/><br/>Then again, once in a while, someone like Amenabar demonstrates what we all knew as kids: Nothing bites in the dark like your own imagination!  The atmosphere of ""The Others"" is, as you might expect, dark and cold, set upon the classic Lovecraftian tale of a tragically broken family trying to live in the past.  The tone of the movie is established *very* quickly (there is no time wasted!) but allowed to mature more slowly as bit by bit we discover more about Grace, her family, and the mysterious servants.  The tension rises slowly; ""The Others"" teases you with whispers and creaking doors, relying on the marvelous use of consecutively dark and bright rooms to generate a kind of confusion between the reality and nightmare that permeate the house. <br/><br/>
Don't worry though, when ""The Others"" wants you to jump, you'll jump.  My housemate was airborne, while I'd much more sensibly taken cover behind the seat in front of me.  I haven't done that since my Dad took me to see ""Misery"" when I was twelve!  The beauty is that it isn't usually the events themselves that are scary; Chainsaws, Baseball bats, and/or men hanging from the ceiling are notably absent.  When you walk out of the theatre, you're not talking about inconsistencies, or how original the story was.  You're just trying to convince your friends that you weren't just ducking under the seats to cower with the spilt popcorn!<br/><br/>Verdict:  CGI gore and freak-a-minute junkies stay away.

","This is a return to an old tradition in the horror genre: the haunted house film.  Many would argue that this particular subgenre has already been revived by such films as _The Sixth Sense_ and _What Lies Beneath_, but I would reply that this movie, with its excellent writing, acting, and mise-en-scene, shows just how silly and amateur those other films really are.<br/><br/>One of the main attraction of this film is Nicole Kidman, and that is rightfully so.  She is as brilliant in the film as she was in _Eyes Wide Shut_ (perhaps more so) as a mother who is at once religiously fanatic and deeply compassionate towards her children.  It is this sort of moral ambiguity that makes this film so delightful and fulfilling throughout.<br/><br/>The visual effects in the movie, although subtle, are nothing short of amazing.  The foggy landscape around the house and the dark, moody tone of the entire film set a tone in which the scares seem perfectly in step with the rest of the movie, as well as the emotions of the central characters.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the script is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It maintains a careful pace (neither too slow or fast- a pitfall that claims many haunted house films) while slowly building to an unforgettable and logically sound conclusion (which seems to be less and less valued in big studio films these days, although it is an element with importance that cannot be estimated.)<br/><br/>All in all, this is terrific filmmaking.  Here's hoping we see more horror films of this caliber soon."

The Others is a tense, carefully crafted ghost story,<br/><br/>similar to the Sixth Sense, but different in so many other ways as well. The slow build up only adds to the suspense, and when finally you get to experience ""the others"" as I guess they are called, the whole audience burst into screams of<br/><br/>pure terror. The dimly lit scenes give you an odd sense, where dark is more<br/><br/>comforting than light (due to a disease that can kill the children if they are exposed to bright light). Nicole Kidman really knows how to act, and she shows it. It wasn't until this year's Moulin Rouge that I realized what an talented person she is, and with two incredible movies in the same year, her career looks to be going up, even without her hubby. This review is sparce, simply because there is too much that could be revealed that shouldn't. The less said is always more for the unsuspecting viewer. Go see this movie for a good scare and a great time. It doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This movie was a total disappointment!!! Everyone in the theatre was laughing and almost throwing popcorn.It is a total rip off of the sixth sense and a waste of money,I have never been so incredibly disappointed with a movie,the ending wasnt bad but for the most part shes running around her house with a rifle screaming at people about jesus.Its terrible."

","1945 Jersey. A woman (Nicole Kidman--who's excellent) keeps her two children barricaded in their big, gloomy, fog-shrouded house. It seems if the children are exposed to sunlight it will kill them. Then three mysterious servants show up to help...or are they? Strange noises are heard and the little girl starts seeing ghosts. What's going on?<br/><br/>The movie is VERY dark, very creepy and very quiet...and that's the problem. It's too much. There's a constant air of dread and danger and it really wore me down. Also the film moves at a (purposefully) slow pace--too slow for me. It's all well-done and there are a few scenes guaranteed to make you jump (or scream) but it was too depressing. But there is a nice twist at the ending that I didn't see coming. So, it's somewhat worth seeing--just very slow-moving."
"RowdyJimmy819","10","1","2","17 August 2001"," The BEST movie of the year
","This has got to be the best movie of the year. First of all, the acting was great. Nicole Kidman gave a stellar performance. You could see the fear in her eyes. Second, the plot was excellent. It had so many twists and turns in it. And the ending..wow. If you thought The Sixth Sense had a suprise ending, you should see this movie. Basically, its about Grace (Kidman) and her two children, Ann and Nicholas, who live in a supposedly haunted house. Ann keeps seeing this boy named Victor who nobody else sees and other ghosts, and the mother does not believe her. Third, it relies on atmosphere, not special effects, to create scares, and believe me, this movie has a whole lotta of em.<br/><br/>If you liked the Sixth Sense, you will love this movie. In fact, The Others was far superior to The Sixth Sense. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!<br/><br/>10/10"

","WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER IN THIS REVIEW!! If you haven't seen it, don't read on to hear how it ends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The sad thing is they made this movie out to be origional, thrilling and chilling. I say its kind of copied, very predictable, and I found the scariest thing was that people jumped when the most predictable thing happens. (IE if you go in the closet and the scary music starts to swell, expect someone to open the bloody door. Its not that hard to predict people, thus not scary! Give me a break already!) This movie was very ""Sixth Sense"" (Which was very original, had suspenseful moments, and made you jump out of your seat the whole time. Which I give a 10 out of a possible 10) In the ""Sixth Sense"" you had a man who thought he was the living- living among the dead, but was actually dead living amongst the living. Same concept here. They thought the ""Others"" possessed their house, when they were actually the possessors. I knew that less than 10 minutes into the movie it was so obvious.<br/><br/>I'm a Kidman fan believe it or not, but this work was beneath her. She can do so much better than what the writers gave her to work with. Kudos to her and the kids for trying to do the best job they could with a stolen, but poorly copied, script. This version was rather dull. The scariest thing was actually paying $8. a ticket to see it. Sorry, but this is a wait till video movie."

This version relied too much on slamming doors to frighten or startle its audience. It was too long, or it seemed too long.

I was waiting for it to end as I already knew what was going on. I like a movie that surprises me. This one just did not do that for me.<br/><br/>Really honestly glad when it ended.

","The tag line basically tells you all you need to know. I guess properly about the new house keepers. but it wasn't until Grace Stewart's(Nichole Kidman) husband Charles(Christopher Eccleston) showed up that I knew absolutely where the story was going and I could have turned it off at that point (""Sometimes I bleed""). One of the old horror techniques is to place the dead individual in a place where they couldn't leave, hence fog. Charles steps out of the fog and tells his wife he has come to say goodbye because he has to go back to the front. If you have time and want just a light, predictable, but fairly decent movie, this is good for that. I haven't purchased it, I rented it. It is probably worth a rental fee."

Why don't they all leave the house if they are so afraid? Why is the mother not going to a doctor with their children who both have this strange disease? --- The only answer can be: because then there's no plot for a movie.

"SugarLandDave","1","2","7","8 September 2001"," Pain, suffering, forever....
","For those who perhaps do not know, ""The Others"" is a movie produced by Tom Cruise starring his estranged wife, Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>That is all that I can say good about this farce which through clever advertising would pass itself off as some sort of horror thriller.  It is in due time about as thrilling as having chewing gum stuck to the sole of your shoe.  Sitting through the whole movie is as pleasant as removing the afore-mentioned gum from your shoe.<br/><br/>Early in the film while speaking about religeon, Ms Kidman mentions pain, suffering forever.  That is what you will feel if you sit through the whole film.......<br/><br/>If Ms. Kidman could act as well as, say, Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie,"" if the children acted like accomplished child actors rather than like a couple of kids you picked up at the corner store, if someone (Tom?) cared about making a good flick rather than a fast buck then perhaps the screenplay could have been rewritten to have some redeeming moments.  Perhaps the cast should have just improvised the whole thing; it could not have been any worse.<br/><br/>It is a shame Hollywood can put out a movie as awful as this, and it will make money in spite of it's being a stinker.  Everyone involved with this fiasco should be ashamed of themselves, but of course, the money will assuage their pain.  Shame on you, Hollywood!  Shame on you, Tom, Nicole! And shame on you, dear reader, if you should fall victim to this film and fail to tell your friends how very bad it is!"

","This ghost film is incredibly well made. It is truly scary at only a few points, but even when you aren't screaming, this film has a very eerie and creepy feel throughout. There are also lots of things that can be interpreted in different ways. It seems as if the mother is mentally unstable, but there's no proof, causing you to question everything else. Is any of it actually happening, or is it just a grief stricken woman having a nightmare? You can't and don't know, which makes it a brilliant piece of psychological horror. It's been months since I watched it, and I still wonder what the true story was. A must see for fans of ghost films, twist endings, or anyone looking for a psychological horror film, as opposed to the cliché gore films that we see all the time. Suspense is built well, the acting is great, and the ending is absolutely insane! Truly unique and very well-made."

","I personally am not a big fan of the horror genre. Yet it has come to my attention that at the time I write this review, one the popular horror plot is the twist where the main characters that the viewers assume as the ones being haunted, are truly the real haunters themselves. And Now, seeing this movie about fourteen years after its original release, I think now I have found the original movie that set the trend for such a plot. Of the small number of horror movies I've seen, I can appreciate the surprise that the plot brings, especially in the part where the twist comes in. In my opinion, the twist served n this movie has the surprise level comparable to the one I saw in The Skeleton Key, even in the original Shutter, that Thai movie. Nicole Kidman played an stable role, successfully portraying an insecure mother with the burden of a lost husband and photosensitive children. Yet I don't think this was the best performance from her."

","Fear of dark is typical in horror flicks, but here its fear of light for Anne & Nicholas. In fact there is a peculiar condition for children in this film (Anne & Nicholas), that they are photosensitive. This is one of those movies which the viewers must never know the suspense/spoilers for thrills. So before you watch this, don't read any reviews with spoilers. The movie is a horror/thriller so its meant to be scary but didn't scare me. The sounds (sound effects) gave me jerk for I've watched it with surround sounds late at night. Just like a typical suspense movie, it can be watched once as the second time you wouldn't. Except for frightening scenes the movie has no sexuality nor profanity nor violence. <br/><br/>The bottom line : Another good film to watch on a stormy night all alone with good sound effects and big screen (without reading spoilers and unless you have a weak heart to withstand horror)"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","14 October 2013"," A Highly Underrated Gem Of Horror Filmmaking.
","Shrouded with a thick layer of mystery that cleverly unfolds over the course of its runtime, making excellent use of horror elements to encapsulate the whole film with a tense mood, and further enhancing its dark ambiance by capturing its low-light surroundings in a truly fascinating manner, The Others is one of the most underrated gems of modern horror.<br/><br/>Set in Jersey during the aftermath of the Second World War, the story of The Others follows Grace, a religious mother of two children who have a rare disease that makes them allergic to sunlight. When three new servants arrive at their mansion, a series of inexplicable events are set in motion which convinces Grace that there is a mystical presence in the house.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, The Others packs in a highly gripping story that is smartly narrated from start to finish and is able to keep its mystery alive till the very end where it surprises its audience with a shocking revelation. The screenplay is no slouch for the characters & their arcs are elegantly handled and each added element only works out in favour of the story.<br/><br/>The old mansion on a seemingly isolated island brings a creepiness of its own. The camera employs minimal use of light, sometimes relying solely on candles & its effervescent glow to capture the drama, and it is effectively carried out. Editing steadily unfolds its narrative. And the performances by its cast is thoroughly convincing, with Nicole Kidman & Alakina Mann impressing the most in their respective role of Grace & her daughter.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Others is an outstanding piece of horror filmmaking that's patiently crafted, deftly scripted, elegantly shot, brilliantly paced, calmly scored & strongly performed and exhibits a wonderful balance in all aspects to deliver a genuinely chilling experience to its audience. And on the strength of its interesting premise & proper attention to characters, The Others is a welcome entry in the genre of horror that's absolutely worth your time & money. Highly recommended."

As a lover of horrors I know how difficult it is to do a good thriller, and as a matter of fact despite my love of the genre, there are only a few good ones I had actually seen in my long life. It shows you how difficult it is to do it well. Therefore I am still on the quest for masterpieces such as above movie. I was absolutely impressed and just wish that Alejandro Amenabar would do another horror as sophisticated as this one. And acting should also be mentioned as superb. Nicole Kidman of whom I am not a special fan,is to my surprise excellent in her portrayal of deeply depressed, psychotic wife; Fionnula Flanagan - fantastic actress with amazing voice and presence, and two other actors also splendid - the producers couldn't choose better players. And children were also great compared with typical Hollywood annoying kids who speak like adults and behave in the most artificial, phony manner. Please, watch this movie. It is not just your plain horror taking place in a spooky house but psychological drama about religion, motherhood and mortality. And dear Mr. Amemabar - make another horror. There are excellent stories written in Victorian times. Take one and show young viewers something besides vampires and zombies."

But the very best is that Amenabar does not rely on CG or gore or violence to create a chill down to your bones scary movie. They kicked it old school with this one and it is a real gem. Another rarity is the truly original story line. Full of twists and turns that despite your best efforts you absolutely do not see coming. I've also found I enjoy this movie better and better with each subsequent viewing. It simply begs to be watched again to pick up on all the nuances you miss the first time around because you are just simply too scared to pick up on them. Kidman is at the top of her game in The Others. Fionnula Flanigan is terrifying as the - well you don't exactly know what she is up until the end. It leaves you guessing as to the true nature of the supporting characters who play the new staff. Amenabar does a superb job with lighting and location. Isolated and utterly creepy the old house itself is almost a character unto itself in The Others. Mann and Bentley also deserve nods for their performances at such a tender age. If you can manage to hold off for a wonderfully blustery, stormy evening alone, it will only add to the thrill of The Others.

"eytand94","10","1","3","6 August 2011"," The Others: A Return to Classical Supernatural Horror
","Nowadays in horror, it isn't enough to simply hint at a ghost. The audience is going to want to see the specter in the flesh. But that takes away the true fright of supernatural terror. The feeling of an otherworldly presence is much scarier than seeing it. After such classics as 1961's ""The Innocents"" and 1963's ""The Haunting,"" a film like Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" is a warm love letter to horror.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1940's New England. While her husband is away at war, Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, watches over her dark, foreboding mansion, as well as her children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a disturbing allergy to sunlight. Once Grace calls upon new housekeepers to tend to the mansion and the kids, things begin to go wrong. There is something the new guests aren't telling her, Anne is ""lying"" about seeing a little boy named Victor, and strange noises occur. But Victor isn't the only problem. There are others, uninvited guests that can't be seen. Is the house haunted or is Grace's sanity string beginning to loosen? <br/><br/>""The Others"" is, without a doubt, an extremely frightening horror film in a repetitious world of serial killers and nude blonds. It got attention when it was released, but today, I feel like its popularity has unfairly faded.<br/><br/>The film has an ominous feel right from the start. There is nothing happy about this setting. You can already tell that Grace is unhappy, and since her husband is gone and her children's lives are at stake, she is always on edge. The mansion is completely darkened, and leaving a single door open can bring in sunlight and trigger an effect on the kids. But in such a case when a door is left open and nobody has touched it, we, as an audience member, develop paranoia and fear of the characters' surroundings.<br/><br/>Back in the day, not seeing a ghost was, and still is, more terrifying. Masters like Jack Clayton and Robert Wise knew that, and so does Alejandro Amenabar. We don't see a single apparition. Amenabar favors implication over shock, something Hitchcock would be proud of. It is an old formula brought back to fantastic life.<br/><br/>Although atmosphere is a highlight of ""The Others,"" the casting of Nicole Kidman is equally powerful. She is beautiful as well as talented. Her performance sponsors a realistic fear, which is a mother's loss of a child's love or even the loss of a child. Bring ghosts into the mix, and you have a perfect recipe for psychological horror, thanks to her performance.<br/><br/>The ending is definitely a more common cliché currently than it was in 2001, but it still brings chills. And so does the rest of the movie. Paying homage to the classical horror films of the 1940's, ""The Others"" knows what truly scares you, and I hope one day, that it won't be a film just for older audiences, but for newcomers who have been raised on slasher movies, also."

The cinematography is wonderful, the score is pitch perfect, the acting is stellar, and the script is just chilling and fascinating. The Others is in a word: AMAZING!! The premise is simple. A woman (Nicole Kidman) lives in a secluded house with her two young children and is waiting on her husband (Christopher Eccleston) to return from the war. She hires three caretakers to come live with them and at that point, things begin to happen. I won't go into any major details here as to not ruin anything but suffice it to say, this movie will give you a genuine feeling of fright and will make you question many things after you have finished watching it. The movie is superb and I believe this film is one of the greatest of all time. I still can't quite understand how it got no Oscar consideration at all. This is one of Nicole Kidman's finest performances and Fionnula Flanagan is wonderful as the mysterious Mrs. Mills. The ending is quite simply brilliant and will leave you in such a profound place of shock for a few minutes afterward. If you have not yet seen this movie, trust me. You need to.

","Since the comparison between this movie and M. Night Shyamalan's ""ghost"" piece is inevitable because both of them are based on pretty much the same idea allow me to start with saying that while the latter works out perfectly (its predictable but still formidable resolution included), the second implementation of this idea provided by Alejandro Amenabar seems to be a little less effective.<br/><br/>In the case of ""The Sixth Sense"" the viewer - even if equipped with five basic ones only - can start to suspect something at the very beginning of the movie. Somewhere halfway into it it's simply impossible not to know what's going on there. But due to the inventive way in which the feature is structured nothing happens to be ruined through it. And despite our possible foreknowledge both the first and second part of the movie can be described as equally fascinating.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is another story. Here it's also possible to figure out what's going on somewhere in the middle of the feature - it must be admitted not without a little help of your being acquainted with ""The Sixth Sense"". But - albeit the movie is very well made in terms of its atmosphere - nothing particularly holds your attention neither prior to nor after that moment. Besides, if Night Shyamalan manages to implement the original idea in question with great consistency and without a single instance of cheating, Amenabar's flick does not seem to be completely impeccable in this respect - for example, I might be missing something but should we presume that before the curtains happen to be altogether removed the ""real"" family never tried to open them? Nevertheless I believe ""The Others"" can be considered a minor masterpiece. All you need to do to let this miraculous transformation happen to the movie is to perceive it not as a somewhat epigonic attempt at exploiting an idea which has already been properly utilized once, but rather as a quite ingenious screen adaptation of Henry James' ""The Turn Of The Screw"". Indeed, parallels between the two pieces would be multiple.<br/><br/>In the case of James' magnificent novella what we have on the surface is a ""ghost"" story about two children being haunted by apparitions of servants and their governess who is in a desperate attempt to protect them. However, according to more recent interpretations - which seem much more plausible than earlier readings - the story that had really been written by James and skilfully hidden behind the first one is a horrid drama of children betrayed by their protectress - not out of malicious impulse, but on simple and unfortunate grounds of being mad. Which would be the core structure and meaning of ""The Others"" exactly.<br/><br/>If we go into details we find numerous other correspondences: two children (but in James' story one of them survives the ordeal), a totally isolated abode where events take place, apparitions of servants who supposedly pose a threat, occasional attempts of the children to rebel against imposed ""protection"". Even the reason for madness is probably one and the same in both cases - the passionate love turned by circumstances into an impossible one. But the main thing is connection between the structural frames of these pieces with exactly the same pattern transpiring in both of them: we follow the story of children haunted by ghosts and come to a shocking revelation - there is no ghosts, but the tragedy is deeper than we could ever imagine. So if this movie was, in fact, inspired by James' work, what we have here is a perfectly accurate rendition of the original idea into the language of film. And, probably, one of the most brilliant screen adaptations of a literary work among all ever undertaken."

","It is nice that there are still horror films like this around, ones that rely on atmosphere and good acting rather than shocks and gore, not that there is anything wrong with that, it is just nice to have alternatives. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the devout mother of two children, living in a large house on the island of Jersey shortly after the end of the German occupation. The film opens with three strangers coming to the door to work as servants, as Grace shows them around the house she explains certain strange rules the must keep, all doors must be locked after use and all the curtains must be kept closed, this is because her two children are so photosensitive that any sunlight would make them very ill or possibly kill them. Not long after this Grace's daughter Anne claims she has seen a boy called Victor in the house along with his family, Grace doesn't believe her initially but after a while grows to believe that the house may in fact be haunted.<br/><br/>There are few shocks in the film but an oppressive atmosphere is maintained by the darkened rooms in the house and the ever present fog outside, as the film progresses Grace seems to get more and more paranoid and irrational to the point where we are led to believe she might even harm the children. All the main actors perform well, especially Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the two young children. While I didn't find it as scary as some reviewers I'd still recommend it... just try to avoid spoilers before watching it."

","The Others is set on 'Jersey, The Channel Islands 1945' where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a large mansion with her two young children Anne (Alakina Mann) & Nicholas (James Bentley) who suffer from an incredibly rare disease in which exposure to bright light could kill them. Three friends, the elderly Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) & a young mute girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) turn up at Grace's home looking for work as servants & luckily for them the previous servants left a week ago. Grace gives them all jobs & tells them their duties. Grace warns them that her daughter Anne is prone to telling lies & making stories up & it's not long before she is telling Bertha about other people in the house although at first there is no evidence that there are, however as children's crying is heard, strange noises emanate from empty rooms & doors open & close by themselves it appears that Anne may be telling the truth...<br/><br/>This Spanish, American & French co-production was written & directed by Chilean-born, Spanish based Alejandro Amenabar who also composed the music & I liked it, I didn't think it was amazing & I have one or two reservations about it but overall I thought it was an effective little ghost film. The script is pretty slow going even at the best of times & tries to return to the days where horror relied on good storytelling instead of relying on special effects, violence & bad language. It moves along at a sedate pace but the character's are decent & it's sort of involving, it manages to draw the viewer in quite well & all the careful build up helps the effective twist ending. A lot has been said about the twist & I for one think it works extremely well although there simply is no denying that it's more or less exactly the same as The Sixth Sense (1999) which was made at least two years prior to The Others. I'm in two minds over The Others, I liked it for what it was but it was slow going & sometimes I found it hard to maintain my interest in it & the effectiveness of the entire film depends upon it's ending which is great if you haven't seen The Sixth Sense but if you have I'd imagine you'd feel a little de ja vu & not be too impressed. There are a few holes in the plot & logic but nothing too detrimental.<br/><br/>Director Amenabar does a fantastic job of giving the film a creepy look & atmosphere, the colours & the the use of light & shadow are excellent. There are some nice shots & some eerie scenes although on the negative side it's a bit lifeless & bland at times. The 40's period setting suits the film perfectly & it's superbly realised throughout. There's no gore or violence & I can't remember any rubbish CGI computer effects (yeah!).<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 The Others is well made & has nice period production design, it shows that a lot of time went into the look of the film. While watching The Others I realised that because of the types of films that I like (horror, exploitation, low budget, sci-fi, etc.) I haven't actually seen a Nicole Kidman film before now. I was impressed & I thought she was great, she's very pretty & very good in this. Her ex Tom Cruise was an executive producer on The Others, presumably before they split. Everyone else does a fine job including ex Doctor Who (2005) Christopher Eccleston.<br/><br/>The Others is a good solid ghost story that I found watchable & effective, unfortunately it's a bit on the slow side & the ending really isn't as original or groundbreaking as it could have been although it's still highly effective. Well worth a watch but I doubt many would want to see it more than once so perhaps wait for it to turn up on TV or cable."

","The Others made me shiver. Indeed it was the old-fashioned fear that hides in every corner of a 19th century mansion surrounded by fog and such tension it's almost touchable. The Others could happen in any place or time but director Alejandro Amenabar has chosen the post WW II period to be the set of his two hour traffic. Grace(Nicole Kidman), a mother-of-two lives in rare conditions: her offspring has a disease which keeps them inside the house, curtains closed. The story begins to open after her new household helpers arrive. It is amazing how such little can sometimes turn out to be the best. Amenabar plays with our smallest fears which tend to get more frightening our minds twisting them. Everything in this movie is ment to be.<br/><br/>The cast is troughoutly talented and wonderful. N. Kidman does another great part in a year which in it's diversity to Moulin Rouges Satine shows her changing capability. Grace does have the air of coolness surrounding her appearance and reminds Kidman's previous screen personas but this time it actually has a positive effect. The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, do have both innocense and confidence in their performances.<br/><br/>The story is calmly revealed bit by bit but it manages to keep the viewer focused.

","It seems overly simple to classify ""The Others"" as a cross between classic Hitchcock and ""The Sixth Sense"" . . . mostly, because that implies ""The Others"" is a film of that highest caliber.  It's certainly not.  However, it's not awful, either; instead ""The Others"" unfortunately falls into the film limbo of being just plain mediocre.  ""The Others"" is a suspense/horror film owing a lot to its predecessors from the 1940s -- it relies on mood, atmosphere, and the casts to create the eerie mood that permeates the film, and never falls back on gratuitous gore to create its horrors.  The look and feel of ""The Others"" is very much that of a vintage Universal film; in fact, if this film had been made in black & white, and if a digital CGI version of Lana Turner could be inserted in Nicole Kidman's place, you would probably swear that this was a forgotten suspense/horror film from that era.   It's definitely not a classic -- there's a number of significant issues that add up together to keep ""The Others"" far, far short of greatness -- but it's an interesting film nonetheless.<br/><br/>""The Others"" is, at its heart, a vintage ghost story -- on a small island off the shores of England, there is a forlorn manor house located far away from the trappings of civilization.  Living in this isolated house are the elegant Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley).  There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. While odd, these rules are vital, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it.  The servants, led by the wise Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), accede to these rules . . . but they begin to hears voices. And things going bump in the night.  So do Anne and Nicholas.  Grace doesn't hear these things, or at least she claims not to, which slowly but surely leads to the questions: Are these new servants creating the disturbances for some sinister purpose?  Is troubled Anne creating them?  Is Grace?  Or does something really lurk within the walls of the manor house, something long-dead, something evil . . .<br/><br/>""The Others"" relies on its pacing and direction to create its ominous mood. This reliance is both the film's strength and ultimate downfall.  Director Alejandro Amenabar lets the viewer savor each moment of the film, building suspense from scene to scene at a slow and steady pace, dropping subtle hints about what has happened and what's going to happen with a very deft touch . . . he really lets things build slowly.  In fact, too slowly. ""The Sixth Sense"" also moved along at an unhurried pace, but at least that film had the good sense to know that in order to maintain the slow pace, some sort of payoff -- or at least a good scare -- has to be tossed out the audience once in awhile, if only to keep some interest and to prevent the film from spiraling into mind-numbing boredom.  ""The Others"" has no sense of this.  An hour into the film, the luxurious pace of ""The Others"" has become little more than self-indulgent tedium.  The process of building tension degenerates into pure impatience.  There's only two moments in ""The Others"" that can genuinely be considered ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" moments; if there had been three or four more of these moments, the film might've averted its slow, steady crash into monotony.  Yes, some of the scenes are extremely impressive, and I was particularly impressed with a lot of the cinematography, as well as the richness of the dialogue . . . but these things only can carry a film so far.  They have to lead to some kind of ultimate payoff in order to truly mean anything, and in the case of ""The Others"", that payoff never comes.  It's a nice film with some wicked little touches, a few of which border on pure genius . . . and then the film ends. No build-up to a dramatic resolution -- or, for that matter, a satisfying resolution.  For that reason, ""The Others"" can be appreciated for what it is trying to accomplish, and for the techniques it uses . . . but in no way, shape, or form can the end result be called a success.  It's a shame, because it seems as though it wouldn't have taken much to turn ""The Others"" from a bland film into one that was grippingly tense.<br/><br/>
Though billed as the star of this film, Nicole Kidman falls just short of providing the strength that ""The Others"" needed from its central character -- the film revolves mostly around her character's beliefs and perceptions, and she's simply not up to the task of making those beliefs and perceptions one thousand percent convincing.  Personally, I've always found Ms. Kidman to be somewhat of an acting enigma -- she's undeniably talented, but apart from her tour de force performance in ""To Die For"", she always appears to be struggling to find the right outlet for her talent.  There's flashes of brilliance from Ms Kidman in ""The Others"", but that's it, only flashes -- overall, the performance is uneven.  I found myself wondering what the film would've been like had it featured either Julianne Moore or Helena Bonham Carter as its star.  Fortunately, there's a ""sleeper"" star in this film, one I would hope to see in many films in the years to come: Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's young daughter Anne.  As Anne, this young actress shows both strength and vulnerability with a powerful range, one rarely seen in young actors and actresses today.  She's asked to go head-to-head with Ms. Kidman on a number of occasions in the film, and not only does Ms. Mann hold her own, she shines through like a champion.  If nothing else, ""The Others"" might be worth watching simply to see Alakina Mann's superb performance.<br/><br/>""The Others"" probably could never have been made without the success of the equally low-key ""Sixth Sense"".  ""The Others"", though, while possessing an undeniable sense of style and grace, is a film ultimately without a lot to say . . . or a lot to give to its audience.  As such, ""The Others"" is a film with some interesting qualities, some more enjoyable than others -- but it's ultimately little more than an okay film that goes on way longer than it should.  ""Interesting"" doesn't always mean ""good"" -- and with ""The Others"", this is certainly the case.  Grade: B-"

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>This has potential to be as big a hit as The Sixth Sense on account of its nature - it is clearly trying to copy its success and its formula (not to mention its release date - I think they both opened in the exact same week, two years apart). It is nowhere as good as that film, but, if you did like that, you're going to probably like this. I doubt anyone will like this one better, though.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is superb. In this aspect, it probably surpasses The Sixth Sense. The editing and especially the cinematography are often breathtaking. The acting is decent. I don't particularly care for Nicole Kidman - she harmed Eyes Wide Shut significantly, in my opinion, but her bizarre style of acting worked fabulously in the purposely campy Moulin Rouge. Here, as a constantly paranoid, possessive, and protective mother, she is more than adequate, though not deserving of any award or special hurrah. The three servants are well played by Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes, and Elaine Cassidy - they have a certain air about them. The best performances come from the two children (another echo of The Sixth Sense, although the adults in that one were also marvelous) - James Bentley as the perpetually frightened Nicholas and Alakina Mann as the intelligent Anne. Mann is in fact wonderful and I hope to see her in other films in the future. There are just a few actors after these principals, and I commend the filmmakers very much. This saves a ton of money, and makes the film more intimate and frightening, which is exactly what this film calls for.<br/><br/>Like always, almost all of the film's problems exist in the script. The screenwriter (who is also the director) realizes that his savvy audience will guess that this is a descendent of the immensely popular The Sixth Sense, so he is always attempting to trick us. What are these strange servants up to? A few times, we experience the narrative from their point of view, and what they say drives us wild with guessing. And what is wrong with the father, who had disappeared in WWII (this is set in the 1940s) and then mysteriously reappears in a frightening fog? We know that there are surprises, and these tricks work to confuse us and lead us away - good old McGuffins. I guessed right away, correctly, the father's situation, which kept me from seeing the forest for the trees. What the script forgets to do, or at least forgets to do well, is develop the characters. The children are well developed, but Amenabar relies too much on the inherent creepiness of the three servants for their effect - they almost become silly by the end; anyway, there were several moments when I laughed at their actions, although it might have been intentional. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is Amenabar's biggest failure. Her main character trait is a severe neurosis - her husband has been lost in battle and she has been left alone in an enormous mansion with only her two children. Those children have a severe light sensitivity - they break out in hives when they come into contact with light (no, they aren't Gremlins or magwies). For most of the film, Kidman's character is built up, but the revelations at the end don't ring true. One of the reasons that the ending of The Sixth Sense worked so well was because the final revelations revealed a lot of hidden facets about the characters and their actions in the events which happened beforehand. The revelations here, while very unexpected and clever, don't exactly follow what Amenabar was building.<br/><br/>Amenabar also has a problem with suspense. He gives himself all these little peculiarities to deal with - the kids are allergic to light, for instance. But he never really uses that to create suspense. One morning, the children wake up to find that all the curtains in the house have been stolen. It would have been better, perhaps, if we were allowed to watch the curtains being slowly removed at night. The suspense nearer the beginning, when we don't know very much, is quite good. The first set piece is excellent. A lot of the other scary scenes are also quite good, including the climactic one, where the secrets are finally revealed. Still, the film uses too many stingers (sharp rises in the music). That may make us jump, but for a dishonest reason."

","I'm astounded by the hype.<br/><br/>When The Others was first released on these shores, people were talking about it as if it represented a groundbreaking new genre. It was as if the critics had never seen a haunted house movie before - and despite the glowing recommendations and boundless praise, the 'highlights' that got screened on TV to promote the movie seemed cheap, obvious and just plain silly.<br/><br/>So, in light of all the hype, I avoided the movie until it was screened on TV this evening.<br/><br/>What a load of cobblers.<br/><br/>For a start, The Others isn't creepy in the slightest. Robert Wise's original version of The Haunting was creepy. And some of the scenes in Peter Medak's The Changeling were unsettling in the extreme. The Uninvited got it right as far back as 1944, and yet The Others succeeds in doing little more than rattling chains and shouting BOO! Perhaps part of the problem is the lack of subtlety - I got the whole story at the end of the séance sequence. It said all that needed saying. But just in case you weren't paying attention we're treated to a painfully contrived monologue that renders many of the most effective sequences utterly redundant. It's this lack of regard for the viewer's intelligence that ultimately lets the movie down, as it degenerates into cheap cliché rather than genuine chills.<br/><br/>Or maybe the problem is its lack of originality. I love horror movies. In particular, I love the really scary ones - which are usually very different to the really gory ones. In watching The Others, it seemed as if Amenábar were simply making a list of 'things a ghost story should have'. At times, I felt like I were being treated to selected scenes from The Haunting or The Changeling, but without the tension or elegance of either.<br/><br/>And - spoilers ahoy - the moment I saw Eric Sykes cover those gravestone, I saw the ending coming a mile off. But let's not have any more comparisons with the Sixth Sense, as we'd already seen the same shock ending in movies like Dead and Buried or Blade Runner - and I'm sure they weren't the first to do it either.<br/><br/>In all, The Others proved to be as engaging, frightening and unsettling as Jan De Bont's laughable remake of The Haunting.<br/><br/>If you've never seen a haunted house movie before, please have fun and enjoy The Others. If, like me, you've been spoiled by all the really great stuff that came before, and genuinely enjoy a good cinematic scare, give it a very wide berth. Check out The Devil's Backbone instead - it's pure undiluted terror by comparison."

Some plot elements contributed nothing to the story and seemed to be no more than distractions. I just did not like the way it played out, waiting for the tension to build but it never really did.

Nicole Kidman is the mother protective of her children to the point where we wonder about her sanity and she's magnificent. It's the best thing she's done so far, (leaving her Oscar-winning turn in ""The Hours"" in the shade). Fionnula Flanagan is the matronly Irish servant who arrives at her door looking for work with a mute Elaine Cassidy and gardener Eric Sykes in tow.<br/><br/>The young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar both wrote and directed the film with great skill as well as composing the haunting score. He also gets great performances from the children. Indeed, this is the kind of movie that will appeal to children while scaring the pants off them. They may identify with the children in the film although that probably won't be to their advantage. Comparisons with ""The Innocents"" will, of course, be drawn and rightly so; this is just as good."

Suddenly strange things start to happen in the house and the family is starting to figure out that everything isn't completely normal. Normally i hate horror movies and Hollywood thrillers, especially psychological thrillers (meaning the main character is a schizophrenic)but this movie made an exception. If you like to keep up a good tight tension while watching a movie i really recommend this one! Nicole Kidman played her role convincingly and the plot was interesting throughout the movie. It kept in few sudden scary moments which made my heart stop but mainly it was a interesting film that kept me hooked all the time. |!!This part may contain a small spoiler!!| The only thing i didn't like about the film was that the ending was totally the same as in Sixth Sense: All the main characters were actually dead and the dead ones were the ones living. I mostly enjoyed this movie more than the Sixth Sense but the final catch was the one thing i think they shouldn't have copied. After all the Others was a really enjoyable movie that you shouldn't miss."

"portia-1","9","1","4","13 January 2005"," A film that entices our interest in ghost stories.
","I watched this movie for the second time on British TV last night and enjoyed it immensely - isn't hindsight a great thing? When I saw it originally, Nicole Kidman was in Moulon Rouge around on DVD at the same time so it was interesting to see just how very different the two roles were. As Grace in THE OTHERS she plays the proverbial, religious up tight woman who is clearly suffering from mental illness due to the absence of her husband who has not returned from the war. It's '1945 so where is he?Jersey was occupied by the Nazis for some five years , well of course he died . AS the film moves along very slowly and Grace becomes more and more highly strung by the 'supernatural happenings'she rejects, it is clear to the viewer that all is not what we are meant to believe and it is true that if you are familiar with Amenabar's work, you will start to figure out where the film is heading but not how, however I don't believe all those who said they guessed the ending in the first half hour because the action and the plot is handled too well. To keep comparing it to the Sixth Sense is a spoiler in itself and unfair to audiences who have not seen the movie. For those who could not understand why the husband returned only to go away again think I have grasped it. He returned in the fog looking suitably haunted, he is already dead but as a ghost has come back to the house to confront Grace as to why she killed his children. I think we have to assume that she has not been a ghost that long when he returned or indeed when the film starts and that the main reason for her despair was the loss of her husband, she probably killed the children towards the end of the WW11 and killed herself when she realised he would not return. He had to leave her because he did not die there with her but in the War somewhere else, and therefore returned probably only in her imagination. Her existence as a ghost who cannot rest is guilt driven by the violence of her own death and that is why we are seeing her(not realising at the time that she is a ghost),as a mirror image and she is a dysfunctional, not very kind woman driven so strongly by religion and by a sort of paranoid protectiveness towards her two children who are both excellent in their roles. Other viewers may interpret this aspect of the film differently but I think it does answer the plothole regarding Christopher Eccleston's character.<br/><br/>THE OTHERS is a highly enjoyable, extremely watchable old fashioned ghost story that is reminiscent of what is best from the genre - no swearing, no violence and no blood. It is a well told and well directed movie which will keep those who have not seen it guessing until the end, and it is explained at the end which often fails with other films of its type. Kidman surpasses herself and Amenabar should be proud of such a absorbing piece of work."
"Imnozy","Null","1","4","1 August 2004"," Disappointing, incomplete
","This movie would have profited by being much shorter.  Nicole Kidman spent so much time running around, opening and closing doors that any interest I had in the story had pretty well faded by the time things started happening. It struggled to find its genre - is it a horror story, a mystery, a thriller - I certainly can't work out?<br/><br/>Everything - the setting - the fog - the mystery servants promised excitement - instead it only delivered a few tingles. And so many unanswered questions.  Why did the husband return? Was he alive or dead? Why were there only the graves of the three servants on the property - surely someone else was buried there?  If all the ""other people"" were in the house - why did the children only see the little boy? No - if you are going to do something similar to this,you have to satisfactorily tie off the ends - and at least make an effort to give reasons for things that occur.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman was frenetic and annoying (I suppose she was meant to be that way, but it didn't make for empathy with her and her plight!). The 2 children were excellent, particularly the girl - they at least were believable. The husband looked like the walking dead (maybe that was the point - did I miss it?).  What a disappointment this movie was to me - I had heard so much about it and expected more."

"schroeder-gustavo","6","1","5","25 September 2015"," Needs more atmosphere to be great.
","The Others is directed by Alejandro Amenábar and it stars Nicole Kidman as an extremely loving catholic mother.<br/><br/>The movie is marketed as a horror film and it does get creepy at times, but the movie moves too slow and lacks suspense to be a really great film. Obviously takes inspiration from the Sixth Sense, which was released 3 years before this movie came out and I can really tell what they were going for with the twist and it kind of worked, but I don't think it was as climactic as it was intended to be.<br/><br/>Let's talk about performances: Nicole Kidman does a pretty good job in the movie, you can actually buy into her despair and going crazy. Like I said the performance is great, but the character really got on my nerves. I don't hear enough people talking about Alakina Mann's performance in this movie, especially for a kid actress, she is spectacular. I really wonder what happened to her, she hasn't really been in anything major since this.<br/><br/>In the end The Others is entertaining and the twist is pretty good, although it is a film that is 100% style over substance, and it should have packed a meaner punch."
"joetatton","1","1","5","10 February 2013"," A good film let down by poor acting
","After reading good reviews i thought i would watch 'The Others' alone on at night for a bit of a fright. The atmosphere was chilling and the actual plot was a very well written and quite a scary ghost story. Its a shame the movie was let down completely by acting. What could have been a great psychological horror ruined by a cast that seem to think they are in a comedy film. The accents, the facial expressions and some of the dialogue (more how it was expressed) made parts of what could have been one of the best horror films of the 2000's unwatchable. I gave this movie a 3/10 but i can understand why it is rated highly down to the plot. Id say if you have plenty of spare time watch this movie anyway if you can see past the terrible acting, if not i recommend 'the orphanage' a similar but much better acted Spanish film that will genuinely creep you out"
"driveshaft1fan","Null","1","5","7 July 2006"," If Only M. Night Shyamalan Did This . . .
","This movie was absolutely chilling and suspenseful, and though I didn't get ""scared,"" I was certainly surprised by the delicious twist ending.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays a mother of two, burdened by the responsibilities of caring for Anne and Nicholas, who both cannot be exposed to sunlight, imprisoning her in a world of darkness, as well as the mysterious whereabouts of her husband, fighting in the war. All of this is fraying her dwindling energy. And there are references throughout the movie about ""the day Mummy went mad."" I loved how the story was manipulated, how throughout the entire film we as the audience are suckered into the belief that the ""others"" are the phantoms trying to shoo them away. Instead, it's them, they are the dead and the ""others"" are the frightened living, as the day Mummy went mad refers to the day that woman killed her children and shot herself.<br/><br/>That spooking performance of Mrs. Mills was just breathtaking. As she knew everything and withheld it gave her a sinister aura, until at the end, it turns out all she was doing was sincerely helping.<br/><br/>However, there were a few scenes that I found a bit corny. The over-dramatic explanations of the ""doors always being shut,"" the overwhelming music being played during the most, if I may, apathetic scenes, it all led me to wonder how much better it could've been if a grand master like Shyamalan created this masterpiece."

The camera angles are intelligent and the screenplay is thoughtful and convincing.<br/><br/>I rather feel that this film will appeal to those viewers who like ghost stories and do not expect any more than dramatic music and a sinister build-up to the denouement. It does not have the Gothic magic of Sleepy Hollow but the acting is impressive - especially from the two children Alakina Mann and James Bentley who were both fantastic. It was also wonderful to see Eric Sykes in his cameo role.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman does a good job with what she has to do but I feel she is too good an actress to spend ninety minutes looking wide-eyed and frightened.<br/><br/>Worth seeing but not a truly great film.

the only reason i didn't give this a half star is cause of the twist. it didn't give me goosebumps because i was zero invested in the movie by that point, but it's pretty clever. imagine Insidious, but instead of the family being haunted by the past and doing the trance or whatever to talk to the ghosts, they story was from the point of view of the past ghosts and the ""intruders"" that were haunting the house were the ppl in present day who are living in the house now and seeing weird stuff caused by the main characters. i like it, but too little too late"
"and-kuratov","3","0","6","17 February 2019"," Too many goofs, too little fog
","I've watched The Others for a second time and was largely disappointed. The horror movie proves to be abounding in goofs. How come the spectres move about so noisily? How come they sleep and eat to keep themselves alive? How could they make love to each other? How come they use keys to lock and unlock doors? How come they can hold (and keep) the keys, to say nothing of a rifle? How could the spectres remember everything but forget their own graves?
The director lets us see what happens to the papers as Grace tears them violently in front of the humans (we see only humans, no Grace). If Grace and her husband and kids are invisible to the human eye, then the rest is dark and trite comedy rather than horror.
I can hardly name another movie as rich in goofs and so blatantly one-off. You can enjoy it but once. And even then, after a while, you can't help putting too many uneasy questions to the director and his crew."

Just another MEH movie."
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","2","22 September 2016"," A classic old-fashioned ghost story
","Following in the footsteps of THE SIXTH SENSE (to which it is indebted with its many plot twists and revelations), THE OTHERS is a throwback to the older, more gentle (but no less terrifying) style of horror which is more about dark shadows, things moving in empty rooms, and atmosphere and style rather than graphic shocks or unwanted comedy relief. Which is why THE OTHERS is by far the best horror film that I have seen in 2001 so far, and with the year inexorably drawing to a close it's a fair bet that this film be the best horror film of the year full stop. Although the slow pacing means that some scenes of inaction inevitably drag, THE OTHERS holds your attention span with some well-portrayed shock sequences, lots of creepy bits, and strong acting from an above-average cast who breathe life into their roles.<br/><br/>I was complaining recently about recent horrors like JEEPERS CREEPERS which assault the delicate senses of the audience by aurally battering them with loud bursts of music during the scare sequences; thankfully, THE OTHERS has only one or two such scenes and is much more frightening when concerning unexplained and diabolic events occurring on screen. For me, the scariest moment - which can almost cause one to look away in fright - is when Kidman sees that her daughter has somehow turned into a withered old crone, a truly disgusting and terrifying scene. This type of thing is often done well in horror stories but not so successfully in film, well that's not the case here.<br/><br/>The setting of the large country mansion is a good one, and the plot contrivance of Kidman having to keep all the curtains shut due to the fact that her children are light-sensitive makes for an excellent visual contrast on screen between dark and light, with plenty of atmospheric shadows in which things might be lurking. There's also a fantastic sequence in which Kidman goes out into the woods and finds herself lost in the fog, which is conveyed so that you feel like you're there. The music of course complements what's going on up on the screen, and the best efforts of a fine cast also help things out considerably. In fact there's the same kind of chill atmosphere as in classics like THE WOMAN IN BLACK or the BBC Ghost Stories for Christmas of the '70s, when you knew something horrible would be revealed but never knew quite what and were frequently horrified and surprised.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman shows off her fine acting style and how she has matured as an actress since the days of DEAD CALM with a fine performance of a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and the child actors, both newcomers, are excellent as the quirky brother and sister. Also giving strong performances in the supporting cast are Fionnula Flanagan as the nanny, Christopher Eccleston (excellent in a tragic sub plot as Kidman's missing husband who mysteriously turns up), Eric Sykes as the gardener, Renee Asherson as a creepy old lady and Keith Allen.<br/><br/>Initially I thought (with the characters and setting) the film to be a remake of the Henry James classic The Turn of the Screw, made most famously with Deborah Kerr in 1961 as THE INNOCENTS. As the plot progresses, however, the story moves in very unexpected directions, ending with not one but two fantastic twists which you won't see coming (at least I didn't, but then I don't go looking for them). THE OTHERS is a breath of originality in what now amounts to a stale genre, and is miles ahead of teen slasher rubbish like the recent JEEPERS CREEPERS. I know which one I'd pick out of the two; the film with characterisation, unexpected situations, thankfully no special effects, and with a real, genuine atmosphere of chill and suspense."

","Arriving at an old Victorian home, new workers looking after a woman's two bed-ridden children experience a series of ghostly happenings that questions their religious upbringing and must figure out how to stop it from continuing.<br/><br/>This one turned out to be an absolutely banal drama rather than a horror film, which has a lot of problems. One of the biggest issues is that nothing at all happens in here, with being just so slow and plodding that the scares hardly happen. Since nearly all the early scares or confrontations are off-camera with us coming upon their reactions or hearing about what happened, leaving this one to completely gloss over the potential main selling point by not showing anything to be afraid of and only telling us. This is compounded by all the times she keeps spouting off about their fates in Purgatory and such for failing to listen to her, her insistence on teaching and interpreting the Bible and all of the religious nonsense that permeates the film, as well as the rather ridiculous plot-point about the father coming home, which is dismissed quite suddenly and eats up several minutes of screen time going nowhere at all. Beyond the plot problems, the last act twist is just utterly confusing and makes no sense, rendering much of the film up until that point quite contradictory to what's been established and doesn't really serve a point at all. All of these issues aren't enough to save it from some rather nice points here, mainly a fine, suitably creepy Gothic mansion that serves as the perfect point for this effort, there's some generally freaky moments with the children's reactions to different events around the house and then there's the first revelation about the different workers' true past which prompts some fine action scenes for the first time and gets some chilling scenes involved. These make it worthwhile, but it's overall quite flawed.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence and children-in-jeopardy."

","Alejandro Amenabar directed this memorable and atmospheric ghost story set during the end of WWII, where Grace Stewart(played by Nicole Kidman) is looking for servants to take care of the house and her two children, who are mostly housebound because of a rare photosensitive condition where excessive sunlight will kill them. New servants do arrive, but spooky things start occurring, making a reluctant Grace believe that her house may be haunted. The return of her husband(played by Christopher Eccleston) from the war proves a temporary respite, as he leaves once again, forcing Grace to confront the awful truth about the haunting(or does she?) Superbly directed, written, and acted film features a clever surprise ending, though one that raises as many questions as it answers. Genuinely frightening at times as well."

","Not one, but two spine-tingling twists in the story towards the end will make you babble with amusement. That is if you pay attention, The Others is an immensely scary movie.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is outstanding; no one could've done a better job at this role and I appreciate the makers to use confined rooms for their scenes. Well, they do induce some chills. With an amazing setup and the idea of inventiveness about the characters, the plot talks about the story of a woman and her two children. A gardener, two housekeepers enter their mansion for work and trouble begins. Some sequences, coupled with eerie sound mixing and BG music are sure to keep you hooked. The two children are amazing, as well.<br/><br/>And when you reach the final 20 minutes, blast! the plot will hit you like a cold corpse from 200 feet above. That is the effect of The Others. It is not void from goofs and dull moments, but if Scary Movie 3 can spoof one of its scenes, it sure gotta be good.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: American or British or take Spanish (The Orphanage for instance) horror movies don't scare me much, but if I had to list, this one would sure find a number. Highly Recommended! Beautifully written!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES<br/><br/>Gore/Violence: Mild | Alcohol/Sex/Porn/Drugs/Smoking: No"

","The Others is a psychological horror movie directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar, and it's his first English language movie. Amenábar is a director, actor and a composer. He wrote the screenplays for five of his movies, and composed the majority of the soundtracks. The Others was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, which is pretty rare for a horror movie. As a big fan of ghost movies, I consider this movie to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>On a huge estate, in an always darkened house – darkened because of the two of her photosensitive children – lives Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), the mother of a boy and a girl whose husband hasn't returned from war in the past year and a half. As a very religious person, Grace insists on her children's religious education, teaches them about God's morals and reads verses from the Bible. Because of her inability to conduct all of the house work, she employs three workers who should help her with the children and around the house. Since she has a heavy rheumatic disease, Grace keeps silence in the house, but it is one day disrupted by piano sounds, children's cries and sounds of footsteps. Her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann) tries to convince her and her brother that she frequently sees a little boy, Victor (Alexander Vince), and his family, but Grace blames the workers for everything that's happening.<br/><br/>The Others has a very good atmosphere because of the creepy soundtrack (present in all tense situations), the old house in which many families have lived, the constant fog and the isolation from every form of civilization. Despite the fact that there are not many jump scares and blood, the tension is still present and it's created mainly by making the house dark (the curtains are always closed) and silent. Nicole Kidman, in spite of being reluctant to accept the role, since before this she was working on Moulin Rouge!, turned out to be excellent in the horror genre. She amazingly portrayed hysteria, as well as kindness to her folks, and her facial expression freezes one's blood (like in the scene where she starts finding out the truth). The movie is dominated by the opposition between the guessing what could be going on, the religious beginning and the overall thematic – and what's really going on, and the sudden annihilation of the aforementioned.<br/><br/>The role of the children in the movie was very big and very successful. Their regular conflicts about their mother and father create drama and tension. The character who leads the audience, and the other characters, to the discovery of what's happening, is nurse Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who tells Anne that she trusts her and that she also feels the presence of the boy Victor. She also tries to convince Grace of the existence of the supernatural. As a remark, I'd say the character of Charles Stewart (Christopher Eccleston) felt unnecessary – he has no impact on the rest of the characters or the overall plot. The movie's ending is exceptional and is worth every minute of the movie's duration. The movie doesn't want to leave the revelation to the very end – instead, the truth is progressively exposed throughout the movie, but still manages to lead to an unexpected finale. The Others, despite not being a movie that will haunt your dreams for weeks, manages to keep its quality and level of creepiness with every subsequent watch. A definite recommendation! <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"

The acting was superb (this would remain my favorite Nicole Kidman movie until The Hours came out) and the ending genuinely caught me off guard- a rarity.<br/><br/>I thought that this was an excellent movie, a wonderful nod to an age when movies didn't need CG and other effects to be genuinely scary.

"cpace2","8","0","1","25 November 2012"," A very suspenseful movie with many plot twists
","The Others is a psychological horror film about a family being afraid of what is inside their house. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) has two children who cannot be exposed to sunlight due to their medical condition. Because of her children's medical condition, Grace has strict rules that the children and the three newly hired servants must follow. Strange things begin to happen in the house, such as footsteps, thuds, and noises coming from empty rooms. Anne (Alakina Mann), the daughter of Grace, informs her mother that there are other people in the house, but her mother does not believe her. In the end, the true ghosts of the movie were the main characters themselves. Grace, Grace's children, and the servants are haunting a family in that very house.<br/><br/>The Others is a very good horror film. From the beginning to the end, The Others will keep the audience guessing what will happen next. There are many plot twists throughout the movie so the audience never expects what will happen next. The ending of the movie has a plot twist, which makes the audience think. Because of the ending, the audience now knows why everything happened. The whole movie ties together and doesn't leave the audience confused.<br/><br/>It is dull at times, however, each scene is very suspenseful. Suspense is what makes The Others such a good movie. Also, the mechanics of the film are flawless. Music plays into the suspense the audience feels. It is very eerie, and keeps the audience alert and on their toes. Each scene has perfect lighting. The lighting adds mystery to the movie since no one knows what's going to appear. The ending of the movie is a plot twist. Grace, her family, and the servants are really haunting the family living in that house. By including this scene, the audience understands what has been happening the whole movie. Everything comes together in the end making the audience satisfied with what they have watched."

","An old fashioned haunted house/ghost story done with a cast delivering perfection. It is the performances from all involved that captivate this story. The atmosphere is appropriately apprehensive and the pacing is solid. <br/><br/>It is unfashionably stoic and is probably somewhat understated for some, but if you don't mind subtle surroundings and low key development this can be a mesmerizing movie with a probable ending.<br/><br/>It is rather downbeat and somber with not much to cheer about but has enough surprises getting to the grounding of it all that can be spooky enough if simplistic in its tone.

","Ghost stories come in all shapes and sizes and The Others, for a while, seems to be a pretty ordinarily shaped ghost story, but there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a devoutly Christian woman who lives in a large country house with her two children who have a disease that makes them react terribly to sunlight. At the beginning of the film Grace hires three new servants to help her around the house, as it is only her and the children because their father is off fighting in World War II. As soon as these new servants come into the house strange things start happening and suspicions arise that the house may be haunted. Clever spookiness ensues in a film that doesn't phone it in on cheap thrills, but rather builds a slow crawling suspense throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's always a blessing to watch a film like this. It's one that manages to be spooky and suspenseful, but it's also high quality entertainment. It's a beautifully shot film that uses lighting wonderfully to amp up the chills. One of the major plot points is the children being basically allergic to sunlight. Because of this they can't travel alone through the house. Any room they go into or just pass through has to be darkened. This calls for the constant closing of shutters and drapes that gives the whole house a dreary and depressing ambiance which makes the whole bleak mood of the film all the greater. There is no room for joy or happiness in this story, and the way the ominous story and dim cinematography come together is excellent, and it's what makes this film so utterly creepy.<br/><br/>For a long while The Others is fairly straightforward, but also intriguing and unique. It helps knowing that the film is a well rated film by fans and critics because throughout the slow building suspense you know that there will certainly be some sort of great pay off in the end. And there is. What seems like your run of the mill ghost story has a great catch to it that rounds the film off as an awesomely surprising story. This is a great film for any fan of suspense thrillers. It's not painfully terrifying, but just spooky enough to make you shudder the next time you walk through a dark room."
"mike48128","8","0","1","1 July 2012"," A Different Kind of Ghost Story
","A tale of mystery, not horror. This is one of the best performances that Nichole Kidman has ever done. A ghost story of the highest caliber; but if you watch it too carefully, there are so many ""clues"" that you will guess the ending long before the final reel. For another version (a similar story) watch ""The Innocents"" (1961). The story seems familiar because it is a partial retelling of ""The Turn of the Screw."" I won't reveal the ending except to tell you that this is a ghost story told from the ghosts' point-of-view, which really reveals too much. (The young boy Victor, one of the ""intruders"", can see the ghosts.) A handsome production with excellent cinematography and sets. Well directed and very atmospheric but too intense for very young children. The movie mystery starts out with a few huge hints: The mannerisms and dress of the servants. The children are very ""photo-sensitive"" to sunlight. Not as much fun on additional viewings, once the viewer knows the secret of ""the Others""."

","""The film is going in my favorites list."" They have truly shown that for making a film you do not need to have sound effects and ghost with bad faces. What is worth noting in the film is that you will feel scared at least for one point of time. I give most of the credit to the actress – ""Nicole kidman"". And of course nothing is possible without a fine piece of direction. The director is new to me but I will remember his name forever. The idea of inducing photo sensitivity in the children so that there will be darkness in the house all the time. I think this reason gave the film an edge regarding the reasons, As many horror films employ everything in dark and without giving it a thought that why everything is to be done in the dark. The ending could not have better. The sound effects are kept to a minimum and fear is induced by the situations and the circumstances. The only thing that I found unnecessary in the film was the character of their father. Other than that this is the only horror film that has made me feel scared.<br/><br/>""A must watch for everyone."""

","All the horror movies usually scare you ""out of your wits"" with sudden sounds and unexpected moments of evil appearance. Well, this one doesn't. It's well composed, and the acting is brilliant. Personally i want to give credit to the old lady Mrs Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), she is simply the best in this movie. Sometimes she appears as a kind-hearted nanny, but at times - very sinister. The plot is widely known to have an unusual twist, but regarding the title of the movie, i guessed approximately in the middle. It didn't spoil my pleasure, and later i rewatched the movie a couple times just to grasp the details of the other view of things. I would say that the vision of the situation shown in the movie is what you should watch it for. Though the atmosphere is all the way suspicious and chilly, the movie leaves a feeling of warmth and a light touch of regret. 9 of 10 for the whole conception elaborated."
"MovieShrink7","3","0","1","2 February 2012"," Awesome movie...until the ending
","I saw The Others several years ago in the theater. It was so packed that me and my two friends had to sit separately from one another because there simply were not enough seats. The movie did not disappoint. <br/><br/>The Others was just subtle enough to lure you into a sense of security before it through another jump at you. The music was perfect because, in most mystery/thriller types the music gives it away but in The Others you keep thinking that you know what you're getting and just when you're ready to call it a false alarm, something else comes out of the shadows. The kids are deliciously creepy and the servants make you wonder what secret the house and its occupants truly hold. I was particularly intrigued by the mute servant. Throughout the entire film I could not wait to hear what dreadful secret she possessed that would compel her to give up speech. <br/><br/>Then the end came and I was so disappointed. Not only did the Sixth Sense literally just come out a few years before so the twist was completely played out, but the way they did it was so damn cheesy! Nicole Kidman is ripping up a piece of paper and then it cuts to a piece of paper ripping in midair in front of a séance group. The effect was lame and lazy. The whole thing was lazy. Cool, I'm glad you realized you killed your kids (which was creepy, I'll give them that) but she probably still should have been alive. Or something, I don't know. All I know is that I was let down. The rest of the movie was brilliant and the ending felt like a wrap up from a scooby doo episode. Boo!"

The director pinpointed the dark crevices of Nicole's personality and she was wonderful. There are very few good Ghost movies out there and this is definitely one of them. Nicole Kidman's British accent was excellent and the British are supreme in making movies about Ghosts. The ending totally stunned me and struck at the fears that all parents have felt at one time or another i.e., that there is a dark side to being a parent.

","A woman who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive children becomes convinced that her family home is haunted.<br/><br/>If you like pacing, haunting atmosphere, and surprise twists, this movie is for you. The Others is a very religious horror film and I see many hating it because of that. Same reason people didn't get into The Exorcist that much. I really liked the religious twist though, and for some odd reason religion makes a movie more creepy and daring. The twist is out of no where and I loved it, kept you in the story until the end and that's what movie making is. Nicole Kidman is a very good actor as we should all know and she does her part perfectly here too. At first in the story I thought she was crazy and then later on I realized she is just paranoid of the kid's sayings. The kids also play their part pretty well too, and thank god it wasn't like those modern movies. And then we have the PG-13 rating which some people hate. They all think R makes a movie scary and that's not the case. The Others is a very great horror movie and I really enjoyed it's slow, eerie pacing and descending into a well-done twist. 7/10."

"oneguyrambling","7","0","2","5 November 2010"," A career highlight for Kidman - but still not a classic.
","Before I yammer on about The Others, let's first discuss the career of one Nicole Kidman, who I consider the most over-rated actress on the planet. Sure she is attractive in a ""Womanly"" way, as opposed to the million ""girl"" actresses that burst on the scene and vanish seemingly weeks later, but her decision making when saying yes to a movie is obviously abysmal.<br/><br/>Thanks to IMDb I can say that these are Kidman's career ""highlights"": - Dead Calm (My initial typo said ""Dead Clam"", which I hope to option and sell to Hollywood for a million bucks.) - The Others That's it. I've seen at least a dozen of her other flicks and have been underwhelmed every time. Kidman is good-looking without having that one ""thing"" that you remember, a good actress without ever being the most interesting character in any movie that she is in, yet she is critically lauded and extremely well paid.<br/><br/>Another thing: I am Australian and realise this is almost slanderous that I am fully bagging a fellow Australian success story, but it needs to be said that NICOLE KIDMAN IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED.<br/><br/>Late addition: I subsequently checked out Rotten Tomatoes and found that Dead Calm and The Others are 2 of her higher ranked flicks, followed by Eyes Wide Shut, which I have seen but thought was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be.<br/><br/>So back to The Others, which after my rant is actually pretty good, more thanks to the simplicity of the story than anything Kidman does though.<br/><br/>Set in post-WW2 on a British island, Kidman plays a mother of 2 young kids named Grace living in a massive isolated manor that is seemingly eternally surrounded by fog. Her husband Charlie, was a soldier in the war and hasn't been heard from for some time - perhaps already dead. Her 2 kids are around 4 and 7, the younger a boy named Nicholas and the older a sister named Ann.<br/><br/>Grace is understandably very protective of her two children, who apparently have an allergy to natural light (read sunshine), and must remain indoors during the day and behind thick drawn curtains. In fact Grace locks every room behind her to make sure they don't wander out, something that is a bit of a contrived plot device in retrospect.<br/><br/>So one day three strangers roll up unannounced at the front door, Grace assumes that they have answered an ad offering work and employs them all instantly.<br/><br/>They are: Mr Tuttle – Gardener/Handyman, perhaps 60. Mrs Mills – Nanny/Cook, also about 60. And Lydia – Maid, around 30 ish and a mute.<br/><br/>Grace explains that her previous help vanished, and she takes great pains going through the rules regarding her children to Lydia and Mrs Mills.<br/><br/>So one day Grace hears a crying child and immediately assumes it is one of hers. Nuh-huh, they are both OK. Ann blames some other kid named Victor who Grace has never heard of so she punishes Ann for the perceived lie. After mutterings, random noises and scuttling upstairs, it seems evident that someone else is in the house, and after questioning Ann matter of factly explains that there are in fact 4 others including the afore-mentioned Victor.<br/><br/>Of course Grace being proper and rational initially doesn't embrace this idea, only as the usual evidence of self closing and opening doors, footsteps, unmanned pianos that play and random voices sorta changes her tune somewhat. She demands that the three servants search the home and grounds for evidence.<br/><br/>A bit of an odd turn of events happens about half way through that I won't ruin (though it makes little if any sense), Grace decides to go for help through the fog, but eds up becoming disoriented and lost, until she finds..<br/><br/>Again I can't say, but it does seem that the hired help know more than they are letting on, and that again someone else is in the house. Aside from Mrs Mills, the help seem to be around more to give the audience and Grace someone to be suspicious of, as elsewise she would be largely jumping at shadows.<br/><br/>The Others finishes with a decent turn of events that makes sense given what precedes it, but unlike The Sixth Sense it does not reward repeat viewings for some reason. I had far fonder memories of this film from when I initially saw it in the early part of the decade than after watching it the other night. In essence I realised that it was a film with one scare, that wasn't really scary anyway, and two revelations that are both OK, but once you know 'em you know 'em. There is little joy in revisiting this flick.<br/><br/>However It does contain one of the (inadvertently I think) funniest lines in film history. Grace is once again seriously discussing things with her kids and in an attempt to comfort Nicholas says: ""You'll never go to war."", to which Nicholas in typical 4 year old fashion replies ""We never go anywhere."" Dunno why, but it cracked me up enough to rewind it twice.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. This is worth seeing the first time, but if you've seen it before don't ruin any positive memories by watching it again.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

The Others doesn't rely on constant jump scares, buckets of gore, or violence. Its originality, understated performances, and focus on atmosphere are the reasons why I enjoy it so much. Every character is ominous and unsettling in their own way, and every event has a hidden meaning. Those are also the reasons why it still holds up so well, when many other supernatural movies lose their luster after the first viewing.  <br/><br/>The plot is as novel as modern ghost stories come. There's several very creepy moments, and they're thankfully explained by the revelations of the movie, instead of eliminated by them.

Imagine the lives of the children, living in darkness, loneliness and fear must have been tough and traumatising. It would have been great if the plot could have touched more on that."

"mnpollio","8","0","2","21 August 2009"," Refreshingly old-fashioned, character-driven haunted house story
","Set in the isolation of the Jersey isles in the days directly following the conclusion of World War 2, Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, an upright Catholic mother coping with the absence of her husband who has yet to return from the front and the burden of raising two precocious children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) whose deadly allergy to sunlight requires her to keep their immense home shrouded in darkness. Into their strange home arrive an eccentric trio of servants, headed by the seemingly benevolent housekeeper Mrs. Mills. Shortly thereafter, Grace finds their lives turned inside-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that they are not alone in the house and in fact may be the targets of a malevolent haunting. Alejandro Amenabar's lush haunted house story is moody, atmospheric and plays far more like a richly textured old-fashioned film from the 1940s than the garish gross-outs and rock-'em/sock-'em visuals that cater to the attention deficit audiences of today. He has been blessed with a stellar cast, spooky settings and a solid screenplay, which keep the audience guessing as to what is going on. Sharp-eyed viewers might guess some of the elements, but it is doubtful that they will guess all of them as Amenabar has a tendency to consistently provide new twists to muddy the waters. Bentley and, particularly, Mann are credible, sympathetic youngsters, who may be victims to their physical health, but are often more astute as to what may be happening than their mother. Fionnula Flanagan is an inspired choice as the motherly housekeeper, whose unflappable demeanor masks a bit of the sinister. Much of the film rests on Kidman and her interpretation of the not always likable Grace. At the start of the film, Kidman presents Grace as rigid and unwavering – a woman to whom no obstacle cannot be overcome by sheer will and a reading of scripture. She honestly seems to love her children, but seems torn between the resentment of constantly living in darkness and isolation on their behalf and embracing the inherent martyrdom of such an existence. There is a certain bit of viewer satisfaction in watching her world shaken up a bit and seeing her iron façade start to slip. Kidman does a marvelous job of walking the line between making Grace a force to be reckoned without turning her into a hateful tyrant and then slowly transitioning her into a far more complicated woman, whose emotions slowly start bubbling to the surface. I actually find this a far more difficult and intriguing performance than the one for which she would win the Oscar the following year in The Hours. A truly worthwhile and haunting film that actually grows on the viewer even moreso over time."
"Aaron1375","6","0","1","1 August 2009"," Not really much horror or mystery in this one.
","It entertained for the most part, granted it was rather easy to figure out the twist to this one. That may have more to do with the movie ""The Sixth Sense"", because thanks to that movie one tends to be looking for a possible twist especially when reviews talk about the shocking ending or what not. This movie has a lady and her two children living in a very big house where one day a group of three mysterious strangers comes and offers their services. Well the mother accepts and so starts the spooky going ons and such that accompany all such films as these. For the most part they are minor stuff here and there. Apparently the daughter suffers from some disease and must stay out of the sunlight, yet the shades set up keep coming down. There are other strange happenings and a strange visit by the father who for some reason comes and goes in very strange and mysterious fashion. Then there are scenes where the girl is seemingly possessed which are quite nice. Still the movie was somewhat disappointing, it is one of those horror/suspense films that is a bit to talky for my tastes and one of the films to start the current trend of PG-13 rated horror films. It also has Nicole Kidman in the lead and I have never been a big fan of hers, as she was one of the worst lead actresses in a Batman movie besides nearly everyone involved in part four. However, I will say this is one of the better roles I have seen her in. I may have found this movie entertaining if we can go back to a day where the surprise ending is not advertised in the trailers."

","The Others is without a doubt one of the few epic classic-feel Ghost Stories of the decade, and perhaps the only great ghost story in recent years. Alejandro Amenábar's direction is superb. He directs with great confidence, majestically structures every scene, and thanks to the cinematographer, creates a truly suspenseful thriller. His screenplay is also brilliant, captivating in all of those classic mansion stories, and giving a lot to play with. But he also does what none of the new thrillers do- give his characters passion and feel. Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance here, her best work of the new century. She gives her character sophistication, but her character is also flawed and sometimes not too likable, and she plays it brilliantly. The two child performances are also captivating, especially James Bentley. The whole cast is superb, making this film grander and more epic than I would have thought. The music is amazing. Kind of like the classic music from old horror films. The ending actually surprised me, which is rare, and because I was not sure how many ways it could have ended. The Others could easily have been done in the 70's, and I actually preferred it to the classic The Exorcist (which I really do not like all that much).

","A woman and her two children live in a large house, waiting for the father to return. A maid, a gardener and a nanny arrive to help take care of the large house. But some others arrive, too -- a group that believe the house if rightfully theirs. This house is haunted! Nicole Kidman stars. Tom Cruise produces. It's tough to say how much of this film is due to their involvement and how much is due to just being a good movie. Certainly the success and nominations came from Kidman appearing (any other actress and this film would have faded into quick obscurity). But it's still artsy and I like that about the movie.<br/><br/>I really can't talk about this film because there's twists and I want to mention them to really give a good overview. I knew about the twists when I sat down to watch this, which I think took something out of the film for me. Which leads me to think this film would not be half as good on a second or third viewing. My colleague in the movie review business, The Butcher, listed this as a must-see horror film. And it ranks at the bottom of the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films, which is still respectable. I guess I don't think it's as good as they make it out to be.<br/><br/>The ""horror"" elements are pretty much just thumps, bumps and people who might be ghosts that we don't really ever see (they always leave the room before the camera enters). So, it's not a scary film. The house and costumes are beautiful, for what that's worth... but not scary.<br/><br/>Go ahead and watch this one. I think it's more a drama than horror, but that's not a reason not to watch it, I suppose. Strong acting everywhere, and the kids are fun if for no other reason than they have interesting accents. I suspect they'll never get another acting job again (especially the boy). Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless."

She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all ""come together"". The scene in an unexpected sexy white night gown asking for love from his estranged husband is a small, very small gem :).<br/><br/>Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, I want to live in this house! (Unocuppied if possible :)). To all of us who have read ""The castle of Otranto"" in loony early teens, this was what Walpole was talking about :)!<br/><br/>Horror is the contrary to gore. It's atmosphere, not ketchup. This is more of a psychological study (and a lesson in acting, let us not forget ""Fionnula Flanagan"" and Grace's bratty daughter. By the way, I LOVE everybody's English usage, and how it reveals class differences between ""Master and servant"". Body language too!<br/><br/>This is a MENTAL drama, the plot wisely gives us SOME keys to keep us engaged, but never enough to foresee what's coming. At least not me! ""kate_hartshorn"" (Irvine, CA) is right: this could well be a practical case of a ""psychology of perception"" course. And I agree with Mr. Kleinman from Portland (also on Amazon) that one should better NOT read much before the film. I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's ""plot keywords"" would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).<br/><br/>I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace. I give it a ten although, for I suspect it follows the ""rules of the genre"" that preclude any glorious and hefty monologue alla ""Pacino"" or something heroic, political or socially relevant. <br/><br/>I can't see how this film could be improved, but I am not so sure it would stand a ""second viewing"". At least, not in the near future. And certainly NOT a third one!! I suspect this is what separates the films that you ""carry to the grave"" to other ""mental exercises"".

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","2","6 July 2006"," Brilliant, and almost sublime... a masterful work within the genre of psychological horror-thriller
","As I write this moments after the second viewing of the film, I can say without a doubt that this is one of those rare films that benefit greatly from being watched more than once by any viewer. Having been very interested in the work of director/writer/composer Alejandro Amenábar basically since I first knew of Abre Los Ojos, after watching the Americanized remake with Cameron Crowe at the helm(and much, much more upon actually watching some of his work), I made sure to watch this as soon as I could. I remember being gripped and never really looking away... and astoundingly, I had much the same reaction this time, as well. This time, I noticed all the little hints along the way... all leading towards the shocking and intelligent twist. Anyone who hasn't seen this, I urge you to avoid hearing what it is, and make sure not to read neither the quotes nor the keywords for the film. And yes, it is somewhat similar to another popular movie(which I haven't and don't intend to see), but a movie doesn't have to be 100% original to be excellent. The plot is incredibly well-written, and it develops exactly as it should. The pacing is perfect. You're never bored and the film never hurries to get where it's going. The acting is flawless, quite simply. As far as Kidman and the other adults go, this is no major surprise, but the children... they are quite simply among a far too small group of extraordinarily talented young actors. The cinematography is breathtaking. The editing is masterful. Something that simply must be mentioned is the lighting... the way it almost becomes a character itself, the way it affects everything else, the way it is played with throughout the film. Explaining the lighting as well as the general isolation is the fact that the two children suffer from a tragic illness... they cannot survive sunlight. What is amazing that throughout the course of the film, you get used to this... the darkness, the thick atmosphere; it becomes every-day life. Near the end, you find yourself fearing the sun... the bright light. Featuring no real gore, blood or violence, the horror is all psychological. The atmosphere and the light(or lack thereof) creates a lot of tension and suspense... and all of it pays off so well. There are no false scares, nothing gratuitous and the whole film is very close to being sublime. Now, to the real problem with this film, at least my problem with it... it's simply not as open as the other works of Alejandro. It's more Hollywood, easier to take in. Instead of challenging you to think, of providing food for thought, questions as opposed to answers(as Amenábar himself has commented that his films are about)... it reveals everything at the end. It leaves little, if anything, up to the viewer to decide or debate. All is explained... the very thing that ruined what potential the remake of his film, Abre Los Ojos. I understand trying to open up to a wider audience, but it's a little sad that he has to make a compromise with his integrity and goals in doing so. With that said, however, this is still not the average Hollywood flick; there is still nothing in the film that is entirely superfluous, and almost every frame of it is perfection, pure and simple. I recommend this to any fan of Alejandro Amenábar, any of the actors and psychological horror/mystery-thrillers. 8/10"

","""The Others"" is an excellent blend of suspense, horror, and mystery. It has a great story, some great acting, and I thought it was pretty scary. But you have to like ghost stories to enjoy this. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a mother who lives in a dark, old island mansion in the 1940's, with her two children, Anne and Nicholas, who are allergic to the sunlight. After some servants arrive to their darkened home, strange events begin to plague Grace and her children. As things get stranger and stranger, Grace becomes convinced that her home is haunted, and she begins to suspect something strange about the servants. Is the house really haunted? Or is there something even more disturbing going on? <br/><br/>Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar brings this delightfully eerie ghost picture to the screen, in the vein of Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller, ""The Innocents"", and Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"". The story is nicely crafted here, and while the similarities between this and ""The Innocents"" are obvious, ""The Others"" is definitely it's own movie. Fans of slow-going, old-fashioned horror films will love this, because of the steady pacing that still manages to send chills up the spine. It's a bit of a slow film in the beginning, but things do pick up, and there is plenty going on in the meantime to keep the audience intrigued. The entire movie is done in the style of those classic haunted house stories we know. <br/><br/>A very dark and Gothic atmosphere is prevalent as well, and director Amenabar captures some very eerie images and some excellently-constructed scare sequences. As for the twist-ending, I have to give some major credit for it. I never saw it coming, and it fit the story perfectly, completely reversing whatever ideas you had about the film. The acting is also great, Nicole Kidman plays her role as the eccentric mother perfectly, and Fionnula Flanagan plays one of the kindly new servants to the household nicely, as do the rest of them. And the children playing Kidman's son and daughter were also very remarkable in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Others"" is a classy and Gothic ghost story, reminiscent of those haunted-house classics we all remember. This film sets up an intense atmosphere - very dark, subtle, and old-fashioned. I enjoyed it. If you like this kind of movie, surely see it, you won't be disappointed. ""The Others"" is a great example of what a genuinely good ghost story should be like. 9/10."

"paul2001sw-1","8","0","1","2 April 2006"," Works hard, but worth it in the end
","Alejandro Amenabar's film 'The Others' is in some senses a straightforward copy of 'The Sixth Sense' (with a nod to 'The Shining' added in for good measure). We are introduced to characters who bear witness to ghosts but whose own life is strangely disconnected from the world around them: the punchline is that they themselves are among the dead, only they have not yet acknowledged it. The formal structure of this revelation is more satisfying in 'The Others', it's still well signposted but there's a symmetry in the relationship between the ghosts and the living that is shocking and pleasing at the same time. The film also lacks the pompousness of M. Night Shyalaman's film, and works as a genuinely creepy horror movie despite almost the complete absence of special effects. What doesn't quite work is Nicole Kidman's central character, the woman who is dead but doesn't know it: her behaviour when she (and we) believe she is still living is apparently so batty that it's hard to relate to the story; while the eventual role reversal is handled with great skill, the earlier form of the tale (an apparently conventional ghost story) works far less well (for reasons that we eventually understand when the tables are turned). In consequence, I would say this is a genuinely spine-tingling movie with a great ending; but not a great movie overall, one that seems less silly in retrospect than it does when you're actually watching it. Both it and 'The Sixth Sense' demonstrate that this sort of trickery can work if handled with sufficient skill, but neither film completely succeeds in hiding the forcing of the plot needed to make it happen."

It confirms the old saying that the most frightening things are the things we can't see. I won't say what the ending was but there was a ghost story on ITV television about 25 years ago with the same title and the same basic story, though with less actors. I can't find it on the IMDb but it was very highly praised at the time. I doubt if any recording exists of it now so it must be coincidence that this movies has the same plot and title.

All of the servants have recently quit without notice, leaving Grace alone to care for the two children, Nicholas and Anne. To Grace's relief, three new servants arrive and offer their services; Mr. Tuttle tends the grounds, the mute Lydia takes care of the housework and the wise old Mrs. Mills becomes the children's new nanny. Nicholas and Anne are both highly photosensitive children and can never be exposed to sunlight, or else they will die within minutes. Therefore, the curtains are kept tightly closed and the gloomy mansion is lit only by weak candlelight. But although Grace seems to be getting her life back under control at last, something sinister seems to have invaded the mansion. Anne swears she has seen ""others"" in the house: an old, blind woman and a little boy. Grace suspects Anne of making up stories but soon, she too is hearing odd noises. Footsteps can be heard upstairs in rooms locked and empty. A grand piano plays by itself. Voices and whispers echo throughout the house. As the emotionally fragile Grace begins to fall apart, the terrible truth becomes unavoidable: the house is haunted. But who, exactly, are the ghosts?<br/><br/>This is such a great, classy ghost story, genuinely frightening without a drop of blood anywhere in sight. Nicole Kidman delivers a knockout performance as Grace, who is so tightly wound up that you keep waiting for her to explode at any given moment. The entire cast is awesome, if you want to know the truth. Fionnula Flanagan is kindly and sweet, but also scary as hell when she wants to be. Alakina Mann is seriously creepy as Anne, the somewhat sadistic older sister. The mansion and its surrounding grounds drip with Gothic horror, shrouded in mist, silence, neglected gravestones and fallen leaves. I suppose I ought to have seen the great twist ending coming, but I honestly never suspected a thing and was exhilarated by the revelation. <br/><br/>Highlights include a scary voice in an empty storage room, a music room door that slams shut in Kidman's face, some eerie photographs of the dead and, of course, the great scene between Grace and an old, blind woman wearing her daughter's dress.

Add a creepy group of servants and what you have is some spooky (Good Lord, don't go in there) kind of fun. One of the best features that I learned about the film after viewing it a few times is that almost all the dialog is spoken very soft, a whisper in some scenes, this forces you to turn up the volume, and in turn, when something scary happens (see where I'm going with this?), your t.v. is cranked and jump straight out of your chair (cool stuff).

","When I first saw that film, I was thrilled to see a motion picture that did not require much special effects to be captivating. The ensemble of the cast is quite convincing, especially for Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan as the mother and maid servant.<br/><br/>What I especially liked was the feeling of unsettlement caused by the fact the story took place in a mansion in Europe during WWII, the style of photography, the sound effects, the eeriness of the two maid servants and the gardener. The fact that the children suffer from a skin disease that prohibits them from strong light exposure darkens the essence of the film.<br/><br/>That film carries a flaw though. For those of you who have seen The Changeling, you will probably find the séance in both films are quite alike. The catch is The Changeling was released sometime around 1979 - 1980. When I watched The Others, it felt like watching The Changeling... only this time... seen from the ""other side"".<br/><br/>I must admit that, on the whole, I liked that movie enough to buy the two-disk DVD edition."

","""We must learn to live together . . . the living and the dead."" Certainly one of the most chilling lines you will ever hear. Kidman has done some good movies, some mediocre movies, and even a few what we would call bad movies. This is not one of them. She is terrific. She plays the mother of two terribly sick children living on an island off of England during World War II who has just lost her husband. She hires three strangers who just happen to have worked in her home previously and begins to have strange occurrences happen soon afterward. The movie takes awhile to come full circle but it once it has you in it's grip it won't let you go. It is fiendishly scary and the buildup to the finale is filled with tension and suspense.

","""The Others"", starring Nicole Kidman, sustains its classic horror setting without being super formulatic (though at times it is). It has a brilliant surprise ending, but some people may not understand it the first time watching.<br/><br/>Grace Stewart (Kidman) is a stressed-out and enormously religious English housewife whose husband has gone off to fight in the war (I think it's World War 1). Her children are allergic to sunlight, and can only live by candlelight. The family lives in an enormous, evil-looking mansion on an English island, where it's always foggy and huge black gates protect the sizable estate. The house looms over the grounds, and - huge surprise! - there's a small cemetery in the back. Now who would guessed - a horror movie? With a cemetery?!!!! Anyways, Grace hires a crew to tutor the kids and be general servants. It's an odd crew, featuring a witch-like elderly lady, an equally wicked-seeming gardener, and a timid servant girl who never speaks a word (this part is awkwardly played by the actress). Once the crew is hired, strange things start to happen - including a stupendously filmed scene involving a forbidden piano playing in the night. Grace connects the bizarre happenings with the ever-odd crew, whose eccentricity seems to be growing with the surreality.<br/><br/>Despite some awkward acting and horror movie deja vu, this is an amazing movie that will scare you long after you finish watching it."

","""The Other's"" is an entertaining yet somewhat misleading movie; billing it as a horror movie is just wrong. That isn't to say that the movie didn't possess elements of the genre, just that enough of them simply weren't present. The movie's setting is very moody, and the fact that it takes place entirely in a relatively dark area makes the suspense level rise incredibly, and the direction is enough to keep you on your toes. The cast isn't one filled with big names - save Nicole Kidman - but the characters don't exactly need to be deep to fit the part. Kidman's performance was good, but seemed a little eccentric and dragged out during most of the scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is more of a suspense thriller; it does deal with ghosts, but not in a conventional sense by any means. The story is the kind that takes a few unexpected twists, which does help to make the movie what it is."

This film has been created with exceeding care and astonishing craft, and the strongest evidence of this is the difficulty in choosing any one area as superior.

","To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns. Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isolated mansion following World War II. Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning. The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur. Is the woman going mad? Are the servants involved? Have intruders secretly entered the house? Or could it be--something unearthly? The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances. But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character. In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film. It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.<br/><br/>The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right. But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel. If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.<br/><br/>The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other. Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk. The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.<br/><br/>It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance. But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found ""Grace"" an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS.

","I reluctantly sat down last night and watched this movie. I'm no fan of horror movie, since it's mostly stuff like ""boo!"" and the only purpose is to make you jump, but this film is different. It's subtle and it builds up the tension all the way to the surprising ending. There's hardly any special effects and the film relies a lot on the actors, whom all are excellent (especially Kidman and the children). This movie is made in a simple way, but it's so much better and effective then the big budget, CGI filled ones.<br/><br/>A break down of the plot then: A women (Kidman) lives alone with her two children on the Channel Islands just after World War II.

"JamesHitchcock","7","0","1","2 February 2005"," A Ghost Story of the Old School
","Ever since the success of The Exorcist and similar films in the seventies, serious horror films (as opposed to the tongue-in-cheek variety) have normally been overstated. By this I mean that such films have been dominated by special effects, with plenty of blood and gore and everything shown explicitly. Before that, however,there was a tradition of making more subtle, understated horror films, where the horror is implied rather than shown directly. Examples that come to mind are The Spiral Staircase and the original versions of Cat People and The Haunting.<br/><br/>Although it is a recent film, The Others falls within this earlier tradition. It is set on Jersey in 1945, shortly after the liberation of the island from Nazi occupation. Grace Stewart lives in an old manor house with her young son and daughter. The two children suffer from a rare allergy to sunlight, which means that they cannot go outside but must stay indoors in darkened rooms. Grace's husband, who was fighting with the British Army, is missing, presumed killed. The children begin to believe that the house is haunted by the ghosts of an old woman, a married couple and a boy named Victor. At first Grace does not believe them; she is a devout and strict Roman Catholic, who dismisses belief in ghosts as superstitious. The strain of living in such a lonely, gloomy house and her worries about her missing husband and her children's health, however, are beginning to tell on Grace's mind. The strange behaviour of the three servants she has engaged is another source of worry for her, and she starts to wonder whether there might be something behind the children's stories.<br/><br/>The film ends with a sudden, shocking twist (which I will not reveal). I have read in other comments on this board, and elsewhere, that the twist is an obvious one which anyone can see coming. I suppose that it might be obvious to real horror film buffs; all I can say is that it certainly took me by surprise. Too often a surprise ending merely serves to show off the scriptwriter's cleverness, without any thought being give to the film's internal coherence, but in the case of The Others, although the twist was unexpected, I found the film had a satisfying ending that made sense in the context of what had gone before.<br/><br/>Establishing a suitably eerie atmosphere is an important factor in the success of a horror film, and The Others is extremely atmospheric. The film was shot in a rambling old house (actually in Spain, although it looks very English). For most of the time we see the house shrouded in dense mist. The children's rare illness, as well as being relevant to the plot, also serves as a device which enables the director to ensure that most of the interior scenes, even daytime ones, are suitably gloomy. Light only enters the house at the end, when the mysterious housekeeper opens the blinds against Grace's strict instructions. This development leads straight into the surprise denouement; the physical light of day and the metaphorical light of truth enter the house at the same time.<br/><br/>There are some effective performances, especially from Nicole Kidman as Grace. Grace, who starts off as a strict, authoritarian parent and gradually becomes more and more disturbed, is portrayed as that very dangerous type of individual, the control freak who is losing control. There are a number of holes in the plot; it is never, for example, explained how Grace's husband managed to escape from the German-ruled island to join the British forces. The sudden reappearance of the husband halfway through does not really add much to the film. Overall, however, I found this an impressive and genuinely frightening ghost story; proof that, even in the twenty-first century, one can still make an effective horror film without resorting to explicit violence or stomach-churning special effects. 7/10"

","I did enjoy this film. I felt it was cleverly thought out and, despite the many comparisons to the Sixth Sense (released 1999, two years before), I would emphasise that it is a completely different film. True, in concept, the ""surprise"" ending is the same, but the way the film reaches that conclusion is very different. In fact there is less of an attempt to hide the ""truth"" as numerous clues to the final outcome are indicated all the way through The Others, whereas The Sixth Sense is more subtle and subliminal requiring a second viewing. With The Others you think ""ah yes, of course"" whilst The Sixth Sense was ""wait a minute, that's not right"".<br/><br/>Also, this film is a refreshing change from the recent Hollywood approach, that would have no doubt sprinkled the film with high-speed camera views rushing through the house, numerous special effects, a full compliment of glamorous nubile (american) teenagers, a few gory murders and a more conclusive ending. No, like the Blair Witch Project, The Changling and The Haunting the horror is often in what you don't see - allowing the viewer's imagination to do all the work.<br/><br/>As for Nicole Kidman, I'm not so sure, but Fionnula Flanagan probably carries the film anyway.

There are some loose ends which don't exactly get tied up-where is her husband? Clearly he knows what happened even if his wife does not yet(""I asked them about that day..."" or words to that effect). You don't get as many clues along the way as you do in ""The Sixth Sense"" and you get the feeling that they're all just going to stay there until infinitely, forever a young mother and two small children.

I asked two females to go to the theater with me to see it, and both declined on the grounds that the movie just seemed to scary for them. I watched it alone in the theater, and overall I think it was a pretty good movie - it just didn't deliver the bone-chilling terror that the trailer leads you into believing.<br/><br/>The positives about The Others include Nicole Kidman, who gives a good performance as a strong-willed and over-bearing, religious mother, the setting (a Gothic mansion in the dense fog of the English countryside), and the ending - which caught me off guard and really made me think about this life and the afterlife for several days afterwards. All in all, I think this movie was designed to critique religious doctrine or to make people question their own beliefs about religion and the afterlife.<br/><br/>There are a few decent scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat.

Like in Shyamalan's film, 'The Others' creates its suspension through the tension felt by its characters. However, Shyamalan was a mastermind when it came to keeping its audience riveted. In 'The Others', there are numerous scenes that go on way too long for their own good. Thus, at times the film feels unwatchable.

","Definitely overrated by the critics. This movie may be a masterpiece in comparison with most gore movies with liters on blood shed on every plan, but apart from that, it is quite dull and finally not so thrilling. Remove the ""sudden noise"" effects that make us jump a little, and you'll discover that there is nothing left to scare us. In what the plot itself is concerned, it has a taste of ""déjà vu"" (the sixth sense, abre los ojos - from the same director -, el arte de morir - another spanish movie -....). So, how long will this kind of plots surprise us, really ?. If you really want to be stuck to your chair with thrill and atmosphere, watch ""Gaslight"", a movie which is considered as a reference for this one. It was shot by George Cukor in 1944 and this is a masterpiece ! And you'll find by watching this old stuff that Ingrid Bergmann is far better than the ""continually half-opened mouth"" Nicole Kidman."

","Derivative claptrap, undermined further by a weak performance by its marginally talented leading lady. Kudos to the supporting cast for crafting strong performances out of paper-thin material, particularly the underrated Fionnula Flanagan. Their fine work, however, will not alleviate the viewer's growing frustration and boredom with this piece. Its director shamelessly rips off every suspense classic from ""The Uninvited"" and ""The Haunting"" to ""The Innocents"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", but does so without skill or coherence.

Basically we have a 30 minutes Twilight Zone episode dragged out into one full-length motion picture.<br/><br/>That is not to say that it's badly made, it's not.  The acting all round is very good, the atmosphere and direction are fine.  It's just the story is really just 10 minutes at the end of the film.  All the rest of the film is rather pointless and boring.<br/><br/>The film was made even more uninteresting by me predicting the twist in about the first 10 minutes of the film.  I'm actually surprised more people didn't.  After seeing Sixth Sense and any sci-fi film I always question everything.  Are they really there, have they gone back/forward in time, etc.  When they showed the first scene with Victor, immediately the thought that they actually might be the ghosts, popped into my head.  Of course when she meets the husband, the game is up.  He's dead, so she must be dead, plus the fog of course.

"nicholas.rhodes","Null","0","1","23 November 2002"," Over Hyped but interesting - the ""Fifth Sense and a half""
","I was very much looking forward to viewing this film, but whereas, I was completely duped by the ""Sixth Sense"", I could more or less guess the ending of this one ........ once you've got used to this sort of thing. The ""Sixth Sense"", on a second viewing turns out to be absolutely flawless from beginning to end, in ""The Others"", there are several illogicalities. I am not comparing the two films because their stories are the same, but the have one important common point, and that is quite simply, the plots in both case are seen from the point of view, if you like of departed souls ( Willis and Kidman ). If you've seen the Sixth Sense and been taken in by it, you can, if you have a minimum of intelligence, guess that the ""prémice de départ"" so to speak is that of someone who has passed on and so won't be taken in by this one. If you have not seen "" Sixth Sense, then the world's your oyster. Cinematographically beautiful, and Kidman delivers a magnificent performance, but all that continuous fog and gloom does get on your nerves after a while - and the costumes and accents of the three servants more or less give the game away that they are from another time. Now why does the husband suddenly turn up and then depart again the next day - there's a good question for you !! The so called surprise ending is perhaps a little sudden and late in the film to have a maximum effect one feels almost ""this has got to come to an end so let's get on with it and finish the thing off"" so to speak. In the Sixth Sense, I was totally taken aback when cat was let out of bag. If I'd been a mouse watching the film, I'd have been eaten up quicker than a lump of cheese !  As far as the DVD goes, what a shame the packing we have, on the version we have in France at least is so pathetic, when you take off the plastic wrapping, the whole thing falls apart in your hands and the discs fly everywhere !! Hopefully it's better in other countries ! Anyway I'll view the film in a couple of months again and maybe revise my opinion !"

","I really liked this movie - as someone else had commented, it's one of the few to literally send chills down my spine.  It takes a lot to get that kind of reaction out of me.<br/><br/>It's also one of the few to be described on the cover as having a ""surprise ending"" that I didn't see coming in its entirety, though in retrospect, all the clues really were there.  It is, actually, very unlike a Shyamalan movie, though the comparison to ""The Sixth Sense"" has been made.  The clues in ""6th Sense"" were ridiculous and mostly useless - the ""red"" thing for example.  The only times that the colour red stands out as remarkable are the shots of the doorknob - otherwise: people wear red clothes, and have red balloons at parties, so no one will notice or care.  The clues in ""The Others"" are more subtle than the red doorknob, but not subtle to the point of being uselessly obscured by their common-ness.<br/><br/>The pacing, I thought, was perfect.  Any faster and there wouldn't have been enough time for the fact to sink in: there is something really not right about this household.  Any slower and it could have become a very tiring thing to watch.  This film is very much like being strapped into a medieval torture device handled by the most excellent Marquis de Sade himself - it's not in the pain of the device or the surprise of the ending, but in the anticipation of it that the thrill lies.<br/><br/>Very moody film, highly recommended!"
"blakepfeil","10","0","1","27 September 2002"," True Film-making at its best, a classic for all generations
","""There is something in this house... something diabolique... something... that is not at rest.""<br/><br/>With these words, you know you've run into a good, elegant thriller/drama, starring Nicole Kidman.  Yes... you've run into ""The Others.""  Although the total effect this movie has, I think the particular standout in the movie would be the main star: Nicole Kidman as Grace.<br/><br/>Amazing.  That's the word I'd use while describing Nicole Kidman. Absolutely fantastic... amazing.  She is the single most talented actress of the 20th and 21st century, besides the beautiful Grace Kelly.<br/><br/>
No.  Even better: Nicole Kidman is the Grace Kelly of today's Hollywood world.  She is truly unforgettable in any role that she portrays, at all. Whether it be the spooky teacher in ""To Die For"", or as an 'whore' in ""Moulin Rouge"" (which she was nominated for an Oscar this year), or as a Russian 'spy' in ""Birthday Girl.""  She is truly a ""wow"" of our time.<br/><br/>But now to ""The Others.""  This movie really hit me as one of the most wonderfully ever produced thrillers ever seen on the silver screen.  It really, is truly, awesome.  And what makes it awesome?  Nicole Kidman. Flat out, she should've at LEAST been nominated for the Oscar this year for her flawless performance as Grace, the spine-tingling mother who is on the edge, every moment she's on the screen.<br/><br/>It's the aftermath of World War II.  The Nazis have been beaten and controlled.  Grace is haunted from the fact that her husband went off to war and never returned.<br/><br/>To top it off, she has two children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a serious, deathly allergy to light.  Because of this allergy (known now in modern day as ""XP""), the house must always be kept in the dark, no daylight must shine in.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Grace, just having woken up from a terrible nightmare, screaming in her bed.  As soon as it's over, we start to unravel the mysteries of the new, mysterious housekeepers right away.  We meet Mrs. Bertha Mills, Mr. Edmund Tuttle, and a girl named Lydia, who've come to the mansion in hopes that there would be an opening fit for them as housekeepers and gardener of the estate, which rests on the Jersey Islands in England.<br/><br/>
Grace already knows what the 3 have come for, and invites them in, showing them around the house.  As she gets to explaining things, she mentions that the last servants disappeared ""into thin air"" almost a week previous that day.<br/><br/>And then she introduces them to the children.  Almost immediately, they take a particular liking to Mrs. Mills, the kind and gentle ""grand-mother figure"", who will be their Nanny.<br/><br/>Soon after, strange things start happening.  And this is where ""The Others"" gets to the top point of the film.  The portrayal and mystery of the lighting that Alejandro Amenabar played with is more than fascinating. It's a ""cinematographers dream"" as Nicole Kidman states in the documentary on the special edition DVD, come out in May.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie are both moving and worthy of any award you can find and offer.  Nicole Kidman as the edgy Grace; Alakina Mann and James Bentley as the scared and curious children, with the allergy to light; Fionnula Flanagan as the mysterious, yet sweet Mrs. Mills; Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes as the two quiet, humble, mysterious companions of Mrs. Mills; Christopher Eccleston as the grief and war striken husband Charles; and last, but certainly not least, Renee Asherson as the ""old woman"" or ""witch"" who's calm and soothing voice makes you want to fall into a deep sleep.<br/><br/>The overall effect this movie produces is a scary and moving, touching one. There are those moments where you can be on the edge of your seat and those other times where you feel yourself tearing up at the destruction the war has caused.<br/><br/>Sets and costumes were perfect for that era, and the lighting especially sticks out when chase scenes within and outside of the dark, creepy house begin.  The lighting was crucial to the overall effect, because you are put in that view that the children have had their entire lives: a dim, eerie light.<br/><br/>Alejandro Amenabar is a true genius.  Writing a flawless screenplay is something you rarely fine these days... it is a true work of literature. Although their are the occasional goofs and obvious flaws in the film once or twice, the direction Amenabar put out was truly amazing.<br/><br/>You must rent ""The Others"" tonight... it will blow your mind!<br/><br/>Kudos, Blake"

","I don't have much to say about this film.  It had a very claustrophobic feel to it, lacking overview at times, and very few characters.  Not that it made it a bad film or anything.  The actors all did pretty good job, though I had a dislike of Nicole Kidman's character.  What I suspect was the downfall of the film, from my point of view anyway, was that you never really get what the story is about.  That is, until at the end, and let me tell you, if you know how it ends, the film is ruined for you (I think).

","The Others is very well acted, the performance by Nicole Kidman is I assume is the reason people glow about this mildly entertaining movie. Also the supporting cast is very solid especially the daughter who with patience, training, and proper film selection really has a chance to have very successful career she can steal the scene scenes from the more veteran Kidman. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT****As far as the story goes it failed as a suspense thriller because of its utter predictability. I had without trying or thinking about it at all, figured out the ""surprise"" ending. I admit that even the best crafted thriller can be guessed or figured out but usually it is by actually trying to. 5min into this film literally I had already guessed every twist and turn that was to be offered. These kinds of films can be completely ruined for most by too many hints much less knowing the outcome so I won't say a word other than trust me you have probably seen this film at least a few times under different names and pulled off more successfully. Another problem The Others has is mediocre to poor pacing, it dragged and then rushed and back again. Mostly it had a slight drag which causes the movie to be just a little dull. The Others has many strengths in my opinion good acting, the direction is good but not great (the pacing), the script is solid, cinematography, and honestly a good twist on second hand concept. Still for all it has going for it The Others comes short of it's goal which is to keep me guessing and on the edge of my seat.****END POSSIBLE SPOILER****<br/><br/>Great suspense for those who ALWAYS say ""I could never have guessed"", and those who pay little attention to the visual aspects of a film. Predictable middle of the road entertainment for everyone else. WARNING this film is no classic it does not bear multiple viewings, gets more flat each time you see it. DO NOT PURCHASE. Better uses of your time in this genre may be Psycho, The Shining, and Dead Again. Perhaps if The Others was released 10yrs ago I would have enjoyed it more but I am far from certain on that point.<br/><br/>2 1/4 out of 5 for this overrated thriller."

","Nicole Kidman has to be congratulated for giving an excellent performance as a woman living on the Channel Islands in a deserted looking house with two small children who are always seeing ghosts. That's the thrust of the tale and the screenwriters have taken bits and pieces of other such suspenseful tales--""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James about a governess and two children who communicate with spirits--and tossed in elements of ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" to come up with a nice little ghost story.<br/><br/>The picture could just as well have been filmed in black and white since it makes almost no use of color. The drapes have to be drawn because the children have an illness that makes them photosensitive to light. Fionnula Flannagan gives an appropriately eerie performance as a housekeeper who knows more than she's willing to tell and the children give expert performances. But it gives away its secret about halfway through (especially if you've been to the movies lately), so the ending comes as no great surprise.<br/><br/>Biggest drawback is the pacing of the film--very slow in spots and bound to make you feel something should happen soon. And the dialogue, especially by Miss Kidman, is below a whisper--someone should have made sure the film got a good dubbing before release--the music often drowns out some key passages in the dialogue, hindered even further by Miss Kidman's attempt at a proper accent. <br/><br/>Best watched with the remote in hand to adjust the volume for the soft spoken passages--and to turn it down for the screams!!"

Horrific imagines shown as drawings to not tell you a damn thing about the plot and a setting of darkness. We open with a fog filled screen with a huge house and a tag Jersey, 1946, or something to that extent. Hmm so the scene is set and we start into the great journey that is this film. We meet the main charectors an overprotective woman that is forced to close and lock everydoor as she walks around and is rude to the hired help that has just arrived. The acting is okay if you totally try and ignore Nicole Kidman for certain scenes, such as the one were her and the children are sitting around a candle lit table with their books. ""Bad little children go to limbo, and bad people go to hell""(or something similiar) begged the question Where do bad actresses go? Answer Jersey: 1946. I knew that opening would come in handy. I would not call this film scary. Dramatic, slightly suspenseful seeing as they don't tell you what the hell is going on and there are plenty of inexplicable events such as The husband just reappearing. Even the end doesn't explain how that happened. Your left with the only obvious answer to why it happened. To be 100% honest i was bored, but i wanted to know what was going on and had plenty of theories.  As a whoile it is good. The ending packs enough punch to make somethigns come together and fulfill the whole movies premise. However gettting their is not half the fun. Sitting through countless scenes of Nicole Kidman's charector being rude to everyone in sight, whether it be the three hired help people that appeared out of nowhere or her own children gets really old. The movie runs at about 90 minutes I belive. It could have been a 45 minute television show and made as much sense. IT might have satisfied me more also. However, we all know that audiences don't pay to watch good quality 45 minute movie, they pay 8 dollars to see a good 45 minute movie with an additional 45 minutes of pointless filler. We found our selves waiting for the notoriuos ""i am your daughter"" scene, and getting so exited once she was in the dress that we knew that took place in.

I rented the DVD upon release yesterday, watched it, and came away fairly disappointed. Kidman is good, but often the acting and dialog made me laugh, it often seemed to be more a borderline comedy than a horror or suspense movie. Nowhere near as good or suspenseful as recent films like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable.""<br/><br/>SPOILERS - DO NOT READ IF YOU'VE YET TO SEE THE FILM -- As the movie unfolds, and fairly deliberately at that, we come to see that Kidman is a fairly normal, if overly cautious, mother in 1945 England. Her children suffer a strange illness and must not be exposed to any strong light, especially not direct sunlight. She needs domestic workers and three show up, formerly worked there. Mom starts to hear noises that can't be explained. Or someone playing the piano. Then, all the curtains disappear. Turns out she and the kids are dead, as well as the three workers. The sounds they occasionally hear are the real people coming to view the property which is for sale. She loves her children, but had suffocated them with pillows. Her death was not explained. <br/><br/>A very ""atmospheric"" film, but to me not very suspenseful or frightening. And in the end, the story was not a particularly interesting one.

The family waits for the return of missing Husband/Father from WW2. <br/><br/>The film is based on an original script by the Spanish director himself, but shamelessly borrows from Henry James' epitomal ghost novelette, ""The Turn of the Screw"" and Thomas Tryon's psychological horror novel, ""The Other."" <br/><br/>
Whatever the case, you'll no doubt enjoy this chilling entry (filmed in mainland Spain, not the English island).

That made the film even scarier!!<br/><br/>                ******END OF EXTREME SPOILER******  <br/><br/>           All in all, this is a brillaint horror film with a great twist, which deserves a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!    <br/><br/>

","I have not yet seen the film, ""The Others"", but from what I have read and heard about it sounds like a new disturbing thriller that most definitely deserves attention.   I've also heard nothing but praises for the director of this film and I myself have taken a look at some of Alejandro Amenabar and think that he is very talented.<br/><br/>There is also a downside of the film for me.  I read in the plot summary that the children of Nicole Kiddman in this film have a desease which prohibits them from letting sunlight hit them directly.  This is not a downside to the film, because I think this is a very unique idea.  This is a downside for me because I am a filmmaker and have been working on a project for quite some time which contains a man with a similar desease.  The film I'm working on is set in the present and is more independant and film noirish so I hope people can over look that."

She is very believable and was a perfect choice. The two young actors were even better. Is it these magical and brilliant thrillers(""Sixth sense"", ""Unbreakable"") that bring the best out of children actors, or is it just my imagination. Anyway, a brilliant movie that can easily be compared to Shyamalan's ""Sixth sense"", especially the ending part, but in my opinion a very different movie. I consider the comparison to be flattering, since ""Sixth sense"" is well, an amazing and unprecedented movie experience, and ""The others"" produces a similar atmosphere, but it ends there. This movie takes its own path, and it does so very successfully. To make a horror movie without any blood, simply by playing with sound and light is extraordinary, and I realized it only after I read a review by a great Slovene film critic. Great, great acting, a thrilling and exciting story and of course a brilliant ending make this one of the best movie of 2001 and Alejandro Amenábar passed his first Hollywood movie making experience with flying colors.

I liked the fact that nothing is thrown in your face, that the tension builds gradually and that the story is very strong. Everything adds up just right, nothing is left to chance.

"emmet-2","Null","0","1","28 March 2002"," One wonderful movie
","I love scary movies. The only problem is, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that really had me scared. Last night, I saw ""The Others"", and my waiting was finally over.<br/><br/>The movie is set on the small channel island of Jersey right after the end of World War II. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a strongly religious woman who lives alone in a big mansion with her two young children. Her husband went fighting in the war and is missing, presumably dead. One night, something terrible happened in the mansion, and the servants all ran away. About one week later, three servants knocks on Graces door and offers their services. She takes them in and gives them their instructions. Because of a severe light allergy, the children must be kept out of the daylight. Every curtain in front of every window must be drawn, and every door in the house must be locked. To begin with, everything seems to progress as usual. But then, slowly, inexplicable things start to happen. Doors are left open. Whispering voices are heard. The piano starts playing itself. Graces daughter is ""seeing"" people all over the house. At first, Grace refuses to believe her. But as the events continue, she is faced with the fact that there are indeed ""intruders"" in the house - and she has to deal with them.<br/><br/>This movie had my complete attention from the very beginning. There is an ominous, eerie atmosphere creeping out from the screen and into you as you are watching. The bleak mansion covered in perpetual fog; the pale children with their mysterious condition; the three servants who may or may not be who they really say they are; and - in the middle of it all - Grace, a truly complex character - deeply religious, a control freak, and at the same time a loving, caring mother. Nicole Kidman gives a tremendous performance as Grace, and really brings out all the different aspects of her personality - especially her mounting insanity and despair. Fionnuala Flanagan excels as Mrs. Mills, the trustworthy nanny who ever so slowly seems to be changing into a menacing threat. And the two young children are the surprise of the movie, playing their parts to perfection. They have some of the scariest scenes in the film - one when they are in bed trying to sleep, and the daughter suddenly starts talking to one of the ""intruders"" only she can see (a boy named Victor), and one when they are hiding in a closet with danger looming outside. Other spooky scenes involve Grace in a storage room filled with objects covered in white sheets, Grace dressing up her daughter in a white communion dress, and Grace investigating sounds from a piano in a locked music room.<br/><br/>But single scenes aside, it's the movie's whole, intense atmosphere that really gets your adrenaline going. This is not a movie for those who love blood, gore and special effects. It relies on its magnificent plot, being slow and deliberate, and building up tension throughout until you are on the edge of your seat, biting your nails and holding your breath in anticipation. The cinematography, the camera angles, the subdued, menacing score - it all blends together into one wonderful movie. The only objection I have is the middle part of the movie, where the plot centers around Grace's lost husband and seem to lose focus for a while. But then it picks up the pace again, and the ending is both so terrifying and so wonderfully ingenious that you are left completely astounded. All the pieces fit together, all the loose ends are tied up and all your questions are answered - but in a way I certainly didn't see coming. ""The Others"" is a successful mix of several genres - the traditional ghost story, a thriller, a family drama - all in one. I'll rate it 6 out of 6 on my dice, and give it my highest recommendations."

","I thought I would get frightened watching this, and must admit that I shivered three times, but was this all there was? This is a film that looses tempo several times. The screw ought to be turned and turned and turned, but it isn't. This is too slow narrated.<br/><br/>If it was a parody on Hitchcock of the 40s it would be rather splendid, because it is played in a 40s manner, especially by Nicole Kidman, who is doing one of her best performances. This also goes for Fionnula Flanagan and the actors must have had lots of fun during the making of this film.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't hold together however. Definitely not. Nothing should be said about the ending, more than it's cheating and disappointing. Besides it's too much fog outside the house, it's too much spooky victorianism all around, it's too much walking in corridors, which would be all right in an parody, but this isn't. <br/><br/>You are not that frightened you're supposed to be."
"vladymirror","Null","0","1","26 August 2003"," overrated
","I will be brief with this one. First of all, I thing that one is pretty much over rated. To me ""The Ring"" is a better horror, creepy, scary movie than ""The Others."" I will not compare the latter one with ""The Sixth Sense"" for the unquestionable superiority of the Shyamalan's masterpiece. Secondly, if you remove the whole screaming and crying there will be nothing much left to scary you. Thirdly, everything was unfolding toooo slow. Endless dialogues and needless scenes in order to extend the running time.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, taking into consideration that even though done with virtually no special effects  (which is not what you'd expect hearing about a movie dealing with a creepy house and ghosts) it managed to keep the tension; together with the very good performance from the entire cast and especially the little girl (Alakina Mann), kind of save the film. The twisted end also worked for me - I didn't see it coming (probably, I was too bored with the slow pace to expect anything). <br/><br/>I guess I would recommend this movie to all those who like creepy suspense films with twisted endings-well, not recommend but more like suggest to try to see. I hope you won't be disappointed. 6.5 stars out of 10"

It contains many of what I thought were red herrings, leading you away from its true finale, but they were simply pointers to where the movie was taking you.<br/><br/>Another recent movie to do this was The Sixth Sense.  Where that movie differs was the fact even if you did guess the ending, the characters, acting and story were all top notch, so the entire movie didn't just rely on one twist.<br/><br/>And the worst crime of all for a horror movie:  the characters were all so unlikeable and annoying that you really did want to see them suffer.

","This is director Alejandro Amenábar's first feature film in English,<br/><br/>having previously worked in Spanish, and certainly the film does<br/><br/>have a European quality to it, making a welcome change from the<br/><br/>recent crop of Hollywood thrillers such as What Lies Beneath and<br/><br/>Unbreakable.  However, this is not to say that The Others is an<br/><br/>outright success.   Nicole Kidman deserves credit for taking a<br/><br/>chance on a relatively unknown director, but despite when of her<br/><br/>best performances to date, her character is too  neurotic and her<br/><br/>religious fervour which she inflicts upon the children, prevents her<br/><br/>from gaining our full sympathy.   <br/><br/>However, the main reason that The Others disappoints is that it<br/><br/>simply isn't scary enough.   The children lack any kind of creepy or<br/><br/>eerie qualities, so we never believe they are malicious, which<br/><br/>would have added an extra dimension to the suspense.  <br/><br/>Likewise, the servants are too homely to ever really be scary and in<br/><br/>particular for a British audience, Eric Sykes as the gardener is<br/><br/>never going to be spooky.   The children's allergy to light was<br/><br/>intended to subvert the horror convention of dark bringing fear and<br/><br/>light bringing salvation.  Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work and<br/><br/>instead just seems like a convenient device to allow most of the<br/><br/>film's action to take place in the dark.  <br/><br/>Nazi occupation of Jersey is mentioned, but doesn't form a major<br/><br/>part of the plot, which is certainly a missed opportunity to explore<br/><br/>more interesting themes than the straightforward supernatural line<br/><br/>the film chooses to follow."

Kidman, who seems literally luminous here, is actually upstaged at times by the performances of the children.<br/><br/>     It would be hard to praise the direction and editing too highly.

"Jaime_Fernandez","2","0","1","10 September 2001"," Amenábar is the copy-paste master
","We can begin with the best thing in The Others: Kidman, no doubt.<br/><br/>And the film itself is not a bad movie, but something worse. You can wonder what's worse than a bad movie? The answer is a non-original movie. And talking about Alejandro Amenábar a non-original movie is something really serious, because this boy has no one single original idea in his brains.<br/><br/>I mean, everything in his movies is copied from another film. In this case, even the idea and the lights are copied from another movies and not only the images, so this is something incredible. People who doesn't know much about cinema (or that are too young to have seen much movies) can see an obvious linking between The Others and The Sixth Sense (Night M. Shyamalan, 1999), but that is just one of the multiple copies of this film. And I write copies and not references or tributes, because I truly believe that Amenábar is a master in the copy-paste style. When you pay attention to The Others you can see images from The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973), Room at the top (Jack Clayton, 1959), The Haunting (Robert Wise, 1963), The Changeling (Peter Medak, 1980), La Chute de la Maison Usher (Jean Epstein, 1928), The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975, here the use of lights), and many others, including also Luis Buñuel (Viridiana, 1961) or Federico Fellini (Amarcord, 1974). So, there is an absolute lack of new ideas in this movie, what is an incredible pity, but a cruel reality. So, why much people love Amenábar? Well, it's really easy. When you are young you have no idea about what is already filmed. So you can create something incredible out of modern style just going to your videoclub and copying every single scene you love. But there is also another question more difficult to answer? Why do experts love this movie? OK, there are different possible answers. First, they are also too young and they have to learn much more. Second, they are Amenábar's friends (in Spain there are a lot of them, but even here there are some critics that have seen much copies in this movie than in any other filmed by the director). Third, they are in love with Nicole Kidman (and that's really normal). Fourth, they haven't seen the movie (this is not so impossible. I am a journalist and I know people who do it). Fifth, a mystery I don't understand. Summing up, Alejandro Amenábar is not a genius neither a clever  director. He is just a lucky boy who knows the best way to make a movie without wasting a single minute of thinking: to copy. And in that he is really a master, or at least, one of the best plagiarists of the world. Congratulations for that."

According to the IMDB, this was a first movie for both Alakina Mann and James Bentley, but they seemed like Hollywood veterans up on the screen. Both are wonderful actors and adorable kids. This movie really brought back the feel of films as they were long ago, you know? I mean, yes, it takes place in 1945. But there was no gore, which I think made it about a billion times better than those movies that people think are so phenomenal because they show some dead people. Don't get me wrong, I liked The Sixth Sense. I've heard a lot of people compare The Others to it, but honestly- The Others is even better. Although, The Others is definitely the same as The Sixth Sense in that they both need to be seen a few times for you to really understand every detail. I've already seen it twice and am going back again this week. An utterly chilling movie. Probably the first to ever make me so frightened that I literally began to shake.

","After most of this summer's films, I left the theater feeling like I had contributed money toward the intellectual decline of America.  The Others was a refreshing change in this sad trend.  Comparisons to the Sixth Sense will inevitably be made by folks who have had their sensibilities atrophied by too many lame thrillers, but -- except for the most obvious and shallow of plot points -- there really is no basis for comparison between The Others and The Sixth Sense.  Both are fine films with entirely different agendas. The Others joins a very small list of authentic film ghost stories, descendants of the rarefied and poetic fiction of the late Victorian era. Wiser comparisons would be to the original version of the Haunting, The Changeling, or the obscure 1989 TV film The Woman in Black -- films about the places, dramatic and metaphoric, our world touches the world beyond death, but also about the philosophical implications of such contact.  The Others will be too slow for viewers more accustomed to recent fare like the remakes of the Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, but for people who like their chills a bit more subtle, it is a rare and very fine treat.  With superior performances, atmospheric sets, and an allegorical content that will be lost on many viewers, The Others may be the best film I have seen this year."

The acting is good, even the children were good in this one.  <br/><br/>Don't expect some masked and deranged fellow pop out of nowhere and start jabbing people with a huge knife. This is a good old fashioned ghost story, which means that there's no gore and no real violence. That DOES NOT mean that you will not be frightened; if you pay close attention, you most certainly will."

","I have always been a fan of GOOD horror movies, those that are suspenseful, not obvious, keep you guessing types.  My absolute favorite was The Haunting (1963) because 1) it scared the begeezers out of me when I saw it at a theater, 2) it was filmed in black and white- much more ominous, 3) you never really saw anything that explained what was going on.  I do have a precious VHS copy & have been hoping it will be released on DVD. When I first saw the trailer for The Others I was quite excited; this looked like the first possible successor since Sixth Sense. I saw it today; I was definitely Not Disappointed.  Nicole Kidman was luminous, reminded me so much of Grace Kelly; the entire premise of the children's disease was genius. The movie was in effect black and white.  Nothing was really seen. The house itself was perfect.  Possibly the difference in the pacing of the movie was because it was filmed by a European???  Don't know, doesn't matter- it's terrific!"

","This movie is very good.  Mostly the things that scare you in the movie are the things you don't see.  This movie is very well done.  Nicole Kidman is great.  All I will say is that this movie has a surprising ending.  This movie was creepier than I thought it would be.  If you like movies that are weird and creepy then you will love this movie."
"foundyouhere","10","0","1","16 August 2001"," More than just ""Scary Stuff""
","To write my review I would like to rebuttal the comments that continually compare this film to that of the Sixth Sense.  The major difference between The Others and The Sixth Sense is that The Sixth Sense is a psychological drama with supernatural elements.  The Others is a psychological MYSTERY, with possible supernatural elements.  Two different genre's of film-making, two different ways of telling a story.  The surprise ending is usually a mandatory constituent of a mystery film.  The surprise ending to The Sixth Sense was interesting but raised question to possible plot holes.  The other remarkable device The Others presents is theory and conception.  The Sixth Sense lays out exactly what is trying to be achieved and the ""surprise"" ending is not out of character of the whole plot.  The Others ending may not have been a surprise to a select few audience members, but that's the point of a mystery, combining clues to theorize a climax ending; figure it out, congrats, to the rest of us who didn't, surprise!  In the end what is important is how you leave the theater, and while my friends and I left the The Others talking about possible theories the ending presents and what parts made us jump completely out of our chair,  leaving The Sixth Sense we were questioning the obvious plot holes that the ending left us with.   Everything about The Others is chilling.  Cliché?  Perhaps, but what is more satisfying than an old English mansion, surrounded by fog, with child inhabitants who fear seeing the sun at the medical risk of death? Especially when telling a horror story.  Not one drop of blood is shed in order to scare.  No CGI monsters, no running through the house as the floorboards are lifted from beneath them.  Noises, voices, mystery and psychological drama are the tricks to create fear.  The performances were creepy and admirable.  The sets were perfect.  The story was masterful, is this really a haunted house or haunted minds? Who are the caretakers, whats up with the husband, what happened to Grace to make her children more afraid of her than the possible ghosts?  So much mystery and all answered wonderfully.   Bone chilling, thought provoking entertainment."
"JohnnyUtah","Null","0","1","16 August 2001"," Good horror film similar to the classics
","The Others is actually a good recent horror movie. Recent horror movies have been really bad, most being of the teen-slasher genre. This one is a scary ghost story that is made like the old classic ghost story movies from the past. Their are no corny CGI effects in this(The Haunting 1999) or spoofs of the genre in this. This is one of Kidman's best performances, and shows she has come a long way since her subpar acting in Days Of Thunder.  If you want a good scary movie that is similar to the older style horror movies, I highly recommend this one."
"benmaddox","8","0","1","15 August 2001"," Steady as she goes...
","Settle in for a slow, but intriguing build to a layered and interesting story.  Kidman's performance is wide-eyed, strong and nuanced.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  More Sixth Sense tense than Psycho scary."
"Moriachnae","Null","0","1","15 August 2001"," It does not Shuffle, It BUILDS
","It really bothers me that so many people call this film ""excruciatingly slow"" and ""shuffling.""  Have we become so numbed by the current ""high speed-chase, hot sex and shoot-em-up"" trends that a movie that requires you to bring your brain is ""boring""?  There's no gore in this film, no bodies falling out of closets, no ""things"" bursting through abdomens...it requires you to think, to be patient and to wait.  It's that most rare of summer movies--a scary, fun ghost story that requires you to bring a little something besides your eyes and body.  It requires you to put some of the puzzle together for yourself.  (There are some gaps to be filled at the end, no matter what the denouement tells us.)<br/><br/>Although comparisons with ""The Sixth Sense"" are inevitable, they are also odious.  Oh, I liked the former, but it was fairly obvious from the first fifteen minutes where the last fifteen would end up.  (I always felt that the ""real""movie were those opening and closing minutes and the middle, however well done, was an excuse to get us from one to the other.)<br/><br/>""The Others"" builds on everything that goes before.  Why does Grace wake up screaming in the first frame?  What are all those little side scenes between the servants about?  Who is evil and who isn't?  What the heck IS going on in the attic???  And what's the deal with those curtains?????  As each new element is introduced (and the sequence in which Grace confronts her daughter in her communion dress is a corker) you have to compare it with the information you've been given before and try to find the place where it fits.  This is what intelligent 'fun"" movie making is about.  This is what intelligent horror is about--not bodies being ripped to shreds by hooded maniacs, but the subtle feeling that you just aren't alone, that things have been skewed, that it just isn't RIGHT...but you don't know why or how and fear that maybe you never will.<br/><br/>I will admit that I had some of the ending figured out in advance, but just enough twists were added (see The Communion Dress Scene above) to make you reconsider your reasoning.<br/><br/>So, skip the special effects (except those you provide with your brain) and get ready to be challenged and entertained.  (And if you are give to shivers, bring a sweater.  And you may want to bring a friend.)  This one requires some brain work and patience, but it will be worth it in the end. Have fun!"
"hatta","Null","0","1","15 August 2001"," ""...more things in heaven and earth...""
","A haunting film that combines elements from the best of this genre (`The Innocents', `The Changeling', `The Sixth Sense') but also owes much to the literary ghost story.  The lonely heroine, the wartime setting, and the prominent role of light are all reminiscent of some of the best supernatural tales of Elizabeth Bowen, such as `The Demon Lover' and `The Happy Autumn Fields.'  This is an intensely psychological, character-driven drama that benefits from an outstanding performance by Kidman in the complex role of Grace.  The opening narrative dialogue is a brilliant piece of thematic scene-setting; keep it in mind as this chilling tale of strange wonders unfolds."
"Stevenuccj","6","0","1","16 August 2001"," Best supernatural thriller since 1999's 6th Sense, BWP, Stir of Echoes
","This movie succeeds on a number of levels, but also fails to overly impress us with it's story or it's climax.<br/><br/>First off, it is very refreshing to see a movie such as this at a time where recent horror movies have been the pathetic ""Forsaken,"" and the mediocre slasher rip-off ""Valentine."" What do we have to look forward to?  ""Jeepers Creepers"" (sigh).<br/><br/>In this company, The Others may well go down as the best horror film of the year.<br/><br/>The acting in The Others is one of it's strengths.  Nicole Kidman, contrary to what I heard prior to seeing it, gives a strong performance as the authoritarian parent who doesn't know how to deal with the freaky happenings in the house.  The kids both give good performances, especially the daughter, in what may be the best performance of the movie.  The housekeepers are decent but not outstanding.<br/><br/>The lighting in The Others is really quite amazing.  The whole movie is lit by candlelight, and it plays out very realistically and adds to the atmosphere.  The cinematography is done flawlessly.  Director Alejandro Amenábar has shown he can film better than most directors today. <br/><br/>
The movie takes a long amount of time getting to the climax, but it keeps us interested.  Had it taken just a few minutes longer in getting there, the audience likely would have lost interest.  The problem with the movie lies with the climax and resolution, which doesn't quite make the trip getting there worthwhile.  There are good twists at the end, which I will not reveal, but at the same time we expect something more to happen which never does.  Part of the blame for that must go to the lack of important things happening leading up to the climax.<br/><br/>Overall a decent but not great movie, which seems like a godsend to horror fans at a time like this."
"gkleinman","6","0","3","26 July 2001"," A Unique Ghost Story
","The Others isn't your typical ghost story; there isn't the quantity of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills you'd expect to find in a film like this. In fact, The Others is virtually chill-free for the first hour. But what The Others lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality. Instead of a roller coaster of cheap chills and thrills, The Others takes a much denser and darker approach to the ghost story.<br/><br/>The Others takes a considerable amount of time to set everything up - almost too much. Halfway through the movie I wondered if there was going to be a pay off. Ultimately there is quite a pay off, but it takes so long to get there you might not feel it's 'worth it'. Despite the fact that I found The Others to be quite slow, I did enjoy it. Nicole Kidman does a great job as the neurotic and tortured lead, and she's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar lights almost the entire movie by candle light, something I haven't seen since Barry Lyndon. This gives The Others a soft and warm look that is uncommon to the genre. Amenabar also makes light a character in the film, where daylight becomes much scarier than the warmth and comfort of the dark. If you're planning on seeing The Others, I'd advise you to avoid reading any reviews which talk about the plot. The film takes a number of twists and turns which can easily be spoiled. This might be a good film to wait for DVD, except for the risk of the plot getting spoiled before you get a chance to see it."
