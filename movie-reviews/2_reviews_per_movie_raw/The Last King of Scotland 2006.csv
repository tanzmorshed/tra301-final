"CalRhys","Null","52","56","5 July 2014"," A Taut Political Thriller
","Gripping, brutal and powerful, 'The Last King of Scotland' is a brilliant dramatic depiction of the life of megalomaniac Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, perfectly portrayed by Forest Whitaker in his Oscar-winning performance as one of the greatest casting against type roles seen in film. His Amin is capricious and unpredictable, a personality that can seem volcanic one moment and vulnerable a few minutes later. A blunt and brutal tale, and one that is highly engaging from start to finish. A taut political thriller about power and corruption. Macdonald's riveting and incandescent direction caps this fictionalised drama, a truly stunning flick that remains as a highlight of film in 2006."

","Life, unlike bad movies, is seldom obvious. In life, murderous dictators don't appear - especially at first - as mustache-twirling Snidley Whiplash figures, cackling madly (although Mussolini came close). The scary truth about monsters is that they are three-dimensional beings, not cardboard cutouts, who just kill a lot of people, but otherwise put their pants on one leg at a time, like you and I, and that makes them so much scarier than if they came from another planet.<br/><br/>In the best film of the ""dictator genre,"" Oliver Hirschbiegel's brilliant ""Downfall,"" Hitler appears as a man who is kind to his dog and his secretary (roughly in that order), and the impact of the work is all the greater as we witness what a ""real person"" is capable of doing. In Luis Puenzo's ""The Official Story,"" Pinochet's reign of terror is depicted through a single act of violence, as a door is slammed on Norma Aleandro's hand; the effect is stunning and ""real."" <br/><br/>In the hands of a less talented director, the story of Idi Amin would be told against mountains of skulls and bones left behind by Uganda's mad ruler in the 1970s. (His total toll is estimated at 300,000.) In Kevin Macdonald's complex, intelligent, gripping ""The Last King of Scotland,"" more than half of the two-hour film subtly implies, hints at the dark forces underneath normalcy while ""life goes on."" <br/><br/>And so, having established real contact with the audience, a jolly and seductive Forest Whitaker then takes our breath away as the mask comes off, and his Amin reaches out from the screen for your throat.<br/><br/>Macdonald - whose previous works are documentaries, including the Oscar-winning ""One Day in September,"" about the Munich Olympics terrorist incident - looks at Amin through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy), a well-meaning, honest humanitarian slowly seduced by the Scots-loving Amin, who appoints him his personal doctor and then adviser.<br/><br/>The McAvoy character is fictional (although Amin did have a Scottish doctor), coming from Giles Foden's novel of the same name, but just about everything else in the film is based on fact - so much so that some documentary footage is smoothly integrated into the film. And yet, what's important and outstanding about ""Last King"" is that just as a painting can surpass a photograph in presenting reality, this film conveys the seduction and horror of a brutal dictatorship indirectly, subtly, unexpectedly.<br/><br/>Unexpected - and welcome - are the many flashes of humor, both Whitaker (dictator with personality) and McAvoy (eager pup of a doctor with overactive hormones) making the best of it. The tone is set in the opening sequence, as the frustrated, suppressed young Dr. Garrigan spins a small globe, swearing repeatedly that he will move to the first spot (""the first!"") where he points when the globe stops. The first spot turns out to be Canada. McAvoy/Garrigan takes one look, hesitates... and spins again. And so to Uganda...<br/><br/>The linear, freely-flowing story-telling is masterful, taking us from the small village where Dr. Garrigan comes to do good and ends up doing well through a chance meeting with Amin, to Kampala, much court intrigue and colorful depravity (even as the fate of a nation is at stake), and eventually to Entebbe.<br/><br/>Fun and games, authentic scenery (the film was shot in Uganda), subtlety, psychology, a heart-pounding scene at Entebbe (after the hijacking, but before the Israeli rescue), nudity, sex, violence, harrowing questions about ""what would you do,"" and all - ""Last King"" is a wonderful compendium of facts and greater truths. Also, a hell of a good movie."
"EUyeshima","8","104","118","2 February 2007"," Whitaker's Towering Portrayal of the Mesmerizing Ugandan Dictator Lifts This Historical Fiction
","Forest Whitaker's ferociously charismatic turn as Idi Amin so dominates this intense historical fiction that it is honestly difficult to pay attention to anything else in this 2006 political thriller. Even though he is definitively the emotional locus, he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance, Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man's lack of hesitancy to take action, Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician, a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator's political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.<br/><br/>Scottish director Kevin MacDonald brings his extensive documentary film-making skills to the fore here, as he creates a most realistic-feeling atmosphere in capturing the oppressive Uganda of the 1970's. Helping considerably with this image are the vibrant color contrasts in Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and the propulsive action induced by Justine Wright's sharp editing. Screenwriters Peter Morgan (who also wrote ""The Queen"") and Jeremy Brock have developed a sharply delineated character study of Amin, who evolves from a magnetic leader giving hope to his people to a scarifying tyrant conducting murders on an imaginable scale (at least until the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur). It is impossible to over-praise Whitaker's towering performance here. He conveys the dictator's playfulness as well as his unmitigated rage moving from simmering to full boil with a power that is at once bravura and subtle. His relationship with the fictionalized Garrigan turns out to be the plot's essential pivot point, although the contrast between the two can be almost too extreme at times.<br/><br/>While McAvoy admirably captures the boyish naivet√© of Garrigan, the character is drawn out in rather broad strokes that make his self-delusion all the more contrived as the story progresses. To intensify the political upheaval portrayed, the plot takes a melodramatic turn into an adulterous affair and even folds in the infamous 1976 Entebbe hijacking incident to illustrate Garrigan's increasingly precarious situation. It's all exciting and even downright brutalizing toward the end, but it also starts to feel a bit too Hollywood in execution. Kerry Washington shows genuine versatility as Amin's cloistered third wife Kay, while Simon McBurney oozes cynical suspicion with ease as a British operative. A convincingly Brit-accented Gillian Anderson makes her few scenes count as a weary clinic worker who proves to have better instincts than Garrigan. But see the movie for Whitaker's magnificent work. He is that good."
"justgazin","9","299","353","24 September 2006"," Basically this is excellent historical fiction about the torturous Idi Amin
","There have been so few pictures this year that are standouts. This movie is one of them. Much of what you will see is true, and did occur in Uganda's history. Amin's doctor, played by James Macavoy, is the main fiction in the movie, but one would think they are watching a historical event. Macavoy's character is so real. The doctor grows from a free thinking, adventure loving, womanizer, to a scared, concerned, and enlightened person. The viewer watches through Macavoys eyes as he witnesses the horrors of Amin's (Forest Whitaker's) presidency and regime.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker, IS Amin in this feature. Whitaker is not the silent sometimes brooding character you remember in other films he has been in. His accent,his face, and his emotions seem to no longer be Whitaker's but Amin's. This movie will scare the viewer because of its realism, and how it builds up to a tension that is hard to endure. The visuals are not for the squeamish. Go ahead and hide your eyes during the ""tough"" scenes. It is still worth seeing this movie for the fast paced story, realistic drama, fascinating tale, and for the unbelievable acting. By the end of the movie the audience is exhausted, but satisfied that they saw a worthy flick."
"jimpyke","9","196","229","24 October 2006"," Forrest Whitaker alone is worth the price of admission
","How can an actor terrify you without saying a word, without even hardly moving his face or body? I'm not sure how he does it, but Mr. Whitaker does it over and over again in this movie. And then he turns around the next minute and becomes giant hug-able teddy bear superhero. Forget all the others, this is the best horror film of the year. This movie, and his performance in particular, grab hold of you and never let go. Whitaker should win an Oscar for best actor, I've never seen a better performance in my life. Also notable is the Nicholas Garrigan character who is written and acted very skilfully to draw the (non-African) spectator into the world of Uganda and Amin. The way his character willingly ""falls into"" Amin's web of charisma somehow goes a long way toward mitigating the racist potential of a story about a very troubled (African black) man. The way the interplay of the two lead character's cultural backgrounds plays out on screen moves the story beyond just their personalities and into the realm of incisive socio-political analysis and critique. This movie is quite incredible, really."
"ferguson-6","8","200","235","1 November 2006"," You're My Closest Adviser
","Greetings again from the darkness. A true tour de force by Forest Whitaker ... the best performance of the year so far! Somehow Mr. Whitaker captures the madness and charm of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Amin was one of the first political rock stars. He used the media to his advantage as his regime slaughtered hundreds of thousands of his countrymen.<br/><br/>Also impressive is James McAvoy (""Chronicles of Narnia"") who plays the dramatized Nicholas Garrigan, a young doctor who sets out on an adventure to make a difference in a small country and ends up counseling one of the most powerful madmen in history. Scottish documentarian Kevin Macdonald directs the film with only a few lapses in directness, which serve this biopic very well. Watching Amin and the young doctor immerse themselves in the shower of power is both frightening and sickening. Macdonald captures this spirit very well thanks mostly to his willingness to let his two leads do their thing.<br/><br/>As Amin laughs and tells Garrigan that ""You are my closest adviser"", I couldn't help but compare to Kathy Bates telling James Caan (in ""Misery"") that ""I'm your number one fan"". The evil and insanity is simply chilling. Whitaker is just amazing as he flips the switch from media darling to cold blooded, ruthless murderer ... and then back again. Just a terrific performance and well worth the price of admission - maybe a couple of times! Good for a laugh is the most unique version of Janis Joplin's ""Me and Bobby McGee"" that you have ever heard ... guaranteed! See this one for a bit of history and the site of a real monster, but also for one of the best film performances ever."
"evanston_dad","9","177","219","21 October 2006"," A Hugely Exciting African-Set Thriller
","With ""The Last King of Scotland,"" Kevin MacDonald has created a bracing, exciting and totally satisfying thriller.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker gives a titanic performance as Idi Amin, Ugandan dictator who rose to power in the 1970s. James McAvoy plays Nicholas Garrigan, a Scottish physician who travels to Uganda for the adventure and wins Amin's affections, becoming his personal doctor. Garrigan enters into a moral crisis as he begins to realize the kind of man Amin is, and begins to fear for his own life as events spiral more and more out of his control.<br/><br/>Whitaker seizes the chance to play this larger than life character and runs with it -- I've never seen Whitaker give so convincing and transforming a performance. However, as good as he is, McAvoy impressed me more. His performance as Garrigan is not as showy, but it's much more textured and subtle, and his character has the bigger arc from start to finish. Gillian Anderson also does terrific work in a small role as a fellow doctor, who understands things about Amin and the African culture that Garrigan does not.<br/><br/>Unlike other recent thrillers set in African nations (""The Constant Gardener,"" ""Hotel Rwanda""), ""The Last King of Scotland"" is not greatly concerned with the geo-political implications of Amin's reign. The atrocities he committed against Ugandans are given only the barest of mentions, and the film sticks almost exclusively to Garrigan and the danger he himself faces. Some may think the film is irresponsible for this reason -- that the plight of one man pales in comparison to the plight of thousands, and I can see where a criticism like that is justified. But the movie packs a powerful wallop regardless, and complaints like this seem like quibbles when up against such an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"WriterDave","7","112","137","15 October 2006"," Forest Whitaker-Scary as Hell
","""The Last King of Scotland"" is a slickly made powder keg of a film about Idi Amin's (Forest Whitaker) horrific dictatorship over Uganda in the 1970's as seen through the eyes of his fictionalized Scottish doctor (James McAvoy). Whitaker is mesmerizing from the word ""go"" and brilliantly displays how captivating a character Amin was: charming, theatrical, paranoid, and mad as hell.<br/><br/>Director Kevin MacDonald only alludes to the horrors (300,000 massacred) while delivering a music-video style account of the free-wheeling decadence of Amin's regime while he still played in favor to his people. Much of the film runs like the early parts of P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" or any gangster saga from Scrorsese: hyper-edited, smoothly shot scenes depicting humor, violence, sex, nudity, and overly-indulged individuals new to money and power. It would've been more compelling had tighter focus been paid to Amin instead of the highly unlikable doctor character, who for the most part comes across as a flighty, over-educated twit with foggy ideas on good deeds and uncontrollable hormones that lead him to hounding after every marginally attractive married woman he comes across, including a barely recognizable Gillian Anderson donning a British accent, and Kerry Washington as Amin's third wife (duh, doc!). <br/><br/>About two-thirds of the way through, MacDonald lets Whitaker loose, and his rampage is awe-inspiring. It culminates in a pulse-pounding white-knuckle twenty minutes that muddle a historical event concerning Israeli hostages with the shockingly brutal finale of the young Scott's stay in Uganda. Again, it would've been more emotionally involving had the doctor been more deserving of our sympathy. Still, Whitaker is fuming and unforgettable. He totally embodies the spirit of the oft-discussed and debated mad dictator, so much so that when the closing credits roll and we see stock footage of the real Amin, you'd swear these were images of Idi Amin playing Forest Whitaker."
"poojucu","10","89","111","11 April 2007"," Astonishing film, that is carried by a great story and performances
","The last king of Scotland is scorcher of a film that follows the story of the horrid dictatorship that took over Uganda in the 1970s. The movie is seen completely through the eyes of young Nicolas Garrigan( James Mcavoy)a young Scottish doctor who decides he is tired of Scotland and ready to venture into another country to make a difference.<br/><br/>Soon after he begins his work in the town he begins a friendship with Idi Amin(Forest Whitaker)a powerful African leader who offers Garrigan a job as his personal doctor. Their developing relationship is wonderful to behold on screen, and for me was the main strength and the key point that made this movie go above and beyond.<br/><br/>Spoiler ahead: <br/><br/>Being a ill informed young adult I know close to nothing about African history, so therefore I had no idea what kind of leader Idi Amin was until the crashing scene when Garrigan figures out that he is actually a murderous dictator, who is destroying the African economy. This misfortune of mine made this particular moment in the film simply magic, and I found myself just trying to get my head around how such a loving and joyful character can actually be so violent.<br/><br/>End of Spoiler: <br/><br/>This is where I realized what a fantastic performance Forest Whitaker had actually given. He had fooled me into thinking he was someone else, he had made me think that he was actually a genuine democrat only concerned about the Ugandan people. His change in character is so superb at times too that I found myself thinking that is simply unfair. James Mcavoy although overshadowed by Forest Whitakers brilliant performance deserves credit too. His portrayal of the young Scottish doctor who is both naive and brave is fantastic, and it is great to watch the young Scotsman grow with every movie hes in.<br/><br/>Overall this is a simply astonishing film, telling an important story with some great performances. No criticism even worth mentioning for this movie that kept me on the edge of my seat til the very end."
"Chris Knipp","8","63","80","30 September 2006"," Toxic temptations
","In this film Kevin Macdonald, a Scot, directs James McAvoy, a Scot, as Nicholas Garrigan, a brash, spirited, and foolish young doctor just out of medical school in the early 1970's who overnight becomes a close associate of Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), the new dictator of Uganda. Amin had served in the British army and developed an admiration for the Scots. He gave himself the title ""His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, King of Scotland, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular."" He liked to dress his soldiers in kilts and have them sing Scottish songs.<br/><br/>Before this Macdonald made Touching the Void and other documentaries, including One Day in September, about the Munich Israeli Olympic team massacre. This film, which is not a documentary and departs freely from fact at least at certain key points, is based on the 1997 novel by Giles Foden, which concerns the doctor. But Macdonald's writers, including Jeremy Brock, who penned Mrs. Brown, and Peter Morgan, who scripted Frears' The Queen, have jazzed up the more bland original character and made him younger and bolder. Garrigan has picked Uganda at random. He is attractive and dashing: he's already flirting with the pretty blonde wife of the head of the rural medical clinic he's come to work in, when he's grabbed, with her, to ""save"" the paranoid Amin. The newly ascended President for Life has hurt his hand in an accident involving a farmer's cow. Garrigan impresses Amin by not just calmly fixing his sprained hand but also grabbing his presidential pistol and putting the cow out of its misery.<br/><br/>When Amin learns Nicholas is a Scot, he takes off his military shirt complete with medals and trades it on the spot for a ""Scotland"" T-shirt Nicolas is wearing -- for his son, Campbell. Amin has another son named Macgregor.<br/><br/>Almost immediately thereafter Amin persuades the young doctor to leave the clinic and become his personal physician in Kampala, the capital (where the movie was shot), sets him up with a Mercedes and a posh apartment in the presidential compound, and makes him a most trusted consultant, allowing him to decide on the design for a major building. Observing this exceptional access, a cynical British diplomat (Simon McBurney) approaches Nicholas and cautions him to ""keep in touch,"" an offer the young man initially rebuffs.<br/><br/>Garrigan's seduced, as are we, initially, by Amin's charisma and charm, and only gradually does he become skeptical and eventually horrified as he realizes he's the intimate of a ferocious dictator who, estimates say, killed off 300,000 of his citizens, as well as expelling all the Asians from the country. What's interesting is how the daring young man as we see him can hardly help being thus seduced; how the two men seduce each other. But Nicholas is in a terribly weak position when things go wrong. Whitaker and McAvoy play off each other nicely as they act out this process.<br/><br/>Several dramatic events involving Garrigan in the two-hour film's latter segment strain credulity, including the way the young doctor's escape is intertwined with the Entebbe plane hijacking incident, and the kinds of trouble he gets into on the way to that escape.<br/><br/>What makes this film, whose plot line can scarcely compete with that of the more multi-leveled and thought-provoking The Constant Gardener, and which has a grainy newsreel look that's undistinguished, is Forest Whitaker's astonishing performance as Idi Amin Dada. Whitaker usually plays soft spoken, sensitive types. This time he nails a range from fearful to seductive to terrifying, connecting them with a seamlessly explosive energy. One would say Whitaker is this picture, except that it's unmistakably also young McAvoy's. Essential to the film is the way McAvoy, who's had mostly more minor and more purely physical roles before (he was the fawn in Narnia) plays off Whitaker beautifully and woos us too with his convincing enthusiasm and dash. This is a very watchable but also disturbing movie which one wishes might have maintained greater verisimilitude. When documentarians embroider the truth, sometimes they go off way too far. But this is not unusual: a great performance in a less-than-great movie. We have to take what we can get, and in The Last King of Scotland we get a very wild ride."
"Philby-3","8","11","12","18 February 2007"," At the court of King Kong
","Giles Foden, who wrote the novel in which this film is based, spent his formative years in Malawi, the president of which at the time was another sinister African dictator, Dr Hastings Banda (who, oddly enough was once a GP in Glasgow). In the book, however, he looks at a far more colourful figure, Field Marshall Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC etc, president for life of Uganda, from the point of view of a young Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, who is plucked from a remote mission hospital to be Amin's personal physician and adviser.<br/><br/>There is some factual basis for this in that Amin did at one time have a Scottish doctor and he also had as a close adviser a former British army officer, Bob Astle (who Foden interviewed living in retirement in Wimbledon) but essentially we are looking at fiction, based on the premise what would it have been like to have been a young, impressionable, rather feckless and sexually adventurous doctor working for Idi Amin.<br/><br/>At first, being at Amin's court is a pretty heady experience for young Nicholas (who as played by the elfin James McAvoy with early 70s long hair seems to be a teenager). Beguiled by Amin's hearty manner and flattered by his attention it's almost too late before Nicholas sees the dark side. He is reckless enough to sleep with one of Amin's wives, not realizing that Amins's spooks are onto him. The climax, during the Entebbe hostage crisis, is bloody and gripping.<br/><br/>Forrest Whittaker had a difficult job playing Amin; because Amin was given so much air time by the media when he was in power he is a very familiar figure. Yet Forrest gives us the core of the man, bluff, hearty, childlike (and hence really scary, as Nicholas observes), given to rages, absolutely ruthless, and as time rolls on, increasingly paranoid. It's a wonderful performance and has to be a strong Oscar contender, though perhaps not the certainty Phillip S Hoffman was for ""Capote"" last year. James McAvoy's extremely youthful looks don't help, but he manages to develop his character so that the feckless youth does seem to develop into a more thoughtful and responsible person. There were also several good minor performances such as Kay Washington as Kay Amin, Abby Mukiibi as Masanga, Amin's taciturn security chief, and especially Simon McBurney as Stone the British spook, who sees Nicholas as a ready-made British agent. Unfortunately Nicholas is Scottish and does not take kindly to Stone's superior English manner.<br/><br/>Kevin Campbell the director is best known for his documentaries, particularly his mountaineering saga ""Touching the Void"". Here he filmed in Uganda, which helps authenticity, but he has also produced an interesting story. Amin is superficially charming, but thrust into power he becomes a monster. Nicholas can't initially resist the charm, but comes to realize he's dead if he doesn't. Nicholas is not the nicest of young men, but in the end we don't want to see him as a victim.<br/><br/>Uganda has had a rocky time since Amin was deposed (the old monster died in exile in Saudi Arabia in 2003), but despite AIDS and a nasty insurgency now has some semblance of law and order and modest economic growth. Hopefully it will never have another Amin, who came close to destroying his country, despite his entertaining manner."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","17","20","12 May 2007"," Kudos To Everyone Here, Not Just Whitaker
","I agree Forest Whitaker was very good as the famous mentally-disturbed leader of Uganda, Idi Amin, back in the 1970s but, despite the Oscar he received as ""Best Actor,"" I thought the best thing about this film was the involving story. Once the co-star of the film, James McAvoy as ""Dr.Nicholas Garrigan,"" became Amin's personal doctor this film, like a good book, became really difficult to put down. It was a very interesting story which got better and better as it went along. It's also one you won't forget about in a few days. This one stays with you!<br/><br/>Make no mistake: Whitaker was excellent as Amin but McAvoy was just as good as the young Scot who found himself involved in something a lot bigger and more sinister than ever thought possible. Frankly, I couldn't stand his character or anything about him. For a doctor, the guy was scumbag, hitting on any attractive married woman he could find, willing to do abortions, was easily led by opulence and flattery, and was smug and stupid throughout much of the film with this silly smart-ass grin on his face. He almost had me rooting for Amin, which means he must have done a pretty good job of acting. too. When the ""good doctor"" was stupid enough to have sex with one of Amin's wives, I thought it would be the end for him. It almost was, as we saw in the movie, and I didn't feel too sorry for him. If this was a true story, the man is unbelievably lucky to escape with his private parts, much less his life. He got off scot-free, you could say (pun intended.)<br/><br/>""Dr. Garrigan"" was a typical good-hearted-but-naive young Liberal who wouldn't listen to the older guys, looking at them in a condescending, snotty way. The best part of the film was when he needed those old politicos to help him leave the country and they gave him back a little of his own sarcastic medicine.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Amin was a brutal man and much more so than he is portrayed in this film. It's a disgrace he was able to live comfortably in exile until 2003. Whitaker's portrayal of the sociopath doesn't touch the surface of the Amin's evilness, but Amin, truth be told, was also a charmer. It's amazing how a little charm can make even a mass murderer look like a nice guy. <br/><br/>In addition to the fine acting performances of Whitaker and McAvoy, I thought the camera-work in here was well above-average, too. This is a nicely-filmed movie, and credit should go to cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. I don't hear much praise going his way but I really liked the visuals in here.<br/><br/>Are there holes in this story? Yes, especially in the last 10 minutes, but - that's the movies, for you. I'm not sure if I'd watch this a number of times, but I am glad I saw it and it's two hours of involving entertainment. It's definitely recommended."
"3xHCCH","9","61","84","24 February 2007"," Great Acting! and Gillian Anderson!
","I like movies based on real people in history. Because of the Oscar buzz surrounding Forest Whitaker now, I knew this movie is about Idi Amin. This is of course a familiar name in my childhood (asked in General Information contests), but I don't really know much about him, except that he was a dictator.<br/><br/>This film has a documentary feel to it. It is really very realistic, even if upon reading background info that the Dr. Garrigan character is fictional. Even though granted that the Idi Amin regime was compressed into a coherent Hollywood storyline, it does not feel contrived. The final sequence of events at the Entebbe Airport was very suspenseful indeed.<br/><br/>Idi Amin was not really the lead character in this movie. It is actually Dr. Nicholas Garrigan. Being a physician, I could not help but be able to identify with his situation and dilemmas. Would you accept to be the personal physician of a country's president upon his personal request? It seems to be an offer and career opportunity you could not refuse.<br/><br/>There is sex and violence in this movie. I could not agree though with Dr. Garrigan's rashness regarding his love affairs, particularly his morals of hooking up with wives of his supposed friends. But considering that this movie is set in the 1970s, that was a totally different world pre-HIV. The violence, what can I say? After watching one violent film after the other, you get sort of anesthetized already. That said, the scene with hooks at the airport was still something else! The acting is very good. Forest Whitaker has channeled the Idi Amin persona very effectively. I could feel the scary and suffocating craziness whenever he is on screen. There's something about this performance being based on a real character though. I think it would be harder to essay a totally fictional character since you have to create this new character from scratch. And I feel James McAvoy (who was actually Mr. Tumnus in ""Narnia""!) did so very well as Dr. Garrigan. You dislike him, yet you can empathize the stickiness of his situation.<br/><br/>Before I end this review, I have to mention that I was very happy to see the luminous Ms. Gillian Anderson again. I totally did not know she was in this film and it was a welcome surprise. She handled her few scenes as the wife of a volunteer doctor very well indeed. I hope she gets meatier movie roles in the future."
"MarshallStax","8","23","29","24 September 2006"," Powerful, epic, personal and affecting
","It may seem like an unusual name for a movie about the events surrounding the 1970's rise to power of Ugandan military dictator Idi Amin, but to see is to understand.<br/><br/>The plot, based on a novel that in turn was inspired by actual events, follows a freshly-minted young Scottish doctor named Nicholas Garrigan. In just a few quick scenes, director Kevin Macdonald clearly shows us that this drinking, pot smoking free spirit is terrified by his suffocating future of being a family practitioner in business with his overbearing old man. <br/><br/>Not nearly as sure of what he wants as what he doesn't want, Nick spins a globe and winds up in Uganda just as a coup has taken place. The director again lets us know quickly what this young Scot's about; Nick has a hard time keeping his hands off the ladies, as he jumps right into the sack with a flirtatious fellow bus traveler before he arrives at the village where he is to assist the resident doctor.<br/><br/>A nicely slimmed down and understated Gillian Anderson, sporting a decent British accent, portrays the doctor's beautiful and under-appreciated wife. She picks up Nick from the bus stop and ferries him to his post through an eerie night road scape full of ghostly Ugandans wandering in the truck's headlights.<br/><br/>Nick enjoys some aspects of his new gig: playing soccer with the kids, vaccinating little ones against the diseases that ravage the land, and yes, eyeing the doctor's wife.<br/><br/>His seduction attempt nearly succeeds; Anderson smartly portrays a good woman whose need to be bad is only slightly weaker than her desire to be noble. Still in turmoil, they attend a rally nearby where Idi Amin is addressing his new constituents. Charismatic and rabble-rousing, Forest Whitaker convincingly portrays the first of many facets of Amin that will be revealed throughout the course of this film.<br/><br/>It would be a disservice to the viewer who has not yet seen this thick, affecting film to describe the plot in any more detail, but suffice it to say that a fortuitous encounter with the dictator soon leads to Nick away from his boredom, good works and untasted forbidden fruit of the countryside village to the inner circle of the charming, terrifying and possibly insane bully Amin.<br/><br/>The aimlessness of Nick's life begins to come clear for him as he gets deeper and deeper into the moral quagmire of being chief adviser and personal physician to the man who was ultimately responsible for the 300,000 deaths of those who opposed him within Uganda.<br/><br/>The ending, after a build-up nearly as hallucinatory and overwhelming as ""Apocalypse Now"", comes down during the Entebbe hijacking and hostage crisis of 1976.<br/><br/>Nick's journey is told without a misstep and an epic, significant air hangs over this grainy, you-are-there photography. And the impact of casual violence and its affect on the value of human life has rarely been portrayed with more vividness than in this film. Nothing done by a Freddy or a Jason can match the atrocities visited upon those on the wrong side of Amin's politics, paranoia or temper.<br/><br/>For the squeamish, this is a harrowing ride.<br/><br/>The soundtrack throbs with African popular music of the time (think Fela Kuti, with less improv and more melody) and the sense of time and place is utterly convincing.<br/><br/>As well made as this film is, it is still the cake that the icing of the actors decorates. Forest Whitaker gives what is without a doubt the performance of his career in Idi Amin. And Oscar nomination, if not an outright win, is a certainty if there is any justice in this world. And James McAvoy's callow Nicholas grows in heft and morality before our eyes. At first, he enjoys the opulence and easy living of being among Amin's inner circle, but, as he continues to dally with the wrong ladies and mock the covert operatives from England that approach him, an actual person with inner strength appears. And though his answer to all this is to run away, the impediments placed in his path teach him a thing or two about being a human being. MacAvoy deserves plentiful praise for bringing this pleasure-seeking young doctor to life, then shepherding him through these changes believably before our eyes."

"antoniofalcao","3","45","64","22 January 2007"," Why mess with history?
","This film can be judged from three viewpoints: as history, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br/><br/>It fails as history, it mentions in passing the coup that threw out Obote, the expulsion of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack as background, but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. <br/><br/>As a profile of Amin it may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this was a better film, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - which proves the Oscar voters don't watch the films they vote on.) It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the point of view of the doctor. It tells instead the fictitious story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story told is the one incident that Amin was probably innocent of. <br/><br/>As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to hold it together. The beginning is taut - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel, but sets up the story. The character of the doctor is well-defined, but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result.<br/><br/>Why the doctor decides to stay in Kampala is badly explained - seduced by power? Why he befriends no-one is strange. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable, but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of Amin close at hand. The Man called Horse bit at the end is risible. <br/><br/>Finally in 1971, Uganda drove on the left, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the Equator tusks?! <br/><br/>In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting, but the last hour will bore you to confusion. If you know Uganda or have read the book - don't see the film - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy - he wasn't."
"jotix100","10","14","18","16 October 2006"," The dictator
","Most satraps that gain power begin with the pledge they are for the people. Unfortunately, history proves them wrong, again and again. In their hunger for power these misguided individuals confuse what the job entails and concentrate only in taking care of themselves as they develop huge egos that will betray them and ultimately cause their own downfall.<br/><br/>Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator, was a man that came into power with the potential for doing good. Instead he went to surround himself with inept people as he eliminated the ones that dared to oppose him. In this fictionalized account of the life of this strong man, there are hints that he never had any good intentions for his country or his fellow Ugandans.<br/><br/>The story links a naive young Scot, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, who one day decides as a lark to point to an earth globe with his finger and decide that wherever it lands, that's where he will go to practice medicine. The first time he tries, the finger lands in Canada, but he rejects it, probably as not challenging enough. The second try his finger touches Uganda, a place that will prove fateful for this young doctor.<br/><br/>Little prepares Dr. Garrigan for what he encounters once in Uganda. The remote spot where he is to practice is run by the Merits, a doctor and his wife. The town where Garrigan begins working receives the visit of the new head of the country, Idi Amin. Garrigan is obviously impressed with the energy displayed by the general, who assures the poor people he is there to protect them because he is for the people. An accident brings back the doctor to the presidential car. Amin, who realizes Garrigan is from England, is happily surprised when the young man tells him he hails from Scotland.<br/><br/>That fateful meeting impresses both men. Amin, the powerful man, decides he wants the young doctor to be his own personal physician. The young doctor is dazzled by the Mercedes that is given to him and how he suddenly is made to be the head of the hospital in Kampala. In the meantime, Garrigan meets, and falls for one of Amin's wives, the gorgeous Kay whose only son is epileptic.<br/><br/>Things begin to change and Garrigan realizes he has really misjudged the situation. He starts to see how his protector can really turn against him when he wants out. The bloodbath throughout the country will devastate the land. Dr. Garrigan is angered by what Amin has done to Kay; the cruelty the dictator knows no boundaries.<br/><br/>Kevin McDonald the director of ""The Last King of Scotland"" paints a realistic picture of the madness during the Idi Amin's regime. The dictator is presented as he probably was. As any man in his position, Amin manipulates the political situation to his own advantage. He uses people to carry on his agenda and when they question anything, he eliminates them.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker gives an epic performance in the title role. Mr. Whitaker, a serious actor who should be seen more often, smolders the screen every time we see him; he is bigger than life! We don't recall a performer that was able to convey what goes on in the mind of a satrap the way this actor captures every nuance of his character. Mr. Whitaker is magnificent in the way he brings this hideous man alive and runs away with the film.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, who plays Dr. Garrigan, is also an excellent player. He matches Mr. Whitaker perfectly. This young actor, from whose eyes the story is seen, makes a tremendous contribution to the success of the picture. Kerry Washington has a small, but pivoting role, as Kay Amin, one of the dictator's wives. Gillian Anderson appears as Sarah Merrit and Simon McBurney gives an interesting performance as Nigel Stone.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is one of the best biopics about a dictator. The combination of Douglas McGrath and Forest Whitaker translates into one of the best films about the horrors of unlimited power in the hands of a mad man."
"Rvrgm","2","33","48","10 August 2007"," Another example of Hollywood's unwillingness to give us actual truth! Instead, they sensationalize for effect!
","Before I begin, I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including Whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination. It is highly entertaining, and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION, it is a very good movie. For that, I give it the two stars.<br/><br/>However, rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere, I want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth. I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is a complete invention of fiction. Rather, it presents this character into a real historical setting, and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real, and what they are seeing is the truth. I have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is, in a word, reprehensible.<br/><br/>There can be no doubt that Africa, along with most Third World Countries is rife with human misery and suffering. Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film. But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money. The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself, or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.<br/><br/>But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much. At the end of the day, they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself, and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming, ""SEE, WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BAD!"" The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie. Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin, Idi's second wife, whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity. In the film, we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse (arms for legs and vice-versa). This is the director making sure you understand that Amin is, as the Gungans say, Bom-bad! But watching the documentary, we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth, which the sitting Minister of Health at the time himself tells us is not true.<br/><br/>So . . . what . . . they just MAKE UP these things? Why? Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence, that's why! They don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves. Look, that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we don't need this Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that! And this is just the tip of the iceberg. What is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character Garrigan is himself fictional. There was no young Scottish doctor taken under Amin's wing. As such, Garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb Westerners understand the African world. The producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about Africa unless there is a white face in it. (Ironically, even the titular character is portrayed by an American black actor!) The problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of Amin and his regime, but instead an exploitative thriller about a white Westerner coming to Africa for all the wrong reasons, making several horrible mistakes, and then ""redeeming"" himself, even at the cost of three other innocent lives. Honestly, I have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of Mrs. Amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional Scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment! I really wish Hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money. I first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of John Nash, which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that America just can't get enough of. The sad truth is that Hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years, and viewers, who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves, buy these fake portraits hook, line, and sinker.<br/><br/>Look, I'm certainly not suggesting Amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't. My point is, with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man, why must Hollywood then go to such fictional lengths? Why must Hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films? Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!? Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves? I urge all who continue to watch Hollywood's purportedly ""true"" movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself, and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!"
"simonparker1990","10","31","46","17 January 2007"," A superbly directed and acted movie!
","2007 has already started off with a magnificent bang in my eyes. Last year, 2006, started with more the after shock of three decent fantasy epics, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and King Kong. 2006 actually didn't really begin with any redeeming movies at all to be honest, however 2007 has got off to a spectacular start. I've so far only seen three movies. Now out of the three The Last King of Scotland is easily the best, however by saying this I realise how much of an understatement this is for this movie. You see The Last King of Scotland is not only better than these other two movies combined, hell its not only better than most of my favourite movies of last year, this movie is easily one of the best movies in absolutely ages! In fact I can only put this on the same level as Pan's Labyrinth as this movie is absolutely spectacular! In fact there has never been an early front runner in my eyes for Film of the Year, however this movie looks very likely to prove everyone different! The Last King of Scotland is an interesting movie following the story of a young man called Nicholas as he is propelled into the bizarre world of Ugandan leader Idi Amin. The movie might not be entirely based on reality, there's some stuff that never occurred, however this movie does still manage to be an absolutely thrilling event and featuring one of the most powerful performances in ages. Forrest Whittaker is absolutely breathtaking as the Ugandan leader, Idi Amin. In fact if he does not win the Best Actor Oscar he will have been brutally robbed. The movies also works because it is a nice blend of thriller, comedy (on the rare occasion) and also complete and utter tragedy. Its a movie bound to please the critics and come Awards time will hopefully reap the benefits. A well crafted and a beautifully acted movie that I now absolutely adore.<br/><br/>The story of The Last King of Scotland follows medical graduate Nicholas Garrigan. He has just qualified med-school and is already sick and tired of his home country, Scotland. So on a spur of the moment thought he decides to go off to the first country his finger lands on when he spins the globe, he doesn't like the sound of Canda so when he tries again he lands on a place called Uganda. On arrival in Uganda the recent government has been overthrown by Idi Amin and his soldier. He fights for the people and so everyone is rejoicing that Amin has risen to power and that he promises new opportunities for Uganda. Nicholas first works in a small medical facility helping the sick of Uganda, however after a chance meeting with Idi Amin he is soon whisked off to Amin's place and is turned into Amin's personal physician. Amin likes Nicholas' straightforwardness, and Nicholas likes Amin's personality. However, after a brief period of time as the pair get along fine the cracks in their relationship start to show. Amin is hiding things up and he seems desperate to keep hold of power. Nicholas meanwhile is being asked to become more than a personal physician and becomes more of an adviser than anything else. As time wears on and Nicholas is no longer allowed to leave Uganda he realises that he has to get home by any means possible. <br/><br/>So then the performances of this movie, obviously they are the movies greatest success. First off is of Forrest Whittaker as Idi Amin. Perhaps what I found most intriguing about the character is the fact that for a large majority of the movie I couldn't help but actually like him. He's such a friendly, larger than life character that you can't help but smile at some of the things that he says. And yet when the man changed he really did change, scenes where he screams at Nicholas become quickly terrifying as you really do not know whether Amin will hug him or pull out a gun and shoot him in the head. Forrest Whittaker delivers and absolutely amazing performance, his seductive, fun loving side in the beginning is pulled off superbly. The nice bit of humour is very welcoming, yet its his amazingly powerful scenes later when he goes towards the nasty side that really do stick in the mind. He should win an Oscar for this role, and this is really one of the best performances in years. The other main cast member, and one that really does deserve almost as much praise is James McAvoy. He's better known as Mr Tumnus from Narnia, however here he really does become much of a serious actor. Here he is absolutely brilliant, of course he is always overshadowed by Amin, but in the scenes where he is on his own he really does shine through. At least enough to hopefully earn him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting actor.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is absolutely wonderful, it gets the highest rating with the slightest of ease, but its the impact of this movie that really will last on longest. Its a movie that needs to gets the Oscars it so richly deserves and I really do want to see this again as quickly as possible. An early front runner for Best Movie of 2007!"
"bob the moo","Null","7","8","17 February 2007"," The use of Garrigan is a strength and weakness but it is a good film thanks mainly to a terrific turn from Whitaker
","The newly qualified Dr Nicholas Garrigan travels to Uganda to take up a post with a village mission. He arrives just after a coup puts Idi Amin in power of the country. During a visit by Amim to the village, Garrigan captures the President's attention by tending to a small injury to his hand and showing himself decisive and strong-willed. It is not long before the young Garrigan finds himself appointed as physician to the President and ensconced as one of his ""closest advisors"". However the initial charm shown by Amin gives way to a darker violent streak as Garrigan finds the superficial stability of the country and its leader is nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>Famous now for the performance that will deservedly win an Oscar in a few weeks time, this film actually doesn't have Amin as the ""main"" character despite him being the draw and the title character. Instead we actually spend a lot of time with Garrigan, his experiences and his problems. Of course I understand why this was the way because Garrigan is out narrative device ¬ñ a composite character who acts as our way into the inner circle of Amin and allows the audience to experience him as outsiders as well. This works well in doing this but it does also introduce problems, or at least one problem. This is the fact that, as the story goes on, we find ourselves more and more focused on Garrigan (who doesn't actually exist) rather than Amin or Uganda (who did and does exist respectively). I found this a bit irritating as it got worse because I had come to the film for Amin ¬ñ as, I suspect, many will have done.<br/><br/>Even with this though the film still works well and makes for an engaging piece. Macdonald's direction is good and his moving camera does give it the air of a documentary while still very much being a drama. Of course the thing that makes the film work is the central performance from Whitaker. The character of Amin allows him to play to his strengths and he delivers a convincingly unhinged turn, constantly menacing but also managing to have a child-like sense of fun at times and a terrifying tendency towards ruthlessness and violence. I have said before, he was brilliant in The Shield (making the whole season his own) and he is equally brilliant here. Alongside this it is no surprise that McAvoy is a bit weak by comparison. His character is not so convincing (a side effect of being a composite) and some of the narrative turns ask a lot of him ¬ñ he is still good and it is not his fault that he is in Whitaker's shadow. Washington has a small role but was pretty good in it even if her presence made me wonder why they felt they had to cast an American actress, likewise Anderson but I assume that they helped get funding so fair enough. McBurney is a bit too slimy and sinister and I wasn't sure what the film was trying to say. Audiences may also recognise Oyelowo from his recent high-profile roles in HBO's Five Days and BBC's controversial Shoot The Messenger.<br/><br/>Overall then not a perfect film but a pretty good one. The use of Garrigan is good at getting us into the story but it is a weakness that we stick with him as the focus. The performances are roundly good but of course it is another terrific turn from Whitaker that makes every scene he is in worth seeing."
"fertilecelluloid","9","13","17","19 September 2006"," A much scarier horror film than most horror films
","Kevin Macdonald, whose background is in documentary, has made a stunning piece of work with ""The Last King of Scotland"". A junior doctor (James McAvoy) from Scotland goes to Uganda just after Idi Amin's (Forest Whitaker) coup and becomes personally embroiled in the dictator's insanity. The title refers to Amin's documented love of Scotland and personal joke that he did such a good job getting rid of the British in Uganda that Scotland considered him for the same job.<br/><br/>Stylistically similar to Oliver Stone's ""Salvador"", this is a lightning-paced political thriller buoyed by Oscar-worthy performances from McAvoy and Whitaker. Script, by Jeremy Brock, Peter Morgan and Joe Penhall, from a novel by Giles Foden, is a model of economy and manages to juggle a huge number of inflammatory elements without ever dropping the ball. Quite explicit in parts and shot with extraordinary clarity and invention by Anthony Dod Mantle, there have been so few great films like this recently that this stands out as a beacon of hope.<br/><br/>As a film that deals with genocide, torture, murky politics and insanity, it pulls no punches and rockets towards an explosive climax featuring the Entebbe hostage drama. It ends exactly where it should and leaves us breathless (having ripped us from a nightmare more real than fiction).<br/><br/>It's a much scarier horror film than most horror films."
"mockturtle","4","36","55","1 March 2007"," Absurd.
","Forest Whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck. ""Historical fiction"" does not justify changing history. The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy. To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.<br/><br/>Let me declare, I do not like James McAvoy. I'm not sure what it is about him, but I thought his Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was creepy and pervy. I think that Kerry Washington would never look twice at him so I can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like Amin would risk and lose her life for him. I don't believe him as a Doctor, and I just don't see the appeal. His character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense, and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just...there's that word again...absurd. Think about it, you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.<br/><br/>Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits. Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance, and highlighted, with his incomprehensible pre-Oscar speeches, just how much he was acting. It's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist."

","Why is it whenever Hollywood decide to green-light a movie on historical events, we end up with dumbed-down history instead? The Last King Of Scotland is suppose to be about Idi Amin, dictator of Uganda in to '70s, charismatic yet sick in the head. But instead of the film being from Amin's point-of-view, we get the P.O.V. of some fictional Scot that just graduated from medical school that decides to get out of Scotland, go to Uganda, serve as a doctor to the poor, hit on his boss's wife who rebuffs him, fixes Amin's hand after a roadside accident, accepts a job as Amin's personal doctor, acts as a spy for Amin, ails Amin's often minor ailments, boinks one of Amin's wives, gets the crap beaten out of him for doing so, almost dies, has numerous chances to escape but doesn't until his ex-boss's wife leaves Uganda, Amin's wife is murdered, the Brits that originally offered to help the doc turn their back on him, and doc is beaten and bloodied and sneaking away along with some hostages also leaving Uganda, all because daddy thinks his son's degree is not as good as his. Boo freakin' hoo.<br/><br/>So why was this film so critically acclaimed? Forest Whitaker is good in the role, but you expected more from him. Amin seemed more like a supporting character in his own film. The doctor character that hogged the film was a complete waste. Who really cares about the Scottish doc? He has no redeeming qualities, you felt no sympathy for him, you actually felt bad that he didn't die. What exactly was the purpose for this character to exist? I'd like to think that we moviegoers are capable of following a movie based on historical events without some pointless fictional character to act as a pseudo tour guide.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this film two stars is because of Whitaker. Was he good? Yes. Was it Oscar-worthy? I really don't know. Maybe if Amin had more screen-time, possibly. Other than that, this film is not worth your time or money."

"JamesHitchcock","8","6","7","24 January 2007"," The Doctor and the Dictator
","The twentieth century deserves to be remembered by future historians as the Age of the Dictator, but despite the prominent role that dictators played in history, they have not been much in evidence in the cinema. There have been many films about dictatorships, but these have not always focused on the men who led those regimes. Pol Pot, for example, does not appear in ""The Killing Fields"", nor Galtieri in ""La Historia Oficial"". Even Adolf Hitler is only a partial exception. Although he has been memorably impersonated on screen by a number of actors from Charlie Chaplin to Bruno Ganz, films about him are less common than one might expect, given that he is the man who has replaced the Devil as our supreme symbol of evil. George C Scott gave a fine impersonation of Mussolini, but this was in a TV series, not a film.<br/><br/>The cinema's lack of interest in dictators is not entirely due to morality- Hollywood has always been happy to make films about fictional villains, or even real-life ones who did not also hold the position of Head of State. A large part of the reason is that many dictators exemplified what Hannah Arendt called ""the banality of evil"". The cold, reserved General Franco bore little resemblance to the idea of the dictator as carpet-chewing maniac. Augusto Pinochet was once described as having the appearance and demeanour of a suburban bank manager. Leonid Brezhnev ruled the world's largest country for nearly two decades ( a period later described as ""The Age of Stagnation"") but was rarely seen, either in Russia or the West, as anything more than a soulless bureaucrat.<br/><br/>There was, however, nothing banal about Idi Amin, who fascinated the Western media during his time in power. He was noted for his eccentricities, such as awarding himself the Victoria Cross, and the media treated him as a licensed buffoon, which obscured the horrendous nature of his crimes. It has been estimated that during his time in power some 300,000 people were murdered (one hundred times the death toll attributed to his contemporary Pinochet, who at the time was far more widely reviled).<br/><br/>The protagonist of this film (I advisedly do not use the word hero) is Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor who, inspired more by desire for adventure than by idealism, takes a position working in a medical mission in Uganda. (The alternative, working as a family GP in his father's practice, does not appeal to him). A chance meeting with Amin leads to his being offered the post of personal physician to the President. The main reason for Amin's choice seems to be that Garrigan is a Scot; the dictator had a fascination for all things Scottish, including wearing a kilt and (despite his Muslim religion) drinking whisky. The title of the film derives from the fact that he even offered his services as King Idi I of Scotland, an offer which the Scots, for some reason, declined.<br/><br/>A strange friendship grows up between the doctor and the dictator, and Garrigan soon finds that he is being treated as Amin's confidant and adviser as well as physician. As portrayed by James McAvoy, Garrigan is in many ways an unattractive character- flattered at being singled out for attention by a powerful man, blinded by a credulous belief in Amin's good intentions and eager for the luxurious lifestyle which his position bestows upon him, he turns a blind eye to the mounting evidence of the atrocities being committed by the regime. His only excuse is that he is young and naive. He is also a casual philanderer; in the course of the film he seduces a Ugandan girl he meets on a bus, Sarah, the neglected wife of the mission director and (incredibly) Kay, one of Amin's three wives. To cuckold one's employer is never a good career move; to do it to a man as unpredictable as Amin is a positively bad one, as Nicholas soon finds out.<br/><br/>Apart from McAvoy, there are also good performances from Gillian Anderson as Sarah, David Oyewolo as the brave and principled Ugandan doctor Junju (the one man in the film who can be described as a hero) and from Simon McBurney as the callous and hypocritical British diplomat Nigel Stone. (There is an implication- which may be justified- that the British Government initially supported Amin's seizure of power, seeing him as more pro-Western than his predecessor Milton Obote, and then turned against him, not because he was a tyrant but because he proved to be less malleable than they had hoped).<br/><br/>The film, however, is dominated by Forest Whitaker, who well deserves his Oscar nomination. I have been an admirer of his ever since ""The Crying Game"" (a film I did not otherwise much care for), and here he is superb as Amin. Whitaker avoids the mistake of trying to make his character purely evil. Amin initially enjoyed considerable support from Ugandans sickened by the corrupt regime of Obote, the sort of Socialist who believed in the redistribution of wealth, chiefly into his own bank account. The dictator we see in the early scenes is a great bear of a man, shrewd, jovial and with a good deal of personal charm and a well-developed, if occasionally childish, sense of humour. Whitaker's interpretation leaves open the possibility that Amin was a sincere man corrupted by the temptations of power and that Garrigan's naive trust was not altogether misplaced. It is precisely because Whitaker's Amin initially appears so affable that the raging, half-mad figure we see at the end of the film is so frightening. An unpredictable man can be more dangerous than one who is predictably wicked. The film works well as a study of the politics of dictatorship and of the relationship between two very different men. 8/10"

","Sometimes it's just the element of surprise that makes a movie; when you expect a movie to go one way and it goes the other. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is like that, (although what surprises may be in store in a movie about Idi Amin may be hard to imagine). But here it's not so much something in the narrative as the way director Kevin Macdonald springs things on us; the slow, soft build-up to the killer punch. Macdonald's background is in documentaries and it shows; the film has a rough edge, a real-life look about it. That feel of being just one step away from a newsreel gives the film a kick.<br/><br/>It's said to be inspired by real events which, of course, doesn't make it true. Rather it's another of Peter Morgan's 'factions', (part fact, part fiction and co-written with Jeremy Brock), dealing with real people in situations which may, or more likely may not, have happened; in this case how a young Scottish doctor, (James McAvoy, first-rate), became principal physician to the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. But the character of the doctor is fictitious, (he is said to be an amalgam of a number of people), so we can only imagine how much we can take at face value. But that's hardly relevant and doesn't detract from the film's overall power. Enough is known of Amin's regime of terror and Forest Whitaker makes him a potent psychopath, charming and seductive one minute, a lethal killer the next. It's a terrific piece of acting. Whitaker not only seduces the young doctor but the audience as well. We know what Amin was capable of but initially we can hardly believe it. That's what I meant when I said the film had an element of surprise. Macdonald confounds our expectations, he throws you off the scent; you are never sure which way the film will turn. Is this really going to be a comedy of manners? (And there is much humour to be had from those early scenes).<br/><br/>And if it all feels familiar it's because we have seen this story before. This is the Faust legend with McAvoy's doctor in the Faust role and Whitaker's Amin as his Mephistopoles. McAvoy sells his soul for a fast car and the promise of easy and available sex, not to mention the delusion that it is he who controls Amin and not the other way round. By the time he realizes Amin is the Devil it is too late. But while the story is as old as the hills Macdonald, Whitaker and Morgan give it a thrilling new slant. This is invigorating, scary stuff; thought-provoking entertainment of the first order."

I'm sure many millions of Ugandans at the time of Idi Amin's sick rule would empathise with that emotion.<br/><br/>The really insightful thing about Kevin MacDonald's film is how effortlessly he dramatises the seductive charms that so many dictators like Amin impose on their subjects. You almost like Whittaker's Amin. He's cheeky, funny, charming - even vulnerable at times.<br/><br/>Power is a very powerful thing. It's when people get close to that power that their behaviour can be seriously affected. And the depiction of that is what lies at the heart of this great movie.<br/><br/>You just about get as far as thinking that Amin is a more likable character than Dr Garrigan (James McEvoy)- his willingly co-opted personal physician. Just about.<br/><br/>Garrigan is never complicit in any of Amin's crimes, but the movie brilliantly demonstrates how Amin (played beautifully and Oscar winningly by Forrest Whitaker) corrupts him. His arrogates towards the British Ambassador, his disposal of the rural missionaries he came to Uganda to help in the first place and his sleeping around (even with one of Amin's wives) are all utterly selfish. And fuelled by his close personal relationship with Amin.<br/><br/>The film winds itself up into a crescendo of violence to the that's like sitting in the launchpad in Space Mountain (believe me that's a scary moment).<br/><br/>Thought provoking and authentic, thanks partly to shooting on location and partly due to Whittaker's performance this is a very good movie indeed."

"jfventures2","9","6","7","17 October 2006"," Bravo to the makers of ""The Last King of Scotland""!
","I have been aware of the rise and fall of Idi Amin since 1971 when I was fortunate to be in Uganda for the first time, and his photograph was plastered in every business, social and government facility, and no doubt home throughout the country. At that time he was viewed as a ""darling"" by the western nations that helped bring him to power.<br/><br/>As a novelist, I commend Giles Foden, Kevin MacDonald, Forest Whitaker, and the entire cast and crew of ""The Last King of Scotland"" for presenting such a vivid, albeit sketchy account of the horror of the Amin regime. I also applaud them for the restraint with which they handled the crimes committed by Amin and his henchmen. Those of us who are aware of the true events know that whatever violence shown or mentioned in the film was minimal compared to what actually occurred -- and would be difficult to witness on the part of the average viewer.<br/><br/>I appreciate the need at this time to present Amin's story from predominately a white POV, and to fictionalize it in order to make it more palatable to readers/viewers. I basically did the same in my novel ""The Lure of the Lion"", although I included among my characters a black Ugandan family and Asians who are affected by the Amin regime. In addition, I present the fact that Amin was in league with the Russians and Arab factions, and was complicit in the hijacking of the Air France airbus. There are other facts regarding Amin's history, and medical condition, which are understandably not mentioned in the film, with its time and context restraints.<br/><br/>What I especially admire about ""TLKofS"" is of course Forest's performance -- yes, definitely Oscar worthy! and the fact that it was actually filmed in Uganda -- a beautiful, fantastic country with courageous, kind-hearted people who deserve a peaceful existence free from the Amins and Obotes (the president prior to and following Amin, whose regime massacred almost twice as many Ugandans as did Amin's, only not as flamboyantly)."

Since so many media outlets were blocked from entering the country at that time, only the people there could have told a more genuine story. I did like the location and the scene selections.

","It's Scotland 1970 and Nicholas is going semi- skinny-dipping in some chilly loch. With him are a bunch of other new medical graduates, Afterwards he goes home for a sherry with overly-traditional parents. Or at least until the opening credits. By then, desperate to get away, he spins the globe and ends up amid hot dusty colours and rich vibrant sounds in Uganda. (You will have to work very hard to divine any deep meaning to the title.) Nicholas is a blue-eyed boy with lots of testosterone. His hormones compete for attention with newly acquired medical skills. Out in the backwoods, he assists a lone doctor and tries to seduce the doctor's wife (played by Gillian Anderson). Yet a string of coincidences soon has Nicholas playing Personal Doctor to the new President, Idi Amin.<br/><br/>As Amin's regime gets under way, young Nick realises he's sold his soul as it were. He's surrounded by a life of luxury - one that is paid for with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans. Worse still, 'Daddy' Amin is in no mood to let him leave.<br/><br/>Expect strong performances, plenty of brutality, a tense ending, and a very nasty little scene in the airport duty free. Plus some convincingly mutilated bodies in the mortuary. A thriller 'inspired by true events', The Last King of Scotland is a competent if slightly raggedy film that sticks in the mind.<br/><br/>On the down side, it's shot on grainy 16mm blown up to 35mm. The overall visual effect often lacks definition to the point of fuzziness. The bigger shortfall is that it has nothing to say beyond its own basic story. It could be called yet another white-conscience-in-Africa film. We hear how the Brits helped Amin to power: it would have been an ideal opportunity to suggest that countries cannot easily be 'helped' towards a better form of government until they are ready (or have earned it themselves, and so learning to appreciate and maintain it).<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland lacks the moral complexity it should have. It misses, for instance, any chance to say anything of importance about the wider world or its subject matter. Unlike Constant Gardener, Tsotsi or Shooting Dogs, it concentrates mostly on weak or corrupt characters, which can make for unsatisfying viewing. Even the moral dilemmas of the young doctor are undeveloped. We watch an action-driven plot where, unless we are totally ignorant of history, we know exactly what sort of atrocities Amin will eventually get up to. The horror has been diluted; the intellectual component edited out. For a thriller, it often leaves much to be desired and we might wonder if Director Kevin Macdonald is still too wedded to the documentary genre that his been his mainstay until now.<br/><br/>Idi Amin had a fixation for Scotland. He gave himself many grandiose titles including 'Last King of Scotland'. One painter depicted him as Scotland's Bonnie Prince Charlie, the 'Young Pretender', who led the fight against the English army but was defeated at Culloden. Such a comparison is odious and appears to hold no deeper meaning than was capable of the disordered mind of Amin (who saw a comparison between two countries 'seeking to free themselves from the yoke of English imperialism'). It does however flesh out the almost mythical figure of Idi Amin. The character of Nicholas would hold our interest more if we did not have to credit a university mind with such stupidity in personal relations. While The Last King of Scotland has many good features, including performances that raise it well above the average, it surely deserved more. Early on in the film, the warmth and spirit of rural Uganda shines through. That humanity might have made a more moving bookend than the cold fact of numbers killed that appears before the closing credits."

The film completely failed to tell you what was going on in the country, it was touched on, but never really engaged. And this was the same of the whole movie it was great on touching on things but failed to go any deeper.<br/><br/>The film suffers from several flaws. One it is a fiction involving real characters, which always is a dubious mix. Second the main character, the Scot, is unlikeable and unsympathetic. Third the end of the movie has no tension, and is hastily put together. Further the chronology of the movie is completely indecipherable. It apparently takes place over 5 years, but it could be several weeks for all we know.<br/><br/>The movie truly fails in that it fails to tell the story of Amin, or the people he killed. At the end of the movie i didn't feel any emotion at all. In fact if you didn't know any better he just seemed like a generous bloke with a bit of a temper. The film makers needed to do better than this if they are to tackle such a huge subject, and instead of a study on mass murder we are given fluff about a graduate position gone sour."

","For those who were fooled by the theatrical trailer, the poster of the movie and the interviews of the crew, ""The last king of Scotland"" might be a huge disappointment : this is not a realistic African political movie, nor even a film about the General Idi Amin Dada, but only another mediocre thriller, who claims to have documentary virtues. Indeed, the movie begins like many others with this lying words : ""This movie is based on real events"" and the all movie is filmed like a documentary, with a realistic photography and omnipresent zooms. But style isn't all it takes to describe reality. By focusing its point of view on a fictional character who lives fictional adventures, the movie looses all its credibility.<br/><br/>Instead of presenting directly the Ugandan dictator, the movie is focused on a white doctor, who's eyes are the point of view on the story and of the events the movie tells. This artifice allows the common spectator to enter the movie, through a character with whom he can identify himself. This could have been alright if the character was credible enough to carry the real events the movie wants to talk about and if he was introduced as a necessary artifice to have a better understanding of the situation. But it's not how Kevin MacDonald shows us his character : this fictional character is presented like a real one, whereas his story uses all sort of ridiculous ""lieux communs"", incoherences, and narrative facilities that contradict the realistic claims of the movie, fictionalize characters that have really existed, and make unreal situations that actually occurred (!). The love story between the doctor Nicholas Garrigan and Amin's wife is for instance a major flaw from a realistic point of view, even if it serves some narrative purposes, and the end of the movie is rather silly and really hard to believe when you consider the situation. But the worst consequence of this hypocritical use of fiction is that the movie fails to show the real violence and horror of the country, which always stays unseen and hidden. <br/><br/>At the end, you doubt everything you saw in this very conventional movie, witch fails to archive its documentary and pedagogical goals. I'd rather watch an intelligent adventure movie like ""Blood Diamond"", than this kind of lying political thriller, that makes me constantly doubt of the truth of what it shows."
"blackburnj-1","9","5","6","24 August 2007"," Thrilling and at times terrifying
","In short, ""The Last King of Scotland"" is a magnificent film. Well written, acted, especially by Whitaker and McAvoy, and impressively directed the film is thrilling and at times terrifying. This film is worth seeing as an excellent piece of modern cinema though it does have some scenes that could only be described as upsetting. However it is an extremely intelligent piece and deserves far more examination than some simple sound bites.<br/><br/>The horror of genocide certainly does not necessarily make great film. You have to be a pretty sick person to sit down, enjoy and engage with a film that is solely about genocide. Recently, man's inhumanity to man has been pushed into film in cruel and nasty motion pictures such as ""Hostel"" and ""Captivity"". This is not entertainment. It is not art. It is vicious and unpleasant and recent events have displayed that violence and murder is not something that should be treated lightly. At the pinnacle of these acts is genocide and the great films that have been made about genocide have never relied solely on their horror to generate entertainment. ""Schindler's List"" focuses on one man's fight to save hundreds of people from cruelty. ""The Pianist"" tells the story of one man's struggle for survival and the good man who saves him. ""The Last King of Scotland"" could very easily have been horrid and vile, particularly as it took its subject matter from one of the most horrendous events since the holocaust. However, like it's predecessors it chooses to focus on character and provides an intense examination of the psychology of Idi Amin. However, the stroke of genius in this film is to have another character, the fictional Dr Nicholas Garrigan, as the audience's eyes.<br/><br/>Garrigan is not a moral man. He is an adulterer and self-centred. He is also extremely young and na√Øve. The audience's foreknowledge of Amin's crimes are suspended by Garrigan's enthusiasm and by the ""Gen-e-ral""'s charm and charisma. It is a slow realisation of how deep Garrigan is, how blind and how terrifying and unstable Amin is. A question hangs over the film ¬ñ was Amin always a maniac or was it something that was caused by the paranoia of leadership and the ongoing struggle for power? It is explored quire thoroughly and terrifyingly. Garrigan is a character that the audience cares about and so we feel his terror and his Faustian dilemma is one that we can understand. He is dismissed by other characters as evil ¬ñ Amin's ""white monkey"" ¬ñ but he is a force for good in Amin's camp ultimately thus making it possible for us to sympathise. He has unknowingly done a deal with the devil and is paying the price.<br/><br/>A lot of the credit must go to the writers and actors in this film. Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan do an excellent job at creating tension and interesting, intricate characters. It has hard to think of a recent thriller that has been this psychological and this effective. Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy compound the groundwork laid by the script with superb performances. Whitaker is brilliant and paints the picture of the terrifying, psychotic Amin excellently. However, McAvoy is a real revelation. In many ways he has a harder part and is charming enough and talented enough to pull it off. The film hangs together as a piece extremely well and the work of Kevin MacDonald as director cannot be ignored. He is an exciting director and should be watched extremely closely."
"PhilipGHarris","8","5","6","13 January 2007"," Whittaker's finest moment?
","There is not much to add to the excellent range of comments already posted to this movie but having just returned from the cinema I feel I should have my say.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film make me wish to read the book, I have usually read this before or have no wish for one media to destroy my images of another, luckily films tend to drift so far from the text you can't usually see the lines.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Whittaker, being drawn to his style most closely when seeing Ghost Dog and until now I think that was his finest moment. However his dedication to this role, having caught some of the stoic nature and humour of this dictator whilst also showing his fierce, paranoid side makes me consider that he has now outdone himself. Some of the inflexions and facial expressions he uses are so close to the man himself.<br/><br/>However a film is not merely the performance of one actor and the whole cast move well under the directors gaze with the two leads playing off each other finely on the screen. Of particular note to myself was Gillian Anderson's role at the start of the film where in a few brief scenes you got a strong feel for a well rounded character.<br/><br/>The films style is simple as befits its subject matter, MacDonald using the same locations again and again to show the slow decent into the mire the country is taking under Amin's rule.<br/><br/>Music was also effectively used throughout."

Of course it doesn't take long for the young doctor to realize his error in judgment by which time it is already too late to make a hasty departure. blah blah blah...Uganda deserves much better.<br/><br/>Again, depth and nuance is lacking in a tremendously well shot film with a brilliant and energetic performance by Whitaker who somehow doesn't seem to age at all. Clearly the movie did not care too much for historical events which is by no means a bad thing per se. Alas, as a thriller it just doesn't build up any tension, and its twists, if there were any to speak of, could be seen coming miles away. Much of the subplot could just as well been excluded and it wouldn't have made any difference.<br/><br/>As a drama it doesn't deliver either since they chose to randomly follow the main characters and not really focus in on either one of them. Our protagonist wasn't at all sympathetic and his actions were mostly irrational and incomprehensable.

"stephenw-8","3","21","38","1 October 2006"," Confused and disappointing movie
","This was a movie that had some potential but ends up all over the place. The main reason is that the Scottish doctor is a weak, pathetic, utterly unlikeable character whose complete lack of any real principles results in chaos all around him, including death for several people such as his girlfriend. When he almost got killed at the end, frankly I was disappointed that he got away.<br/><br/>Also from a historical point of view I learned very little. The actual doctor/dictator relationship was apparently fictional, and since that's the only thing that was really developed in the movie, it is misleading to call it based on actual events.<br/><br/>In particular, the idea that the doctor escapes with the Entebbe hostages was totally stupid and unbelievable. It was a huge mistake to tell half of the Entebbe story, leave the other half for a line of text before the credits, and grossly distort all the facts in order to fit the doctor into it. Ridiculous. A much better movie could have been made just about Entebbe, and just by fitting to the facts (I know a few were in the 70s, but it's time for a new one.)<br/><br/>Also, they didn't mention that Idi Amin was a Muslim. Sure, it's not directly relevant to anything, but you'd think that in a two hour movie the religion of the central character would come up at least once. I bet they left it out to be PC.<br/><br/>The only good things about the movie were the acting of the Idi Amin character, which was consistently excellent, and the settings, film-work and so on. It looked good. Pity it was such a bad movie."

","Just in time for awards season, we are presented with a once-in-a-career maniacal, multi-layered and commanding performance. These characters are usually based off notorious historical figures in literature, music, science (Think Virginia Woolf, John Nash, Ray Charles, June Carter, add Idi Amin). These great performances all enhance their spirit and impact on our world history.<br/><br/>The Last King Of Scotland is an adventurous and rugged thriller filmed and set amongst the rough deserts and buzzing cities of 1970s Uganda, Africa. Like the ""other"" African thriller this year - Blood Diamond - it flaunts invigorating panoramas across the festive and lively people of Africa with some spirited on-set locations.<br/><br/>The story follows Nicholas Garrigan, a newly graduated doctor searching for adventure and a chance to prove his newfound skills to save lives. He ends up in Uganda (by pure luck) and quickly befriends Idi Amin - dictator and ruthless leader. Their strike up a unique friendship and soon, Garrigan is living the high life with Amin - special treatment, boisterous parties, palace luxuries and limitless power. Things get out of hand when Amin's murderous and dogmatic policies result in failure healthcare, a stumbling economy, deaths, and assassination attempts. Garrigan's beliefs and ethics are put to the test when the Amin puts the pressure on him to stay on. Against his will, Garrigan soon ends up running a country he knows nothing about and signing his name in Amin's murderous tactics.<br/><br/>The buzz says that Whitaker will probably win the Oscar for this one (although I prefer another leading South-African performance this year). He is impressive throughout, stealing the show in every scene he's in. He commands a frightening bipolar authority that is so charismatic and likable even in his moments of rage. His gaiety and jestery is so contagious that it easy to see why Garrigan forms such a close so quickly with him. And with Garrigan we also begin to see the precarious edge of his power to nasty consequences. But I must say that I really felt Whitaker should have contributed more him to the story. His appearances in the film were a little too disjointed and I compare the performance to that of Kidman's 2002 Woolf. All show but not enough maturity. I really wanted to know so much more about him - his rise and demise, and more character development. As a result, he came off as only series of ferocious vignettes rather than than the whole portrait he could have been.<br/><br/>McAvoy carries the film for the entire duration well, serving as our eyes and our ears pulling us into his world. He does a commendable job and is enjoying a worthy bookmark in his career. It is chilling to see his world cracking apart and through his eyes it only too easily becomes our world too.<br/><br/>I really would have liked to see more of Gillian Anderson's character. She is undergoing an interesting revival, doing the circuits. She is developed well at the start with some absorbing mysteries and a curious history, but we almost never see her again in the film and the opportunity is totally wasted.<br/><br/>The story is suspenseful throughout but I felt that the editing could have been much sharper, plus/minus a few extraneous characters. In addition, the film's subject matter just didn't interest me as much as it should have - perhaps because it wasn't my cup of tea (no fault to the film intended). The scenery is vibrant for the most part showing of the exotic tones of Amin's palace and the harshness of the African nation.<br/><br/>This is Macdonald's first fiction feature after the excellent dramatised documentaries, One Day In Sept & Touching The Void. With this film, Macdonald proves his niche in dealing with shocking historical events bending the line between gut-wrenching suspense and hard non-fiction. In ""Last King"", he remains so true and honourable to the material all the way. A thrilling and suspenseful thriller, with some historical eye openers thrown in for kicks. However not quite my style - only an average drama for me but worth looking into for the memorable performance."

He is invited to become his personal physician in Kampala and along the years he sees how despotic his friend is.<br/><br/>I personally hate the manipulation Hollywood loves to do with historic events. I have recently seen a good movie, ""Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus"", with a ""pseudo-biography"" of a real woman. The same happens with ""The Last King of Scotland"" where the lead and most important character, the despicable Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is absolutely fictional. His character leaves his family, tries to have an affair with the wife of his friend, becomes friend of a bloody dictator and has an affair with his wife. Therefore, the situations are not the dramatization of true events, but only a soap-opera with the image that the writer wants to give to Idi Amin Dada in the story. My question is why he needs to use the name of Idi Amin Dada, and not an also fictional dictator of an African country inspired in the real President of Uganda? The way this movie is conducted I believe many people will believe that it was based on the biographies of Idi Amin and ""Nicholas Garrigan"", like a documentary, and not in an imaginary crap of a British writer. However, the story is engaging, well directed and acted, and Forest Whitaker has a magnificent performance and resembles to the real Idi Amin. Gillian Anderson is almost impossible to be recognized, thinner and with a long blond hair. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O √öltimo Rei da Esc√≥cia"" (""The Last King of Scotland"")"

In the aftermath of the operation codename ¬®Operation Thunderbolt¬® , Idi Amin issued orders to retaliate and slaughter several hundred Kenyans present in Uganda . <br/><br/>A compelling drama all the more gripping because being true , though the character well played by James McAvoy , is fictitious. It is packed with thrills , intense drama , tension , violence , strong loving scenes and nice interpretations . At one point, Idi Amin can be seen wearing a Glengarry , which is a Scottish military cap, with a red and white tartan ribbon around it . Amin had been in the King's African Rifles, and suffered considerable racism from British officers . The only one to show him any respect was a Scotsman, and thenceforth had an inreciprocated affection for Scotland, even considering himself a pretender to the Scottish throne . All star cast gives fine acting as well as support cast . Masterfully played by Forest Tucker as the lunatic leader who is driving Uganda into bloody ruin , he achieved a well deserved Academy Award . James McAvoy as likable doctor who must make some crucial decisions is splendid , he gives a vigorous as well as sympathetic performance . Secondary actors give excellent acting such as Kerry Washington , David Oyelowo , Simon McBurney and special mention for Gillian Anderson . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Kevin Macdonald .<br/><br/>Adding more details about Idi Amin life , these are the followings : Amin joined the British colonial regiment, the King's African Rifles, in 1946, serving in Kenya and Uganda . Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Ugandan Army and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971, deposing Milton Obote. He later promoted himself to field marshal while he was the head of state. The number of people killed as a result of his regime is estimated by international observers and human rights groups to range from 100,000 to 500,000 . During his years in power, Amin shifted in allegiance from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable Israeli support to being backed by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, the Soviet Union, and East Germany. In 1975, Amin became the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), a Pan-Africanist group designed to promote solidarity of the African states. During the 1977‚Äì1979 period, Uganda was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.In 1977, when Britain broke diplomatic relations with Uganda , Amin declared he had defeated the British and added ""CBE"", for ""Conqueror of the British Empire"", to his title . On 27 June, an Air France plane with 248 passengers was hijacked, by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the German Revolutionary Cells, and flown to Entebbe, the main airport of Uganda. Operation Entebbe was a mission carried out by commandos of the Israel Defense Forces at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on 4 July 1976 . Dissent within Uganda and Amin's attempt to annex the Kagera province of Tanzania in 1978, led to the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War and the demise of his eight-year regime, leading Amin to flee into exile to Libya and Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003 .<br/><br/>Other films about this polemic figure are the followings : ¬®The John Akii Bua Story: An African Tragedy¬® (2008) played by John Bosco , ¬®Amin : rise and fall¬® (1982) by Shrad Patel with Joseph Olita , ""Operation Thunderbolt"" (1977) played by Mark Heath , ¬®Raid on Entebbe¬® (1976) this version Yaphet Kotto plays Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.

"dgwfriend","8","4","5","6 March 2007"," Forest Whitaker is rightly crowned.
","Don't we all just love a dictator? Of course, if choice be had, most of us would rather not spend much of our time living under one, but it's rare to find someone who isn't just the slightest bit interested in what makes them tick; what sets them apart from the hum-drum, somewhat more benevolent, leaders of this world. <br/><br/>As dictators go, it's pretty much universally agreed that Uganda's General Idi Amin was up there with the very worst of them. As many as four-hundred-thousand people were killed during his time in power in the 1970s. Thousands of others were forced into exile abroad. But despite Amin's less than laudable human rights record, his life remains a fascinating subject. He was a truly eccentric, if terrifyingly brutal, figure and it's difficult to avoid being intrigued by his character.<br/><br/>Kevin MacDonald's adaptation of Giles Foden's novel takes us deep into Amin's world, although if you're expecting a completely faithful re-telling of the book, it's not. There is much that is different between the book and the film. It's a much more condensed treatment of the years of Amin's rule and there are a number of characters who don't make it from the pages onto the screen. But none of that's to the film's detriment. The core of the story remains the turbulent relationship between Amin and a fictional Scottish physician hired after treating the General when he's involved in a car prang involving an ill-placed cow. Together, the book and film compliment each other to provide a compelling exploration of humanity and, perhaps more significantly, inhumanity.<br/><br/>The doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, is played by the rightly ascendant James MacAvoy who's fast developing into one of Britain's finest young products. His character's an arrogant, self- serving type who finds himself plummeting deeper and deeper into the fetid pit of Idi Amin's rule. His very existence is a metaphor for the corrupting force that is absolute power and its amoral trappings. There is also strong support from the likes of Gillian Anderson and David Oyelowo and special mention must be made of Simon McBurney who plays Foreign Office official Nigel Stone with creepy, menacing brilliance.<br/><br/>While most of the supporting performances are strong, this film is almost nothing without its lead. Forest Whitaker has long deserved promotion from critically-acclaimed character actor to universally-acclaimed star of screen. With this role, that's exactly what he's achieved. He plays Idi Amin with such brilliance that it's nigh on impossible not to be both moved and frightened by his presence. He manages to bring to the screen what was so dangerously captivating about the man. It's all too easy to demonise a figure such as Amin. It's easier for us to understand how dictators succeed if we think of them as monsters. But Forest Whitaker's acting ability, coupled with intelligent writing, shows the very human side of him, and that makes him all the more terrifying. An Oscar was always likely to be his reward and couldn't be more deserved."
"tomimt","8","4","5","26 February 2007"," The escaping doctor and the paranoid president
","'The Last King of Scotland' is no way a perfect movie, but it is a great movie none the less. After a rather typical beginning for a movie, that is based on a rather generic beginning of a young white man going somewhere out of a whim, the movie really kicks in a high gear. The gear is, when Forest Whitaker is seen in his first big scene as Idi Amin, charismatic, yet paranoid dictator of Uganda.<br/><br/>So this young man, doctor Nicholas Garrigan (brilliantly portrayed by James McAvoy), is trying to escape his life as a future family doctor and thus by an act of faith ends up in a hospital in Uganda. There he has a crush on the local doctors wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson) and so he decides, when the opportunity calls, to enter in the position of Amin's personal doctor. Troubles soon enter his life in the form of Amin's beautiful wife Kay (Kerry Washington).<br/><br/>From what I first thought seemed to be a rather typical historic drama, I was surprised of the intensity of the movies latter half, or actually two thirds. The most generic display of Africa is really in the first half hour of the movie. Superior acting, good script and great direction makes tLKoS very enjoyable, and in some places very gruesome, experience. I have to give the nod towards Whitaker and say, that his Oscar win was truly deserved, as he was truly mesmerizing in his role.<br/><br/>My final score 8 out of 10"
"MichaelMargetis","Null","4","5","23 February 2007"," ""A man who shows fear... he is weak, and he is a slave. "" - Idi Amin
","""I may wear the uniform of a general, but in my heart, I am a simple man"" - Idi Amin<br/><br/>The above statement is delivered by Amin during the first ten minutes of the film. There the tall, chunky Whitaker personifying Amin walks onto a stage in front of a large group of poor Ugandans and delivers an almost heart-wrenching speech. He talks about how he loves his people and that he won't rest until all the poor are taken care of. This is utterly convincing and even knowing what a twisted person the real Amin was, I almost believed him. I believed him all the way up until he showed his real colors by threatening a poor cattle farmer after being in an accident. This is when Amin's true colors shine and we are aware of what lies behind his false appearance as a caring humanitarian -- a ruthless, psychotic and literally cannibalistic monster.<br/><br/>'The Last King of Scotland' doesn't center around Idi Amin, but young Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy, who you may remember as Mr. Tumnus is last year's smash hit 'The Chronicles of Narnia'.) Garrigan is fresh out of medical school and instead of putting up with his father's (who is also a doctor) subtle mental abuse, he decides to go do missionary Medical work at the first place his finger lands while spinning a model globe. After landing on Canada and shrugging, he goes again and lands on Uganda. An intelligent humanitarian but still a childish boy, Garrigan seduces a moderately attractive local he met on the bus, before he reaches his destination of the village where he will do his charity work. There he meets and falls for the caring wife of the resident doctor (played by X-Files' Gillian Andersen), before coming face to face with President Idi Amin, after a small car accident. Idi Amin is ready to kill Garrigan, before finding out he is Scottish, and then decides to make him his own personal doctor. Garrigan goes along with the whole idea hesitantly at first, but really starts to bond with Amin. After witnessing Amin commission the murders of a bunch of men who tried to kill him, Garrigan begins to have to rationalize Amin's brutality, but eventually realizes that Amin is just pure evil, and tries to escape from his clutches. The film shifts from being a drama to a thriller after the first hour and fifteen minutes or so, and even though it lags a bit in between, most of the time spent watching the film will have audience members enthralled and practically on the edge-of-their-seats.<br/><br/>'The Last King of Scotland' is a lot like 2004's 'Ray' (the Jamie Foxx biopic of Ray Charles), in that it's a great film built around what is perhaps one of the most riveting leading male performances in film history. The performance I'm talking about of course, is that of Forest Whitaker, who not only gives a performance, but an embodiment of one of the most notoriously cruel dictators to ever live -- Idi Amin. From the moment Whitaker walks onto screen, his stature and presence alone is enough to give you goosebumps. At this moment, the beauty and brilliance of his performance is only beginning. After that he becomes more and more intense, making every second he's on screen so frightening, it seems Amin is right there next to you breathing down your neck. This is Whitaker's most ambitious performance, delivered flawlessly, that I have not a doubt in my mind it will earn him his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Lead Actor. If he doesn't win, I'd be utterly surprised.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is very good, but pale in comparison. British newcomer James McAvoy gives a great performance here as the young, naive Scottish doctor. My father compared him to Keanu Reeves, but I shutter at the comparison seeing as unlike Reeves, McAvoy actually showed range and was believable in the part. Kerry Washington (who you may remember from 'Ray') is also quite compelling in a small supporting role as Amin's third wife. The rest of the cast have too small of parts to really critique, including Gillian Andersen who is on-screen for about a total of seven or eight minutes.<br/><br/>The screenplay is solid most of the time, but lags a little in the beginning and in the middle. When Whitaker isn't on-screen, the film seems less engaging. One of the biggest complaints I have about the screenplay, is like my complaint of 2004's 'Hotel Rwanda' which garnered similar themes, -- it's too conventional. The story, although never sappy, is too predictable and follows a lot of the ingredients of most Hollywood thrillers. Kevin MacDonald's directing is solid, but not magnificent. Perhaps this is because 'The Last King of Scotland' is the first feature film MacDonald has directed that isn't a documentary feature. I'm not saying that MacDonald, the Academy Award winning filmmaker of the 1999 documentary 'One Day in September', provides bad directing or even mediocre directing, I'm just saying there were some parts in the film where the directing could have been flowed more smoothly.<br/><br/>When it's all said and done, 'The Last King of Scotland' proves to be an intense, gritty and well-made drama/thriller built around an astonishingly powerful performance that is ten times more memorable than the film itself. I highly recommend catching this film while it's still playing at the Harkins Camelview where it opened today. It's worth seeing for Forest Whitaker's ferocious portrayal of Idi Amin alone. Grade: B+ (screened at Harkins Camelview 5, Scottsdale, AZ, 10/13/06)"
"nobbytatoes","7","4","5","30 January 2007"," strong film, out shined by Whitaker
","Kevin McDonald has been walking through documentaries for some time now. Historically significant events of One Day in September, biographies and the spellbinding re-enactment of mountain-climbing tragedy of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates in Touching the Void. The Last King of Scotland sees McDonald moving out of the documentary field, yet not stepping away from portraying a historical point of time. The Last King of Scotland, blending fact and fiction, circles around the appointment of Idi Amin as President of Uganda, and the beginning of his dictatorship.<br/><br/>After finishing his medical degree, Nicholas Garrigan wants a change of life, and escape from his father. Taking his new degree, Nicholas travels to Uganda, to help the sick while searching for adventure. Being taken to a car accident involving newly appointed leader Amin, Garrigan impresses Amin with his confidence, but mostly on his Scottish heritage. Taking a liking towards Garrigan, Amin appoints him as his personal physician. Garrigan is easily charmed by Amin, going up the ranks to Amin's consultant to right hand man, though Garrigan starts to question Amin's leadership when his real personality crawls out and becomes witness to many unsettling events.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland catches you off guard. Told throw Garrigan's eyes, our initial scenes take us through his travels, his work with the villages doctors, and the beginning of his friendship with Amin. Used as an easement of what's to come, all the civil unrest and killings under Amin's rule are all unseen, as Garrigan isn't witness to them; yet. The closer he get's to Amin and what was unseen now faced on, the darker Garrigan's journey becomes. His ideas of coming to Uganda to save the dying and look the savior shatter on his realisation of that simplicity, when clasped so tight to Amin, a man who almost has that sparkle in his eye, switches instantly to cold blooded murderer.<br/><br/>Kevin Macdonald shows his competence jumping from the documentary to feature film. Those initial scenes he takes you by the hand, as we start to spiral into this hellish world he taking us too. Trying to show us his craft as a film maker, he does push too hard than needed. Macdonald's directing is competent, but reaches didactic and awkward at times. This hits a point during Amin watching the film Deep Throat, trying to encapsulate his world of sleaze, along with his pool party where Garrigan makes his ultimate mistake. As the political side is only subtle laid in the background during the start, when Macdonald begins to play upon it, the darker themes move to the foreground, but fight with the paranoia edge of Garrigan's fight for survival and Amin's megalomania. Macdonald pushes one then the other, instead of wielding them in a double edged blade. While Macdonald's directing dips occasionally, there is outstanding cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle, and viscerally executed violence, with a gut wrenching climax between Amin and Garrigan.<br/><br/>While The Last King of Scotland isn't told through Amin, Forest Whitaker is a commanding force to behold. Like Amin he charms you and draws you in to his world. As the charm fades, the vulgarity and sheer distaste to him build to one powerhouse performance from Whitaker. James McAvoy exudes Garrigan's cockiness and naivety, to a man simply saving his life. Gillian Anderson seems sorely underused as Sarah Merrit, with a character that isn't completely fleshed out.<br/><br/>A few awkward moments here and there weigh The Last King of Scotland down, but when this gets going, there is no stopping it."
"grandenchilada","7","4","5","16 October 2006"," Evil Charmers
","I have always loved Forest Whittaker. He has a remarkable presence and he is a subtle, powerful actor. Now he plays Idi Amin in the movie The Last King of Scotland, also co-written by Peter Morgan, of The Queen. Sure enough, Forest Whittaker gives a subtle, powerful performance as the Ugandan maniac who killed 300,000 of his countrymen, who is a textbook case of dictator madness and who ended his life without paying for his crimes, sheltered first by Libya and then by Saudi Arabia. The movie disappointed me. I think some of the creative choices got in the way of the incredible story it tells. It seems that nowadays every movie about Africa has to be shot with a hand-held camera that feels as if it has Parkinson's, grainy textures, manic editing and everything looking either yellow or green (The Constant Gardener suffered from the same malady). I can understand these devices are meant to express turmoil and lack of stability and all that, but I wish the filmmakers had more faith in telling the story straight. The turmoil is there, no need to shake it up. The Last King of Scotland is the story of a young Scottish doctor, played by the wonderful James McAvoy, who ends up being Amin's personal physician and adviser. His Dr. Garrigan is a young kid who craves adventure, sort of a slightly amoral cad who loves seducing women and who is charmed by Amin, apparently a big charmer himself. Garrigan wears his conscience lightly and goes to Uganda, more to escape his fate as a country doctor in Scotland than because of humanitarian concerns. I hate to give the story away, so I won't tell you everything that happens, but suffice it to say that it's clear that Garrigan is given plenty of evidence of Amin's dark places from the start but he insists on ignoring it. He prefers to be seduced by the charms and luxuries of absolute power. It's rather hard to believe one could be so naive and so brazen at the same time. I mean, who has ever met a dictator and not known that something must be very wrong with him? What dictator on Earth doesn't send shivers down people's spines? You have to live in Jupiter, or perhaps the Scottish countryside, not to guess than an African army general who just came to power through a bloody coup is not quite Florence Nightingale. This film is the story of two charmers, one who may have begun with some sort of a conscience (though I find that hard to believe from Amin) and ends up in utter satanic madness, and one who starts out with none and painfully gets one, as he grapples with the fact that being loyal to a murderous despot is evil. This movie should be seen for several reasons: To appreciate fantastic acting all around. Whittaker and McAvoy are a wonderful pair of cads. Whittaker is mercurial, his moods change in a split second and it is a very contained performance. He makes the guy extremely likable, manipulative and very comfortable with his own power. Then there is the surprisingly touching Gillian Anderson as the frustrated wife of a saintly doctor and the fantastically creepy Simon McBurney as some sort of a horrible British spy. He rocks. There is a lot of interest in this story, and the movie builds up from a fun romp through a beautiful African country to a descent into hell. By the time Garrigan realizes he's aiding and abetting the devil, it is too late. There are many powerful moments in the movie but somehow it operates too much like a movie, with a relentless barrage of music, with certain movie conventions that amp up the excitement, but fail to work as a convincing recreation of what happened in reality."
"pik923","2","8","13","11 January 2008"," Completely totally disappointing. Whittaker is great, that's about it
","I am trying to figure out why this film received such rave reviews. To make up a story around a doctor who never existed, bring him together in relationships with real life characters as a way to describe Idi Amin and the history of Uganda makes no sense and in fact is a huge draw back to the intensity of any film. There is so much more that could have been done with this story as a film, it is really embarrassing to watch it. The story line itself doesn't hold together. There is no reason behind much of the action except to try to show how crazy Idi is, but why do that with a fictional character when a film like this is asking you to look at the horrible truths of Idi Amin? I did not understand the film, there is little character development. There is a lot of horrific moments of violence but it does not fit together. What a pity! The screenplay is not good; the cinematography in parts is boring and feels like the camera was slipping (ie the editing is worse than the cinematography) and the acting was poor and senseless. Whittaker was wonderful as Idi Amin but even his character development did not make it for me. And can anyone tell me if it's true about Amin's wife and a foreign doctor - white foreign doctor? Is any of that true? Beats me - I can't trust anything about this film."

Oh by the way, the guy is a psychopathic killer. What?!?!? How stupid is Garrigan supposed to be? As for plot snafus, I think the editing just stunk. For example, just after Garrigan gets it on with Kay, every runs around saying ""Amin wants everyone down by the lake ... Hurry up."" So, everyone runs to the lake & Amin is playing a tune, and ... nothing happens. Did I fall asleep? What was that? Did they edit out a scene and forget to edit out the one leading up to the one they edited out? That is not the only such instance, but why bother ... it is only a 4."

If so, why should such a movie that mainly repeats what is already known about Uganda (and reiterates old western stereotypes), have a positive impact on western audiences?<br/><br/>What the old stereotypes are? Just to pick one: the Scotsman gets laid with two African women, while the white missionary woman resists his looks and youth and charm (""I cannot do this""). Was she more afraid of her priest husband than Amin's wife Kay of her mass murdering spouse? Or is British female morality and virtue just superior to that of African women as the old stereotype would go? The answer is obvious."

","Caution Spoilers ahead!!!It is amazing to me that this film got such great reviews.It's nothing but a bad thriller.Although i do agree that Forest Whittaker's performance was excellent,it was not enough to save this shallow film. The sheer stupidity of the Dr.Garrigan character left me with a sour taste in my mouth. The fact that Dr.Garrigin could be so oblivious to what was going on around him is positively laughable and an insult to the intelligence of the audience.Throughout the film he keeps defending Amin even after he is presented with mountains of clues to what he is really all about. The fact that the writers and director expect the audience to believe that someone who is a medical doctor could be so stupid is ludicrous and quite frankly very insulting. I was particularly bothered by the party scene when Dr Garrigin has sex with Amin's mistress while he is in the next room partying.I actually found this scene comedic.The fact that they do this in the room right next to him in order to give the scene forced dramatic tension is a really pathetic clich√©.This is about the point of the movie where it veers off into cheesy chase-thriller territory.It's goes straight downhill from there.Anyone who enjoyed this movie really needs to read something factual about the tragedies in Uganda as this film is an insult to those who died under Amin's tyranny. I am usually not one to complain about continuity errors as all movies have them, but i found one in this film hard to ignore.The scene in the airport when Amin is torturing Garragin there is a giant plasma screen in the background in the airport.How this made it's way into the film is beyond me.Sheer laziness on the part of the filmmakers would be my guess.The amount of positive reviews of this movie is a perfect example of how ignorant people are of history and how much films are dumbed-down for the audience in modern cinema."

"moonspinner55","6","5","8","9 June 2007"," Fictionalized history, with a Scottish protagonist who doesn't elicit much sympathy
","""Inspired by real events"", Giles Fodin's novel becomes Oscar-winning triumph for Forest Whitaker, ideally and convincingly cast as Idi Amin who, in 1970 Uganda, staged a political coup, ousting the former African dictator with promises to the struggling country that he was just like one of them. James McAvoy's performance as a medical school graduate from Scotland who comes to Uganda hoping to ""make a difference in the world"" is a problem however. We get just a smidgen of information about McAvoy's young doctor: he seemingly picks Uganda at random on the globe, but a two-person medical staff is already awaiting his arrival; and we never learn what happens to the British doctor and his wife, the latter of whom fends off McAvoy's advances (he's apparently attracted to married women). The Scottish medic and the new President cross paths and enter into a close friendship and working relationship, but we're as confused as this kid when Amin lashes out at his circle in paranoid confusion and insecurity. Whitaker's performance is spot-on, but Idi Amin as written comes off like a buffoonish, mercurial hothead, cheeky one moment and enraged the next. The film's final third, with the physician requesting to leave Uganda but then having a heated affair with one of Amin's wives, is a mess, and director Kevin MacDonald's assured processing of this story simply unravels. McAvoy is an ingratiating lad at the outset, but he becomes less interesting (and less sympathetic as a focal point in the plot) after turning from a wide-eyed idealist into a political detective. After bodies begin stacking up, and a French airliner is hijacked by the Palestinians, one's faith in the filmmakers weakens, and all the vitality MacDonald showed early on is betrayed by the melodrama. **1/2 from ****"

Forest Whitaker has a great performance, and my friends who never heard of him before thought that he was actually from Uganda. As I said I loved the story and Forests's acting BUT the directing and camera work on this movie was HORRENDOUS! I'm in a Grade 12 video class at my school, and we have better camera work then this movie's. The pan's and zooms were jumpy, the camera would quickly go right, stop, then quickly jolt right again. Same goes with zooms: zoom in, stop, zoom in, stop, zoom in, stop, quick zoom out. Than on top of these horrible zooms and pans there were also some unnecessary ones, for example one part where Idi Amin and the Doc are talking there's a terrible zoom to Amin's hand, it's not a smooth zoom, and the hand/arm isn't even centered when it stops. These technical aspects ruined the movie for me, cause I thought I had finally gotten away from terrible camera work when I passed Video10."

In the words of one critic ""it ultimately leaves you with nothing to think about"".<br/><br/>I'm no puritan by any means, however I found it slightly offensive how a white central character's fate is elevated to 'all importance' while black people are tortured and killed around him.<br/><br/>Essential characters are reduced to one-dimensional plot devices that slot very mechanically into the whole story. This undermines the necessary tone of humanity, especially as the central protagonist alongside Amin is of dubious morality.<br/><br/>The final text at the end of the film was annoying, giving some facts about the 300,000 people who died in Uganda in real life . . . then following it and finishing with the shockingly trivial observation that said something like ""and no one knows whether the day Amin died on was the one that he had predicted in a dream he that he would die on"". If he WAS right are we supposed to think ""hmmm . . . maybe he WAS inspired after all!""?? A good film from a 'watchability' point of view, but it still left me feeling like I'd just seen the pantomime version of Jack the Ripper!"

","Spoiler Alert! Why the happy ending? Clearly, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) was on a one-way ticket to a nasty ending. And just at the point where he seems to be doomed to a horrific death ... he is cleaned up and hustled onto the departing plane! Why didn't the script writers have him rescued by the Israeli commandos? Only ""48 hours more"", and the movie could have had a good shoot 'em up ending. A commando rescue would not have been any more odd than the strange escape by Dr. Garrigan. Besides, Dr. Garrigan is not a pleasant character.<br/><br/>I very much liked the character Nigel Stone (Simon McBurney). The portrayal of the pragmatic and cynical British diplomat was great contrast to Dr. Garrigan's egoism and ignorance. I very much liked the pool-side meeting of the two. Stone might have appeared to be socially geeky but he clearly had Dr. Garrigan figured out.<br/><br/>Good movie spoiled by a happy ending!"

","Over the years films seem to have gone through phases of popularity. From the science fiction of the eighties, courtroom drama's of the nineties to the war flicks of the noughties there has always been one genre that seems to be milked until the last sour dribbles within each time frame. In recent years however the proverbial milk is being taken from the udder of ""Snuff"" films.<br/><br/>The more traditional horror films of the past have been succeeded by a torrent of films such as ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" dedicated to documenting the graphic and horrifying demise of terrified teens in a variety of increasingly gruesome ways. These films have sadly received a decent backing from critics and viewers alike who puzzlingly seem to buy into the token of a back story the antagonist uses as their reasoning for carrying out their horrific pursuits. It seems the more traditional techniques and themes used to evoke terror in the viewers have been sadly dropped by the wayside. The earliest of horror films used a concoction of suspense, Gothic imagery and implied brutality to trigger the viewer's imagination into assuming the worst, in the process leaving them terrified.<br/><br/>When watching The Last King of Scotland I was finally given a reminder that these techniques have not been forgotten.<br/><br/>The film charts the story of Nicolas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young and charismatic Scottish doctor, who moves to Uganda looking for adventure, but rapidly winds up the newly appointed president Idi Amin's (Forest Whitaker) personal physician, with all the side effects. Although Garrigan is followed throughout, this is just the ""McGuffin"". This is a film dedicated to Amin. Director Kevin Macdonald turns Forest Whitaker from an underrated Hollywood b-lister who rarely played anything other than a disturbingly likable character, into a truly terrifying tyrant.<br/><br/>Amin was an inspiring leader capable of great speeches as is shown in the film, but it is the other forms of persuasion displayed are far more interesting. Whitaker portrays a manipulative and violent leader who would stop at nothing to carry out his ever changing wishes. Despite all his charm he is an immature leader who puts his pride above all else, as is backed up by Garrigans cry, ""You're a child. That's what makes you so ****ing scary!"" This is the films strong suit. In Whitaker and McAvoy you have two leading actors who are totally convincing in their playing of totally convincing roles. The realism of the film is so extreme it is easy to become immersed in the plot and genuinely fearful of Amin. Whitaker just becomes Amin in every way, his emotions simply feel real. When the premium talent of the two main characters is backed up by top notch support staff and a brilliant soundtrack and script you have a genuinely amazing film.<br/><br/>In terms of immersion there are few films that will capture your attention like this one, and the performance of Whitaker is simply awe inspiring. I urge you to go into this film with an open mind and try to hang on to every word, as they are all fantastic. This is not a casual film, it creates a world you will be sucked into for its duration, but the images included will live with you for a long time to come."

","Wouldn't it be interesting if movies ostensibly based on true people and events added a caveat like ""but otherwise, this movie is 100% fiction."" That was the thought that crossed my mind when I saw the caption at the start of the movie, telling viewers ""this story is inspired by true people and events"".<br/><br/>Otherwise, The Last King of Scotland is a thoroughly entertaining thriller but of negligible value in giving insight into what Uganda was really like under Idi Amin's reign. In fact, Amin is actually a supporting character in this movie, but Forest Whitaker's incredible performance pushes him front and center, in the same way that Anthony Hopkins made The Silence of the Lambs about Hannibal Lecter despite having only some 30 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>In actuality, the movie could well be subtitled The Nicholas Garrangan Show as the movie is actually about the young Scotish doctor (energetically played by James McAvoy) who goes to Uganda in search of adventure and ends up as Amin's personal physician and one of his closest advisers.<br/><br/>Director Kevin McDonald really knows how to ratchet up the tension and if he wanted to, he could easily join Paul Greengrass in bringing grit and edge to mainstream thrillers. He also keeps the film briskly paced, which keeps audience interest up despite the two-hour length.<br/><br/>But in line with the focus on Dr. Garrigan, the horrors of Amin's reign are kept in the background, until its time for the good doctor to realize what kind of a fix he's gotten himself into, whereupon the photos of those violently killed by Amin's men are brought out.<br/><br/>The filmmakers also have no insight into what makes Amin tick, other than Garrrigan's calling him a child at a crucial point in the movie. In other words, the only insight the movie can come up with is that Amin is a walking Ego, given absolute power and then turned loose on Uganda.<br/><br/>So watch The Last King of Scotland as an entertaining thrill ride, but do try to read up on Amin if the subject interests you."

","Based on the novel by Giles Foden, The Last King of Scotland is inspired by true events from the brutal regime of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin as told by his personal physician in the early 70s.<br/><br/>Scottish director Kevin Macdonald directs fellow Scot, James McAvoy, as the fictitious Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, who sees Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) as both charismatic and terrifyingly gruesome. While McAvoy is able to hold his own, acting-wise, against the fierce Amin portrayed by the Oscar-deserving Whitaker, he suffers from his youth; he looks like he belongs in high school and not believably a young doctor interested to help the plight of the African poor.<br/><br/>Gillian Anderson (more popularly known from The X-Files) has an understated role as Sarah Merrit, wife of the small town doctor whom Nicholas originally came to help. Her character pegs him from the beginning as not the sort anyone would think would come to Uganda to help in their mission. He proves her right later on.<br/><br/>While the audience could probably understand Nicholas' restless need for adventure, it is difficult to relate with this antihero, especially as someone who is telling the story. The average person would probably not have done the things he did.<br/><br/>However, the painful truth surfaces when another doctor Djonjo tells Nicholas, ""Go home and tell the truth about Amin. They will believe you. You are a white man."" The editing is crisp and the unraveling of the story is exciting. Filipinos can perhaps relate to the political atmosphere of that time. Watch this and be awakened by the brutality not only of actual blood spilled but also more horrifyingly, of quiet decisions we and our leaders make everyday."

One of the main reasons for its quality are the acting performances of the two leading actors Forest Whitaker (especially his performance was amazing-in some scenes he switched from being a good fella into a total psycho in one second,which was quite scary:) and James McAvoy. Watching the development and change in their relationship was really interesting and impressive. Another great part of the movie was the screenplay. The dialogs weren't too short or too long. They said what was needed to be said and didn't involve the crap they usually involve (unnecessary stuff about their past,family, which aren't required for the storyline of the film, but are only filling blank spaces in the film etc.) The only thing I could reprehend is too long introduction (James McAvoy playing football with African kids etc.)On the other hand that was kind of needed in order to leave stronger impression from the movie as a whole, which I absolutely understand, but Ithink it could have been done a bit better.

It's a sad day if this is the Best British Film, though The Queen isn't much better. Shorter and less bombastic. Actually, The Last King of Scotland reminded me of The King and I. Can't wait for the musical version..."
"Derek237","9","3","4","13 February 2007"," An entertaining and thrilling film
","The Last King of Scotland is not a film about the ruthless, sadistic dictator Idi Amin. It is actually about a lost youth, who lives with such a reckless abandon that he does not care whose lives he interferes with, as long as he fulfills his hedonistic desires. It's no surprise that in the rush of things after he whimsically decides to practice medicine in Uganda (anything is better than becoming an exact duplicate of his father), he unknowingly becomes best friends with the devil.<br/><br/>Most of the politics of Amin and his rule are side-stepped in order to focus on the story of this fictional character, Nicholas, played by James McAvoy. Some may think this is a bad idea, and in a way it is, but surprisingly, the film works incredibly well as this morality tale, as well as a very intense thriller. I felt it was something of a mix of Wall Street and Midnight Express, and you can't really go wrong there.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker plays Amin, and even though his character is not the central focus of the story, he certainly steals the show. This is one of those rare, amazing performances that always leaves you anticipating the actor's next scene. It's such a delicious role that maybe if Amin actually WAS the focus of the story, it just might not pay off as well. In the case of Whitaker's perfect, career-defining performance, less has proved to be more.<br/><br/>This was not exactly the kind of film I was expecting, but I enjoyed it thoroughly nevertheless. Both Idi Amin and Nicholas are well fleshed out characters. Amin's charm and madness are hypnotic to behold. Nicholas' journey from being a naive fool to finally taking some responsibility unfolds very well and convincingly. He may be fictitious creation, but what is said to him by a certain character at the end, about the role he must finally play, is completely plausible.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland features incredible work by Whitaker, all-around great acting, and it always kept me on the edge of my seat. It may not have had much of a political agenda, but it was still one hell of an entertaining film of the highest quality.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

"jgrosspjc","7","3","4","12 February 2007"," Oscar time for Whitaker, despite the overkill
","As the youngest of baby boomers are drawn to the novelty of the 1970s as history, we sometimes remember Idi Amin with more humor than horror as the big, black, and flamboyant cannibal king. The Last King of Scotland will change that. And as Westerners have yet to endure the rule and wrath of a cult of personality, we are challenged to find anything redeeming in Stalin, Castro, or Amin let alone charisma. For this reason alone,Forest Whitaker deserves the Oscar for best actor. We knew the ""king"" was a murderous dictator, but in certain moments, we can't help but like him (especially when excitedly declaring victory after blatantly cheating in a swim race). Glasgow's own James McAvoy, is narrowly more likable as the protagonist Dr.Garrigan whose naivety is defendable if not his Scottish bravado, libido, or botched heroics. The soundtrack's intensity during an African bacchanal, or Garrigan's unsuccessful dash after Sarah (Gillian Anderson) in the back seat of the rolling-away-bus (as seen in hundreds of films) was beyond gratuitous. Given his tendency to commit overkill, we should congratulate director Kevin MacDonald for at least leaving the Entebbe raid and aftermath on the cutting room floor. This was the right place to end the film, using the Israeli commando-rescue operation,as a historical 'restore point' with which most of the target audience will be familiar. Certain scenes are memorably enhanced by changing film stocks including a bewitching sketch where the""Field Marshal"" spontaneously joins the tribal dancers commemorating his appearance at a regional rally. With unlikely subtlety, these scenes match the epilogue, a collage of historical footage of the real Amin and somber posting of his handiwork (300,000 Ugandan civilians murdered). The Last King of Scotland should be important to Western viewers as our ignorance of matters African, is no longer viable."

","The above quote is not from ""The Last King of Scotland"", but from ""Gangs of New York"" as said by Leonardo DiCaprio ¬ñ but it might as well be, for doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) experiences the same deceitful tour into the African elite. It starts with mafia-like showering of gifts and status under the great dictator and ends in political world of kidnapping, mass-murder and torture. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is a nuanced, well-told portrait of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from the naive perspective of his personal physician.<br/><br/>James McAvoy captures the idealist nature of his newly-examined physician with apt conviction. Back in dreary Scotland he spins the globe and lands his finger first on Canada, says ""Eh"" and decides to spin it again, this time ending up in Uganda. Cut to Nicholas riding on a loud bus in Africa and meeting the joyous, colourful Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). As the film progresses, he has trapped himself in a self-spun cocoon of complex love stories, political questions and lavish gifts and suffers moral qualms accordingly.<br/><br/>Although in screen time and narrative the film centres on our doctor, the film is not about Nicholas Garrigan. Indeed, the BAFTAs deemed James McAvoy 'supporting', and Forest Whitaker 'leading' as have most awarding bodies. Whitaker's inventive, bold and off-colour performance is primed to pick up awards and almost certainly also the big one with the Academy. As Idi Amin, he is an entertainer, dictator, mass-murderer, torturer, husband, father and bully all rolled into one and all operating seamlessly within the same large, intimidating man. The result is unspeakably captivating and the walleyed Whitaker brings unusual baggage to the complex character, creating a fully-fledged artist.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is shot on location with beautifully picturesque pastel-tinted African dance parties in one end and starving children and torture chambers in the others, inspired by true events and wholly grounded in reality, especially by including montages of live action footage and news paper articles on Amin's gruesome practices. Yet the film does not feel entirely realistic. The main problem is the hackneyed extra-template love-story between Nicholas and someone close to Idi Amin and predictably, it has severe implications. This feels quite redundant in the otherwise compelling film. All in all, however, Kevin Macdonald's ""The Last King of Scotland"" is a fine 2006 addition.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

","""The British Empire is long dead; only flotsam and jetsam now remain"" wrote Niall Ferguson in his outstanding history of Britain's imperial adventures ""Empire"". Amongst the flotsam and jetsam that had been discarded was the nation of Uganda which became independent in 1962 and fell into anarchy a few short years later. The first ""democratic"" Prime Minister (on the Westminster model) was Milton Obote who soon tired of the constraints of democracy and overthrew the constitution. Uganda then became ruled by whichever warlord had the most military resources and from 1971 to 1979 this was the grotesque tyrant Idi Amin. Superficially a comic figure there was in reality nothing at all amusing about this maniacal psychopath. So to make a movie about Amin the minimum requirement is to ensure that his tyranny is clear ¬ñ and this the director of ""The Last King of Scotland"" Kevin Macdonald does exceptionally well. Amin could have been depicted merely as a comical Gilbert and Sullivan grotesque (which he was), but Macdonald - in his first feature film ¬ñ uses his documentary-making experience to present Amin also as a far from fictional mass-murderer.<br/><br/>Amin is revealed in all his horrendous authenticity by the creation of a fictional character in the young Scots doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) through whose eyes we see the dictator in all his raw brutal detail. Garrigan is seeking adventure and escape from the dull and straight-laced Presbyterian world of his family in Scotland. He chooses Uganda initially for commendable humanitarian reasons but is soon enticed by Amin's offer to him to be his personal physician. So we see Amin through Garrigan's eyes, and being as close to the despot as he needs to be to fulfil the role that Amin wants him to perform, we inevitably see Amin warts and all.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is about the corruption that always comes from power ¬ñ not just the corruption of Amin, but the corruption of Garrigan as well. Gradually the privileges of power give Garrigan the conceit that he can do what he likes ¬ñ just as his employer does. When this includes the idea that he can have a sexual relationship with Amin's attractive third wife Kay (beautifully played by Kerry Washington) his delusion is almost as mad as Amin's. It's probably never a good career move to screw the wife of a maniacal mass-murdering psychopath! Pretty much everything about ""the Last King¬Ö"" is excellent, a remarkable directorial debut by Macdonald. But what turns a very good film into a great one is the astonishing portrayal of Amin by Forest Whitaker. Whitaker is a veteran of some seventy movies as actor, producer or director but he can never have come close to a part before that was so made for him. And he took it very seriously indeed getting and staying in character even when the cameras were not running. It must have been very scary indeed for the crew and the rest of the cast to have Amin in their midst all the time!"

","I,personally,knew only the most vague stuff about Ugandan President Idi Amin Dada,and some-perhaps much-of what I knew was legend. Something that was generally accepted was that he was a violent and brutal leader. What this movie,penned by Jeremy Brock and Giles Foden(adapted off a novel,the name of the author escapes me)and directed by Kevin McDonald(not to be confused with the lanky Canadian comedic actor from ""Kids in the Hall""),has done for me(And I know I'm not alone here)is catalog how such a brutal enforcer of a leader could be scarily winsome and charismatic as any other politician or demagogue. To be sure,I feel like this is neither a remarkable or unique development in the world of politics,but to get a closer look at this regime and the larger-than-life,mercurial man behind it is still eye-opening.<br/><br/>Scotish Physician Nicholas Garrigan(James McAvoy,who makes me wonder if Hugh Grant has a long-lost Scottish relative)moves to Uganda on somewhat of a whim,expecting to do good for man plying his profession. Not long after being introduced to and working among the children and mothers in the mission he's assigned,he comes into an encounter with the then freshly crowned leader Amin on a chance encounter. Amin(Forrest Whitaker,an actor I've always appreciated,and for whom it makes me very happy to find in a role like this one,getting recognition he's getting for it!) blusters,poses and huffs big and magnanimously. He's a populist of the textbook kind:proudly flouting his humble roots and promising a government that won't poses the largess and graft of the previous regime. Garrigan,partly out of fear,partly out of true admiration of the man,goes along,semi-reluctantly at first,then nearly in oblivion afterwords. Over some years of living as amin's personal physician and(by Amin's own appellation)his personal adviser,Garrigan slowly comes to the realization,through both what he sees on the news and around him,as well as Amin's increasingly erratic behavior,that he's not working so much for a brash 'Man-of-the-people' but a very dangerous man. By then,however,Garrigan has made his proverbial deal with the Devil,and paying up for it will be inevitably brutal.<br/><br/>Despite this being a vast,vivid sweep of Uganda and the 1970s landscape it held,this film's character study is remarkably sparse and concentrated. Amin and Garrigan(believed to be a composite character,based on about four westerners for whom worked in his administration for much of his reign,which was officially deposed in 1979)are the primarily focus here,and as such both Whitaker and McAvoy are strong here,though McAvoy's Garrigan(maybe intentionally so)could illicit incredulity as to how selectively naive someone in his position could be. Kerry Washington(As amin's third wife),Gillian Anderson(as the co-chief of the mission where Garrigan originally works),Simon McBurney(As the Brit diplomat,deep in the know)and David Oyedeno(As the former regime physician)show up and add to the story,but they are sparingly used,there to frame certain chapters in the turn of this relationship between ruler and doctor/adviser,and thusly,ruler and country.<br/><br/>As hard to watch in parts fascinating and difficult to look away from in others,this movie may suffer a little from excess or of narrative abridgment,but it is as worthy as any movie to see this Oscar/Golden GLobe/whatever season. Whiatker in particular,makes this film worth the price of admission. Worth a look."

He spins a globe and ends up choosing Canada...he spins again and lands on Uganda. For a smart doctor he should have researched what this country was going through before heading over there...but hey, I guess he was really looking for an adventure. And he gets it. After working at a small village hospital, his services are surprisingly needed by the big honcho himself, Amin. Doctor Nick helps him out and at the same time befriends the incredibly power-hungry yet charismatic president. Amin asks/tells Nicholas, that he's is needed by his side. Nick slowly agrees and from that moment on, Nick and Amin become the best of friends and live happily ever after...or Nick eventually sees the truth behind Amins' eyes and has realized he's entered a much too dangerous world.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland is fast-paced and led by Forest's awesome performance of Amin. It's such a scene-stealing performance, I didn't care much about the other characters until pretty much the end of the movie. But don't get me wrong, they are all good performances...truthfully nothing special, but the main reason you're seeing this movie is to witness one actor working at his finest.

I know people who escaped from Uganda swearing this was Amin personified a stupid brute with enormous power yet with the inkling, attitude and mentality of a child. Utterly inept yet his intimidation was one that could weaken knees. The Garrigan character closely resembles another Brit who was in the employ of Amin as a close adviser, Bob Astles.

Rather than take up with his father in practice in relatively tranquil Scotland, he goes on an adventure to Uganda, a newly independent African country formerly in the British Empire. Garrigan might have spent his time in a rural clinic unnoticed but fate puts him in tight with Uganda's new dictator Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) who has recently seized power. Amin brings Garrigan to the capitol Kampala where Garragan is installed as Presidential physician and best friend to a lonely ruler.<br/><br/>With a touch of self - deceptive innocence, Garrigan plays the neophyte walking in the shadow of the perilous backstage to power. Garrigan enters the operating theatre of power with a detached bemusement of the spectator at a play. And Idi Amin is one for creating good theatre with his antics.<br/><br/>Can the attraction of the glamor of the power, prestige and privileges blind Garrigan to the brutality of the dictatorship he serves? Certainly aspects of Idi Amin's rule, like that of George W Bush would have been comic if it were not for the cost in lives.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker rendered a bravura performance as the paranoid dictator, capturing both Amin's exhilerance for power and love of the the theatre of power."

","Forest Whitaker did an amazing job here. He resembled Idi Amin--- looked like him, moved like, and sounded like him. But Whitaker's performance was much, much more than a mere impersonation. He really inhabited the guy. The vibe was so full, and so complete! It was as if Whittaker recreated him in a perfect translation for us, the movie audience. That is a rare and marvellous thing. Whitaker more than deserves his Oscar nomination. There are some worthy candidates for best actor this year. Others also did great jobs, and deserve to win as well. But Whitaker also clearly did a masterful job, and clearly deserves to win as well. His portrayal went far beyond the trendy and gimicky 'impersonations' of famous folks.<br/><br/>The story is scary and sort of creepy. But as far as a westerner such as myself can know, it appears to be real. It has a ring of truth and authenticity to it. News stories report the Scottish doctor character was indeed a conglomerate of real-life white visitors to Amin's world. I was engaged and engrossed in the movie from the first scenes that took place in Africa. What an amazing movie! And being true, it also rang with a certain satisfaction that not many movies do.<br/><br/>The Scottish doctor was all too human. He was not painted as any kind of do-gooder or saint, which I liked. How many of us could have resisted the temptations he was faced with? I would guess that most of us would have done exactly as he did, and probably worse. Even though he was a fictional character, it seems that he was based on a conglomerate of western, white people and their behaviour when confronted with the favour of koo-koo despots with unlimited power and wealth. He was seduced. But I think most of us would have been as well.<br/><br/>Overall, a stupendous movie! Please don't be shy about the reality theme, nor the grittiness. it had some gory moments, but wasn't all 'The Killing Fields'-y, as I had feared. It was thrilling, fast-paced, and truly human. I gave it a well-deserved 10 out of 10. And good luck at the Oscars, Mr. Whitaker! I hope you win."

","Part-biopic, part-docudrama, but mostly supercharged thriller, The Last King Of Scotland tells the complex tale of a cocky young doctor Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy) who comes to Uganda by pure chance in the seventies, only to find himself as the personal assistant of one Idi Amin, the flamboyant dictator-cum-president of the newly independent nation. Just as Amin is won over by the frankness and sense of humour of the young doctor, Garrigan finds himself enchanted by the boisterous charm of his new patient. Amin (electrically played by Forest Whitaker) exhibits a charismatic wit that makes it easy for the audience to understand how he brainwashed so many people. The final act, however, delves deep into the monster that he would inevitably be remembered for ¬ñ the man who slaughtered 300 thousand of his people, and lived a paranoid reign for most of his time in power. The Last King Of Scotland, despite occasionally hitting a damp note, strikes a worthy balance between the comic and the horrific ¬ñ thanks largely to the Oscar worthy energy that Whitaker, a truly great and underrated actor, instills his performance with. A blistering thriller with an unusual mixture of haunting imagery and dark comedy, this is one of the early must-see films of the year."

","Historical dramas in Africa are thin on the ground. Although awash with rich material,the sceptre of Rasicm has largely kept mainstream film makers away from Political drama on this volatile continent. Yet McDonalds's tale is a triumph, with a towering performance from Forrest Whitaker as Idi Amin.<br/><br/>Ironically the narrative is driven not by Amin , but by James McCavoy as a young Scottish Doctor in search of adventure - who certainly finds it! He uncannily reprises Ewan McGreggors ""Joie de vivre as a Scotsman"" and his role allows Amin's to ""breathe"".The cinematography has a wonderful lush African feel to it whilst bravely eschewing the obvious ""safari"" shots.<br/><br/>Very few films simply show Africans as Africans - and this is one of this film's great strengths. Well edited, and sprightly in pace, one episode zips into another making mincemeat of the two hour running time.<br/><br/>The beautiful Gillian Anderson has an understated love interest role at the start of the film as the undervalued wife of a Doctor manning a remote village medical centre. But the real action starts when Amin persuades the young Doctor to join him in Kampala.<br/><br/>Ironically the only stereotyping is of the British (English as far as McDonald is concerned) Consular officials as bumbling Colonial mealy -mouthed fools. It smacks of a joke for the Directors Scottish mates, and slightly undermines the restraint with which the other characters are drawn.<br/><br/>Apart from the savage climax as the Entebbe Hostage Crisis unfolds, the violence engulfing the country is only alluded to and hinted at. Amin is portrayed largely as a human, colourful, and humorous individual - not least when he is discussing extra marital liaisons with the young Doctor.<br/><br/>Although this is a fiction within an historical context it succeeds in both entertaining a s a story and illuminating pretty fairly one of Africa's more notorious dictators"
"jaredmobarak","9","3","4","20 January 2007"," Do you have monkeys in Scotland?¬ÖThe Last King of Scotland
","What happens when a precocious young doctor gets a feeling of claustrophobia at home and decides to travel the world to bring help while having fun in the process? Kevin Macdonald's The Last King of Scotland tries to show us the answers in the midst of Idi Amin's rise to power in Uganda. While not a biopic, the film is also not a narrative fiction of any real weight. Instead this is a tale of a monster through the eyes of someone whose innocence thought what was happening was for the good of all until it was too late to turn back. Idi Amin is not the star of the show¬óalthough he does steal virtually every scene he's in¬óit's the young doctor's evolution at the hands of the viciousness he was sheltered from in his childhood that drives the plot. When one is not quite world weary and still under the impression that they are invincible to atrocity, they can easily be duped into following what they see up close rather than what is happening around them.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does a wonderful job as the young doctor going to Uganda to lend his assistance and find some adventure along the way. He is rebelling against the life he should be leading in Scotland as a family doctor at the side of his father. That is not the life he wants to be living so soon in his career and thus spins the globe to find his next destination. While in the African country, he takes part in the hard job of being one of two doctors trying to help all the unfortunate poor of the nation. Upon a chance meeting with the new president, General Amin, he is given the opportunity to become the man's personal physician. McAvoy is fantastic at showing the utter happiness at being looked upon as someone who can help a nation by this seemingly great man. He begins to enjoy his post, lives with all perks available to him, (I loved the transition from utter squalor of the countryside to the wealth of urban areas in the capital, as I never expected to see that upper crust side to the African scenery here), and becomes the leader's closest adviser on all matters whether or not medically pertinent. It is his great job during the high times that really show how good of an actor he is once the lid is lifted to reveal all the atrocities that have been happening right under his nose. What once began as a job of missionary work becomes a trial to see if he can stay alive long enough to leave the country while his friend and boss becomes more and more unstable in his sightline, characteristics he hid so effectively during the courtship process of recruiting his skills.<br/><br/>No matter how good McAvoy is, though, he is no match for Forest Whitaker's powerhouse performance as the larger-than-life Amin. Sure there is a lot of talk going around that the Scot is the real star here with the general a supporting player, (as far as awards go), however, Whitaker is on screen for a good three quarters of the film and definitely deserves to be considered in the Best Actor categories. Just because the film does not necessarily revolve around his character, he is still a co-star before being relegated a supporter. I have always been a Whitaker fan, from his small roles like that in Fast Times, to measured dramatic perfection in season 5 of ""The Shield,"" to the more unique roles like Ghost Dog. Nothing he has done, though, can prepare you for the magic he brings to the screen here. You get every side of this monster from his compassion for the people of Uganda¬óalbeit those that are on his side¬óthe utter charm and charisma that was used to get not only those around him as friends but also the British government to support his coup of the nation, to the animosity that could brim to the surface without the slightest provocation. Watching him go from happy-go-lucky to a maniacal rants of insane paranoia, cutting short even those he just finished praising, is amazing. The smile could charm even the most skeptical cynic, but I think what someone says in the movie is true; he is a child and that is what makes him so scary.<br/><br/>Sure these two performances make the movie a joy to watch, but the film itself somewhat lacks in substance. Through the middle of the film, we see the conflict bubbling to the surface many times; yet while being different, serve to give the same context to the viewers. All this monotony is eventually redeemed at the conclusion. I truly will say that I never expected what happened. Yes, I figured what transpired would, but I didn't think it would go down quite the way it did. I applaud Macdonald for never shying away from the true impetus of this film; he brought to the table a story of a monster disguised as a great man and showed how it all could unravel without flinching. His use of grainy camera-work adds to the documentary-like style and the close-ups of actors covered in the sweat and dirt of Africa showed the realism and truth of the place. He was also able to get great performances from all his supporting cast, from the extras playing regular townsfolk and army men, the Ugandans surrounding Amin, (especially David Oyelowo as another doctor), a nice show of talent from usual standard-fare actress Kerry Washington, and a surprisingly real and emotively bottled representation of a woman who trapped herself into the life she led by Gillian Anderson. All in all, this film is a must see for the actors alone, yet also has a riveting story to watch progress until its inevitable conclusion."
"jgil-1","Null","3","4","19 January 2007"," Not enough Idi!
","I remember the brutal reign of Idi Amin years ago reading about his brutal reign in Uganda and was surprised that it took this long for a movie to be made about this mysterious dictator-madman. I was eager to watch this movie in hopes of gaining some insight on his rise and fall and learn more about how it all came about. After watching this movie, I must admit I was disappointed that the focus was on a fictional character (Dr.Nicholas Garrigan) and not on the dictator himself. A story focused on the Dr. and how he came to Uganda and eventually met Idi was not what I had hoped for. Forrest Whittaker did a marvelous job in becoming Idi on screen--truly worthy of the awards that he will receive for this work of art! The problem with this movie is the lack of focus on the main character. We do not learn how Idi rose to power, his early years and even his brutal character was hidden for most of the film. The last part of the film does capture his brutal and paranoid personality but so much of the film was focused on the other character (who is fictional!) that I left disappointed. Still so many questions left unanswered on who the real Idi Amin was that I will have to read more about him to get those questions answered. The story was interesting but the movie was not what I had hoped for. The previews for this movie is misleading because Idi is really the secondary character. He doesn't even appear in the movie for the 1st 20 minutes. The previews make it seem like he is the primary character and this isn't the case. While the movie is still a good one, I think it could have been a real classic if more of the focus was put on the main character."

Yet here Kevin MacDonald portrays both characters with immense sensitivity and honesty. He does not spare the gore but won't dwell on it unnecessarily, either. He offers a taste of the environment, the beauty and the threat, rather like 'The Constant Gardener' with which I personally find myself comparing this film. This film is not about the past, it is about world politics today with all the cross-cultural tensions, and also about Africa,with a not dissimilar scenario only a stones throw from Uganda.

","The Last King of Scotland, is not a biopic about Idi Amin, but instead a fiction rooted around his bloody and brutal rule of Uganda in the 1970s.<br/><br/>The story centres on the journey of newly qualified medic, Dr Nicholas Garrigan, adventure seeking and idealistically na√Øve about the post-colonial power plays occurring in the newly independent Uganda that he has arrived in, and far away from his native Scotland.<br/><br/>As he journeys on a packed bus to the missionary run rural hospital, where he has volunteered his services, he witnesses tanks and army trucks roar past jubilant crowds. He befriends a female passenger, and enquires of the military presence to find that Amin has just seized power in a coup, and this is ""a happy day for Uganda "". Not one to opt out of celebrations, Nicholas rounds off his evening by bedding his new friend.<br/><br/>Nicholas' tendency to desire any female with whom he has a struck a friendship, is what leads him to first becoming Amin's personal physician, and later to his torture by Amin's death squad. In between these two key scenes, we witness Forrest Whitaker's towering figure and equally towering performance as Amin, stealing every scene from James Macavoy's ""gap-year"" gone wrong character. Whitaker's Amin was apparently endlessly researched, with the dictator refusing to let go once the cameras had stopped rolling, and the man is given room to reveal himself to be more than ""The Butcher of Africa,"" but nevertheless a ruler that seems to govern on his indulgent whims and dark fancies.<br/><br/>Take for example, his full, self-given title of ""His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular"".<br/><br/>In this adaptation of Giles Foden's eponymous novel, writers Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan, and director Kevin Macdonald (Touching The Void), recreate key events in Amin's rule including his trips to Libya (where he that formed an alliance of sorts with Qaddaffi), his expulsion of all Indians and Pakistanis in Uganda (around 60,000, on the grounds that they are sabotaging his economy), and the hostage crises at Entebbe airport.<br/><br/>As these events occur, we see the development of strange friendship develop between Nicholas and Amin. Initially won over by Amin's love of Scotland and his magnetism, their bond grows stronger as they together survive an assassination attempt. Bolstered by the growing trust Amin displays towards him, Nicholas chides the local Foreign Office man when asked to ""report back"" from his unique position as the new President's personal doctor.<br/><br/>Amin's decadent parties, Kampala 's club life and hotel bars keep Nicholas occupied when he isn't working at Kampala 's hospital, and delay his awakening to the grip that has formed around him. This is vividly portrayed when Nicholas advises Amin that he intends to leave Uganda , to which Amin's immense frame hugs the increasingly desperate Nicholas, and proclaims ""You are Ugandan,"" invoking the kind of wretched terror and finality that hasn't been seen since Brando's Captain Kurtz. Shortly after, Nicholas returns to his home to find it ransacked and his British passport missing.<br/><br/>As the brutality of Amin's rule and his paranoia increase, Nicholas finds himself trapped where his position as ""Amin's white-monkey"" means he cannot find passage out of the nightmarish dictator's hold.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland,"" offers no condemnations on either colonialism or Amin's governance, and instead allows the almost ""end of days"" dionysian cuccoon that Amin and Nicholas briefly inhabit to slowly peel away to reveal the anarchy underneath, on Kampala's streets, in Uganda's villages and in Amin's mind. In this regard, it is a powerful and at times, harrowing journey."
"come2whereimfrom","8","3","4","14 January 2007"," First great film of the Year.
","Based on real events this film is really only a snap shot of Amin's brutal reign over Uganda at the start of the seventies but oh what a snap shot it is. Told from the point of view of two men, one the president the other a young doctor the film belongs to them. Forest Whitaker is simply amazing as the mad president and rising star James McAvoy is brilliant as the doctor who finds himself out of his depth as the president's personal physician and unwitting adviser. Starting in Scotland in 1970 we see Nicholas graduated and daunted by the idea of going into the family practise spinning a globe and vowing to go to the first place he touches which happens to be Uganda. At a chance meeting with the president after a rally in which we first see Whitaker stride to the front of the stage as much Amin as the man himself, the two seem to hit it off. When the seemingly harmless and innocent president takes a shine to Nicholas and offers him the job of his doctor he decides to give it a go. A slow and almost comical move through life at the president's side follows and we as an audience can enjoy Nicholas's good luck and new high life right up until he is brought a car. From this point the film takes a turn as does Amin which sees Whitaker really get his teeth in to the role especially the scene in the warehouse which sees him almost instantly change into a monster. Nicholas now trapped in a collapsing country at the hands of a butcher is desperate to get out but Amin does everything to make him stay including stealing his passport. Lavishly shot but with elements of a hand-held feel, well paced and with a sharp script the film is held together by the two central performances, even so the music and cinematography also help capture the feel of the country at that time. The transition from the first half of the film with its elements of comedy to violent thriller is handled well by director Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void) its edge of your seat stuff as you are always waiting for it to all go wrong. Whether it's Whitaker for his portrayal of Amin or MvAvoy for his performance as Dr.Garrigan this film will win awards and rightly so, The Last King of Scotland is just one of those films that only comes along every so often."

","""The Last King of Scotland"" has a wonderful performance by Forrest Whitaker. Absolutely Academy Award worthy. the subject matter is inherently interesting, also.<br/><br/>It would, nonetheless, have been a more powerful film with a more moral Scottish doctor-hero. In his own way, he, also, is an immoral man. His transgressions are minor indeed compared with Idi Amin's.<br/><br/>Since emotional engagement is a proper aim of filmmakers, would one not have been more affected by Dr. Garrigan's plight if he had not immediately, and without any discernible compunction, tried to betray his doctor colleague by attempting to make love to his wife, and later, while he still admired him, betrayed Idi Amin with Amin's wife? It's not to compare with Amin's moral turpitude, but it lessens my sympathy for Dr. Garrigan, the film's hero. Have I so outlived my era that younger people do not feel a bit this way, too?"
"gelman@attglobal.net","9","3","4","23 October 2006"," Excellent Acting by Forrest Whitaker
","Idi Amin was a nightmare figure during his bloody tenure as ruler of Uganda, and Forrest Whitaker impressively recreates both his magnetism and his madness. The violence perpetrated by Amin's regime on his enemies, both real and imagined, mostly takes place off screen. Even so, this is a difficult film to watch, much as Hotel Rwanda was. The story line is taken from a novel, and, though it is mixed with history that anyone over the age of 50 is likely to remember, every film-goer is likely to wonder how much, if any of it, is based on actual people and events. The film concludes 48 hours prior to the Israeli raid on Entebbe which freed the remaining hostages after Amin allowed the non-Israelis and non-Jews to be flown out of the country. That's because the Israeli rescue operation is not relevant to the plot line and including it would have shifted the picture's dramatic focus. See this film for Forrest Whitaker's performance. Amin was an altogether different personality than the hotel keeper that Don Cheadle so superbly portrayed in Hotel Rwanda -- but I'm guessing that Whitaker will receive many awards at year's end for this role."

","In a far off land beyond the pale of civilization, there lives a powerful ruler whose merest whim is iron law to his people. Charismatic but childlike, his moods swing between extremes of generosity and cruelty. He takes a liking to a British person who is in the country to look after the ruler's many wives and children in a professional capacity. This person befriends the lowliest of the ruler's wives, with unfortunate consequences. At the end the British person is sadder but wiser.<br/><br/>That's right -- this movie is a remake of The King and I, only without the songs (unless you count Loch Lomond and Me & Bobby McGee). Don't let the up-to-date hand-held camera work, authentic locations, and fast-paced editing fool you -- at its heart this movie fits comfortably into the good old fashioned white-man-in-darkest-Africa genre.<br/><br/>Other time-honored Hollywood clich√©s make an appearance as well. For example, how can we tell when Idi Amin crosses the line into madness? Simple -- he screens a copy of Deep Throat while the soundtrack bursts into some oh-so-decadent heavy metal music. That ought to give second thoughts to all the millions of us who saw that movie and listened to that music in the 70's!<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is good as Amin, but his performance has been absurdly overpraised. In reality, he doesn't break any new ground -- all he really had to do was thumb through his Actor's Handbook until he found the entry for Dictators, African. The real Idi Amin (seen briefly in documentary footage just before the closing credits) seems to have been a much more disturbing character -- less colorful, less charming, but even more brutal. If anything, this movie soft-pedals the reality of his regime.<br/><br/>And anyway the best performance in the film, and the best reason to watch it, is James McAvoy as Dr. Garigan. This character is really a slime ball -- he could teach Amin a thing or two about moral decadence. In the classic style of a 70's middle-class ""rebel"", he's really only out for #1, and to have a good time. He starts out his African sojourn by showing up for work late, having stopped off to bang an African babe he met on the bus. Next he attempts to seduce the wife of the saintly doctor (but Gillian Anderson, of course, is nobody's fool).<br/><br/>Garigan hesitates only briefly before switching from saving lives in the bush to the soft life in Kampala, after which he wastes no time in currying favor with Amin by ratting out the Minister of Health. By the time he sleeps with Amin's wife, with predictably gruesome results, I have to admit that I wasn't entirely sorry to see him end up in the hands of torturers. Nevertheless, the last shot of him on the plane seems to suggest that he may have finally figured out a few things about real life, or even perhaps about himself.<br/><br/>All in all, Garigan is a much more complex and ambiguous character than than this film's version of Amin, although obviously less showy. And McAvoy is brilliant -- it's a shame that he hasn't gotten more of the kudos that have been heaped on Forest Whitaker. I hope we get to see more of him, soon."

","A more richly deserved British acting award has never been given. These acting awards were announced here in Fremantle several nights ago before I had watched the movie for which Forrest Whitaker was given this Best Actor award. Diane and I attended The Last King of Scotland this morning and we were both absolutely in agreement that Mr. Witaker's performance, dare I use the often repeated accolade of electrifying, was just that! He was totally believable in the role of Idi Amin with all of Amin's quixotic behaviors and mercurial mood changes. I only remember Amin's physicality on TV broadcasts of the early 70's, I knew nothing of his personality or behavior but I am equally sure that Giles Foden's novel upon which Morgan and Brock's screen play was based was as accurate as the movie reviewers report.<br/><br/>I know that commentators should not necessarily make personal comments about the players in this shoddy little drama played out in central Africa 25 or so years ago but the most memorable aspect of this remarkable movie was not the Amin portrayal, as good as it was but the doctor's, as played by James McAvoy. I left the movie with the good doctors utter, absolute stupidity clouding my memory of this film. Being overly friendly with his medical partners wife was dumb enough, trying to kill Amin with a poison pill was disastrous for one's health but having a sexual affair with one of Amin's wive's was the ultimate stupidity. I know that the script of the movie was based on a fictional novel but the little notice at the film's beginning saying that the movie was factually based leaves a certain questioning in the back of my mind.<br/><br/>Even if the script were totally fictional regarding the good doctor, I still must question a script with such exceedingly stupid people. Amin emerges as a paradigm of virtue and reasonableness in comparison to his doctoral confidant.<br/><br/>These are just silly random comments about a wonderful movie peopled with extraordinary good actors. Amin's henchmen that do the dirty on the doctor at movie's end are memorably sinister--just looking at those guys is scary without them even doing anything. The Last King of Scotland is a memorable movie, miss it and you will have missed a truly great movie."
"raysond","Null","4","6","30 January 2007"," The Last King Of Scotland
","The year 2006 has been without a doubt a outstanding year in the history of the cinema. However one of those movies ""The Last King Of Scotland"" is among the best out of the bunch of films that came out this year competiting against movies like ""Dreamgirls"",""The Queen"", ""Children Of Men"",""The Flags Of Our Fathers"",""Pan's Labyrinth"",""The Departed"",and so much more.<br/><br/>""The Last King Of Scotland"",brilliantly tells the strange and gripping story of a young Scottish doctor(James McAvoy from ""The Chronicles Of Narnia"")who in 1971 signs up fresh out of college with the British Ministry of Health to work in a remote Ugandan village and winds up living the high life in the capital city of Kampala,clutched to the turbulent bosom of General Idi Amin(Forest Whitaker). The film is inspired by true events and it is based on the 1998 novel by Giles Foden. Amin,of course,was real,as was his jokey,buffoonish charm,and there was also a sadistic side to him as well....his regime was totally responsible for the brutal slayings of over 300,000 people leaving the country of Uganda is total chaos under his command. He also have a flair and a kitschy love of all things Scottish(He once declared himself the last king of Scotland.) Forest Whitaker's electrifying performance as Amin is one for the ages and this is an actor whose sweet,jovial features counteract his imposing physique and vise versa given two sides to a character who can be good and sadistically evil,creating of curious tension that he fully exploits here. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan(James McAvoy)however,is fictional-though he did have a real-life counterpart in a former British soldier named Bob Astles,who became one of Amin's closest advisors. Fresh out of medical school and reluctant to settle down to a life of stew,sherry,and Presbyterianism,Garrigan has fled Scotland in search of adventure in Africa,which takes him to one of the most dangerous countries in the world-Uganda. Arriving in Uganda on the day of Amin's coup,he is met by Sarah(Gillian Anderson of ""X-Files"" fame),the lonely,tousled wife of the only other doctor in town. Sarah represents just the sort of trouble Nicholas is drawn to-mysterious,complex,and none of his business,and his attraction foreshadows a yet more reckless dalliance.<br/><br/>After a chance encounter that has Nicholas doctoring up Amin's injuries from a car accident,he is offered the job of Amin's personal physician. Soon he's installed in a swanky apartment,hanging out in nightclubs,and speeding through the streets of Kampala in a Mercedes convertible. This was a movie that was shot on location in Scotland and Uganda,the film shows a side of Africa rarely depicted in the movies. Kampala's bustling energy and striking midcentury architecture reflect Nicholas' youthful optimism. But as the movie progresses,the streets becomes cast in a oppressive hush,and the beautiful,futuristic buildings start to look like symbols of the dangers of scorched-earth reinvention. Nicholas' vanity,idealism and lust for adventure make him especially vulnerable to Amin's insidious charm. He willfully ignores early signs of trouble,the better to bask in his new role as the dictator's best friend and confidant,choosing to believe he is helping usher Uganda into its iteration as a free black African nation. Director Kevin Macdonald,who basically specializes in documentaries,captures the energy and exuberance of a young nation in the throes of optimism and works into a foreboding frenzy. As for Forest Whitaker(an actor knows for his impressive work in films such as ""Bird"",""Platoon"",""A Rage In Harlem"",""Jason's Lyric"",""Ghost Dog"",""Species"",""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"",""Good Morning Vietnam"",and not to mention his directorial work in the films ""Waiting To Exhale"" starring Whitney Houston and ""Hope Floats"",starring Sandra Bullock)in the role of Idi Amin,he plunges deep into the psychology of the role,portraying Amin as a sadistic erractic personality who explodes into a galloping paranoia. His strange fascination seems to spark a regression once he is in power and it changes throughout the course of this movie. Nicholas, of course is a child as well,focused on his own thoughtless gratification. He sees the absolute madness before him and knows now what Amin has done. In one scene,one of his lovers(Kerry Washington)reminds him what they face if they're caught. Towards the end,he does escape Uganda alive with his life. A movie worth seeing."
"Dark Raven","4","4","6","26 January 2007"," Boring, uninteresting, flat
","Besides Forrest Whitakers performance there is little else to recommend this very average film. The script lacked a focus and was devoid of any real tension and so the scenes felt flat and uninteresting. Also there is nothing new here that I haven't seen a million times before. The cinematography and camera direction was dull and distracting (camera following Whitakers hand as he talks, despite the fact he Whitakers face is drawing you in with a great performance, the flow gets broken because the camera now decides to follow his hand in close up? wtf?). The music was another thing that didn't fit with the tone. I thought the music in the final scene was going to break into the James Bond theme at one point.<br/><br/>I never really felt anything watching it. To be perfectly honest I was bored most of the time. The main character Garrigan was so unlikeable, with so many of his decisions making him even less likable, that it was hard to route or care for him. Instead Whitaker, playing a man who in real life was an utter monster, came across far more likable and charming in a very weird way. Perhaps this is because we were denied the chance to see and truly feel the atrocities that he was responsible for (save only a few black and white photos) But while one could argue that this was the point of view that Garrigan would have had of Amin, it doesn't help the situation when Garrigan comes across as such a stupid and unlikeable hero."
"hugibert_aldred","9","4","6","18 January 2007"," An intriguing, and brutal insight into the life of Idi Amin!
","I will start by saying that The Last King Of Scotland is a truly fantastic film. There is very little about this film that can be faulted, something I do not easily say.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is an actor who in my opinion has always been on the fringes of the film industry A-list. His earlier performances such as his role in Good Morning Vietnam, and Big Harold in Platoon suggested that he was an actor destined for the top, however since then, he has struggled for any real consistency. He had a few decent roles such as Phone Booth, but until this film, he has never truly given any suggestion that he can be a formidable leading man. His portrayal of Idi Amin however catapults him right up the Hollywood hierarchy, and shows what he is truly capable of.<br/><br/>His performance is spellbinding. He manages to create a character, who is on one hand a charismatic and highly likable man, and on the other, a brutal, almost psychotic killer. He is able to terrify with just a glance, and i mean terrify, but charm you in the same way he does Nicholas Garrigan. I would be very surprised if he does not claim the Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>James McAvoy also deserves considerable praise for his efforts in this film. His change from young carefree student to a man with the wait of the world on his shoulders his impressive. And credit should go to the rest of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>Idi Amin is often a man forgotten about in our modern world, but this film truly depicts what life in Uganda was like under his regime. We see the joy in his appointment to ruler of the country, and it's slow demise, for which credit should go to the writers and director.<br/><br/>This film is not for the faint of heart. There are many brutal scenes, of which I don't want to give away, needless to say that some scenes of violence are shocking. <br/><br/>The Last King Of Scotland is a very good film, and one very much worth seeing. But be warned some parts may distress. 9/10"

","THE LAST KING OF Scotland (2006) ***1/2 Forest Whitaker, James McAvoy, Kerry Washington, Gillian Anderson, Simon McBurney. <br/><br/>Inside a Monster: Whitaker gives a galvanizing Oscar caliber performance.<br/><br/>Idi Amin was a larger than life thug, whose decade long reign of terror in his nation of Uganda during the 1970s may have been given an asterisk in history books for his genocidal tendencies that would make most despots blanch (his involvement of 300,000 fellow countrymen is notorious) and he may pale in comparison to latter-day villainous leaders like Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. However history has a way of repeating itself and on cinema, history lasts forever.<br/><br/>Amin's rise to power is seen from the unblinking, na√Øve eyes of a young (fictitious) Scotsman named Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy in a strong difficult role), a recent medical student grad who on a whim decides to leave his homeland for the first place his finger lands on his spinning globe (well, really second, after the primo decision of Canada apparently held no sway of adventure) to make a break from his unmoored existence.<br/><br/>Once there the good doctor is ensconced in the tumultuous African nation under a military coup de tat by Amin that eventually lands Garrigan an audience with the imposing, garrulous man himself (Whitaker, in a towering career best and a front-runner on the short- list for the Academy Awards this year), when after attending a crowd-pleasing speech with his fellow doctor Sarah Merritt (Anderson in an underused role), they encounter a road delay on their journey back to their camp. It is here that Amin's entourage has struck a farmer's ox and Amin has sustained a hand injury. Garrigan is hustled over to the stricken leader who shows his scary side, barking orders to his men, while the dying animal bleats in the scorching sun. Like an Aesop fable of the lion and the mouse, Garrigan fixes the wound and then when he can no longer bear it, takes Amin's pistol and kills the animal ending its misery. Angered and shocked at this impromptu command of power Amin hovers over the smaller man and then does something equally surprising: offers the young Scot a permanent position as his personal physician. When Amin learns Garrigan is indeed from Scotland ¬ñ Amin a renowned lover of all things Scottish ¬ñ offers the medic his ribbon-festooned shirt in exchange for the soccer t-shirt Garrigan is wearing. The deal with the devil has been made.<br/><br/>What follows is the idealistic yet amazingly blind-sided by power doctor is suddenly thrust into the corridors of the Amin regime unknowingly to the ongoing slaughtering of the Ugandans and his administration suddenly 'missing'. As Garrigan becomes deeper and deeper into a de facto friendship with the charming yet paranoid chieftain it suddenly dawns on him that Amin is indeed a ruthless dictator and the desire to return home is only further diminished. <br/><br/>To add fuel to the fire Garrigan is enamored of Amin's youngest wife Kay (ethereal Washington), the third spouse of Amin's, who is pretty much neglected by her husband and when Garrigan gets too close to the fire, the source only begins to heat up the inevitable downfall.<br/><br/>Written by Jeremy Brock, Peter Morgan and Joe Penhall, adapting the novel by Giles Foden, the screenplay focuses more on the gullible doctor than the rule of Amin until its climax but it is a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a monster and how the curdled charisma of this horrific ruler managed to fool much of the Western world. Whitaker's top drawer turn as Amin is amazing, with his imposing bulk, crocodile smile and on-a-dime turn from laughter to unbridled anger is a goose-bump inducing performance counterbalanced by the ballsy and ultimately sympathetic performance by McAvoy; the chemistry between the two actors is hypnotic in the same way as watching a train wreck in slo-motion.<br/><br/>Director Kevin Macdonald keeps the pace going at a ready clip and wisely allows his actors breathing room from one set-up to the next and gives it a you-are-there vibe to the proceedings at hand.<br/><br/>But once again it Forest Whitaker who richly deserves all accolades come awards season for making a monster into a human being and back again in the blink of an eye; no easy feat by any means."

","Africa throws up a great deal of modern dictators, but Amin was something else by any standards. In this film we get a great actorly cameo of him, though surprisingly little about Uganda. But we do get to know about a fictitious Scotsman.<br/><br/>On retrospect, a film about Idi Amin was never going to be very good if after 15 minutes our Scotsman anti-hero, the observer device for the film, was still wasting time with another non character whose entire part could have been removed.<br/><br/>In the excellent Downfall, we get to see a troubled Hitler - but the writer gets right with the man himself and the people round him. No time is wasted on those not relevant to helping the audience understand.<br/><br/>I know Forest Whittaker is a great actor, and this role was clearly one he relished. Its a pity that the director felt that the other characters had to be one dimensional for the film to work. Is that how they thought Amin came to power? For a film about Idi Amin, it could have done with a bit more about Idi Amin. In the end our Scotsman anti-hero soaks up so much time that one feels sorry he's has a holiday ruined by some silly black dictator. Should have gone to Club 18-30."

"Cristi_Ciopron","3","3","5","17 August 2008"," An ordinary piece of slapdash
","The biggest mistake of this wrong movie is that it's about Garrigan, young man that is in turns uninteresting, insipid and annoying. The movie is not about Idi, but about a brainless physician that has a preference for others' wives. The character is so uninteresting and flat, and it is so uninterestingly portrayed (the problem is not with making films about uninteresting common people, but in making blatantly uninteresting films about uninteresting people ¬Ö) that this rudimentary portray of a boring, dull, shallow young man, deprived of any charm or wit, is absolutely null. I do not understand how this dull movie could be mistaken for a political movie or for a biopic¬óit is not a film about a man's way in politics, and it is not a biopic about Amin. Garrigan's small time idylls with married women in Africa is below any narrative merit.<br/><br/>Not one portrayal is successful. Another piece of slapdash, hollow, without any artistic interest,made by one of the imbeciles empowered as directors. It completely lacks the gusto, the true inner dynamism (not its ridiculous mechanical counterfeiting). Among the many flicks about an exotic country in political crisis, with a Caucasian jeopardized, THE LAST KING ¬Ö ranks among the worst. Briefly,it has nothing to say. Why did they presume that Garrigan is of any interest, when he is a pathetic dolt, uninterestingly, even annoyingly portrayed? He's no Sorel, to be sure. He's a small time adventurer, profoundly insipid, who flirts with politics. It's by far the worst kind of schmaltz ¬ñthe political exploitation. I could not detect any artistic intention, any idea about the subject¬óonly the trite exploits of an uninteresting Scottish physician. The flick is remarkably poor¬ópoor as action, as characterizations, as ideas. Not one character is even remotely interesting. The sex scenes are the only things quite enjoyable. The flick was poorly conceived. Macdonald is no Costa Gavras.<br/><br/>Having no dramatic content, THE LAST ¬Ö is less interesting than a good documentary. The real Amin in the final footage is more interesting than FW's impersonation. The impression left is that Macdonald had nothing to say with his flick. Another anaerobic movie. Everything is pretty phony and banal."
"sddavis63","7","3","5","1 October 2007"," A Fictional Story Offers A Glimpse Of Reality
","I've been intrigued by ""The Last King Of Scotland"" for some time and have finally had the opportunity to view it. The movie is an adaptation of a novel offering the fictionalized story of a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy) who becomes personal physician to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, and we see the descent of that country into a brutal nightmare through his eyes. The movie is for the most part well done, and I wanted to mention a couple of highlights for me.<br/><br/>First is the performance of Forrest Whittaker playing Amin. I have to confess that I've never been totally captured by Whittaker as an actor for whatever reason, but in this, he nailed the part. I've often thought of Amin as having been a simple, brutal thug-like creature, and yet Whittaker is able to capture the complexities of the man quite well. Sometimes a childish prankster, often a brutal sadist, always the showman, and increasingly paranoid as time goes on - Whittaker captured all of that. It was a very impressive performance in what must have been a difficult role. The other thing I truly appreciated was the way the reality of Amin's reign was believably woven into the fictional storyline, as the country moves from rejoicing over his seizure of power to terror at his hands. There are a couple of scenes where the violence of the regime is portrayed quite graphically, but for the most part it's the sense of terror that really fills the movie and moves it along and makes it work.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the movie was the fictional storyline that weaves everything together. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan ends up as Amin's personal physician in what I thought was an implausible manner - even given the unpredictability of Amin's nature. That very implausibility made it difficult to take this movie too seriously, even given the strong points I mention above. That doesn't make this a bad movie - it's a very good movie, but it does take away a little bit from it. Having said that, the best line of the movie - and what probably sums Amin up as well as anyone could - belongs to Garrigan. Beaten, and about to be brutally tortured, Garrigan looks at Amin and says ""you're a child, and that's what makes you so f***ing scary!"" Overall, I'd rate this as a 7/10."
"ThrownMuse","7","3","5","6 June 2007"," Fascinating characters study that falls short in a few places.
","This is a tricky one. There's no denying that Whitaker gives a larger-than-life performance worthy of every accolade he has been given (though it's debatable if he is indeed the Lead Actor in the film.) The film is much more entertaining than I expected, given the subject matter. However, I'm not sure how successful the narrative fares as seen through the eyes of the fictional Scottish doctor (James McAvoy.) There's lots of comic relief that seemed out of place to me, and some subplots where I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. But overall, it's a good and thought-provoking movie with excellent performances all around (including Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington in support roles.) On a sidenote, the camera seems to be in love with James McAvoy's body. I don't find him attractive, but it's good to see a film where the director isn't gender-biased in terms of showing nudity."

","While I found ""The Last King of Scotland"" to be an entertaining movie with a superb lead performance from James McAvoy and supporting performance from Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin, I left the theatre wanting to learn more about the lead character of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan. I wanted to know where he was today, and if the movie was based on his actual memoirs. Well, imagine my surprise when I found out that his character NEVER REALLY EXISTED!!!! I felt so used! Then I wondered just how much of the movie was twisted to show the evils of Amin. Many know the real history of what happened in Uganda, and this is not it. The real story is even more horrifying than anything that was shown in this movie, and that's the big let down of it all. If they could've told the real story, without the fictional characters and situations, this movie would have been so much more powerful. As it is, it leaves you wondering what is real and what is not, and I, for one, felt used."

","Much has been said about the claustrophobia here and the constant latent threat. I don't find it really. It's of course a great performance by Forest Whitaker, but how difficult is it really to play a thug? It doesn't take that much for a trained skilled actor.<br/><br/>From the beginning to the end, it's a rather conventional thriller about the young Scottish doctor who is hired by Ugandian dictator Idi Amin. The doctor is naive, but learns more and more about destructive politics in Uganda and about his own more and more destructive situation.<br/><br/>The main line here is of course someone saying to the doctor that he hasn't experienced anything real. That's true, but goes somewhat for this picture as well."
"omar-99","5","3","5","16 February 2007"," Huge Disappointment - Sharad Patel's Exploitation Classic Far Superior
","A film i had been anticipating keenly ever since i heard of it when it played at Toronto last September or so and drew rave reviews for Forrest Whittaker in particular in the role of Ugandan Dictator Idi Amin. I am afraid, Whittaker was almost bordering on embarrassing and his flapping his arms around and trying to pout like a gorilla were just buffoonery. He is nothing like Amin was, unrecognisable. The best portrayal of Amin has been by Joseph Olita in the exploitation classic Rise and Fall of Idi Amin - now there was a man so convincing as Amin that it was not actually difficult to believe that it was in fact the man himself. Forrest Whittakers take was a little akin to the Black and White Minstrel show - with grinning golliwogs behaving in a very stereotypical and offensive manner. For those of you unfamiliar with Amin and Uganda, this film will probably be the ticket but for those of you who are already familiar with Amin and his ways and a smattering of regional history, the film is very weak indeed. Yes i can find something positive to say........the songs used in the background to the most part are simply brilliant afro-funk..........question is, where is the soundtrack."
"ClayDeaver","6","3","5","5 February 2007"," Frightening realism
","Although I was certainly glued to the screen and it had my attention so did the last shark I saw and I wasn't very comfortable with the shark either.The acting was great and the locations and costumes were very believable but apparently it wasn't meant to leave me with any sort of a comfortable feeling or a feeling that the soul somehow triumphs over the sort of adversity of being an impoverished people living under an evil dictatorship.Their lives are mostly tragic it seems. The film depicts a realistic depiction of how the main character gets seduced by the dark and powerful side if you will in a very smooth manner. Forest Whitaker was great as Idi Amin, but how much can you say about the character of Idi, personally I didn't see any redeeming value in his character. And James McAvoy as the doctor, was really depicted as a degenerating character himself, who seems to have a bit of redemption on the way but certainly nothing that would give anyone a glow at the end of the film.I think the film was well done and although probably accurate, other than reaffirming that yes Idi Amin was a really bad egg just as we thought and treated his people very badly I fail to see it's purpose. Hopefully the film is making money and driving the economy, that would at least serve as something positive. So although Forerst Whitaker portrays the Evil Idi as a Charismatic leader and truly lights up the screen I failed to see much value in it. But hey give it a chance although I wouldn't take a girlfriend or the kids. Personally I didn't sleep well afterward"

","Idi Amin is one of those figures that only a handful of people know about: all I knew was that he was a ruthless dictator in the seventies of some African country who murdered thousands of his own countrymen (and women). I knew that he was African, chubby and wore a banana-republic-looking uniform with medals. And when I saw Forest Whitaker in the role of Amin, I thought that it was just uncanny and chilling. Whenever Forest was on screen, I felt almost as if I should be answering to him as well as James McAvoy's character was; as if I was standing alongside him. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is an independent gem of a film. Actual film footage is cleverly insinuated into parts of the film that was made on limited means (like most real good dramas are).<br/><br/>The premise is simple: young idealistic doctor in early seventies wants to make a difference in his life and that of others by benevolently choosing a third-world country (in this case Uganda). Sets up camp there and boards with unlucky and insignificant others until meeting rich and charismatic dictator by chance. Dictator offers him job as personal physician and adviser- is seduced by charms of the ""good life"". Until seeing the brutality firsthand- wants out now. Dictator makes it known to him that he cannot leave and that he is committed to his promise. Dilemma-disaster, dilemma-disaster...Perhaps this slight-of-the-numbers plot line plays out so successfully because Whittaker's overall performance as Amin that portrays him as three-dimensional, mercurial and downright scary. There is always tension after he enters the picture just by his own unpredictable presence. McAvoy is fine as the Scottish doctor in this (and will probably become the next Ewan McGregor in a few years) along with Kerry Washington (who was hardly noticeable from Spike Lee's ""She Hate Me"") and Gillian Anderson (whom I hardly recognized as well until she gave that Dana Scully-stare in certain shots- I'm not sure if she ages well, but her beauty still seemed to be intact). A very well-made film that combines the ubiquitous actual events with fiction (although I read that Amin actually did have a Scottish doctor at one time) and Amin's unpopular international opinion is cleverly ingratiated through the protagonist by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Whether you are a history buff or not, Forest Whitaker's performance makes the film worth watching on its own. I am surprised to see that Whitaker has been nominated for Best Actor this year (and I think he deserves the Oscar over someone like, oh- let me think- ""Leonardo DiCaprio."" This motion picture leaves you with a more powerful impression since Uganda was only addressed in a paragraph or two in the newspapers back in the seventies and early eighties. This is a film that will leave one feeling more appreciative that they live in a country unlike Uganda or Somalia where constant violence and revolution is commonplace and people like Amin are a dime-a-dozen."

","Yes, everything you've heard about Forest Whitaker's career-defining role as former Ugandan president/dictator Idi Amin is true. The Oscar is in the bag. But let me be the first to tell you that his co-star James McAvoy (playing a young Scottish doctor who becomes the president's personal physician) is a scene-stealer as well. McAvoy's character, Nicholas Garrigan, comes to Africa with the most unselfish intentions possible but is lucky to leave with his life. His charm and appeal, however, never fades.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is about more than a murderous African dictator or another African genocide. It's about the long and short-term affects of colonialism. The British Empire had the biggest hand in carving up the continent of Africa in the 19th century, and British weapons and funds put Amin in power in 1970, so how much really changed in a hundred years? It's terrifying, grotesque, and haunting, but there are unexpected moments of comedy and humanity, and come Oscar season, you're going to wish you saw that film that everyone will be talking about."

Also, James McAvoy should also be recognized and applauded for his performance as Nicholas Garrigan (Idi's closest adviser).

There is no question about Amin, however."

Thus those who filed in for a bona fide history lesson subsequently either got angry or plain disappointed.<br/><br/>Propelled by Forest Whitaker's barnstorming Oscar winning perf as Amin, Last King of Scotland is riveting and fascinating from first reel to last. The political upheaval at this time in Uganda's history is presented in delicate strokes of dark depressing realisations, and also that of uneasy humour.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Amin is most complex, part man child, part greenhorn political suitor and one heartbeat away from despotic lunacy, with Whitaker nailing every single tick. It's key to note that the film does shed some light on Amin, so as a character study it soars and holds you enthral throughout.<br/><br/>Director Kevin Macdonald films in kinetic style, which is perfect for the material to hand, and he also deserves a pat on the back for ensuring the characters around Amin (circle of family/advisors etc) are a constant intrigue as per Amin's agenda machinations. James McAvoy gives sterling support as the key ""fish out of water"" doctor who Amin takes to his bosom, while Kerry Washington as Amin's wife number 3 also strikes the right emotive notes.<br/><br/>The finale falters somewhat, where it encompasses the Entebbe Hostage Crisis but fails to do that incident justice - instead using it as a cypher to have us rooting for McAvoy's made up character to get out of harm's way. But this is just a misstep that's not film defining. For this is a fine film, if it's not jolting you with harrowing scenes, or tickling your brain for education purpose, then it's demanding your attention for historical noting. Job done. 8.5/10"

Its a bit like Will Smith ..when he played Mohammed Ali..simply not good enough. James McAvoy does a good job as the naive Scottish Doctor who goes to Uganda for some fun, and finds a nightmarish ""Political system"".

","FIrst of all, I should start by saying I had very little knowledge of the real-life events on which this film is based prior to my viewing. This film truly has the audience gripped in the story of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan from the very moment he steps foot in Uganda. Although the character can be rather unlikeable at times and seem a little selfish, one can really find oneself investing in the character and hoping for his wellbeing when things go awry. The color palette of it also really helps to capture the feeling of Africa and specifically Uganda.<br/><br/>However, it is the fantastic performance of Forest Whitaker that really steals this show. Forest's portrayal of the Ugandan leader Idi Amin is both breathtaking and captivating. Whitaker manages to capture the subtleties of the character while still making the character an imposing and larger than life man, thereby creating a believably psychotic character. <br/><br/>Although there are a few very minor plot holes and the introduction of a character that leads to no pay off, there is not much to complain about in this film.

","Now I know this film has been around for a while now and I'am ashamed that its taken me such a long time to get around and watch it, but here is my review...<br/><br/>Plot Summary Based on the book of the same name, written by author Giles Foden, this is the story of a young Scottish doctor who travels to Uganda to help local communities and ends up getting stuck right in the middle of Idi Amin's Regime.<br/><br/>What I thought of it Having seen old reviews of this film I did have an idea of what I was in for when I pulled it out of my collection and sat down to watch it, yet it still impressed me.<br/><br/>I must admit that before watching this film I did do a bit of research into the subject just to get an idea of the setting and history etc.<br/><br/>I am very pleased to say that director Kevin McDonald has done a very good job of getting Idi Amin's true behaviour and methods across onto film with sensational acting from Forest Whitaker. I had no doubt that Forest Whitaker would do brilliantly in this role as he has in the past but he really does give, in my eyes, an Oscar winning performance matched only by that of James McAvoy who played Amin's physician.<br/><br/>On a whole the acting in this film is of a very high standard as is work of the director and the whole crew. Everything from locations to editing have been done well and add a great feel to the film.<br/><br/>The only bad things I will say is that in the film, we don't really get a great idea of what the people of Uganda were going through at this time, the violence and such that they were living in, which I feel is a great shame as this really would have made our feelings towards Idi Amin and the countries people much stronger, whether they be good or bad.<br/><br/>In Summary Overall I think this is a truly brilliant film in both story and acting, the cast, specifically Forest Whitaker really knew there role well and played on this fantastically, giving great insight into the life of Idi Amin and his closest friends and colleagues.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to all, a definite must-see film.....7/10 Stars"
"Lejink","6","2","3","24 September 2007"," Tartan army tale
","Gripping but incongruous movie, juxtaposing a naive, opportunistic and above all else randy young fictional Scottish doctor, played with brio by newcomer James McAvoy - nice to hear a real Scottish accent for a change (are you listening Johnny Depp?), as counterpoint to too-true-to-life despot and dictator Idi Amin. Amin is up there (or should that be down there) with fellow tyrants like Pol Pot and Mugabe in committing heinous sins against his own people, and Forrest Whitaker brings out the child-like monster of his character at one moment enjoying a football kickabout the next ordering the torture and disappearance of imagined political rivals. The film is carried by the two leads, both excellent but I found the grafting on of the fictional thriller-type escape of McAvoy at the end out of synch with the truthfully exposed brutalities of Amin. You care more for the thousands of Ugandans you know died during Amin's bloody reign than for a made-up character ultimately symbolic of nothing. A similar ploy was engaged in the recent TV mini - series ""Rome"" where it seemed to work much better in my view but nevertheless this is a brave film on a difficult subject shedding light on yet another 20th century monster ""of the people"". Mr Mugabe are you watching?"
"the_Poppuns","9","2","3","15 August 2007"," Whitaker was Supporting
","I can't believe I never heard any controversy about that. His role was clearly a supporting role in the film. I would have complained during Oscar time but the film wasn't released near me so I didn't see until now. But anyway... I thought the film was great. And not just for his performance which was great but also slightly overrated. James McAvoy did a wonderful job too and I don't think I heard anything about his performance. Sometimes I wonder how much viewers take into a movie about a well known figure and then give the movie or performance credit for their own memories. Because I don't know this Amin guy. I was a little kid at the time. So I didn't have anything to hold him up against. But I'm thinking McAvoy maybe got ignored a little because of that. <br/><br/>About the story itself what I found interesting was how similar the two characters were. I don't think either of them wanted to be defined by where they came from. Garrigan wanted to be Scottish but not British which got him into trouble, and I don't think Amin wanted to be like his fellow villagers which seemed obvious in the torture scene. And speaking of that, I thought this movie was grosser than Hostel. I'm sick of horror movies getting discarded out of hand because they have violent images and then seeing a movie with even more violent images that you never hear about. This movie has two insanely disturbing scenes in it. If you're at all squeamish, prepare yourself.<br/><br/>I thought the film was really great. It has the suspense of a thriller but Oscar caliber performances too. I probably would have given it a 10 if I was more of a fan of politics."
"ctc-5","4","2","3","28 April 2007"," Interesting just by virtue of the subject matter
","For a movie theoretically about one of the twentieth centuries most disturbing dictatorships, The Last King of Scotland is surprisingly lighthearted. The movie is bogged down with all too frequent lawn-party scenes, which have the feel of a Disney Land style attraction, mixing stereotypical elements of traditional African culture with Hawiian shirts, aviator sunglasses and formalistic sounding seventies hard-rock. The use of staples of western consumer culture (the Mercedes Benz given to Nicholas, pool parties, screaming wah-wah guitar solos) and home-video style feel, are perhaps intended to create a juxtaposition with the reality of Amin's regime. Yet the viewer is never really shown the dark reality of genocide. The actual genocide is reduced to a couple of photographs shown to Garrigan ( the doctor through whom the story is told) and a 1-min. montage. Director Kevin MacDonald's purpose is clear enough- to show a facet of Amin apart from the angle picked up upon in history books. Instead of seeing Amin shouting at the dismembered head of his disposed prime minister, we see him playing the accordion. Garrigan even tells him at one point: ""You're just a child. That's what makes you so scary."" The problem is that he is overwhelmingly charismatic; there aren't enough scenes where he becomes genuinely frightening. Perhaps that is the point, to challenge our expectations and preconceptions- yet it nonetheless feels like a sham to portray the leader of a genocide as altogether a sympathetic figure. Part of the reason why the movie fails in this respect, is the general weakness of the Garrigan as Amin's personal physician story line. For starters, Garrigan (James McAvoy) is embarrassingly naive. Amin tells him, ""You came to Africa to play the white man,"" an indictment which rings very true (although this is partially because Africa as represented feels wholly western, but that's beside the point). For all of Garrigan's talk about 'wating to affect the world,' and 'to make a difference,' he comes across as extremely shallow, with a childishness to match Amin's. Except his childishness is mixed with airs of superiority. He seems most unbelievable when he attempts to become serious: when he shoots the cow (to prove his sensitivity to suffering, presumably), the affair with Amin's wife, when he stands up for a patient against when of Amin's thugs, His shock at hearing about the genocide (300,000 people were killed and he had no idea?!?), etc... In telling the story through his character, it seems as though it should follow some sort of curve: his initial acceptance of Amin as a positive change for Uganda, his growing realization of the truth, and then his eventual renunciation and betrayal of Amin. And to an extent the movie does follow that curve- but it's ultimately unsuccessful, because his character doesn't foster any feelings of sympathy and secondly because his break with Amin is so sudden and predictably carried out as an extension of his affair with Amin's wife. Whitaker's performance does live up to the hype surrounding it- it is dragged down by rest of the film, but his mannerisms as Amin are something to behold."
"sebadee","7","2","3","28 February 2007"," Beware of the blurring of lines between fiction and reality!
","The most important element of this film is the disclaimer that precedes the action. It says that the film is BASED on real people and real events. Idi Amin was a real person; Garrigan was not. Giles Foden - on whose book this film is based - uses the fictional Garrigan as a device to reveal his portrait of Amin.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is excellent in the role but I could not get past the fact that it was an actor - a very good one - giving a performance. Try as I might but I could not find him scary. For me Whitaker's humanity shines through. What has been a strength in other performances is a weakness here. Wait until the end for footage of the REAL Amin for a truly terrifying glimpse of controlled madness.<br/><br/>James McAvoy too is excellent. There's glory in portraying an evil despot but little in playing his fool! In a way McAvoy's is a much braver performance than Whitaker's. In all, a very good film but beware of the blurring of lines between fiction and reality!"

","The characters are excellently played √Ç‚Äì the sweet, naive, and rather clumsy Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, the brutal giant baby, Idi Amin, and the other characters surrounding Ugandas Big Leader! A political, historical narrative most likely mixed with a great deal of fiction. But the story took place for real, and the film brilliantly shows why the people cheered the new leader, and why they celebrated his fall later on.<br/><br/>The film also shows the impossibility in doing things right when you have dedicated you self to a sick man who grew up in a brutal society.<br/><br/>The film makes me want to know more about Uganda and Idi Amin!"
"judywalker2","8","2","3","22 January 2007"," Good Movie in General
","I went to this movie specifically to see the performance of Forrest Whitaker and came away liking all of the other performances too. Forrest did a fantastic job playing Idi Amin. He captured his mannerisms and personality to a tea. The young doctor was very good too and his character of course is written in such a way that you dislike him but grow to feel sorry for him as the movie progresses. I personally thought that Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington were mostly wasted in this movie with the same macho, male silliness that is always prescribed to women in these movies. They don't just fall into bed with the first man that is nice to them and I wish Hollywood would start recognizing that it turns the female audience off immediately. The violence was a little excessive, everyone know that Amin regimen killed people and it would have been nice if they had focused more on what made the man."
"gsygsy","8","2","3","22 January 2007"," excellent political thriller
","Essentially a political thriller, this movie is also a warning against easy idealism. In a small way, the warning chafes against the more conventional thriller aspect, at least in the closing quarter of an hour. Never mind that: this is otherwise a well-written film with excellent production values. The photography is particularly good - not overly glossy in the way that so many such films are, and with a real sense of the atmosphere of Uganda. The editing is also very fine. And the acting is terrific. McAvoy makes a believable journey from cocky youth through accidental henchman to guilt-ridden victim. Whitaker is breathtakingly good as Amin - charm one moment, terror the next, taking you off guard. If he doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, there's no justice. Actually the Oscar lot are generally good about rewarding actors playing people who actually lived, so he's in with a good chance, despite his movie-makers' attempt to undermine his performance in the final moments of the film by showing pictures of the real Amin. Fortunately Whitaker is so amazing that the attempt fails completely. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is also first-rate, as witnessed by the ever-subtle, ever-enigmatic Gillian Anderson - what a superb artist she is!"
"franaiken","9","2","3","13 January 2007"," gruesome but great!
","The film gripped me throughout - the links to historical events I remember such as the Asians being thrown out made the horror of the regime more real for me. The blood and death depicted in the film was certainly not gratuitous. The only issue for me was the ending which seemed to be tacked on to add a dramatic end but didn't ring true. Whitaker certainly lived up to the praise he has received but to me McAvoy who I've admired since he was in Shameless had more subtle characterisation and therefore a harder part to play which he did amazingly. Can't wait to see him again and I hope he gets more challenging roles like this one."

","I grabbed the DVD the moment I saw it on the shelf of the store and watched it at the first opportunity - wouldn't want to miss this year's Best Actor whose wins are almost (but not quite) as overwhelming as Helen Mirren's.<br/><br/>The movie is not entirely as I expected. Despite what some critics had me believing, the mood of the movie is light (almost jovial) way past the first half, and it's only in the last 15 minutes of the two-hour movie when the blood-chilling images appear. Indeed, in the end credits, the audience is shown the monstrosity of the dictator whom many consider insane. But throughout most of the movie, he is portrayed in a sympathetic manner. Strangely, this movie reminds me of Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"". Marie Antoinette denies having said ""Let them eat cake"" in almost the same breath as Idi Amin denies having practiced cannibalism - so the movies show, without either confirming or disproving what has been said.<br/><br/>A role like Idi Amin provides the portrayer great opportunities to shine, and Forest Whitaker has certainly risen to the occasion. However, I shall reserve judgment of whether he deserves this year's Oscar until I have seen Peter O'Toole in ""Venus""."

The appalling massacres and brutal reign of Idi Amin are downplayed.

Yes, he is cute and slightly eccentric, but I felt absolutely no emotional engagement with him and that, for me was the fatal flaw. Yes, he is swept away into the moneyed world of Amin but there is no character development to make you care one way or the other.<br/><br/>Even at the ending, which I won't reveal, I was left shrugging.

","Less wooden than ""Hotel Rwanda"", but neither movie really does justice to the nightmare of Africa.<br/><br/>Movie revolves around Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scotsman who becomes personal doctor to the mass murderer Idi Amin. Evidently, Garrigan is an idiot because he does not perceive the human misery all around him until other people (one of Amin's wives and another doctor) tell him. Furthermore, as Amin's personal doctor, Garrigan is supposed be doing something to improve healthcare for all Uganda, but he seems strangely untroubled by the fact that he never does any of that work. Since we see Uganda mainly through Garrigan's eyes, we only start to feel a bit of the horror of Amin's Uganda towards the end.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is Forest Whitaker. I have seen Whitaker in other movies and he seems to be a sympathetic and likable man, but his performance as Amin is inexplicable until you hear him interviewed in the special features section of the DVD. Whitaker is obviously confused about Amin. I.e., Amin talked of Ugandan, and African, freedom from colonialism, and he was a funny figure, offering aid to England and other such nonsense. At the time, lots of people lapped up that sort of thing. Oh yea, some 80,000 Asians were made destitute by their expulsion from Uganda---and they were the lucky ones since Amin proceeded to ruin the economy, slaughter about 300,000 Ugandans, and terrorize the rest in a decade of butchery.<br/><br/>Maybe some people did not realize the full magnitude of the Ugandan horror, at that time, but Whitaker has no excuse. Listening to Whitaker's sympathetic comments about Amin was quite like listening to someone make excuses for Hitler or Stalin or Pol Pot. It is shocking and demoralizing. And, it is also an explanation, I think, for why the movie is missing a lot of the vibrancy it could have had.<br/><br/>I should add that a few other people, both Ugandan and English, who are involved in making the film and who are interviewed in the special features section of the DVD, seem similarly ambivalent about mass murder and the mass murderers who perpetrate it. It is inexplicable. Fortunately, several interviewees do not suffer from this moral blindness, but the damage is done.<br/><br/>A really great movie about Africa remains to be made."

"DICK STEEL","8","3","6","27 January 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Last King of Scotland
","The first Forest Whitaker movie I watched was Blown Away, which starred Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, one of two ""bomb-maker"" movies in 1994 (the other being the more successful Speed). And since then, he's been one of my favourite character actors, chalking up a diverse filmography, although some in largely supporting roles in the movies that made its way here (Panic Room, Phone Booth, etc). This year, he is widely touted to win that Oscar for his role as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland.<br/><br/>You cannot deny Whitaker's sheer enigmatic presence on screen, even though his size makes him hard to miss. Despite playing a less than savoury character, Whitaker brings about certain charisma to his role, and makes it believable that the masses adore their new leader rising from a coup. Switching from the man who's contended with everything, and earnestly believing he can delivery the country from the doldrums, to one obsessed with power, and consumed by madness, inconsistencies, and suspicion, Whitaker does it all and showcases his spectrum of abilities convincingly.<br/><br/>However, this biopic of sorts comes from the point of view of Idi Amin's personal physician, Scotsman Dr Nicholas Garrigan (played by James McAvoy), recent graduate, and still finding the meaning to his existence, which led to his arrival in Uganda. McAvoy starred in last year's Chronicles of Narnia as the Faun, and I've seen him as Leto Atreides II in the made for television series Children of Dune. Here, his Garrigan is the confused young adult, suddenly thrust into position of envy, power and privilege as part of the small circle of trust Amin keeps, and is no goody two shoes with his inability to keep his lustful thoughts just thoughts alone.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Giles Foden, The Last King of Scotland (find out why) has a fairly simple narrative from start to end, bringing Dr Garrigan into Uganda just as Idi Amin seizes power, and from a chance meeting, gains Amin's trust and gets appointed albeit reluctantly at first as his personal and family physician, given promises of running hospitals and drafting out health plans for the country. And slowly, as their relationship evolves, Garrigan finds out the truth about the volatility of the dictator, as he battles consequences of his lusty actions, and tries to find a way out of the madness.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note that it was the posse of western powers who installed Idi Amin as ruler, and also the same powers that be who tries to control a live wire to do their bidding, like a puppet master having total control of his puppet, only to have the puppet fight back. A similar relationship between Amin and Garrigan also exist. And when you get too powerful or influential, expect the masters to try and take some drastic measures, using whatever means to meet the end. Lies and deceit, cunningness and strategy to stay alive, all these are experienced by the two men.<br/><br/>Adding some balance to the level of testosterone, there are two supporting female cast in Kerry Washington as one of Amin's wives, and Gillian Anderson as the object of Garrigan's desire. Though both actress had much less to do in the movie, it was indeed a long time since I've seen Anderson in a movie, I believe the last was the X-Files movie. Basically flower vase roles here, with a standard performance which warrants nothing to shout about.<br/><br/>The real star of the movie is nonetheless Forest Whitaker, though is there any statistic saying a vivid performance of a ""villain"" will warrant less of a chance for an Oscar win? I recall Denzel Washington winning it for Training Day as the villain, but then again, that character is fictional, unlike this one which is based on a real person, whose activities are frowned upon by the west? One figures, but I'm still putting my bets on Whitaker."

I first read about Idi Amin Dada in the mid-1970's. It was, to say the least, an appalling revelation. Amin was- sad to say- the quintessential politician. In one account, a cruise ship was prevented from continuing downriver because crocodiles had eaten their fill of the bodies clogging the mouth of the river and the excess had caused an importune blockage. Drat the luck. And with international correspondents on board, too... The filmmakers responsible for this travesty should hang their heads in shame.

","Lots of buzz about Forest Whitaker made this a must see. The rehabilitation of Idi Amin would be a tough sell for the poster child of evil African dictator. An amateur pugilist he was rumored to have dealt death sentences personally. Clearly much too much larger than life to render meaningfully into a two hour film. Kevin Macdonald does his cause little service by having us divide our focus with a dilettante child doctor. James McAvoy is easy to watch but the character he is asked to play is so thin and poorly drawn as to be little more than distraction. I turned to my friend when our young doctor decides to sleep with Amin's number three wife and asked, ""is any one that stupid?"" She answered correctly, "" young boys."" I heard that once before from a woman priest describing a male colleague working his girlfriend's gams into a sermon. We do some pretty amazing things when in the clutch of testosterone. Nonetheless, it was too much to ask that we believe even a Scottish rake would risk torture and death for a roll in the hay. Come to think of it, Gillian Anderson (Scully from the X-Files) playing a sunbleached British nurse could get me to risk much. But I digress. As did The Last King of Scotland. Too often Amin's maniacal behavior was foreshadowed and too often we knew what was coming. The raid on Entebbe even made an appearance. We were asked to believe a Scottish doctor was smuggled out on the Gentile plane that left early on in the stand-off between Palestinian hijackers and the Israeli government. The Last King had a Readers Digest feel to it, extra large type and condensed to the point of a PowerPoint presentation.<br/><br/>What is it about sub-Saharan Africa that attracts such monumental evil? 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives under Amin, more than that were hacked to death in the eighties when the Hutu and Tutsi's went at it. Several hundred thousand are dead and dying under Sudanese rule. We cluck our tongue and bemoan the price of gas. What do we say to our children? We were too busy adjusting our 401K to do anything?"

Forest Whitaker does an outstanding job portraying the nutbag, egocentric tyrant. But, in typical Hollywood storytelling, he's just a side character.<br/><br/>The real story concerns the moral dilemmas faced by the fictional Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrison, who befriends Amin and ends up in the bear cage. James McAvoy does a great job playing this character, he's a very fine actor, but I have to admit, the contrived storyline ends up being a negative for the film. I wound up investing a lot of time and compassion for this naive and torn character, yet later I found out he was an entirely fictional creation, and it was really a let-down.<br/><br/>It's one thing to invent a character to ease in the telling of a story, this is done all the time. But to invent the lead role, and make the primary role of interest the secondary role, just cheats the audience immensely.<br/><br/>Personally, I think they invented a white character to make the film marketable. The filmmakers should have learned from the excellent Hotel Rwanda, such a thing is not necessary. But, alas, the producers are still stuck in the stone age ...<br/><br/>Fine performances all around, including not only Whitaker and McAvoy, but the cadre of supporting *black* actors who give tremendous performances in everything from Ministers of Health to neglected wives to lounge singers really makes this film great.<br/><br/>8 out of 10, two points taken off for the contrived plot line.<br/><br/>Barky"

","I watched this movie many years after it was released - having heard about it from so many people. I also thought that there was a fair bit of media buzz created when this movie was released. Although Forest Whitaker's performance was good, it was kind of overdone at times and wasn't too much to write home about. Having read so much about Uganda and Idi Amin, it is laughable how historically inaccurate this movie is. Most people would brush this off by saying ""hey its just a movie"". But its more than that, its a piece of history that was conveniently altered by Hollywood to create sensationalism. This movie will in no way help the millions of people around the world who have no clue about the history of Idi Amin. There is a lot of unnecessary drama in the movie that takes the focus away from the main historical events. Idi Amin was a psychotic monster in real life, but in the movie he appeared remarkably sane. Whitaker failed to communicate the fear and bone-chilling aura of one of the most brutal African dictators in modern times. The performances of the other actors were mediocre at best. <br/><br/>The character of Nicholas Garrigan is totally fictional. There was no white doctor who Amin was ever so close to, and no white man ever had an affair with his wife and got her pregnant. In fact, in real life Amin divorced his wife on national radio and later had her killed and her body dismembered. However, in this movie there is a made-up Hollywood romanticism that is all to familiar now - white guy leaves his cozy life to go to a third world country, has crazy adventures, gets laid all the time, penetrates into power circles with ease, several locals die, but the white man comes back home and lives to tell the tale! Towards the end of the movie, when the Air France plane is hijacked, the movie drags slowly to the point where Garrigan escapes on a plane full of refugees. They could have instead shown how the hostages were actually rescued by the Israeli Armed Forces in what was one of the finest rescue missions in history. <br/><br/>I think the script sort of ruined this movie. You can watch it for entertainment, but please do not confuse this for being actual history."

He actually becomes Idi Amin, not only does his voice change but so does his stance. He goes from a cuddly bear to terrifying despot in the space of one scene! Brilliant. The rest of the cast acquits themselves just as well, James McEvoy matching him scene for scene and Gillian Anderson (of TV's X-Files fame) virtually unrecognisable as the wife of a British doctor. Kerry Washington is the only member of the cast that disappoints,her accent being all over the place but she isn't given enough screen time for this to become a problem. The script simply crackles with dialogue and the cinematography is excellent. The only (minor) quibble is that the massacre of 300 000 people is only alluded to, but perhaps we didn't need to see it on screen, there being enough violence and gore to keep even the most bloodthirsty fan happy.

We get an insiders look at the brains and brawn behind the corrupt government of the time. Films depicting the chaos in Africa never get old; it's such a drastic change from anything we are used to seeing in the United States that even to begin to fathom that things like this movie showed happened only a few years ago (1970's) automatically leaves the audience enraptured. This movie was astounding and emotionally beautiful. It gave us a look at the complete global devastation going on in Uganda but from an individual perspective, something I believe is often a recipe for success, this film was above and beyond successful.<br/><br/>Forrest Whittaker was brilliant as Idi Amin, he was more than deserving of the Oscar. He was able to capture the personal compassion that Amin clearly believed he possessed, while at the same time showing us the eerily terrifying persona those around him experienced. He certainly scared me, not only in his violence, but also in his uneasy kindness, we never knew what he was thinking, and that can often be the most terrifying thing of all.<br/><br/>While Whittaker was outstanding I don't think the gentleman who played Dr. Garrigan has been given enough credit for this movie. Can you even tell me his name without looking it up? I'll give you a minute¬Ö. It's James McAvoy, but either way, it is through his eyes the story is being told and I believe that it is really him that this movie is truly about. However he unfortunately doesn't even appear on the DVD box cover. What is that about? Not only did I find him very attractive (Who wouldn't.) but also I found his acting enticing and very believable and I really felt for him throughout the movie. By the middle of the movie I was earnestly hoping things would turn out good for him, and I winced with every strike he received from the brutal guards of Amin. McAvoy deserves much more credit and recognition from the public for his brilliant portrayal of the young and na√Øve doctor.<br/><br/>This movie has most certainly been added to my list of favorites. It has all the elements of a fantastic movie. The plot, the characters, the setting were all perfectly mixed together to produce what I believe was cinematic gold. It address social issues, but not in a drab documentary sort of way, sometimes it is necessary to put these sort of statements into narratives such as these in order to be able to reach a larger, sometimes less cultured audience. This is a movie that all people, from everywhere, from all walks of life should see. It can give you a new perspective on global issues and possibly enlighten you to some of the tragedy that has (and still is) occurring in third world countries. While I'm sure much of it may not be historic fact, it is eye opening nonetheless. Make everyone and your mother see this film; I don't think you will regret it."
"gradyharp","10","2","4","18 April 2007"," How Dictators Rise...and Fall
","THE LAST KING OF Scotland delves into the history of Ugandan leadership in the 1970s with gusto. One of the characters (Sarah, the doctor's wife) wisely observes that the crowds that fill the streets cheering as Idi Amin takes control from Milton Obote had the same reaction for the previous dictator and will have the same for the one who follows Amin. It is that aspect of this very fine film that hits home: the people desperately want to be ruled by a hero who will care for them and they maintain hope that each successive 'hero' will be better.<br/><br/>Director Kevin Macdonald bases his 'biography' on the fictionalized novel of the same name by Giles Foden, transformed into a fine screenplay by Jeremy Brock. In order for us to understand the full nature of Idi Amin the story is told through the eyes of a fresh young Scottish physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who leaves his home looking of adventure and settles in Uganda as a mission doctor with Dr. David Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his beautiful wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson). Garrigan learns his role quickly, is attracted to Sarah, but Sarah is wise and turns Garrigan's attention to the rising problem of the overthrow of the Ugandan government by the enigmatic Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). An incident occurs that draws Garrigan into Amin's favor and much against the advice of Sarah, Garrigan falls under the spell of Amin, becoming his official physician. The two men form a warm bond of friendship and trust and it is through this bond that we see the human aspect of Idi Amin, a man born poor but who has risen to power due much to the connection with the British he loathes.<br/><br/>Gradually Garrigan sees the inner workings of Amin's mind, his madness and his ever-increasing brutality as he faces a world as the dictator who will control everything. Garrigan has an unfortunate affair with one of Amin's wives Kay (the very beautiful and gifted Kerry Washington) and as the country is falling under the slaughtering of Amin, Garrigan finally sees his implication in the rule and undergoes the turnabout effects of Amin's brutal strategy. The film ends very quietly with and reenactment of the incident at Entebbe that brought the world's attention to the heinous dictator of Uganda.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is brilliant as Amin: he has obviously studied the man from newsreels and has been able to go beyond press reports to find the humble man who rose to power. McAvoy embodies the fictional physician and has far more screen time and a more sophisticated role than Whitaker and deserves more praise for this performance than he has received. The entire cast is excellent. For once a film about the violence that erupts too often in Africa pays more attention to characters and the gorgeous landscape of Africa than to fighting and killing: the evidence of Amin's mass murders is shown in photographs and the monstrosity his deeds is carefully focused on one particularly heinous death. The musical score by Alex Heffes uses native songs and rarely calls attention to itself - the mark of a brilliant composer. In the end THE LAST KING OF Scotland serves up a hefty slice of history altered by fiction to enhance the storyline but presents a case for how Amin came to power and the indomitable spirit of the people of Uganda despite the government. A fine film on many levels. Grady Harp"
"edwagreen","6","2","4","17 April 2007"," Last King of Scotland-Doctor Wasn't Needed in this House **1/2
","Forest Whitaker's interpretation of the late lunatic Ugandan leader, Idi Amin, was good but not Oscar worthy. In some of the scenes Whitaker mouths the words as if he is being forced to. The person who made him up for this difficult part does deserve praise.<br/><br/>A young Scottish man, just graduated from the University as a doctor, goes to Uganda and in a chance meeting, he comes across the new dictator Amin. The latter has just overthrown the unjust Obote, and in a general compassionate speech, he promises the citizens of Uganda the world. Everyone cheers but the ruthlessness of Amin soon begins to show.<br/><br/>He takes his young doctor under his charge and at first the man is doing everything but doctoring. He even steps in for the Ugandan dictator at an important meeting. When our doctor sees what's going on, he tries to escape, but it's too late. He is severely brutalized and it is amazing that he survived. He is fixed up by a doctor who shall soon receive a bullet in his head for his efforts. Our young hero manages to get on a plane that has been reserved for the hostages take to Uganda by Amin's Palestinian friends. By the way, the film never showed the Israelis saving all but one of Israel's hostages.<br/><br/>A lot of this film is almost reading like a soap opera. We could have entitled it ""As Your Stomach Can Turn from Amin."""
"missygp","7","2","4","5 February 2007"," wasted opportunity... but Forest was amazing
","I thought this was genuinely a wasted opportunity to tell us something about Uganda. For example, it explained nothing about the Indian community's position or history in Uganda, and why Amin would fixate on getting rid of them as the solution to Uganda's problems. For those who know nothing about the history, maybe it was revealing, but I can't help feeling this could have explored the situation further. I also found the characterization of anyone other than the main two characters shallow - we never find out why Amin's wife is a ""bad woman"", we don't find out what resistance from Ugandans is taking place. The English were again a shallow, easy villain and the complexity of colonial history was ignored for a soft (albeit deserving in many ways) target. <br/><br/>The other disappointment was, in a way, the inevitability of seeing the situation through a white outsider's viewpoint. The film did make the point that white people were more likely to be believed - by the West - as to the extent of the atrocities, but what about Ugandans? It's not as if there is a plethora of movies showing us about the mobilization of Ugandan protest against him. It could have been a real opportunity to look at resistance in Uganda, given that he murdered so many of them and was actively involved in fighting.<br/><br/>Having said that, Forest Whitaker's performance was nothing short of staggering: forceful, charismatic, charming, paranoid and unpredictable, he made you understand why people had so much faith in Amin, why he swept to power, and why he was genuinely terrifying. Brilliant, and I hope he gets all the awards he deserves..."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","4","19 January 2007"," contains both the conventions and convictions of good thrillers, with a 'tour-de-force' performance
","It would be one thing to make the pat statement 'this is worth seeing if only for Forest Whitaker as dictator Idi Amin'. For some it will be, and in fact some may just go to see it based on the hype he's been building up in the awards season (not that it's undeserved). But the director Kevin MacDonald, along with his DP Anthony Dod Mantle (behind the modern classic as 28 Days Later), gives the film an edge to it that might have been lost on a technical crew less interested in getting part of the psychology into the style. In the core of the Last King of Scotland, which is purportedly based on the true story of Amin and his doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who becomes soon an adviser and soon like a ""son"" in Amin's bi-polar mind, is a thriller that does thrill, and also pulls into question what it means to practically become a participant in the madness of a brutal dictatorship. Garrigan randomly picks Uganda to go to after he graduates from medical school in Scotland, tries to be a doctor where needed, but somehow becomes enveloped in the world of Amin after a chance encounter on a road-side. He becomes charmed by Amin's upfront likability and candid manner, plus his vulgar humor and promise of both peace for his people and excess in his domain (he has three wives). But soon this turns to become sour when Garrigan sees the darker side to Amin- a paranoid fear-monger who can flip on a dime on his closest advisers. He knows he has to get out, but it wont be easy, at all.<br/><br/>It's a shame then that such pungent subjects- of the towering force that is Amin, portrayed by Whitaker with a look in his eyes that always perfectly conveys what the scene should feel like, and towards the end becomes absolutely chilling in both his rage and even his amiability. Even McAvoy is able to rise to the challenge of his counterpart, as the guy who inspires more in Amin to be ""Scottish"", but also becomes wayward himself. His plot line though becomes a little mired in bits that don't seem truthful (who's to say if they are, as it's based on a book likely based on what happened), with his romantic asides the most unconvincing portions of the picture. The whole sub-plot with him and one of Amin's wives (played by Kerry Washington) becomes a little soapy, and puts such realism into the realm of near contrivance (I also would've liked to see, aside from the one scene where Garrigan sees the pictures, the furthest extent of his murderous ways on his people). But when pit into the reality of Garrigan's situation, and the environment around him, it becomes a richer picture. It does have the goods with being an engrossing entertainment of course, and of the two films out now (this and Blood Diamond) set in turbulent Africa I'd recommend this a little more for the style and acting. That it isn't great isn't ever a fault of Whitaker, however. 7.5/10"

"kijii","8","0","0","28 November 2016"," Where did this dictator come from. and what made him tick?
","Try to imagine what it might be like if you were a Western European and witnessed‚Äîfrom the inside--the beginning and development of one of the most notoriously brutal African dictators of the 20th Century. What might it have looked like to you? This is exactly what Giles Foden did when he wrote his fictionalized historical novel, The Last King of Scotland. <br/><br/>In writing his novel, Foden gives us a chance to try to get into the regime of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin and get an up close and personal look at this brutal clownish figure from the 1970s. Like Hitler or Jim Jones, there is a curiosity to know more about where such people come from and what makes them tick. Call it morbid, but nevertheless, it is still there. In the movie version of the novel, Scottish director Kevin Macdonald--principally known for his documentary, Touching the Void (2003)--shapes Foden's novel and brings it to life.<br/><br/>As the movie opens c.1970, a young Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), is fresh out of medical school but feels that he will always live in his father's shadow unless he breaks from the family and practices medicine far away. Seeking to make a difference, he chooses to practice in the underdeveloped African country of Uganda. Nicholas starts to work in a free clinic with another white doctor and his wife, Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson). When he hears about a local coup, he thinks it would be interesting to go to town and see a rally with the new leader. <br/><br/>Nicholas and Sarah go to the planned demonstration where they see Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) addressing a large crowd. On their way back to the clinic, he is stopped on the road by the local authorities because Amin is in need of medical help. While he is treating Amin's injured hand, the two make a connection. Amin becomes interested in the way Nicholas handles himself and admires Nicholas' tee-shirt with the word, ""Scotland"" on it. He wants to trade his uniform for Nicholas' tee-shirt. The fact that both identify with the Scots and dislike the English is something they have in common.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, Amin sends his limo to pick up Nicholas, gives him a tour of his palace, and meets his wives and children. Then, in a jovial way, he asks him to become his personal doctor, and offers to let him run Uganda's top clinic in Kampala. Nicholas accepts and abruptly leaves the clinic. As he enters into Amin's social functions and is taken into Amin's confidence, Amin starts to call him 'his personal adviser.' Nicholas' naivete is no match for Amin's charm, and he is soon ensnared into Amin's inner circle. Soon, British agents are asking Nichols to 'keep in touch' if there in anything that they should know; Nichols scoffs at the idea of informing on Amin.<br/><br/>As Amin's personal doctor, Nicholas notices his growing paranoia. But, living in a somewhat cloistered life, Nicholas doesn't realize the brutality of what is going on in the country. It's only when he is personally degraded that he discovers some of Amin's atrocities. And, it is only when he becomes the object of that brutality‚Äîas a result of an affair with one of Amin's many wives--that he personally experiences it.<br/><br/>What's amazing to me about this movie is that‚Äîuntil the very end‚Äîthere is little violence to portend what is really happening in the country. We know‚Äîthough Nicholas' eyes---that Amin is concerned about his world image. We know that he is negotiating about Palestinian and Israeli hostages from a hijacked airplane. But, the movie only skims the surface of these important historical issues, because that is not really what the movie is about. It's about the relationship between a naive personal adviser (later called a 'personal monkey') and the web of deceit spun by the brutal sociopath that controls him.<br/><br/>'The death toll during Amin's regime will never be accurately known. An estimate from the International Commission of Jurists is that it was not less than 80,000, and more likely around 300,000. Another estimate, compiled by exile organizations with the help of Amnesty International, put the number killed at 500,000.'--Quoted from Wikipedia<br/><br/>It's important to note that the time frame of this fictionalized story is from 1971 to the incident at Entebbe in 1976, and Amin's regime was to last until he was deposed in 1979. What we really don't know--and can't know from the above quote--is the time pattern of Amin's ordered tortures and killings: What would a time chart would look like, with TIME as the X-Axis and KILLINGS AND TORTURES as the Y-Axis? From this chart you could see: 1) Did these killings and tortures start gradually and grow over time? 2) Did they occur at a constant rate throughout his regime? 3) Were they concentrated more in the later years of his rule? 4) Were there any external events that triggered when they occurred?<br/><br/>Since we can only estimate the raw numbers, we are even FURTHER afield as to the pattern of their occurrence. When you factor in that we are seeing a fictional account of Amin though the eyes of a cloistered and naive white Western European, what you are left with is a story of what might have happened. Again, I say that the movie and novel are more about the relationship between Garrigan and Amin than what I suggested at the beginning of the review: the witness and experience‚Äîfrom the inside--of Amin's entire regime.<br/><br/>Does this movie give us more insight into the mind or motives of Amin? Probably not. But, Forest Whitaker gives us a powerful portrayal of this historic figure. Whitaker could have overplayed Amin, but he didn't. His portrayal seems right on the mark!!"

","Supposedly, Idi Amin's official, obviously self-awarded title was ""His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular."" I note this in case you're on the fence as to whether the Ugandan dictator (sorry, president) was indeed a madman.<br/><br/>Amin was the ""people's choice"" leader of the central-African nation Uganda from 1971 to 1979, a reign marred by mass murders, cannibalism, and generally rude behavior on the part of the Fearless Leader toward, well, anyone not him. In other words, not a particularly fun time to be a Ugandan, or to visit Uganda.<br/><br/>In the Last King of Scotland, Amin is played by Forest Whitaker, who turns in an Oscar-winning performance as the unhinged leader; it is a singularly magnificent exhibition, a prime example of an actor simply disappearing into a role. Gone is the goofy persona from Good Morning, Vietnam, or the morose hit-man from Diary of a Hit-man; Whitaker is finally at center stage. And where you might expect some actors to ham things up a bit, playing a larger-than-life character, Whitaker comes across as honest and eminently believable. His Amin believes in Uganda, wants to see it prosper, but he's drawn by the centralized power and damaged by bouts of insecurity and self-doubt.<br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scotsman who arrived at Uganda hoping to make a difference in the health of Ugandans but who wound up as the personal physician - and a bit more - of the country's unstable president. Garrigan's wide eyed, but not so wide eyed that he can't pause to bed seemingly every woman he lays eyes on. I guess it's the rowdy Scot in him, or something. Anyway, he goes from being a simple country doctor (and making eyes at his colleague's wife) to the presidential palace, where he naturally beds one of Amin's many wives. Nothing good can come of that.<br/><br/>Whitaker's superb, of course, but McAvoy seemed a little more transparent as the dictator's right-hand man, his number-one closest adviser. McAvoy's Garrigan seemed to wilt in the presence of Amin, which makes sense until you realize part of the characterization is that Garrigan stands up to Amin; that's why the latter respects the former. Even the way Garrigan and Amin meet seems wrong. There's an accident, and the president needs some mending (sprained hand); meanwhile, a cow that had been hit by a car is braying in pain. No one is doing anything about it, so Garrigan grabs Amin's gun - with all his soldiers around him, mind you - and shoots the cow several times. Problem solved. Only we'd seen no evidence that Garrigan could handle a gun or that he was comfortable around them, and we saw virtually nothing after that that would imply he was the strong, heroic type. And, really, grabbing the new president's gun in full view of his heavily armed soldiers? Doesn't make much sense. Later on, toward the end of the movie, Garrigan makes two ridiculously stupid decisions, too, putting the whole notion of his intelligence to the lie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem, though, is that nearly all of Garrigan's problems can be traced to one source - his penis. Yeah, I said it. If he'd kept the thing in his pants, he wouldn't have been in ANY trouble with Amin and would have found it a bit easier to eventually leave the country and return to Scotland.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is that this is Whitaker's movie, despite the perspective, and he's so perfect that it's easy to forgive McAvoy's lightweight performance and the plot oddities. The Last King of Scotland is a cut above most historical movies, because even knowing the ending won't spoil the fun. It's also exquisitely photographed (in Uganda itself), and it's riddled with electric scenes."

","Although Forrest Whitaker won the Oscar for best actor in this, I very much enjoyed James McAvoy as the Scottish Dr. Garrigan, the co-lead. He brings a spirited and care-free mischievousness that gets him into some trouble. Based to some degree on real people and events, this movie follows the good Doctor's exhilarating, naive, and harrowing experience in Uganda. There is good supporting characters like Kay, Sarah, Nigel, Dr. Junju that lift the movie quite a bit. And although the action and story become a little bit repetitive, the actors and direction keep the movie strongly engaging up until the final shots.

He is befriended by Idi Amin (Whitaker) who makes him is personal doctor.<br/><br/>I remember reading things about Idi Amin when I was working overseas and the movie hardly touches on the brutality this man was capable of. And, through the eyes of Dr. Garrigan, the movie touches on Amin's violent mood swings, but doesn't go far enough. He almost becomes likable and I hope that wasn't the intention.<br/><br/>Looking back on it there is probably no one better to portray Idi Amin than Forest Whitaker. He did a good job and was rewarded with an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. The rest of the cast and crew were very good too, and James McAvoy could have copped the Best Supporting Actor Award, but no one thought of him. Too bad as he was the barometer we gauged Amin by and he performed exceptionally well. Too bad no one thought of him.<br/><br/>Now, what does all this have to do with the title of The Last King of Scotland? Idi Amin liked Scotland and it's people and referred to himself that way at times. Nothing has been given away and the movie is worth seeing to catch a glimpse of what this evil man was about.

"maatmouse-1","8","2","5","7 June 2007"," Brilliant film and standout performance from Forest
","Like, I suspect, a lot of people in the world, I know little or nothing about Uganda or her history. I do know something about Idi Amin but like so many Brits, we are fed only half truths and propaganda which suits other ends. This film follows the James McAvoy character Doctor McGarrigan from medical school, which he passes, through to his 'adventure' in Africa and Uganda in particular. His intentions are genuine enough; he wants to help the Ugandan people and render any medical assistance he can, but Uganda at this time is going through a massive political upheaval and McGarrigan, initially with Gillan Anderson's character, becomes awe-struck and fascinated by Amin's hypnotic brand of politics. After one incident involving a cow on the road, McGarrigan comes to Amin's attention and, finding out he is Scottish, is brought into Amin's political and family spheres.<br/><br/>There is an element of innocence lost about this film. MacAvoy's character starts out as a wild eyed young man looking for adventure in Africa and encountering women on the way which he sleeps with. He falls for one of Amin's wives along the way, after helping the man's son who has epilepsy and becomes tangled up with her, only to get her pregnant (unsurprising, considering you have two quite young people together and contraception isn't used). Amin discovers this and kills his wife and unborn child horribly and then tortures McGarrigan with the aim of killing him. Fortunately for him, he escapes during a hostage rescue attempt.<br/><br/>Several things stand out about this film. The first is obviously Forest Whitaker as Amin. He is completely believable and even looks the part and sounds it. The second is the portrayal of a country undergoing political change at a frightening pace and not always for the better, the third is Gillian Anderson in a good role. Another interesting point is the occasional perspective from which this is shot: it is shot not always from a white man's perspective although there are elements of 'deepest, darkest Africa' which creep in from time to time. For McAvoy's character, Africa is treated as an adventure: have fun, do a job and sleep with a few women. He is young enough to get away with it, up until a point."
"mdholt","10","2","5","5 October 2006"," Awesome movie!
","First let me say that if Forrest Whitiker doesn't get Best Supporting Oscar for this the academy should be charged with a felony. This is one of the best acting performances that I have ever seen, and makes the movie worth watching. Watch this film, if only to see this performance.<br/><br/>As far as the movie, the only part that didn't flow was the Doctor (yes, I know he is the main character), who was sort of a weak character that I was never really able to get a grip on. This maybe due to the fact that I was trying to like him, but he was really wasn't likable. He was selfish, arrogant, and naive. The kind of man who thinks he knows everything, and is too stupid to realize that he is stupid. Even though the main character wasn't Amin I think it worked really well, because we saw Amin through the eyes of a doctor who ended up being a participant in Amin's crimes (and probably was aware of what he was doing, but was shocked with the result). <br/><br/>You start by seeing Amin as this hero of the people, and then realize that he is a paranoid madman. I don't think that same effect could have been done with Amin as the main character. What this movie did really well is establish the suspense, especially at the end. Even though I didn't like the doctor at all, and if anybody was deserving of torture it was him, I was still horrified during the climax, and relieved when he was able to escape (through an heroic act of a minor character). <br/><br/>This movie has a lot in common with Hotel Rwanda, except it is not a tale of heroism in the face of hatred. Except for the final act of the minor character there is nothing heroic done in this movie."

But, that does not change the fact that I walked out of this movie, at the seventy-minute mark, because of its agonizing slowness!<br/><br/>James McAvoy's portrayal of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan did not cause me to identify with his character, in any way. Not when his decision to visit Uganda, as a medical missionary, was prompted by NOT wanting to go into private practice with his father (or, apparently, suffer through a Canadian winter).<br/><br/>As for Forrest Whitaker? He did a half-way decent job, in his portrayal of Idi Amin. Especially, in the depiction of the latter's gradual slide from the ""George Washington"" to the ""Adolf Hitler"" of Uganda. But, more deserving of the Best Actor Oscar than Will Smith? Nope! Uh-uh! No way! I repeat what I stated in the message boards.<br/><br/>WILL SMITH WAS ROBBED!<br/><br/>The only exciting parts, during those first seventy minutes, were the treatment of Mackenzie Amin's epilepsy; and the attempted assassination of Idi Amin during the test drive of Garrigan's new car. And, as far I'm concerned, those were two scenes too few.<br/><br/>Do yourselves a favor, folks. Don't waste your money going to see this. Because, not even the versatile Mr. Whitaker can save this flick. And, I cite as irrefutable proof the fact that it did NOT win Best Picture!"

","Had been pretty keen to see this as didn't know stacks about Idi Amin and this would save me reading a book.<br/><br/>""The Last King Of Scotland"" tells the story of Idi Amin, seen through the eyes of Nicholas, a fictional doctor who acted as his personal physician. It takes us from his entry to the presidency until the exit of Nicholas from Uganda. This unique perspective allows us to see the story from an angle you would rarely see it from (eg ""Hotel Rwanda"").<br/><br/>From the start wifey was perplexed as to the choice of Forest Whitaker, whom she thought had ""too warm eyes"". I advised her though of his apparent charisma, which was proved in the footage seen in the extras. I was focused on how he won an Oscar. Sure, he played the role really well, but not Oscar worthy in my eyes (then again, I don't think I saw any of the movies containing the other nominated actors).<br/><br/>The story is fascinating, and certainly held my interest. Whitaker was excellent, but didn't receive much support from the rest of the cast. McAvoy (Nicholas) got on my nerves for some reason, and a more seasoned actor may have brought more to the role eg Ewan McGregor. The only other notable role was Sarah, played by Gillian Anderson, in her best performance since ""The X-Files"" (hang on, she hasn't been in anything since. Boy did she fade out).<br/><br/>Anyway, well worth seeing, and make sure you watch the extras."

","I liked the movie because is very well done: script, acting, photography, music and even the 70's looks are very credible. A bit too long for my taste, with 20'less it would be a much more intense film.The romantic ""affaire"" of the young doctor with Sarah and the more carnal one with Kay Amin are much less credible and diminish the story. The secondary characters, like the British consul, are very well designed and performed. I think Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin Dada is superb and should be worth of an Oscar nomination. Also something to remark is a full frontal of James McAvoy in one of the many surprising scenes of the movie. The title is completely misleading and it's got nothing to do with the story, also the ""hanging"" reminds me too much of ""A man called Horse"", but -anyway- it's worth seeing."

","4 February 2007. Oddly enough, The Last King of Scotland is more about a young doctor's growing up than it is about Ugandan President Ida Amin. This intimate, fascinating, though somewhat frustrating portrayal of a young doctor who gets caught up in the fascinating, sometimes humorous, sometimes sinister and cruel backdrop performed to perfection by Forest Whitaker as Amin. Gillian Anderson is almost unrecognizable in her supporting role. Overall, this movie is a great observation of a young, naive, and impulsive man in a strange and sometimes dangerous country that is merciless in its traditions and customs. An intriguing editing job of the isolation of the powerful from the masses amid the ominous echos of conscience. Perhaps, even more focused and more ambiguous performance of these characters may have perhaps offered up a classic movie. Nine of out Ten Stars."

The visuals are not for the squeamish. Go ahead and hide your eyes during the ""tough"" scenes. It is still worth seeing this movie for the fast paced story, realistic drama, fascinating tale, and for the unbelievable acting."

He joins a clinic run by Dr. David Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson). The country comes out of chaos under Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). Nicholas is taken to treat Idi Amin after a minor car crash. Idi Amin loves Scotland and takes a liking to him.<br/><br/>I don't like Nicholas as a character. He rubs me the wrong way for some reason. He is arrogantly clueless which is the purview of the young. Other than that, this is a fine film.

"TieN_NeiT","8","1","2","5 December 2011"," The movie was a classic portrayal of man's inner conflict.
","Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) was unhappy with his situation in Scotland, living under his father's roof and not being able to live up to his expectations. His thinking was ""any place is better than this"" so he spun a globe and randomly landed on Uganda. He will soon find out that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.<br/><br/>This movie has two main themes: the first (as mentioned above) is that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. The second main theme is the corruption of power. Idi Amin (Forest Whittaker) starts out the movie as an idealistic, man ""for the people"", however his presidency turned him into a ruthless dictator who only cared for himself and soon trusted nobody. Thousands of his countrymen, even close advisers, were killed under his brutal regime, merely for the fear that they would threaten his seat of power. The way the doctor leaves his normal life and lives in an entirely different, corrupted world is reminiscent of the movie ""Donnie Brasco"" (1997). Though the settings are entirely different, the themes are similar. There are a couple scenes in the movie where the doctor has an inner struggle with ethics and loyalty. He is so bent on staying away from home that he often chooses the ""wrong"" path and remains loyal to Amin. There is one scene where he tells the president of a bad feeling he had about the Minister of Health talking to a white man at the Holiday Inn, even though Nicholas knows there's a chance that he may be harmed. You can clearly see this when Dr. Garrigan even says to Amin, ""Just talk to him; don't do anything."" He knows something may happen, and the minister is later executed. This is when Nicholas realizes he has started to go down the wrong path and that the grass truly -isn't- greener and decides he needs to go home.<br/><br/>Some thematic elements in The Last King of Scotland that were done well (although not anything fresh or spectacular) were lighting and angles. The lighting would often grow dark during the sad, intimidating, or ""heavy"", parts of the film and bright during the parts that everything appeared to be alright. The angles played around the position of power, where they would look up at Idi Amin as being the one in position of power, and down on others, etc. <br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it movie to anyone who enjoys an in-depth journey into man's inner conflict."
"ShootingShark","5","1","2","21 October 2009"," Interesting, Disappointing Drama Of African Power Politics Featuring Sensational Showstopper By Forest Whitaker
","Nicholas Garrigan is a young doctor from Scotland working in rural Uganda in the early seventies when a chance encounter with Major Idi Amin Dada, the new head of state, results in his being appointed Amin's personal physician. Garrigan enjoys his new title and prominence, but as Amin becomes more paranoid and dictatorial, Garrigan starts to fear for his own safety ...<br/><br/>This is for the most part a gripping drama / biopic of one of the most charismatic, intriguing and reviled figures in African politics. It has several great things going for it, the first and foremost being Whitaker's outstanding performance as Amin, which won him an Oscar. Now I don't normally agree with the Best Actor winners, but this is a definite exception; as well as being utterly convincing in manner, voice, physicality and temperament, Whitaker's depth of character is extraordinary. His Amin is comical, scary, profound, admirable, detestable, child-like, canny, fearful, a gamut of contradictions. My only complaint is that there isn't enough of him - McAvoy is good as Garrigan, enjoying Uganda's beauty and hedonism, but his character is naive and self-centred, and all too often the movie details his anguished reactions to Amin's deeds when it would be much more interesting to stay with Whitaker. The authentic locations in Kampala and the surrounding countryside look fabulous, and the movie is full of great toe-tapping music by Alex Heffes. However, in my view it has a failing, and it's the last half hour. While it's working as a drama / expos√É¬©, and as a story of two very unlikely friends, it's great. Towards the end it turns into a silly unbelievable thriller, as Garrigan is recruited by the British Embassy to poison Amin, has a disastrous love affair with one of his wives, is crucified with meat hooks, and escapes on the Entebbe mercy flight. This finale is both lamely scripted and not particularly well directed, and kinda spoiled the movie for me. I guess my problem is really the Garrigan character; if the film had been just a straight biopic of Amin, focussing on the more profound issues of what he achieved for African independence and the brutality of his regime, I'd rate it much higher. It's still a must-see though, if only for the towering dynamo of a performance by Whitaker. Based on the book by Giles Foden, who appears briefly as a journalist. For another take on Amin by another great actor, check out Yaphet Kotto in Irvin Kershner's underrated (and much more accurate) 1976 TV-movie Raid On Entebbe. 5/10"
"madonnawb","10","1","2","18 September 2007"," Now I know...
","Why Forest Whitaker took home the big prize- he really deserved it! Not that I like his face very much or his previous roles I must say (especially since the last place I saw him was in that E.R. episode where he was a freak patient avenging his rage on Dr. Kovac), but this role was perfect for him... and he really delivered. You can really feel the insanity and unpredictability of his personality and rage- truly frightening...and I would never wanna be in a situation to depend on the mercy of his ever-turbulent mood.<br/><br/>Now apart from the great acting, I can't say I loved the plot - our main character gets into such trouble in such a way that we can hardly feel sorry for him. I mean, I really have no sympathy for the skinny Scottish guy - Dr. Garrigan. Seriously, he didn't exactly do himself any favours: you are in a crazy dictator-run country where no international laws can save your ass under any circumstances, and here you are making best friends with a very unpredictable man who gets what he wants and has a knack for paranoia and insane moments of rage- and oh yeah also gives away death sentences like food stamps. And what do you do- sleep with one of his wives? Bad idea.<br/><br/>In that retrospect I didn't like the development of the movie- unless that was the purpose, after all maybe it did happen, but as mentioned I definitely enjoyed Whitaker's acting.... as scary as it was."

At first enthralled by the new President he slowly begins to realize that all is not well as he journeys from country doctor to physician to the man himself.<br/><br/>Well made and well acted story is a bit unremarkable dramatically especially if you've seen any of the exploitation films on Amin or even Barbet Schroeder's Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait.<br/><br/>Forrest Whitaker is excellent as Amin. I'm not sure his performance is really Oscar worthy since the only real difference between his performance and some of the other people who've played Amin-say Joseph Olita in Amin: The Rise and Fall, is that he has a better script to work with. Since its such a show offy role that its easy to take an excellent and rightfully praised performance, and make it seem like its ""the best"" of the year when its one of the best. Its a good but not great film. Add it to the long list of films that are Oscar winners for reasons that will escape you two years hence."

","Wow! What a presence Forest Whitaker has on screen! Luckily the movie isn't in 3D as the viewer already has the impression that at any moment he will reach out and grab him/her by the throat!FW is indeed Amin: huge, menacing, bipolar to say the least and with the awesome potential of keeping his entourage in a heightened state of constant anguish.Amin apparently possessed the hypnotic powers that characterize many past and present dictators. The fact that he was in a constant state of doubt as to his own godlike status and that he questioned the loyalty of everyone around him made his reactions even less predictable. Nobody really knew how to address him and even the most submissive and personally humiliating approach could evoke totally irrational outbursts on his part. Forest Whitaker portrays Amin as he really was and does this outstandingly. James McAvoy does what is expected of him but neither the weak character he portrays nor his charisma as an actor impressed me much."

","This film is based on the memoirs of the personal physician of the Ugandan dictator in 1970's.<br/><br/>This movie is so moving. From the beginning, the portrayal of the relationship between Dr Garrison and the president is already strong and solid. Another superb aspect of story telling is the paranoid nature of a dictator. The inability to trust anyone is shown in the film very well. Working for the president could be prestigious, but it could also be dangerously fatal. The final torture scene is simply unwatchable because it is so real, so scary, so sad. And yet, we know it was real. It was in fact the fate of 300,000 people."

You get a true sense of being in Uganda in the 1970's. the scenery reminded me of my childhood in Kenya, though Jame's Mcevoys doctor character was a little too hippie for my liking at times, and his stupidity at times baffling. This is definitely Forrest's film and he steals the show, though we could have gone a little further and explored Idi's evil side as there was definitely more than was displayed in the movie. The story nevertheless is quite interesting and really picks up pace towards the end leaving you at the edge of you seat at times. Most of the major events during Amin's reign are shown and historically apart from the fictional doctor character the film is fairly correct. A definitely good film to watch."
"go-98","8","1","2","15 May 2007"," An excellent mix of fact and fiction
","As a long-time student of Idi Amin, I awaited The Last King of Scotland much much anticipation. And on my first viewing, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised the presence of the character of Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) but I think it works well in that his view of events joins a number of factual dots very nicely - including the murder of Amin's wife Kay, who was indeed butchered in the brutal way portrayed in the film. I don't think a tight narrative could have been otherwise achieved without making it look like a pseudo-documentary.<br/><br/>The character of Amin (played by the excellent Forest Whitaker) was almost as scary as the real thing - the body language was excellent, but I felt something somewhere was missing. Maybe I have seen too much footage of the real Amin. In particular in this case the eyes didn't have it - Whitaker cannot escape the fact that he exudes a certain humanity that Amin clearly lacked; and without being churlish, the actor's lazy eye also played a little part as well.<br/><br/>Then there was the East African accent which was spot on - but again something was missing in that many of Amin's verbal quirks were overlooked. For example Amin had this very African habit of pluralising certain words, but this doesn't appear to have been spotted by the scriptwriters when they were watching the original footage. On many occasions he often emphasised a point with the overuse of the word 'completely' and the phrase 'I think you should know this' - but the former was used only twice in the film. If you watch Barbet Schroeder's documentary film and then follow this with LKOS, you would be able to spot these subtle differences.<br/><br/>Still, I am probably picking at straws here. Overall I found the film very enjoyable, and would definitely recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in these events."
"shanfloyd","9","1","2","15 May 2007"," Whitaker's Amin had 'Oscar' written over his face...
","""The Last King of Scotland"" is definitely one of the best movies based on real events ever. Though the film is not entirely fact-based... it's told from a fictional character's point of view, but the audience, particularly those who were around in the time of Idi Amin's regime can breathe realism in its every minute.<br/><br/>The introduction of the storyteller, a young Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, was important to create subjective angles. Yet the character is not at all as inert as one would seem. He is perhaps the leading character in the film, not Idi Amin. And Garrigan's character is wonderfully designed... with his initial careless nature, his sexual (mis)adventures, his later concerns and helplessness etc. James McAvoy does a fantastic job playing this role. The essence of the character is beautifully captured by him.<br/><br/>But everybody knows if there's one reason to see this film that'd be Forest Whitaker's performance as the infamous dictator. Whitaker captures the character's brutality, insanity and his weaknesses in their most minute details. Whitaker seems to know what it takes to be a dictator. His work had 'Oscar' written over it."
"Bunuel1976","7","1","2","9 May 2007"," THE LAST KING OF Scotland (Kevin MacDonald, 2006) ***
","Forest Whitaker deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his vivid portrayal of Ugandan dictator, General Idi Amin (even though newsreel footage at the end shows there is not that much of a facial resemblance), who starts out as being fairly benign but gradually turns to mass-murdering tyranny through his paranoia and mood swings. Showing the events from the viewpoint of his out-of-his-league Scottish physician was an innovation but, eventually, this drags the film into dreary melodramatics when the doc impregnates one of Amin's wives and, ultimately, serves to render the film unfocused and overlong.<br/><br/>The film is certainly very well done and generally compelling but, once one realizes that the Scottish doctor is a fictional character, the viewer is left wondering whether the director (or the author of the book on which the script was based) opted to take a foreigner's eye-view of this turbulent period in South African history because otherwise the project would have had no commercial momentum! Not much barbarity is shown but, when it is, the results are quite chilling - such as the vivisected body of Amin's duplicitous wife and his hideous torture of the doctor practically in full view of the Entebbe hostages, scenes which wouldn't have been amiss in a horror film!"

And anyone old enough to have read the news accounts of the day will remember much about Idi Amin and his buffoonish but deadly regime as portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>Those younger in years, raised in a politically correct era absolutely loathe to show anything negative about Africa, might well gasp in disbelief and naively search for other, non-African villains.

"oneloveall","7","1","2","11 April 2007"," Powerful and entertaining in equal measures
","Another masterful attempt at injecting a fictitious character into real historical events and personalities, this successful film obviously thrives off of the passionate delivery from Forest Whitaker as the ruthless but smiling dictator Idi Amin, though eventually offers much more as well. It must be noted that the marketing of this movie does seem a bit disrespectful. We all know of the rave reviews and awards across the board Whitaker has been amassing for his fearless take on the eccentric and explosive ex-leader of Uganda, though all the hype surrounding his characterization has left the true main character, Amin's Scottish physician played by a likable James McAvoy, out to dry when being promoted, marketed, or even discussed after the fact.<br/><br/>It is through McAvoy's eyes after all, that the entire journey to Africa and eventual partnership with Amin is transmitted to viewers, and though his well received performance is completely overshadowed by the colossal charisma coming from this title role, it is slightly disheartening to see no mention of a lead actor on any promotional material, cover art, or anything else desperately trying to let us know the film is a tour-de-force for Whitaker. At the same time it is also completely understandable, given the nature of business in Hollywood...and his show-stopping antics. The Academy award winning actor shines brighter then ever with his fire-charged interpretation of the plagued leader, rescuing many of the screenplay's minor unnecessary indulgences with this commanding role in his hands. Though I would argue Whitaker's performance opts for an overt delivery at the expense of most subtlety, even at his cartoonish worst the actor threatens a screen with such intensity, laughing endlessly while hinting at upcoming terror as to keep viewers transfixed throughout any dejected operatics. <br/><br/>Framing Mr. Amin in a most stylish and flattering way, director Kevin Macdonald's constant use of provocative camera zooms upon the tyrant's uneasy inner space helps give the film the stylistic engagement and emotional urgency it needs, not to mention just complimenting Whitaker's great performance even more. The set locations were sumptuously shot as well, though this time it was not so much the increasingly generic African landscapes as it was the intriguing interior and exterior locations used for capturing the King around his decadent ""palace"", helping to showcase Africa in a different light for a change. The film may become a little too Boogie Nights for it's own good, in it's attempt at rendering the party lifestyle indulged by the privileged few, but is of little consequence to the overall pace.<br/><br/>What really keeps The Last King of Scotland fresh, barring the acting of course, are the interesting moral dilemmas played out by this conflicted doctor, as we watch a young naive idealist come over to Africa to make a difference while ending up doing something entirely different. It is a haunting, subtle, but completely powerful metaphor which lasts with the viewer well after the frightening screams from Amin have faded away. Though the climax felt a little mis-managed, the film remains entertaining and potent the whole way through, never betraying it's entertainment roots, yet offering much political and psychological food for thought in the process."
"RedAzaelia","Null","1","2","18 March 2007"," Breathaking!
","Just...wow.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland tells a story of Idi Amin's dictatorship of Uganda, as seen through the eyes of his (fictional) Scottish personal physician, Nicholas Garrigan.<br/><br/>It's certainly the most intense movie I've seen in a while. It's excellently acted, shot, written, and directed. It's not quite as violent as one might expect, considering 300,000-500,000 people died as a result of Amin's actions. There are only a few violent and/or gory scenes in the whole movie, though they are quite enough as they are--this movie is not for the faint of heart (or stomach).<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker, in the title role as dictator Idi Amin, delivers a powerhouse performance. Whitaker is amazing and incredibly frightening to watch, and well-deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. There are no further words to describe his performance. His heart-stopping performance is a must-see.<br/><br/>His foil is the also-talented James McAvoy as Nicholas Garrigan, a naive young man fresh out of med school and looking for adventure. He provides not only the conscience of the movie, but the eyes through which we see it. His reactions provide virtually the only barometer for the audience to gauge their response by--an unusual tactic, but a very effective one. Make no mistake, though. Garrigan is far from the perfect hero. However, in spite of any mistakes he might have made, Garrigan remains sympathetic.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland was directed with an excellent eye for suspense and tension by Kevin Macdonald. The plot grabs hold and doesn't let go until the very end.<br/><br/>The movie may not be available in some mainstream cinemas, but it's well worth going out of your way for. Full marks: 10 out of 10."

","I went into ""The Last King of Scotland"" expecting a great performance by Forest Whitaker and not much else. After all, that's what all the reviews by the professional critics said. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Giles Foden, the film follows the adventures of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) from the time he graduates from medical school through his entire stay in Uganda. Initially, he is offered a partnership in his father's medical practice, but he rejects it and instead decides to practice medicine somewhere exotic. He chooses Uganda by spinning a globe and randomly stopping his finger there.<br/><br/>Once there, we see that he is little more than a self-centered womanizer, out to have a good time and not much more. One day--with nothing better to do--he attends a speech by General Idi Amin (Whitaker), who has just seized the presidency in a coup. Amin is articulate, charismatic, playful, and exactly the sort of guy you want to be your friend. Not long after the speech, Garrigan is summoned to help Amin, who has hurt his hand in a car wreck. While Garrigan is treating Amin, he is too wrapped up in himself and too distracted by the bleating of a dying cow to notice that everyone is afraid of Amin. When he seizes Amin's gun to shoot the cow, he takes no notice that he nearly signed his own death warrant. When Amin learns that Garrigan is Scottish, he turns on the same electric charm and winning smile that he used during the speech, as Amin has a love for all things Scottish (except red hair). Impressed by Garrigan's lack of fear, Amin invites him to be his personal physician and adviser. At first, Garrigan rejects Amin's offer, but eventually Amin wins him over by playing on his egotism and lust for women.<br/><br/>And only after accepting the position does Garrigan see the real Amin: a paranoid, sadistic despot who murders his political rivals and personally oversees the tortures of those closest to him whom he suspects of treason. At first, Garrigan is in denial. After all, the British human rights advocate who first tells him what Amin is really all about (Simon McBurney) has a slimy personality, and is a little too fond of a cloak-and-dagger style of talking. But once he befriends Amin's neglected wife Kay (Kerry Washington), he comes to realize that he will never be allowed to tender his resignation or leave Amin's side without risking his life.<br/><br/>Mention must now be made of Forest Whitaker's performance. He is quite simply electric. He laughs, howls, sweats and charms with enough gusto to put Charlton Heston, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino to shame. Also, I think there may have been some slight electronic trickery in the sound department, because Whitaker's voice echoed whenever he spoke, but none of the other actors' did. But never once did I get the feeling that he was overacting, or even that this was Forest Whitaker playing a part. I really thought that I was watching the late African dictator whose name has become a synonym for ""insane tyrant"". Perhaps this is because most of Whitaker's other roles are of easy-going types, but I imagine that it's more because he's just that good.<br/><br/>Also, I have noticed that when Kerry Washington plays a married woman, the actor playing her husband wins an Oscar for the role (i.e. Jamie Foxx in ""Ray""). I doubt this is coincidence. I believe she is one of those actors--like Robert Duvall or Morgan Freeman--who makes everyone else better just by starring alongside them. According to this website, her next role as a married woman is in ""Lakeview Terrace"", due out in 2008. The role of her husband is not cast yet, but expect him to win the golden man in two years.<br/><br/>There is a persistent, politically correct criticism about this film that it is somehow cheapened because it shown through the eyes of a Caucasian westerner instead of a Ugandan. But I think that works in the film's favor. It is aimed at a western, English-speaking audience, and too many of us--like Dr. Garrigan--take our freedoms for granted and don't understand how global politics affects our lives. Garrigan only grows a conscience once his freedoms are taken away. Also I like the ironic counterpoint in having McAvoy and McBurney play the ""good guys"", yet their characters are such jerks, while Whitaker plays the ""bad guy"", yet is so charming and likable.<br/><br/>The film does have some major flaws. Firstly, short shrift is given to Amin's actual crimes against humanity. We only see a few scattered glimpses of his cruelty in the second half of the movie. Secondly, the actual events depicted in the movie were spread out over six years, but since nobody in the film ages (not even the children), or even changes their hairstyle, one is left with the impression that all this happened in one summer.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is a suspenseful thriller that is a cross between ""Marathon Man"" and the final act of ""Apocolypse Now"". It resonates with great acting and a powerful message that if we take our freedoms for granted, they can be quickly taken away by someone who seems to love us and pretends to have our best interests at heart."
"cultfilmfan","10","1","2","3 March 2007"," The Last King Of Scotland
","The Last King Of Scotland is based upon the novel of the same name by Giles Foden. The film takes pace in the 1970's and is about a young doctor from Scotland named Nicholas Garrigan who decides to travel to Uganda to become a doctor there. After being set up with one or two other doctors in Uganda, Nicholas meets the new president of Uganda named Idi Amin. Amin is quite taken by Nicholas, so he decides to make him his own personal physician and moves him to a bigger hospital. Nicholas and Amin also become quite friendly and Amin seems to have a real soft spot in his heart for Nicholas and he sort of takes him under his wing while at the same time often coming to Nicholas for help for medical reasons and advice for the country. Soon, Nicholas sees that Idi isn't always just fun and laughter and that he has a dark side which later resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being murdered in Uganda causing Idi Amin to go into exile until his death in 2003. The Last King Of Scotland is the winner of 22 awards including the Oscar for Best Actor (Forest Whitaker who played Idi Amin). I thought this film was a masterpiece from start to finish and certainly one of the best films of 2006. The film is directed with great skill, has a good script, good cinematography and good film editing. Don't think I've forgotten about the acting because that is one of the things that makes this movie so great. Forest Whitaker completely transforms into Idi Amin and totally owns this character and at times makes him seem jolly and fun to sometimes downright frightening and menacing. Everything from Whitaker's facial expressions, body language and right up to the way he portrays this character is brilliant and is very worthy of the Oscar for Best Actor. James McAvoy who plays Nicholas also does a great job here and I think he was very overlooked when the award season hit. What could have been a long and political movie turns out to be a film that is more about characters, their personalities and what is going on in their minds. The character development and study of this film is great and the characters are brought to life by the great acting, script and direction. This is also a good looking movie and is immensely entertaining, at times thrilling and always compelling right up until the end. This is a powerful and engrossing film which has lots of talent behind the camera and right in front of it. I liked how the movie went more for the characters than the political stuff and although he was called a brutal murderer I liked how also the film gave Amin a more human side because it made him all the more real and believable. This is a towering achievement in film that sets the bar from acting to directing and is one of the best films of 2006."
"David-O-Brien","7","1","2","22 February 2007"," Good but could have been so much better
","I really enjoyed Forest Whittaker's performance in this film. He achieved just the right balance between charmer and maniac. Whittaker has always been an extremely competent actor but he has never been centre stage till now apart from the film 'Ghost Dog'. He is ideal to play the part of Amin given his physical stature and his air of menace. James McAvoy gives a great performance as well. His character goes from happiness to crisis over the course of the film and it is a very polished performance.<br/><br/>I have to criticise one aspect of the film. The atrocities carried out by the Amin regime were abominable but they are only touched upon in the film. I would have preferred the director to show more of how Amin brought the country to rack and ruin with his brutality. It would have been a 10 out of 10 film if it had of done this as well."

","If Chinese Gongfu was attractive then movies about Africa is hot. I don't exactly know why but I guess because it's far away from us. No guys get to know it so a man standing in a big history context makes things different and our taste for the different suffering continues our appreciation.<br/><br/>when people see Jack Chen we know the movie is going to talk about fighting and when people see Africa we understand it would be about suffering.<br/><br/>Africa was the most undeveloped continent in the world and every year there are thousands of projects built for its improving. Rich west find a place to enjoy the mercy you could show and motivation you could hold for the rest of your life. It is said that helping them is hard because investors can't find effective workers and it's a bloody long chain to connect the training with the final engagement so mostly they could only take advantage of their natural resources."
"antoniotierno","8","1","2","16 February 2007"," haunting thriller
","This movie got a scary nature but depicts terribly well this intimidating character; the portrait of this dictator is really frightening but the story is recounted in a really seductive way. The whole film is adrenaline-filled but what is truly suggestive is the character greatly played by Forrest Whitetaker, that is a mix of cold bloodiness, ruthlessness, humor and madness. Think this motion picture will be remembered for a very long time, as blood and violence - not only physical, also psychological - are a considerable part of it but the events and the story are undeniably gripping. Would suggest everyone not to miss ""The KIng of Scotland""."
"neferu","8","1","2","15 February 2007"," Excellently crafted
","The Last King of Scotland is in some ways an historical film, but is essentially a thriller. I knew nothing of Uganda's violent past before watching it.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the experiences of a young Scottish doctor trapped in his home where he feels that his skills have a greater calling elsewhere. He travels to Uganda to help the disease and poverty stricken communities. After a series of unusual events, he ends up as the president of Uganda's personal physician. Soon the doctor finds himself entangled in a spiral of madness and brutality - orchestrated by the monstrous Amin. The character of Dr. Garrigan is played by James McAvoy, and he delivers a worthy performance. As the series of events lead him down deeper and darker roads, his character changes into a completely different person.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker plays Amin and does a convincing and fascinating job of it. He portrays an unpredictable, paranoid, and deeply disturbed soul and brings it all through masterfully to the screen. Amin is like a child with a gun - dangerous and capable of terrible things in his ignorance. To get into the part Whitaker gained a lot of weight and actually began to learn the language of Swahili. The results are brilliant - not one violent physical action is used in Whitaker's performance, and there is no need. Just the threat of the hulking silhouette is terrifying. <br/><br/>The camera work, script and score are all impeccable, and compliment each other during the course of the film. An ambiance is created in the film perfectly; one of tribal rhythms, sweat, unpredictability, tension, the viewer is truly placed in Uganda. <br/><br/>Some have criticised the film for its fictional quality, (the doctor is a fictional character) saying that it does not portray the true events of the terrible reign of Idi himself. I am not at liberty to agree or disagree with the statement, as it is a business thankfully I have not experienced first - hand, but I can see the validity of such a comment. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this film immensely for the performances, the cinematography and the wonderful understudy into one of histories madmen.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on this towering historical and cinematographic achievement."
"razvan_cendo","8","1","2","15 February 2007"," Impressive!
","I have to say that I didn't have the impression that Whiteaker would deserve the best actor award.But after I have seen this movie I admit that he played his role perfectly. The last king of Scotland presents the story of a young doctor adventuring in Uganda,trying to avoid the common life.His life indeed changes when he meets Idi Amin and becomes his physician and close friend.At the beginning life is great among the president,but after a while atrocities are revealed and Nicholas wants to get out of the African country. The problem is that the dictator doesn't.If you want to find out how it ends and see the marvelous acting of Forrest Witheaker you should definitely watch it."
"dougandwin","7","1","2","14 February 2007"," Great Acting, but too much Fiction
","Forest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland"" clearly has Oscar written all over it - it was a magnificent portrayal of a vile dictator who destroyed his country. Unfortunately, for me at least, the fiction around the character of the Doctor played by McAvoy took up far too much of the story - I had hoped more time would have been spent on th factual base of Amin's rise to power, rather than depicting imagined goings-on of his personal physician. However, despite the foregoing, it is a powerful film showing the horrors that occurred under the tyrant's rule and how the economy of Uganda was ruined by him and his ""party"". I guess there have been similar instances of African countries striving for their independence from European countries, and the horrors they have endured, and continue to endure."
"rajdoctor","7","1","2","10 February 2007"," The King of Scotland
","The King of Scotland This is a story about Idi Amin told from the perspective of his personal Scottish physician. Forest Whitaker has played the role of Idi Amin brilliantly. This is a role for life for any actor and Forest has done ample justice to the nuances of the Idi Amin's character. He has been excellent in portraying varied range of emotions ¬ñ and that weirdness of the crazy character.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays the young Scottish doctor who in his youthful energy and bashfulness, is liked by Amin and gets sucked into the gruesome events that unfold slowly in the movie. He has done a very good job in showcasing his skills as an actor.<br/><br/>But the movie belongs to Forest Whitwaker. He punches each and every shot of his with so much of power and perfection that it is hard to believe that Idi Amin was anyways different from what is portrayed by him. From the most loved leader of Uganda to the most dreaded one ¬ñ is a deadly journey.<br/><br/>As the story is shown from an insider's perspective James as the Scottish doctor is only able to see the real savagery of Idi Amin at the very end of his partnership with Amin.<br/><br/>All credit to Kevin Macdonald as a director to makes this movie so tight and interesting from the first to the last frame. The background score jells very well with the narration and sometimes works on its own as a separate character to build tension, events etc. Forest Whitwaker would make Kevin much proud because I think he excels his director's notes, and that is exceptional. It is no wonder that Forest recently won the Golden Globe and International Bafta award and I would loose my confidence on the fairness of Oscars if he does not with the Oscars for the best actor. It will be a shame on the Oscars!<br/><br/>Is not that enough for you to go and see the movie? (7.5 Stars)"
"amandajeanmorgan","10","1","2","9 February 2007"," This is a fantastic, superb film
","This is the best movie of the year!! Forrest Whittaker is phenomenal. The plot includes love, hate, murder, betrayal--one could only hope if Shakespeare were alive he could have created such a masterpiece. This movie needs to win every award it has been nominated for. Idi Amin is probably rolling over in his grave, because this film seems to paint one of the most accurate portraits of a dangerous, insane dictator whose sense of humor only makes the viewer more uncomfortable as we realize that this man (played marvelously and flawlessly by Whittaker) is not only evil, but he is losing his mind. And the viewer can't help but feel sorry for the doc, even tho' from the beginning of the film we see that he made his bed and should lie in it~~he made a deal with the devil and there are grave consequences for his clandestine dealings."
"laraemeadows","Null","1","2","7 February 2007"," Leaves you with a scar on your heart and mind
","""The Last King of Scotland"" based on the book by Giles Foden, is the intense story of charismatic and horrifying Ugandan leader, Idi Amin. Exceptional writing by Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan, acting, and directing make a must see movie that sticks in your mind and on your heart like a battle scar.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays new doctor Nicholas Garrigan. When Garrigan decides to have some adventure as a doctor in a third world country, he spins the globe and lands in Uganda. While out in the middle of no where Uganda a revolution goes on around them. Idi Amin, portrayed by Forest Whitaker, overthrows the government in a coup and the magnetic leader travels the countryside so his people can know him. During his travels he meets Garrigan, finds out that he's Scottish, and asks him to be his personal physician. Garrigan agrees, starts his life of luxury and is thrown into a tyrannical world of systematic violence and paranoia. Eventually Garrigan becomes one of Amin's closest advisers.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is frightening. When you first meet Amin he is fun, approachable and it was easy to find inspiration in his words and personality. Throughout the movie his personality changes from inspiring to paranoid and terrifying. Whitaker's performance flows naturally in and out of these two men trapped in one body. He never misplaces his anger in a sweet scene; his glints of admiration never seep out during a frenzied rant. Whitaker avoids all hints of schizophrenia and ignores all opportunities to dive into multiple personality disorder. <br/><br/>Garrigan is unaware of what's happening in Uganda at first, but even after he realizes what Amin is doing, he does nothing to stop him. Only when it seems the crazed paranoia and mass murders might affect him and weigh on his conscience does Garrigan say something. James McAvoy's emotional transition from innocent privileged young man to a morally ambiguous government official is stirring. During the movie, I had to restrain myself from yelling at Garrigan to stop what he's doing, to leave right away or to just do what had to be done. McAvoy's seamlessly grows his character from an acorn to a diseased oak. <br/><br/>The supporting cast isn't outshined by the main characters. Kerry Washington plays Kay Amin, Idi Amin's third wife. Her performance is tender, perplexing and sexy. Gillian Anderson plays Sarah Merrit, Garrigan's first love interest in the story. Her sage words and cool demeanor will be left ringing in your ears by the end of the movie. Simon McBurney, Nigel Stone's character, is monstrous in the covert, James Bond sort of way. His maniacal character is not over acted, absolutely to the credit to Stone. <br/><br/>Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan use an historic figure to tell a cautionary tale about what happens when you let fear decide who runs your country and what happens when your blind ambition overrules your moral center. Their characters are complete and lacking no texture. The temptation to make characters who are strictly monsters or heroes is avoided. Each character, even Amin, is not strictly good, nor bad, but products of their circumstances. I found the recipe for creating a monster far too realistic to be comfortable and for that I thank the writers for giving me the opportunity to feel that level of discomfort. Even the hero of this movie is only slightly heroic; leaving the melodramatic phony heroics for a superhero movie. Garrigan's transformation left me wondering if I could be any stronger than he is, given the situation he got himself into.<br/><br/>I was impressed that the cinematographers and directors made a point of changing the camera style, lighting and framing to fit the mood of the movie. There are scenes where the sweat on someone's face seems radiant in the dark. There is an impressive use of light to set mood that doesn't fall into the clich√© parenthesis. <br/><br/>This shattered my personal peace. It has left me to question my own behavior. Have I paid enough attention to my own life? Have I let raw, unadulterated ambition kill parts of my humanity? What would I do in that situation? At what point would I run screaming from Uganda? Can we afford to be afraid and let that fear color our decisions when it comes to our government? How can I tell if someone is a monster when they are so charismatic? Has my ambition hurt other people?<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is a heart pounding drama that left me uneasy, utterly disappointed with the quality of the characters' behavior and inspired by the quality of the film making. Missing this movie would be bad for your cinematic knowledge and for your personal growth."

","For me Forest Whittaker made this film his own portraying the megla manic,egotistical dictator of Uganda, Idi Amin, and he deserves an Oscar for one of the most powerful performances I have seen in a long time.Having read other comments concerning the over use of violence,I can only say that this was nothing compared to the true events of the time.Bravo to the film makers for not shying away from what was one of the most bloodiest dictatorships in living memory. Also,well done to James McAvoy for his portrayal of the naive young doctor whose realisation of the truth hit him in the face like a brick when it was all too late.Finally,congratulations to FilmFour long may you continue making decent films"
"garrard","9","1","2","4 February 2007"," Whitaker portrays the epitome of a warped mind!
","Like dictators before him, Ida Amin was a man that was determined to fulfill his destiny at all costs. Thinking that his plans for a new Uganda meant the elimination of those that he felt stood in his way, Amin was responsible for the deaths of over 300,000 of his fellow countrymen. This riveting film tells the tale of the dictator as seen through the eyes of his devoted-at-first personal physician (James McAvoy) and how the doctor began to see the true side of Amin.<br/><br/>Forrest Whitaker is outstanding as Amin, totally immersing himself into the man with frightening relish. It's as if the part were tailor-made for the actor and he should be destined to win the coveted Oscar for ""Best Actor"".<br/><br/>James McAvoy adds great support as the young doctor and Kerry Washington is striking as the doomed third wife of Amin. Gillian Anderson appears as a fellow doctor that understands, oh to well, the intentions of the new ruler, having lived through the ""changes"" brought forth by the previous leader.<br/><br/>This is a definite ""must-see"" film."
"alan997","9","1","2","2 February 2007"," Great book, great movie
","An absolutely gut-wrenching roller-coaster of a movie that among other things provides an object lesson in how to film a novel. The broad arc of the original plot is faithfully followed, tho' significant events from the book are simply ignored, and the ending bears little relation to the original. But the film is in the most important sense absolutely true to the book, whose core and most pervasive feature is the escalating sense of dread, of unpredictability, of sheer terror, of things starting to slide inexorably out of control, of madness, of limitless power at the disposal of a capricious and unhinged infant. That *feeling* - of sheer, mounting dread - is the very heart of the book, and is brilliantly transferred to the screen. Excellent, efficient, totally-focused direction; towering performances all round (every bit part was played to perfection...easy to miss given the dominance of the central performance); intelligent script, great location photography....movies don't come much better."
"Stampsfightclub","9","1","2","28 January 2007"," Very powerful political drama driving by sensational Whitaker
","My View on the Narrative. <br/><br/>Forest Whitaker (Phonebooth) delivers a sensational Oscar Nominated performance as the President of Uganda who is living in a very violent world and as the head of his country, mounts difficult challenges and now his new assistant James McAvoy (The Chronicles of Narnia) is there to help him, with a danger of becoming too attached to the president. It's a knockout emotional powerful issue driven story which is based on the events of the president in the 1970's. This political story is exceptional with issues upon Uganda's traits and values focused upon in great detail and through the use of Whitaker the story becomes so focused and emotional it took my breathe away. The plot is consistent in being entertaining, engaging and powerful throughout. The ending was slightly confusing and one scene was too graphic for my taste but was definitely necessary to convey what the times in Uganda were like under Idi Amin's control. The violence and strong issues regarding the welfare of the country will make even the strongest of persons touched, it is from start to finish, a knockout story.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>When hearing of the Oscar nominations, I hadn't seen this film but I went the day after and I don't need to say anything more than Whitaker simply made this movie what it was and he deserves the award 100%. His acting was simply sensational and he deserves an award to merit his powerful performance in this film. He carried it from start to beginning and his relationship with James McAvoy was thoroughly convincing. I have seen many strong performances in my time, from Edward Norton in American History X to Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs and this performance is up there with the best. <br/><br/>without a shadow of a doubt, i recommend this film to anyone with a thirst for power, emotion and strong nation beliefs"

","""Forest"" heaven's sake, somebody please give Mr. Forest Whitaker the Best Actor Academy Award for his ferocious tour-de-force leading performance as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin! His work will reign as the king of performances of male actors this year. However, I do have to dictate that he was not the leading actor in the film. That reign of being the premier protagonist of ""The Last King of Scotland"" would go to James Mcavoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, the young Scottish doctor who moves to Uganda and befriends Amin. It is prominently his story that is the film's showcase. Garrigan, not only becomes Amin's doctor, but as Amin calls him also ""his most trusted adviser"". That is till Garrigan discovers the massacre Amin havocs on his people. It also did not help matters much when Dr. Garrigan made too many Ugandan house calls to Amin's wife Kay, so they can play doctor together if you know what I ""amin"". Anyway, Idi Boy was responsible for the savage brutal deaths of over 300,000 people during his reign in the 70's. He was a vindictive eradicator! The film was inspired by true events, even though the Garrison character is fictional. James Mcavoy's underrated performance as Dr. Garrigan deserves a doctorate in effectual acting. Kerry Washington's work as Kay was also ""ok"" in my book. Director Kevin MacDonald can be called the ""Mac Director Daddy"" for assembling a gripping film on the personal corollary of dictatorship through one man's eyes. I also have to helm other cinematic players in ""the King's court"": Jeremy Brock's screenplay, Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography, Joshua Barraud's art direction, and Alex Heffe's musical score. However, it is that ""Forest"" through the trees that primarily branches the cinematic power of ""The Last King of Scotland"". **** Good"

In this movie Amin laughs, speaks with candor, is charming, and is supported by the people. But Amin is also capable of committing cruel acts of brutality against those who he believes are his enemies and will turn against his closest advisers if he detects even the slightest hint of disloyalty. For what Amin demands and expects most of all is unquestioning loyalty and in return he offers genuine friendship. Forrest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin is phenomenal.

Its fictional protagonist, Scotsman Nicholas Garrigan, relates how he came to be the personal physician and confidant of Idi Amin.<br/><br/>Since the story was based on true incidents, the role of Nicholas Garrigan was confusing at times whether it is real of fiction, which became clear to me only after doing some research.The plight of people suffering there in Idid Amin's dictatorship was shown phenomenally, and made us think how brutal a human being can be. The gory images in the movie filled me up with disgust for the dictator, at the same time also made me think whether showing these images to normal public is appropriate. Many times I had to close my eyes, as I was not able to watch those images, but then I guess, without those images movie wont have that impact.<br/><br/>I would suggest to definitely watching this movie to know a little about history."

The latest film to capture the continent is ""The Last King in Scotland' a story based on Ugandan dictator, Amin (Forest Whitaker), who befriends a young, Scottish doctor, Garrigan (McAvoy), during his regime in the 1970s. The result is an intriguing African thriller directed by Kevin MacDonald.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is the acting performances by both Whitaker and McAvoy. Whitaker won the golden globe for best actor, and deservedly so. His character is horrifying and likable, all at the same time. Likewise, McAvoy is vibrant and versatile, this will certainly be his breakout role.<br/><br/>The plot chronicles the relationship of the two men. Garrigan is Amin's personal doctor and becomes so entrenched with the President's life that it becomes impossible for him to accept the fact that Amin is more than just the charismatic statesmen. <br/><br/>The story was well documented but in the end it really didn't stand out from any other African movies I have seen recently. MacDonals uses a distorted coloring tone for the film, similar to Meirelles in ""The Constant Gardener."" And the film has disturbing moments like in 'Hotel Rwanda."" Let's be honest, many movies based in Africa have disturbing scenes, because Africa is not the most cheery of all places. There are diseases, poverty, violence, political unrest, etc. There are some scenes in this movie which will make even the strongest of viewers squirm, even though it is all done very well.<br/><br/>The ending result is an intriguing African thriller. Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy are the movie and carry the movie, successfully. Kevin MacDonald does a good job as director and the end result is a solid two hour of entertainment.<br/><br/>7 out of 10!"

","The 20th Century sadly gave the world some truly evil people, Hitler, Pinochet, Saddam Hussein, all hell bent on genocide, power and greed. Idi Amin was one, his promises to the Ugandan people, of new schools and hospitals, to put the country back on the map of Africa, were mere words and lies to deceive his people. The Last King Of Scotland, tells part of the story,and delivers a powerful and compelling film. Nicholas Garrigan (James Mcavoy ) just graduated from medical school, decides upon a spin of the globe to travel to Uganda. He takes a post in a Bush Hospital working with Dr Merritt and Merritt's wife Sarah ( Gillian Anderson ). After a freak car accident Garrigan meets Idi Amin played superbly by Forest Whitaker, Amin takes an instant liking to Garrigan, and offers him the position of his personal Physician. This offer is accepted, things could not be better for Garrigan, his life has changed, he meets Amin's 3rd Wife Kay ( Kerry Washington ) and starts a passionate affair with her, but he has yet to know the true horror of Amin's regime.Garrigan soon becomes an victim of the power and corruption of Amin's regime, a man unwittingly held against his will,once employed as a Doctor, now acting as adviser and confidante to Amin, depending on Amin's mood swings. Forest Whitaker gives us a truly powerful performance, for the best part of an hour we are led to believe that Amin cares about the Ugandan people, he comes across has a charming likable man, but the real Amin begins to show, a paranoid madman. Whitaker's acting is awesome, a worthy winner of a Golden Globe, it would be a travesty if he doesn't win a Oscar. This is a film that deserves to be seen, Kevin Macdonald's excellent direction, superb Cinematography and film editing, first rate acting from an inspired cast, make this a must.I doubt if i will see a better film this year. Quality Movies like this don't come along too often, this is serious and thought provoking film making. Highly recommended."

I wanted to see it when it was first released but they pulled out of theaters before I could finally see it. Then, the Golden Globes happened and Forest Whitaker won an award. Finally, I got to see it. The first part of the film opens so dull that I immediately thought I had made a mistake by going to see it. That wasn't true for long. As soon as Forrest Whitaker jumped on screen, his presence as an actor and as Idi Amin was felt throughout the entire theater. He really deserved to win the Golden Globe for Best Actor. I can't really describe his performance, well, because it was so well done. He created a likable character out of Amin. Which is scary in its own right because you, the audience member, are sucked into admiring him just like the James McAvoy's character is. I immediately took a liking to Amin, but I think thats what was suppose to happen. I eventually knew that he would soon show us his other side but I didn't care. The film is well photographed in 16mm, which lends to some of the grain of the picture. Which gives it a Texas Chain Saw Massacre look set in Uganda. The story unfolds like a suspenseful thriller, every minute you are on the edge of your seat. Constantly pondering what will happen next. I don't want to give any of it away but it's definitely one of those films you have to see to believe how spectacular it truly is."

","My wife and I were in a test preview audience when the film was in pre-production. I did tell them that the Gillian Anderson character was entirely spurious to the film and it would be better paced if they simply cut her scenes. She did her part perfectly well and her accent could not be faulted but it seemed to have been tacked on to give her some lines.<br/><br/>Other than being a bit overlong and dragging (in pre-production format) it was pretty good once the fictional doctor had been introduced to Idi Amin and we got into the real film.<br/><br/>Forrest Whitaker was hypnotic and despite not looking much like the late unlamented dictator he seemed convincing to me. How accurate his Ugandan accent was you would have to ask a Ugandan. It sounded OK to my totally untrained ear. If you saw him in the Crying Game then don't hold it against him."
"kane4782","9","1","2","13 January 2007"," Jovial, gritty and mesmerising, with a sensational performance by Whittaker
","Having read rave reviews on this film in numerous magazines and websites, and having seen the trailer, I went to see this with high hopes and it certainly did not disappoint! I will review this by breaking the film down into its three main acts that tantalisingly build upon each other to the eminent climax of the film.<br/><br/>Set in the 70's, we first see McAvoy's character, Nicolas, as an arrogant yet intelligent young man, who has just graduated university and about to embark on a career as a doctor under the wing of his rather snobbish and pretentious father. He realises that it is not the life he wants to lead and decides to go off on an adventure, where he can have fun and put his medical skills to good use at the same time. His destination, Uganda, where Idi Amin's military coup has just come into power. He joins a charity clinic and begins to help the sick people of Uganda together with the resident doctor and his wife, played by Gillian Anderson (of X-Files fame). These first 30 minutes, build a platform for the audience to gauge the type of character Nicolas is and the situation he has put himself in. Lightly entertaining, albeit a little slow paced. Anderson, having been away from the silver screen for a relatively long time, finds herself in a small yet significant role and in fine form.<br/><br/>In the second act, Nicolas encounters the new President himself, Idi Amin, through a rather bizarre and tense event. They become friends and Amin offers Nicolas a new job as his personal physician. The pace of the film picks up here and we see their friendship blossom. Whittaker and McAvoy have a great screen chemistry together, Whittaker coming across in this act as a tough and frightening leader, but with a sense of humour. McAvoy succeeds in his portrayal of someone who has strong beliefs, but wary of the fear Whittaker brings with Amin. As the film progresses, Nicolas becomes aware of the real Amin and their friendship deteriorates into a relationship based on fear. This is not helped by Nicolas's sexual advances towards one of Amins wives.<br/><br/>The final act and climax of the film is brutal, gory, intense and mesmerising. It develops the animosity between the two main characters, whereby Amin's rule over Uganda verges towards insanity and tyranny, and shapes what is to be a fantastic (and gruesome) finale. I won't go into further detail and spoil it for you, you will be on the edge of your seat by this point anyway.<br/><br/>To conclude, although McAvoy's performance is perfectly sound with inklings of a young Ewan McGregor, his character has been created to fit in with real events. This movie is all about Idi Amin and his portrayal by Forrest Whittaker is astounding. He thoroughly deserves the plaudits and should walk away with most (if not all) of the upcoming Best Actor awards. He has played many great supporting roles in the past and it is deeply satisfying to see him take the lead role and show what a genuinely fine actor he really is.<br/><br/>Last King did remind me of Hotel Rwanda and is not for the faint-hearted, but although along the same lines, it focuses on a real and evil protagonist that was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands. It is a startling reminder of the horrors of the world we live in and this should not be forgotten.<br/><br/>If you plan on seeing any film this year, make sure you see The Last King of Scotland. You will not regret it."

"keysersoze13","9","1","2","13 January 2007"," Outstanding, thrilling, surefire Oscar winner.
","'The Last King of Scotland' is intelligent and thrilling drama created with flawless acting, writing and direction. Directed by Kevin McDonald, making his fiction debut after acclaimed documentaries 'One Day in September' and 'Touching the Void', brings Giles Foden's novel to the screen with flair and creates a haunting and entertaining cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The film is based on Foden's fictional book, which constructs a fictional story from true events surrounding Idi Amin, Ugandan dictator and self-proclaimed 'Last King of Scotland'. Amin ruled Uganda as a tyrant, responsible for the deaths of, as the film explains, at least 300,000 of his people. The film mixes fact and fiction to follow the fictional character of Nicholas Garrigan - who is inspired by real people - a young Scottish doctor, as he spontaneously travels to Uganda, determined to do what he can to improve the nation. There he meets, by chance, Amin and is soon appointed his personal physician. Nicholas gradually becomes a greater part of Amin's life, as Amin does in his and slowly becomes aware of the dangerous position that he is in, one where he cannot escape.<br/><br/>The film's script comes from Jeremy Brock (writer/director of 'Driving Lessons') and Peter Morgan, currently earning acclaim for his script for the award-winning 'The Queen' and his hit West End play 'Frost/Nixon'. Their screenplay blends humour, tragedy and emotional human drama with two complex lead characters to tremendous effect. The two men are fascinating and captivating characters.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent. The film is well-paced, with breathtaking locations and urgent, often hand-held cinematography that give gritty realism that doesn't glorify the story in gloss as could have happened if left in the hands of Hollywood. But this production is in good hands, with a Scottish director and English screenwriters.<br/><br/>The film really comes alive with the outstanding performances of the talented cast, in particular Forest Whitaker as Amin and James McAvoy as Garrigan. Whitaker thoroughly deserves the Best Actor Oscar for his blistering and intense portrayal as the dictator, searing across the screen alternately charming and terrifying. McAvoy does not allow himself to be upstaged by Whitaker's powerful screen presence, and his performance will at least gain him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His performance is every bit as compelling as Whitaker's, as he creates a character whose actions render him difficult to like, but crucially we can sympathise with in the climactic scenes. Great support comes from Kerry Washington as one of Amin's wives, David Oyelowo as McAvoy's predecessor as personal physician and Simon McBurney as a sleazy, manipulative Englishman.<br/><br/>'The Last King of Scotland' is a thoroughly deserving Oscar contender and a truly great piece of film."
"lindawriter-1","9","1","2","9 January 2007"," Blistering performance from Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin
","Ever since I saw Forest Whitaker in 'Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai' at the end of the nineties I've wanted to see him in another meaty, lead role. This was it. His performance as the tyrant Idi Amin is blistering and this alone makes the film worth seeing. I remember the coup in Uganda when Amin took over, and I remember the ensuing TV footage that chronicled the rise and fall of his violent, lunatic regime. I seem to remember also that Amin really did crown himself King of Scotland. In the first few minutes of watching this film the memories of those days came flooding back: it was uncomfortable and compelling to watch. The film is based on Giles Foden's novel of the same name and focuses on a period in the life of the newly qualified Scottish medical doctor Nicholas Garrigan, beautifully played by James McAvoy, who leaves his Scottish home in search of adventure in Uganda, where he finds work as a doctor in a poor area. He arrives in Uganda on the day of Amin's coup. By chance the naive, heavy drinking and womanising Garrigan meets Amin who takes him on as his personal physician and adviser. After a brief period of living the high life in the capital, Kampala, Garrigan realises his mistake and decides to leave. However, his plan backfires and the horror begins. Real TV footage and references to historical fact are used during the film to emphasise the underlying truth of the story, including the hijacking at Entebbe. There's humour and suspense in this brilliant film and the tension builds up until the last moment. The only criticism I have is that the terror unleashed by Amin is understated, but maybe this was a conscious decision because it mirrors the young doctor's naivet√© and blindness to what was going on during Amin's tyrannical regime."
"lee_a_scott","9","1","2","8 January 2007"," Powerful stuff.
","What's better than seeing a really good film? Seeing a really good film for free at an advance screening! The point was to get the film notice via word of mouth, and I am more than happy to do my bit. This is an excellent film, and Forest Whitaker totally deserves the Oscar buzz that he's got going ¬ñ managing to make Idi Amin believably charming is the easy bit, but being terrifyingly monstrous without resorting to Paciono-esquire scenery chewing is a great achievement. The film perfectly strikes a difficult balance between accurately conveying the horror of the situation without using unrealistic Christ like characters, as Hotel Rwanda suffered from. James McAvoy's Nicholas is, essentially, not a pleasant character, but is the one to root for by virtue of being less bad than Amin. By making the characters believably flawed, the whole comes off as more powerful and moving than several similar movies, and is well worth seeing. Top class."
"ecko_47","9","1","2","2 January 2007"," Idi Amin in his glory
","He thundered and loomed and joshed and clasped. He made terrible threats and effusive promises. He laughed and raged and told bad jokes and saw enemies in the shadows and was equally at home in a dashiki as he was in a kilt.<br/><br/>He was Idi Amin -- or, as he preferred, His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, King of Scotland, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular. And his rule over Uganda in the 1970s was as capricious and bloody and mad as that ridiculous title suggests.<br/><br/>Amin, who died in exile in 2003, was a massive figure -- comical and quixotic and utterly deadly -- whose image has faded from popular culture, where he was once a favorite subject for documentaries and comic spoofs. But with ""The Last King of Scotland,"" Amin, as portrayed with ferocious, convincing energy and zeal by Forest Whitaker, returns in all his ghastly glory. And Whitaker is so good as to ensure that anyone who sees the film will never forget Amin again.<br/><br/>Technically, ""Last King"" isn't Amin's story. It rather concerns itself with the misadventures of Nicholas Garrigan, a (fictional) recently minted doctor who decides to taste a bit of the world before inheriting his father's medical practice in Scotland. Spinning a globe, he hits on Uganda, where he makes a brief run at a fling with a married woman (Gillian Anderson) before his fateful encounter with Amin, after which he is sucked up by the president as if by a tornado, moving to the capital city, running in fast crowds and serving both as personal physician and trusted adviser to the mercurial madman.<br/><br/>Garrigan is played by James McEvoy (Mr. Tumnus from ""The Chronicles of Narnia""), and it's a quite able performance: frisky and assertive and sexy and foolish in turns. But he positively vanishes beside Whitaker, who delivers a career-best performance as the sweaty, insidious, booming, glad-handing monster (and I say ""career-best"" with Whitaker's work in ""Bird"" well in mind). The readiest comparison is ""Training Day,"" in which Ethan Hawke was very good and could barely hold his place on screen next to Denzel Washington. For this performance alone, ""Last King"" is a substantial piece of work.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film is estimable but not quite great. Working from an adaptation of Giles Foden's novel of the same name, director Kevin MacDonald creates an episodic and sometimes meandering story involving palace intrigues, adultery, British interference in Ugandan affairs and the famous raid on Entebbe, where the airline passengers hijacked by Palestinians were rescued by Israeli commandos. Some of this is supported by solid performances by Kelly Washington as one of Amin's wives and Simon McBurney as a British diplomat. But it still lacks the force of a more straightforward narrative.<br/><br/>As if to mirror the squirrelly storytelling, MacDonald and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (who's worked on many Dogme films) adopt a herky-jerky camera style, which, along with fussy editing, actually manages the unlikely trick of diluting Whitaker's performance. Too often we want to stare into that titanic, crazy face, only to have our attention diverted to McEvoy's milky reaction. We don't need a stand-in for our shock and awe here -- Whitaker summons it quite effectively."
"sonofgodtrujesus","Null","1","2","26 December 2006"," Best film of the year?
","I loved this movie. Visually, the look of this film was beautiful. I watched this film a second time before it left theaters because it was so funky and fun to look at; it's like being submerged into the past. The actors were all perfectly cast, lending to the feel and reality of the film. The tension in this film is masterfully built up until tight and strangulating; you literally feel the pressure. What was really enjoyable though about this film was the transformation of the actors in becoming their characters; everyone seemed to be working in unison, flawlessly. What really impressed me about this film though was how it dealt with the violence of the dictator; it was not intrusive or used as a means of drawing attention to the screen. This film was solely carried by great performances and the directors ability to set the mood and environment of the film with his skill behind the camera. I would definitely add this movie to my collection. And have told just about everyone that I've met to see this film; my choice for film of the year."
"madbeast","7","1","2","16 December 2006"," Powerful But Gruesome
","This telling of the rise of Idi Amin as told through the eyes of the young Scottish physician who found himself in the dictator's inner circle long before he realized that was a dangerous place to be is a compelling, powerful film despite some incredibly graphic depictions of violence that are so horrific that they take the viewer out of the film rather than drawing him into it.<br/><br/>I was somewhat surprised that Forrest Whittaker has won so many acting awards for his performance. He does a fine job as Amin and provides a chilling and complex presence, but it is to me really a supporting role (despite Whittaker's top billing) and the outstanding performance of the film is James McAvoy in the more challenging role of the young Scotsman who is at first charmed by the dictator and is soon horrified by him. The film is really McAvoy's character's story, and while I don't suggest that he should have been the rightful recipient of the awards that went to Whittaker (I would give my vote to Peter O'Toole in ""Venus""), I think he has been seriously undervalued in the praise of his fine performance (as is the superb Kerry Washington in the pivotal roles as one of Amin's wives).<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" is a fine movie, but there were some sequences that were so gruesome that I had to look away from the screen. In those moments, I was very aware that I was in a audience watching a film rather than feeling a part of it. I think the excellent performances of Whittaker, Washington and especially McAvoy would have been far better served by a more suggestive approach."
"annoman","8","1","2","22 October 2006"," Shot with precision and detailed with informative dialogue, viewers have the opportunity to dwell in the mind of one of the world's most vicious fiends.
","Forest Whitaker inhabits the heartless monster of Idi Amin, Uganda's President from 1971-1979, with ease as he leads a cast of stellar performances in this true story of corruption in a country so hopeless its residents would follow any leader who rose to the opportunity. Subsequently, in 1971, Idi Amin was elected the Ugandan President for some years to come. In the eight years following his initiation, his unflinching thirst for power would lead to deaths of more than 300,000 Hindus, Christians, and Lango tribes. The number of deaths by persecution that Uganda witnessed during Amin's tenure as President stands as one of the highest death tolls one nation's leader has been responsible for since Adolf Hitler. The Last King of Scotland recounts the terrifying story of Amin's rule through the view-point of a young Scottish doctor, who travels to Uganda to aid the fight against disease that the population was succumbing to. James McAvoy, in his most prominent role to date, is fit for the role at hand. We watch his character, Nick Garrigan, as he is adopted into Amin's regime as the President's personal physician. As young Nick realizes the corruption and willful malevolence of the leader, he begins to scheme an overthrow of the reigning dictator; to save his life and the life of thousands of Ugandans. Kevin McDonald goes about his depiction of the events that took place in a fashion reminiscent of 2004's Downfall, which told the story of the last days of Hitler's reign through the eyes of his private secretary. Shot with precision and detailed with informative dialogue, viewers have the opportunity to dwell in the mind of one of the world's most vicious fiends."
"xander34","8","1","2","22 October 2006"," Last King a riveting look at despotic demon
","Whether playing a tough high school football player in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, legendary jazz musician Charlie Parker in Bird or a mafia hit-man in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Forest Whitaker has always given solid, occasionally great performances.<br/><br/>Yet, only with his role in The Last King of Scotland will Whitaker finally receive the respect he deserves. In his first non-documentary feature, director Kevin Macdonald gives a highly ambitious look at Ugandan dictator Idi Amin (Whitaker) through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy) in the 1970s.<br/><br/>Macdonald definitely shows his documentary roots through the use of extensive location shooting in Uganda, giving a guerrilla, authentic approach to the film. He also uses a fair amount of hand-held camera-work, grain and noticeable zooms to give this political thriller a documentary feel. The cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, utilizes high-contrast, deeply saturated images of Uganda with a prevalent light brown hue.<br/><br/>The pacing is fast, and the style, technique, costumes and music accurately illustrate the '70s feel. When we first meet Idi Amin, he's portrayed as a humorous but intense politician who has just become Uganda's president.<br/><br/>However, by the end of the film, the humor is gone. We finally get to see Amin's true colors.<br/><br/>Whitaker brilliantly captures the intensity and brutality of Amin, while maintaining his charismatic qualities. He is so convincing, that the footage of the real Idi Amin, spliced into the end of the film, completely flows.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Jeremy Brock, Peter Morgan, and Joe Penhall, based on the novel by Giles Foden, actually focuses more on the naive Dr. Garrigan than on Amin. Garrigan would be too unlikable to care about in any other film, with his arrogance, selfishness, and ignorance. His naivet√© seems appealing at first, then idiotic, and eventually completely loathsome. But what saves his character flaws is the on screen chemistry between him and Whitaker, and a strong performance by McAvoy. However, what is entirely misleading is the statement ""This film is inspired by true events,"" as the McAvoy character is fictional.<br/><br/>The last half hour of the film ultimately becomes a thriller, coupled with a few scenes of absolute horror. Audiences will cringe in disgust at the violence attributed to Amin, who reportedly killed more than 300,000 Ugandans, while staying on the edge of their seats when not covering their eyes in terror.<br/><br/>The suspenseful final scene at the Entebbe airport provides a painful, though emotionally satisfying ending to a heavy handed film.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland is an extremely powerful film, with a commanding performance by Whitaker."
"Tecun_Uman","8","1","2","22 October 2006"," One great performance and One good film
","Forrest Whitaker shines in this film, a shine that is usually rewarded come Oscar time. He is able to show the charisma and madness that was Idi Amin. Warm and inviting one moment and crazed and delusional the next. The other performances in this film were good as well, but it is Whitaker that shines. The story is about a young Scotsman that is not quite ready to accept the comfort and conformity that is waiting for him as a family doctor in Scotland. So, he decides to spin the globe and wherever his finger lands is where he will go. Of course he is seeking some adventure and when the first spin lands on Canada, well, it's spin again. On the second spin he hits Angola and the adventure begins. Through a number of events our young doctor ends up becoming Idi Amin's personal physician and so much more. Now, I will admit, that I thought some of the story twists were a bit too far out there, the kinds of things that makes a movie say that it is ""based"" on a real story. And yes, the movie does start to tire a little towards the second half. But overall, it is by far one of the best films I have seen this year and one of the strongest performances."
"saint_barbie","8","1","2","19 October 2006"," A thrilling journey into the presence of a dictator
","This is a stand-out brilliant portrait of Idi Amin's rule of Uganda, from a fascinating and unique angle. A young Scottish doctor, totally ignorant of African politics or society, goes out to work in a village hospital, and gets sucked in to Amin's personal clique.<br/><br/>Nicholas, the doctor character, is subtle and wonderfully conceived, and played with great charm by James McAvoy. He's an excellent protagonist - most of the audience will know very little about Uganda or Idi Amin, but this doesn't matter, because he doesn't, either. Gradually, he goes through a process of developing his thoughts, taking the audience along with him. By the end of the film, you suddenly realise you know a lot more than you did at the start - although the film is far too thrilling to be classed as a history lesson.<br/><br/>McAvoy's performance, while first-class, is inevitably overshadowed by the real treat of the film - Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin himself. To anyone familiar with the dictator, there will actually be times when you'll find it hard to believe that you aren't watching him in person. It is completely impossible to tear your eyes off Whitaker whenever he's on screen: he's compelling, terrifying, dynamic, and oddly tender at moments. It's the performance of a lifetime, and he deserves to be richly recognised for it. For me, Whitaker in this film stands alongside Bruno Ganz's extraordinary performance as Hitler in 'Downfall', as the best on-screen depiction of a dictator I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The only problem, for those not familiar with Idi Amin, is that at times you might almost think the filmmakers are exaggerating - that he seems too evil, too insane, too cartoonish. Unfortunately, the portrait is totally accurate. The real Amin was everything the film shows him to be, and more.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland is stunning, shocking, and the best film about Africa I've seen for years. See it!"

","Forest Whittaker and Kevin McAvoy in Kevin McDonald's new film Last King of Scotland display the kind of brilliant on-screen magic any director can dream of. Haunting the screen with his ogre-like frame and wickedly alluring smile Whittaker plays the role of Idi Amin, the Ugandan President put in power by the British in a time of hostility and despair. McAvoy, opposite of Whittaker, plays the role of a young Scottish doctor, Nicolas Carrigan, free-spirited and naive enough to become Amin's personal physician. Never actually seeing the violence of Amin on-screen, both the audience and Carrigan are fooled by Amin's artful craftiness. Shot in a documentary style, almost guerrilla at times, McDonald captures the true sorrow and passion that Whittaker portrays with such ease it is repeatedly scary. Also bringing remarkable roles to the screen are the two main female characters, Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington. Anderson as a lonely relief worker, that lacks attention from her relief engrossed husband, brings a deep character to the screen in just a few scenes, and then disappears all too quickly. Washington as one Amin's multiple wives helps bring the fear of Amin to the screen in a tale where the visage of deception is lifted far too late. As the film draws to its conclusion Whitaker is unleashed and transforms into a roaring monster of a man, making the last scenes of the film almost unwatchable. We cannot help but watch the brutal African rituals McDonald brings to life in an airport terminal Duty Free shop, no less. Finally, McDonald has crafted a beautifully haunting portrayal of a man so enthralled by the passion for his country, he destroys both himself and Uganda."

While his mesmerizing performance is Oscar worthy, it definitely does not take away form James McAvoys turn as the good doctor. The supporting cast is pitch perfect, especially Kerry Washington, portraying Kay Amin, one of Idi Amins wives. The grainy and gritty photography serves this film well, as do all the arts; sets, costumes, hair and makeup, etc., depicting early 1970's Uganda. A note to the squeamish, there is much violence, none of which is gratuitous, and extremely disturbing, considering this genocide was real and it did take place.

I'd agree that it's much more of a supporting performance, but it could have won the Oscar in either category. James McAvoy just really pales in comparison, but he's actually not that bad - just not noteworthy. The story jumps around a lot and doesn't really seem to do justice to what was going on in the country - too much attention is paid to the doctor's sexual exploits. The climax is kind of sudden and as a result the film ends on a down note. Still, the script is well-written and Whitaker really does carry the film, but it's not that great of a film because of it."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","2","7","29 March 2007"," Absolutely hateful and sickening
","Such a character as Amin Dada is hateful, and absolutely repulsive. To make a film about him is even worse than the character himself because we cannot dismiss the story at the end of the film and have to realize it is a true story that can happen again any time. Some westerners will come along and install some bloody tyrant in the place of a leader the said westerners will not like. Then they will always manage to get rid of this tyrant after, in this case, six hundred thousand dead. It is always easy for the west to sacrifice a few hundred thousand people in some supposedly backward and underdeveloped country. But the film is disgusting because a young and small Scottish doctor who is running away from his oppressive father gets baited by the monstrous grotesque and disgusting tyrant in some kind of perverse father transfer. This young kid is silly, unconscious, absurd, idiotic, criminal, absolutely spaced out to the point of making love to the President's wife and what's more getting her pregnant. She will end up dismembered and a few other Elizabethan niceties in front of her own children and he will nearly die hanging from butcher's hooks in the chest and bled like a pig if a Ugandan doctor did not save him and help him escape though he will die, and he knew it, five minutes later with a bullet in his head. We can always content ourselves with the idea the tyrant was a tyrant. But how can we satisfy our doubts with the idea that a western doctor could be the willing accomplice for a while at least and then the cowardly accomplice in spite of all his education and oaths. He does not even have the courage of killing himself to maybe remain clean in his own eyes.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

Soon enough, Dr Garrigan is working for the dictator, as his personal doctor and then closest adviser. The young guy is blind-sided by power. At a certain point, you ask yourself who's more crazy: the doctor or the dictator? While Whitaker is great, McAvoy offers an average, sometimes weak, performance. <br/><br/>The movie is a must just because it shows what kind of a man was Amin and how he made his people suffer. On the downside, the film stays on the surface and offers us no real explanation on how Amin got to lead his country. This fact is not saved by a few footnotes at the end of the movie. Finally, one could say the movie is more about Dr Garrigan's life than Idi Amin's one and the tragedy of the Ugandan people.<br/><br/>Seen in Toronto, at the Fox, on March 3rd, 2007.<br/><br/>81/100 (***)"

","With the fine cast assembled here, it'd be hard to go off-track with this story, (the brutal reign of the leader of Uganda Idi Amin) yet somehow that's exactly what seems to happen. It's also hard to imagine anyone but Forrest Whitaker playing Idi Amin. Whitaker captures the compelling, competent and confident personality that drew supporters and followers from all over the continent, (as at first many felt Amin personified post-colonial Africa of the 1970's with the slogan ""Africa for Africans"") - but that quickly went horribly wrong. Whitaker also emanates real and scary menace portraying the real Idi Amin that the world came to know that became the tyrant and despot that ruled Uganda during the 1970's. But with the telling of the story through white doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) causes something to get lost in translation.<br/><br/>Certainly using the white protagonist does make the story easier to watch for some of us as the easily-identifiable character. But while there's a lot happening here, none of it seems interesting or even coherent for long. The audience is not carried along by the story so much as led by fits and starts. Garrigan comes to realize that the formerly warm and pleasant Uganda he had come to like, has become a tropical prison that he'll never be allowed to leave (since Amin values his services too highly to permit this). But other then Garrigan's obvious (and very relatable) terror at this revelation, there's not a lot that's interesting happening in the story.. Limited by budget restraints, presumably, the story can't keep things entertaining enough and too much seems to happen off-screen. The story had a lot of potential - Idi Amin was a very ""exciting"" guy while running uganda as he did (into the ground) - but this movie somehow captures very little of it.<br/><br/>Might be worth a watch for Whitaker's interesting portrayal of Idi Amin, and the whole take on Uganda during this time. Other then that there's little of interest in the story."

","Don't get me wrong; ""The Last King of Scotland"" really isn't a bad movie but it's just one that remains a bit too bland with its story and characters. The lack of depth is disappointing, though it obviously still remains a well done movie overall.<br/><br/>It's almost as if the film-makers were playing it safe. It's not really a shocking or disturbing movie or one that shows the madness and horror of Idi Amin and his regime. It instead is a movie that more so tells its own fictionalized story, which is of course its own good right.<br/><br/>Still it would had made the movie a far more powerful and effective one if it actually did showed some of the stuff that actually had happened during the Idi Amin regime. Now instead we only get a few lines of text at the end of the movie that tells some of the horrible stuff Idi Amin was responsible for. This was the same problem I had with ""Blood Diamond"". If you try to make a point or impact on the viewers you should do so in your movie and with your story and not with a couple of lines at the end of your movie.<br/><br/>But lets judge the movie for what it is. And it actually really is a well done film, that however could had used some more development and a better story in it. The story as well as its characters remain a bit bland throughout the entire movie, which causes the it to not really work out as effectively with any of its tension. The tension only suddenly starts to kick in by the end of the movie but at this point the movie also suddenly turns into a far too over-Hollywoodized one, which really isn't in tone with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>You have to give the movie credit though for remaining a pleasant watch throughout, despite of its heavy and serious subject matter. I think it's only a good thing that the movie doesn't take itself so heavily, which actually only strengthens the movie its madness.<br/><br/>Fore there is also really no doubt about it that Idi Amin was one crazy person, which gets beautifully captured and portrayed by Forest Whitaker. It seemed like an odd choice at first for him to portray Idi Amin, since he doesn't look much like him and Forest Whitaker isn't exactly known for playing though and 'villainoush' characters. But he really made the role his own and he became Idi Amin. Yes, he truly deserved the Oscar for his role! But with all this talk about Forest Whitaker people are not giving enough credit to all of the other actors in this movie. James McAvoy and Kerry Washington are both also really great and it was the first time really that James McAvoy could show how capable he is of playing a leading role in a big movie. This performance was more or less his big breakthrough, which he also really deserved and earned for himself, with his performances over the years.<br/><br/>It's a good movie to watch, just don't expect it to make a big or lasting impact on you, or shock or emote you. It's good to watch but nothing more than that really. It will only leave you hungry and interesting in a true Ida Amin biopic or read- and find more out about him, since this movie isn't really giving you enough.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"elshikh4","4","1","3","25 December 2009"," Watchable movie about a guy who falls for the wives of others !
","..more than one about the former Ugandan president (Idi Amin)!<br/><br/>This script transformed the whole thing into a melodrama mixed with some thrill at the end, not a movie about a nation or a dictator.<br/><br/>I believe the scriptwriter sunk in the character of the imaginary doctor, and his passion over the married women. This wasn't a right choice itself, because aside from taking a big part of (Idi Amin)'s transgressions and crimes, it took a lot from the lead's purity. That unsettled the character to face what he really deserves, and to be one of the last persons to judge the title's character. Actually when the husband gets revenge on the one who cheats his trust, and sleeps with his own wife, that, surely, gets the audience's sympathy, yet with the husband! Plus I didn't feel that the love affair between the doctor and the president's wife was a romance between 2 birds imprisoned in golden cages. For him, it was kind of emotional, too unbelievably risky, reaction towards taking away his freedom (or an affair with new married woman!). And for her?? The movie didn't give us convincing excuse to cheat on her husband else he's not that handsome young man!<br/><br/>There are many goofy points all along: the British diplomat speaks his mind freely in front of anyone white! (Amin) has no intelligence agency, knowing the place of his suspected minister only from his doctor who saw the man accidentally?! I didn't get why (Amin) doesn't permit his ill son, who has epilepsy, to get a remedy?? And how oh how this scary dictator knew about the affair between his wife and his doctor, and did nothing about it??? Moreover, Dr. (Garrigan) ran over an innocent victim at the assassination scene while he has no regret about that after? We knew nothing about (Gillian Anderson)'s husband who we don't see at the end while her escape?! And the movie portrays the (Entebbe) situation as the climax of (Amin)'s crimes, while it didn't give us any enlightenment about its details in the same time!<br/><br/>Who's (Idi Amin) in this movie? Look at the first meeting between the 2 main characters. The president didn't get mad over someone who grabbed his gun, and used it in front of him without his permission?!! He was happy that the doctor spoke his mind frankly (where was that?!), or how he thought totally afterwards that that doctor ""saved his life""? We didn't even know what happened originally between the president and the cow? Then in another, more intimate, meeting between the 2 men, after curing the president's stomach, we think that finally we'll get the chance to hear something that may clear (Amin)'s depths, but we don't! And all what we had about even the man's awful deeds was a swift TV report, a hasty expulsion decision, then a couple of phrases here and there. Hence, it's not who's (Amin) in this movie?, it's rather where's (Amin) in this movie?<br/><br/>The third act was provocatively weird. It turns suddenly into cheap thriller, where the defeated lover wants to revenge on the husband who revenged on his unfaithful ones (is it a remake of Tony Scott's Revenge?!). So we have a suspense around will the president take the poison or not?, will his security manager take it instead of him or not?, will the boy get away with it, escape, going to be caught or not? And when the movie ends with his escape followed by the end of (Amin)'s regime; it's the top of idiocy as if this doctor was the one who exposed the truth to the world, being the basic reason of the dictator's windup!!<br/><br/>Still, this doctor's escape was justified from the movie makers, since he was what exactly; less evil, or hopeless lover?!! The dialogue of the Ugandan doctor at the end summarized the confusion of this script: ""I don't know why I'm doing this. Maybe to redeem yourself and tell the world the truth about Idi Amin""?? So, what we learn from that? I'll tell you: Cheat on your crazy president, and it's fine since he's crazy! Paranoid men execute their closest men for a slight doubt, yet forgive their wives' adultery till the wife is pregnant with else's child! And yeah, the African presidents leave the ones who sleep with their wives free and harmless till they have a hostage situation in their airport!<br/><br/>The director kept things going on so tense. The image and the pace are hot, but not like (Amin) himself. Sometimes focusing on the man's exaggerated movements was smart, and sometimes it was just boring, especially with no showing for his inside as another stereotypical psychopath who's not worth exploring. ""You're a child, so that's why you're scary"" isn't an enough analysis. And after a whole movie, about a naughty doc, provided with the compulsory, forever disgusting, sex and nudity--it's naive. So with fictional story about one of (Amin)'s wives who sleeps with others to be pregnant with illegitimate son, then it's like calling the title's character names. Namely this movie didn't try to understand (Idi Amin), didn't get to show his corruption clearly, while what it did was enjoying humiliating him by fictional events. So despite the believable job that (Whitaker) did, I suspect that choosing him, with the obvious matter of his eye, was for utter deformation. But, as most of the movie, it was outwardly and false deformation more than the internal and real one.<br/><br/>With this movie, I did see the title's character, but didn't know him. I watched a drama about a boy who falls only for the married women, where the *last king of Scotland* was another cheated husband! At the end, the Ugandan doctor says to the Scottish boy: ""Tell the world about what happened in Uganda"". Well, explicitly after the end of this movie, I needed someone to do the same for me!"
"MartinHafer","8","1","3","6 September 2008"," While far from a perfect film it is quite mesmerizing and you can't stop watching
","THE LAST KING OF Scotland came on HBO last night and I had no intention in watching it then--just recording it to watch later. After all, it was late and the movie wouldn't be over until well after 2am. But, on a lark, I decided to at least watch the first 15 or 20 minutes. Over two hours later, I was watching the final credits--so much for ""just watching a bit""! The reason I kept watching is because the film was very well constructed--especially in the first portion of the film. You KNOW had things are going to happen, but you find yourself seduced by Idi Amin's charm. So, just like the fictional doctor, you are carried along by the promise of a newer and better Uganda.<br/><br/>While I wasn't thrilled with basing the film around a fictitious man, perhaps this was best because many of the people around Amin at the beginning are dead and perhaps there weren't any real people that could have been an interesting anchor for the film. However, what I really didn't like was the plot involving this doctor becoming sexually involved with one of Amin's wives. It just seemed ridiculous that any couple would be THAT horny when it's obvious that Amin is a violent and unforgiving man. It made no sense at all and seemed like it was added in order to ""sex up the film"". It also took too much focus off Amin's madness and resulted in a bizarre scene near the end reminiscent of A MAN CALLED HORSE that also seemed unnecessary.<br/><br/>However, these concerns, though important, were not so bad as to seriously impact the film. Forrest Whitaker's performance was exceptional and the film was certainly exciting throughout. I highly recommend the film despite my few complaints, however I also highly recommend this film NOT be seen by kids or teens. It is a very hard R-rated film--with lots of unavoidable violence and lots of gratuitous nudity."
"dromasca","6","1","3","4 August 2008"," the superb performance by Forest Whitaker is part of the failure of this film
","One of the problems with 'The Last King of Scotland' is that it is too much a pleasant and commercial film. Dealing with one of the most horrible dictators of the 20th century the makers of this film may have been concerned that the subject is too difficult for a film to be successful. They so try to create a flawless action (although the final looks less credible) and they casted Forest Whitaker to act as Idi Amin. His act is superb, but is also part of the failure of the film in my eyes.<br/><br/>The balancing figure of the film and the main character filling the screen time is the dictator personal physician acted by James McAvoy. He is also meant to symbolize the blindness and indifference of the post colonial West, less caring about the human rights in the colonies they just abandoned and failing to understand both local realities as well as the evil of some of the rulers they put in place. However, the young McAvoy is a miscast, he is too young and without being a bad actor misses the complexity and angoisse that must have stroked a real doctor Garrigan.<br/><br/>So the film is left on the shoulders of Whitaker, whose Amin is credible, although probably not historically true. His superb acting holds the movie together with the splendid camera work and makes it enjoyable if one can enjoy the fascination of evil, but overall the movie misses to tell many of the truths it could about Africa and dictatorship. I was disappointed."

I went into this expecting to see a great performance in a not so good film but came out pretty satisfied all the way around. The film loses points in its final act as it tries to be something it's not, an action film but other than that I really enjoyed the movie. McAvoy does a good job carrying the majority of the film and Gillian Anderson also impressed me in her small role. The film of course belongs to Whitaker who turns in the performance of his career. I guess there could be a debate about whether he was a supporting role or a lead but either way his performance hits all the right notes. I loved the way Whitaker plays the General as a charming man even though deep down he's nothing more than a murdering scumbag. The physical presence Whitaker brings to the role allows him to be frightening even without saying a word. Each time Whitaker walks on screen you can feel the evilness of his soul yet, as I said, Whitaker also manages to make him charming and funny."
"Author_Poet_Aberjhani","10","1","3","20 January 2008"," Shockingly Absurd and Profoundly Brilliant
","Anyone who caught Forest Whitaker as jazz great Charlie Parker in the Clint Eastwood directed ""Bird"" (1988) may easily have found themselves thinking, ""Wow, an actor with that kind of genius is bound to win an Oscar one day!"" But who could have guessed that it might be for Whitaker's titanic portrayal of the former Ugandan President Idi Amin in the riveting film THE LAST KING OF Scotland? A too-quick assessment of this film might make a viewer think it's one more good movie about a larger-than-life ruler seduced and corrupted by power. A second welcomed study reveals that it's actually a great movie about not one, but two men seduced and corrupted by the lures of power. Idi Amin is definitely one of them but so is the Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan, played with wonderful naivety and passion by James McAvoy.<br/><br/>For Idi Amin, as portrayed here, the seduction is irresistible and ultimately self-destructive because of a need to rise above the humiliations of his past and to meet the demands of a changing Africa. Garrigan finds himself seduced by power largely because Amin makes it available to him when he adopts the Scottish native as his personal physician, only to increasingly demand he serve as a top political adviser. Instead of refusing to give advice he's neither informed enough nor trained to provide, Garrigan enjoys being flattered to the point that he boldly has an affair with Kay Amin, the president's wife, played by the stunning Kerry Washington. Consequently, one moment he is embracing Amin as a father figure, and in the next he is suffering the kind of brutal fate no one likes to imagine.<br/><br/>""The Last King of Scotland"" swings brilliantly back and forth between shocking absurdity and outright tragedy. It's easy enough to see toward the film's beginning that Amin is a leader with true love for his people. Yet it becomes equally apparent as the film progresses that his private terrors and political wrath are at least as monumental as any love he holds. To blend such a range of psychological extremes with credibility that evokes both outrage and even, at times, empathy, is not a feat that many actors could have pulled off, but lo and behold: Mr. Whitaker did.<br/><br/>News coming out of Uganda during the 1970s invariably presented Amin as a bloodthirsty dictator allowed to run amok with his heinous inclinations unchecked before finally being exiled to Saudi Arabia. ""The Last King of Scotland,"" based on Giles Foden's novel, gives us a more complete portrait of a very complex man and country.<br/><br/>by Aberjhani, author of ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance"""
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","14 January 2008"," A tale of seduction let down by a poor final third
","With its 'inspired by true events' rider, The Last King of Scotland tries to persuade the casual viewer that is a true story when it is really just a fictional flight of fancy built around the dangerous but charismatic Ugandan despot Idi Amin. While the story eventually descends into trite melodrama, what comes before gives a reasonably believable depiction of how it must feel to be trapped in a country where human rights count for little, and human life is easily dispensable, even though the subject matter could just as easily have been the seductive allure of crime or drugs.<br/><br/>While James McAvoy gives a decent portrayal of an arrogant young man whose mistaken assumption that he is untouchable belies the youthful impulses that drive him, he would always have been overshadowed by the role of Amin, regardless of who played him, and even had his shallow role not been so poorly developed. As it is, it's doubtful whether the producers could have made a better choice than Forest Whitaker, both physically and performance-wise. Whitaker seems to effortlessly capture the essence of Amin: a cheeky bear of a man, all toothy smile and gleaming eyes, hiding a brooding paranoid who is liable to burst through the cuddly fa√ßade at any moment. It's a role that could easily have toppled over into broad parody in less capable hands, but Whitaker is admirable restrained and never allows himself to be swept away by the role.<br/><br/>It is probably the relationship between Garrigan, McAvoy's callow young doctor, and the bloodthirsty dictator that is the film's strength and, given Garrigan's brash disdain for those who are of no use to him, there is a certain guilty pleasure to be derived from his eventual downfall. And that is probably the film's weakness ¬ñ given that a certain naivety is required on the doctor's part, the film goes too far, failing to pull back and allow the viewer to develop some sympathy for him."

He also flirts with one of his wives (played by Regina Washington)and delves into a game of deceit with the dictator.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker's portrayal of the troubled, charismatic leader is riveting and worthy of all the attention and awards it got him, but James McAvoy's performance is a very good counterpoint to the story in general, and in the many scenes they have together in particular. These are probably the best scenes of the movies and are intricately woven from fine dialogue and dead-on performances.<br/><br/>The ending was a little unoriginal and seemed a bit forced and not well explored. It could have had a better treatment and tied all the elements in a better, smoother way, I suspect. The last line of the movie is appropriately ironic and humorous, however.<br/><br/>The viewpoint of a foreign doctor thrusted into Ugundan politics and slowing learning of the implications is an interesting one and makes for a great story.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a young doctor who travels out to Africa to help with the famine and poverty that is ravaging it in the 1970s. But he unexpectedly catches the eye of the current ruler, Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) who takes him under his wing and, in return, asks him to be his personal psysician. At first Nicholas can see nothing wrong with the seemingly jolly and warm-hearted ruler, but like many rulers before him, Amin soon becomes corrupted by power and enforces a brutal and barbaric regeime. Trapped in a situation he can't get out of, Nicholas is left caught between a rock and a hard place.<br/><br/>During the late 80s and early 90s, all Forest Whitaker could enjoy were comedy black guy roles in films like Bloodsport and Blown Away but who'd have thought that by 2007 he'd be the star attraction in grade A, Oscar contenders like The Last King of Scotland? Obviously driven by determination, he's worked his way up the Hollywood food chain during his career (something that may have been made harder by the colour of his skin) and is now in a position where he couldn't be happier with what he's got.<br/><br/>He brings the lead role of the real-life Amin to life powerfully and with great conviction, chewing up any scenery he can get his hands on. Likewise, in the supporting role, McAvoy also can't be faulted.<br/><br/>Sadly, though, for me the film wasn't as great as I'd have hoped. While it brings 70s Africa to life colourfully and gets as good performances as it could have hoped out the two lead stars, it wastes a good supporting cast, including Kerry Washington, Gillian Anderson, Simon McBurney and David Oyelowo and fails to form a really engaging solid narrative flow through-out. ***"
"tsmithjr","8","1","3","6 July 2007"," Very good movie, but paints too humanist a view of one who ordered hundreds of thousands killed.
","This movie was great. But it used too much ""license"" in the story. As always, Forest Whitaker was outstanding!! However I was disappointed that a lot of the historical aspects were glossed over in the movie. Granted, you probably have to be over 40 to remember Idi Amin, but everything in the news at the time indicated that he was a brutal dictator. And the documentary included with the DVD does capture some of that (it does a better job than the movie of spelling out what he did).<br/><br/>This movie did try to paint a more humanist view of him. But from following the news in the US (in the late 70's), Idi Amin was in effect, the murderer (or ordered the killing) of hundreds of thousands of his countrymen. While I don't need to see the blood and gore that he invoked. The movie glossed over many over the important brutal aspects which portrayed his rule. It barely mentioned the mass graves which are his legacy.<br/><br/>One thing I did learn was that the British put him in power. And for that I can thank the movie. But both my wife and I were left still wondering what drove him to order the killings of so many. Even if it had been speculative, we would have been left with some ""educated guess"" as to what drove Amin to have hundreds of thousands killed.<br/><br/>Most of the story just took too much ""film/story makers license"" for me to be left satisfied with it. I could rant on about that but it happens too often now so I won't. I'd still buy the DVD again, it was a good story. But I'd make sure to watch the documentary, it's not that long and gives a more accurate picture of what happened in Uganda during that period."
"jpschapira","8","1","3","19 June 2007"," Social issues in film...Current affairs and all that
","At the moment, my English teacher is giving us some kind of current affairs lessons, and we've been talking about the situation of Darfur, in Africa, and the thousands of people who are dying while the world sits back and does nothing. I'm talking about genocide, and what Idi Amin did in Uganda in the seventies has no difference.<br/><br/>Kevin Macdonald brings these events to the screen, taking them from a screenplay by the daring Peter Morgan and by Jeremy Brock, based on the novel by Giles Foden. These are the times when I regret not having read novels before watching films based on them. My teacher read the original novel and was a bit disappointed by the film but, then, that's something that happens all the time. In another contrasting way, maybe it's better I didn't read the novel before; otherwise I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the film as much as I did.<br/><br/>I found the screenplay fascinating, for example: full of clever phrases and of interesting use of the African language. In this Uganda full of hope, as Macdonald first show us, is where Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) has ended up. We first meet him sitting at the table with his parents, celebrating his graduation. His father, also a doctor, congratulates him but doesn't forget to mention his degree was more impressive. We clearly see the tension in the family and Nicholas decides to get away.<br/><br/>Now we are in Africa and, as the movie sees things from the doctor's perspective, everything seems amazing. The scenery, backed by the never-failing African traditional music, inspires happiness; mostly when Nicholas is scared by the presence of an army with guns and a woman tells him: ""It's OK. There's a new president. This is a good day for the people"". Young and innocent are the word to describe this doctor, who arrives looking for adventure, willing to help, but ends up tangled in the most unexpected events.<br/><br/>Director Macdonald, a documentary filmmaker, takes on his actually first fictional film (his last film ""Touching the Void"" was a mix of fiction with documentary), but it wouldn't be wrong to say that he is 'documenting'; because in the end, he's telling a true story. Right now he has completed a new documentary about a Gestapo commander; and the documentary that got him an Academy Award is about the Munich Olympic Games in 1972.<br/><br/>This is a man making movies with social conscience; and I don't if it's his team or what, but ""The last king of Scotland"" is so gripping that you can't take your eyes off the screen, whether it's showing massive killings or passionate dialogue. In this latter aspect lies the film's best quality; showing the terrifying relationship between Nicholas an Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). I'm talking about two people who look at each other and may be hiding a big amount of things; people who thought they knew each other but started witnessing revelations about the other, basically in their looks.<br/><br/>""The last king of Scotland"" relies on looks a lot, because the camera is always looking. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is something I enjoyed very much. He leaves no doubt that Africa is a country where violence is an everyday issue, when he clearly lets us see the gun Idi Amin is carrying the first time we see him. And his men, armed all the time and carefully looking. The way Mantle moves the camera up and down in an unpredictable manner; the way he picks up things, little details in every scene and takes the time to show them as he shoots the environment as a whole; the way he observes Forest Whitaker's face are parts of his more than effective work. There were some key moments where the film implemented flashbacks I think weren't needed, and the impact and comprehension could have been better achieved without them.<br/><br/>Anyway, what a fierce, masterfully controlled and insuperable look Whitaker has on his face; popping those eyes which come from this superb performance, because, among other things, he takes on the role as if he had ruled the country himself. James McAvoy's Nicholas doesn't stay behind, having a hard time to swallow while he looks at the dictator with the terror I was talking about. The young actor is apparently establishing himself among the rising British talents, now with leading roles in various films. Kerry Washington is also very impressive as Amin's wife, with little moments of great strength.<br/><br/>Also apparently, Idi Amin was a charming man; one that you would want to give a chance to, as Nicholas says early in the film. Well, Uganda gave him a chance; and look what happened."

","The Last King of Scotland is one of the best DVD's I've seen recently. The movie is about a na√Øve, young, medical school graduate who journeys to Uganda at the time of General Idi Amin Dada's rise to power. The young lad is on a selfish, Peace Corps-like adventure but soon becomes acquainted and associated with Amin as a sort of top adviser. The story follows the young man's slow descent into the horror of Amin's reign.<br/><br/>The movie was quite good. I'd watch it again. Shot on location, the film is rich in local color. The story is gripping. Almost from the beginning you're at the edge of your seat waiting for Amin's shoe to drop on the clueless, young child of the 70's, Dr. Nick who, by the way, had to be the dumbest, most politically ignorant kid in his class. He sure didn't attend the same prep school as The History Boys. Although he did select Uganda as his destination by dropping his finger on a spinning globe, you would expect he'd do a bit of research before leaving home.<br/><br/>The acting is first class. The sex is gratuitous. So is the violence. (What else is new?) Judging from the deleted scenes, character depth was left on the cutting room floor. Still, Amin is known and portrayed as such a fearful, ruthless and psychotic figure, little else is needed to move the story along briskly.<br/><br/>The movie makes the point that political heroes/saviors often turn out to be the worst kind of scoundrels. I would have enjoyed that story much more if the plot had turned around the international political and economic intrigue that enabled Amin's dictatorship rather than Dr. Nick's insatiable, sexual appetite.<br/><br/>I'll score the movie eight stars only because the good, Scottish doctor is too much of a spineless bonehead to take seriously or even sympathetically.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

Having really enjoyed the main actor performances in Capote and Ray, I had high hopes for Scotland. And while he delivered, much like the other two, nothing else did.<br/><br/>The film centres on idealistic young Scotsman Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), who has just graduated from college. Wanting to make a difference, he takes out his globe, spins it, and places his finger down on where he wants to go. Uganda ends up being the answer, and Garrigan turns up there just in time for the start of President Idi Amin's (Whitaker) reign. The doctor wants to help the Ugandan people out as much as he can, but after a chance encounter with the charming President, the charismatic doctor is taken in to be his personal physician. Only then does he get to experience what Amin is really like.<br/><br/>As intriguing as the film sounds, it really is not all that great. It is riveting in a lot of sequences, but many just drag on without a point. If a point is to be made, it takes about five minutes to get to it, if at all. Numerous subplots are thrown at the viewer, and only a few totally pan out. The rest either crash and burn, or are just never spoken or acted upon after their brief mention. It feels more inconsistent than anything, and the two hour runtime really does help in any case. It just drags the film out longer than it needs to be.<br/><br/>This mainly is indebted to the fact that the main character is Garrigan and not Amin. I realize that the film is based on a novel. But after some brief research, it turns out that it is very unlike the novel. So why not make this subtle change to? Focus less on the fictional Scotsman, and do more with the real person. Garrigan is an intriguing character on his own, but having him be the focal point of the movie is not too great an idea. Amin is the compelling character here, and the reason people are seeing the movie in the first place. He should not have to play second fiddle to a wavering fictional entity.<br/><br/>But while the main characters have a few issues, the cinematography does not. The beautiful and brutal African landscapes are captured in the awestriking way that North Americans have come to expect. The lush atmosphere (even down to small sequences involving the annoying insects) is represented wonderfully here, despite the subject matter. But in comparison to other harsh African-content films (like The Constant Gardener or Blood Diamond), the film captures a lot of the more upper class areas well too. Every African-based film I have ever taken in is always focused on the deep, dark and ferociously violent areas of the continent. Here, we get to see the more royal side of it, and it is equally if not even better captured than the rough side.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that it did not abruptly hold the movie up with historical details forcing the audience to feel the need to rush out and do something. Blood Diamond had that annoying element that totally ruined the film, and I am glad it is not present here. A movie should be subtle about a call for change, not in your face and halting the movie to tell you. The film is also nowhere near as brutal as I imagined, only having a lot of gore and blood appearing closer to the end of the film than to the beginning.<br/><br/>I would be lying though if I said that everything in the film is overshadowed by the overbearing and positively excellent portrayal of Amin that Whitaker turns in. You will be hard set to not have your eyes glued to the screen whenever he pops up and starts talking. Right from the start as a bus simply passes Amin waving to a crowd, Whitaker commandeers the screen (and you do not even get to see him again for at least another fifteen minutes). His profound performance is simply not to be missed. Any sequences are livened by his mere presence. His aura is felt in all of the scenes he is in, and even when he does not show up, you can practically smell the impact he has made on the scene and the actors acting within it. And when his character suddenly turns from an absolutely frightening beast to a kind hearted chum and then back again within mere seconds, you know you are watching a master at work. Whitaker more than deserved his Oscar.<br/><br/>As hard as he tries, McAvoy just cannot hold up against the force of Whitaker's performance. When he is on the screen for excessively long points of time, even he knows that the audience is begging for more Amin. It is not that his performance is not that great; it is the fact that it feels amateurish at best. He does very well for himself, just not well enough. I understand that this may have been for effect, and may actually prove just how right he was for the na√Øve doctor. But he just cannot hold the film on his own, and I am sure that everyone who watches it can tell in his struggle to even attempt it.<br/><br/>While no other supporting actor even comes close to being good on screen, Whitaker more than makes up for it. The film is flawed and inconsistent, but he is not. His performance had people talking for a reason.<br/><br/>7/10."
"strtmanadammac","10","1","3","10 April 2007"," A spellbinding performance...
","By Forest Whitaker as the Ugandy dictator Idi Amin proves that he is more than worthy of key roles in Hollywood.<br/><br/>However let me be the first to say that the storyline was not all that great. It doesn't command attention like THE GODFATHER and REAR WINDOW. The reason it is so successful, is because of Forest and the way he literally talks, acts, moves, and reacts like Amin every second in this film showing how closely he has studied the man.<br/><br/>I truly believe that without Whitaker, the movie would not be stupendous because his acting simply draws you into the time period Amin reigned.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give THE LAST KING OF Scotland a 6/10 for the storyline, but a full 10/10 for acting."
"jon2005","9","1","3","4 April 2007"," The Last King of Scotland
","From documentary director Kevin Macdonald comes a gripping thriller about a young Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy) who heads to Uganda to work at a small village hospital. Whilst there, he meets the general who has just taken control of the country, Idi Amin (Whittaker). They hit it off immediately, and Amin invites Garrigan to become his personal physician and adviser. Unable to resist the lure, Garrigan agrees, but soon learns that Amin, although high-spirited and funny, is also a violent dictator, and realises he cannot stay in Uganda anymore.<br/><br/>Much like Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall, The Last King of Scotland attempts to provide an unbiased portrayal of Idi Amin, showing both his good and bad sides in equal measure. It doesn't try to judge Amin, but it has no need ¬ñ his dictatorship is obviously based on terror, but he is shown not just as a monster, but as a person; he is still a human being, after all. In fact, as the film is shown from Garrigan's perspective, Amin comes across at first as a thoroughly likable personality, and his violence is hidden from Garrigan for a long time, partly through design, but also through Garrigan's own naivety.<br/><br/>Forest Whittaker is truly a tour de force, and there is no finer person to play Amin than he. He is a riveting screen presence, and keeps the character of Amin fascinating to watch, and to follow his emotional breakdowns and outbursts is enthralling. His is arguably the finest performance by an actor to portray an historical figure, and he alone is what makes the film worth watching. However, the other cast members are not weak. Indeed, James McAvoy shows almost as much talent playing the arrogant, na√Øve but well-meaning Garrigan, and even as events spiral out of his control, his decisions are given an air of authenticity by an actor also at the top of his game. The entire film is lead by these two central performances, and there is not a moment where one of them is not on screen, which means the audience is gripped from start to finish. <br/><br/>These performances also have the power to allow the audience to ignore the ever exaggerated turns of events that control the film towards the end ¬ñ the situations become harder to swallow, but these are minor niggles that can be easily overlooked. It is at times frustrating to see Garrigan behave as he does ¬ñ he is hardly helping himself as he begins to learn of Amin's true nature before starting an affair with one of his wives (Washington). His punishment upon the discovery of this affair is brutal, fully playing on its 15 rating and making us feel Garrigan's pain. However his ignorance is a key part of his character ¬ñ so much so that he refuses to spy on Amin for British intelligence ¬ñ and frustration gives in to pity. <br/><br/>Director Macdonald uses his experience in documentaries to give the film an authentic feel, and he certainly knows how to present both sides of an argument. That he is capable of creating so much tension also proves that he is a talent to watch beyond the documentary circle. The Last King of Scotland is a fantastic watch, with the ability to absorb the audience into the experience. A great biopic, and an exciting thriller.<br/><br/>Rated: 9/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Long story short: good movie, great performances, great writing, mediocre direction. So many of the visual choices in this film seemed designed to eschew the incredible beauty of the setting, opting rather for a TV-like amalgam of close-ups, quick-cuts and occasional moments of camera self-consciousness. <br/><br/>Basically every actor in this film did a terrific job - with the lovely Kerry Washington turning in a surprisingly good and (wow wow wow) hot performance. The movie was well-paced and the production quality high, but I left the theater feeling cheated out of what could've been such a visually stunning and artistic picture, but wasn't."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","1","3","13 March 2007"," Forest Whitaker is larger than life in a terrifying and electric performance
","Kevin Macdonald's 'The Last King of Scotland' is a fictional chapter in the life of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), seen through the eyes of his personal doctor, the fictional Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy; ""Chronicles of Narnia""). Garrigan starts off as a big fan of Amin's goals to rebuild Uganda. However, being at Amin's side constantly has blinded him to the horrors Amin is committing: like the genocide of 300,000 of his own people. The film really doesn't show much of the political aspects of Amin's regime, and that's a good thing, as it centers around the relationship between Amin and Garrigan.<br/><br/>As earlier stated, Forest Whitaker delivers not only the best performance of his career, not only the best of 2006, but one of the best performances ever. It is a terrifying show that displays the epitome of insanity and incredible mood swings. Whitaker can be extremely likable and even charming in some scenes, but in the next scene, and sometimes in the same scene, Whitaker can turn into a vicious monster that will scare the audience. He is magnificent in the Oscar winning role that will stick in your brain for years. Never has evil and insanity been portrayed this well. Whitaker also makes his fellow co-star James McAvoy perform extremely well. McAvoy also delivers a multi layered performance as a character who definitely changes throughout the whole movie. He is a strong character, and despite his small size, McAvoy commands the screen and holds his own against the titanic performance of Forest Whitaker. The character arcs of both Amin and Garrigan are brilliant because of Whitaker and McAvoy.<br/><br/>Another strength of the film is the script from Jeremy Brock (Driving Lessons) and Peter Morgan (The Queen). The dialog in particular is very well written, allowing for Whitaker and McAvoy to really bring it. Idi Amin's dialog is extremely good, and it really gives Whitaker a lot of room to do what he does with the character, which as you should know by this point, is extraordinary. The script is fast paced, yet sort of struggles midway through the film, but makes up for it in the climax. Kevin Macdonald's direction of the actors is obviously fantastic, but other than that, he's just average. His vision is pretty ordinary, and considering he was working with 1970's Uganda and dealing with a fictional story, it's a shame he didn't jump at the opportunity to do something really special with the chance.<br/><br/>The last point that I'd like to make is that this film should be viewed with minimal knowledge or research of Idi Amin, so the impact of his - sorry, Forest Whitaker's performance can be experienced to the fullest. If you already know a lot about Amin and his dictatorship, you can still have a great time. I found that it was much more enjoyable experiencing Whitaker embody an evil man that I knew nothing about. The Last King of Scotland is a good political thriller with incredible acting. I recommend it to all above age 16 due to some strong sexual content, nudity, some strong language, and an extremely scary performance from Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"

","I do not know how much you pay for your cinema tickets wherever you are, but it is worth every euro, pound, dollar... you spend. In fairness, given its quality, you'd have to pay far more.<br/><br/>Why? Easy. You cannot fault any actor or actress in the film. Forrest Whitaker has taken the credit for a great performance, which he gives, but what about Doctor Nicholas Carrigan? To me, James McAvey is the star of the film.<br/><br/>More great things - The film could have easily fallen in one of the different behaviours of the characters, but it doesn't. It keeps the story going very well and it really drags you into it. I was surprised when I came out the cinema and found myself in the centre of Madrid instead on the hot streets of Uganda.<br/><br/>It is important the rhythm the story has. And in my opinion it is spot on. You don't get meaningless scenes that are there to fill the length of the film, but you don't get way too much information to get lost in the plot. All you need to know is there; it is easy to follow thanks to the work of the scriptwriters, the director and the cast. The film could have also turn into a restless, highly paced thriller, but it doesn't. There is enough of anything in the film when it is needed.<br/><br/>In a personal note, I enjoy the Scottish accent and that helped me bing fond of Dr. Carrigan. In Spain we have the vice of overlapping the voices of the actors with Spanish speaking actors. I feel strongly against t, even more when the day after watching the film (in English) i saw the trailer in Spanish. Then all the actors had the same accent, being English, Scottish or Ugandians with different knowledge of English. It s a shame. But this, of course, is beyond the responsibilities of this film, and so I cannot fault it. And, anyway, I wouldn't want to"
"MaxBorg89","8","1","3","25 February 2007"," Forest Whitaker's crowning achievement!
","For years, Forest Whitaker has been a brilliant supporting player in acclaimed films like Platoon or The Crying Game. Now, like Philip Seymour Hoffman did with Capote, he has proved he has the right qualities to carry an entire picture. Okay, so this isn't his first leading role (he also has the underrated Bird and Ghost Dog on his resum√®), but there's very little doubt The Last King of Scotland is the movie most people will remember him for.<br/><br/>Deftly mixing facts and fiction, Kevin Macdonald's powerful opus covers one of the darkest (forgive the expression) periods in Africa's history. It's 1970, and young Scot Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy, last seen playing a faun in The Chronicles of Narnia) has just graduated from med-school. Of all places, he chooses to go to Uganda, hoping to be able to really help people and, while he's at it, have some fun too. By the end of the opening credits, he's already seduced a woman traveling on the same bus as he, and spends the next ten minutes wooing his employer's wife (Gillian Anderson). It doesn't take long, however, before the situation changes radically: the newly appointed Ugandan president Idi Amin (Whitaker) comes to visit the village where Garrigan works and, fascinated by his methods and origin, offers him a new job. Although a little hesitant at first, Garrigan accepts, thinking his position as Amin's personal doctor might make things easier. Soon enough, though, he will be forced to realize he's actually working for a cruel, if charismatic, dictator, and that there may be no turning back.<br/><br/>Rather than delivering a conventional biopic, former documentarian Macdonald prefers to explore the complex and terrifying figure of Amin through his relationship with a completely fictional character, the young, ambitious and excessively naive Garrigan. In fact, although the title (which is explained in a quite amusing scene) refers to the Ugandan tyrant, the movie's real protagonist is the Scottish doctor, in terms of screen-time and character development (hence the weirdness of the screenwriters'decision to drop an interesting subplot almost immediately). And while McAvoy is far from bad, he can't match the towering performance his co-star gives: tackling the most difficult role of his career, Whitaker effortlessly conveys Amin's passion and childlike enthusiasm, making the character charming even when he starts showing his more monstrous aspects (cannibalism not included, the accusations being merely hinted at), as two particularly disturbing scenes towards the end of the film testify.<br/><br/>Overall, an incredibly good film. Macdonald deserves credit for brilliantly pointing out that dictatorships don't necessarily belong to the past, but in the end what makes The Last King of Scotland special is the riveting Whitaker. His portrayal of an evil and, at the same time, intriguing ruler is his most layered and rewarding performance so far, of the kind Oscars were created for, and this year's Best Actor statuette undeniably belongs to him."
"SteveDalziel","6","1","3","7 February 2007"," Could've been much better
","New medical graduate Nicolas Garrigan goes to Uganda to practice medicine and winds up the personal physician of the murderous new president, Idi Amin.<br/><br/>The main fall-back of this film is that rather than tell the story of the life and reign of Idi Amin, as seen from his doctor's perspective, the focus of the story is, instead, on the life of the doctor himself. And the character of the doctor is so badly written! He's so utterly charmless, uncharismatic and full of self-confidence that it makes him so hard to like. On top of this, he is also so stupid that the story is also unbelievable (watch the film, you'll see what I mean by stupid!). And James McAvoy is quite unconvincing, he's actually very annoying.<br/><br/>With such a powerful, charismatic character such as Amin, the film should focus on him, rather than uninteresting side-stories concerning his doctor.<br/><br/>However, the film does have a saving grace; Forest Whitaker is amazing, so utterly convincing in his role, every line is executed perfectly. He is up for a nomination, and viewing the competition he really deserves a win. But the film really doesn't deserve any nominations, and interestingly is hasn't received them.<br/><br/>Could've been good, but if the film was based on Amin, it would've been a lot better."
"t-h-fields","9","1","3","14 January 2007"," One of the Year's Best
","Many of the younger readers here may not remember the murderous regime of Idi Amin, dictator of Uganda. I was in college when he was deposed, in 1979. Shortly before that, I saw a good documentary about this tyrant, titled Idi Amin Dada. If you mixed scenes from this new movie with the scenes from that documentary, it would be hard to tell which is which. Forrest Whittaker is so convincing that you soon forget that he's an actor.<br/><br/>The story is told from the perspective of a young Scottish doctor who goes to Uganda for his first job. Fresh out of medical school, he's very bright and motivated, but naive. He meets Idi Amin through an accident of fate, and becomes his personal physician. At first, the dictator seems to be a good man--a man of the people. I won't give away any more.<br/><br/>If this movie gets no Oscars, then something is seriously wrong. Just beware, it contains some disturbing scenes of violence and gore. Not for the timid, but a real gem."
"kmorgan-1","8","1","3","15 October 2006"," Spinandstir's Review
","At times, I was hoping to get more of a historical picture so I could learn about the infamous dictator, but the film is not a doc. If you want history, you have to research Amin on your own. What the na√Øve doctor chooses not to know, we don't really learn either such as (the excessive torture and brutality of Amin), but when he does learn about the leader via horrific glimpses of his brutality, so do we. Nicholas is very much a young liberal who wants to believe that this dictator will bring power to Africa and unleash the chains of British imperialism. However, Amin is not the answer to the poverty and misery in Uganda, and Nicolas finds out in the ugliest of ways and barely escapes to tell us about it.<br/><br/>The film really captures the deterioration of the dictator's mind/soul. Much like the The Madness of King George, this film observes the downward spiral of the manic mind and how absolute power can make you paranoid and corrupt. Whitaker is so much in character that sometimes it feels like a documentary. However, like a great actor, when he charms you as the leader, you are charmed in the audience. When he destroys you, you feel demolished.<br/><br/>read more at www.spinandstir.com :)"

","Peole who go to movies surprise me by their ignorance time and time again. This movie covers the mood of an era and conveys the character of Idi Amin Dada really well, but the framework of the story is a totally fictionalized potboiler. People, please note almost everything you see that is supposed to be behind the scenes in the film did not happen! Other similar stuff might have, but this is not history.<br/><br/>Folk on this site have given the movie 8 or more because it is a good historical fiction, and then go on to comment how much more satisfying the movie could have been if they had done it properly. That in my mind makes this a mediocre move. Forrest is great, but at the end of the day he is imitating a very well documented person, with untold hours of historical material to work from.<br/><br/>In my mind a movie with as many fundamental flaws as this one does not deserve to be called great. Clearly the academy agrees as it has no director or picture nod. A bloke who is being another bloke is not acting he is impersonating, but how often does the academy award that! I just hope this year's winner is one of the actors who actually acts.That being said Will Smith and Forrest Whittaker do great impersonations in their nominated roles this year."

I had to actually see the end credits to believe the movie was really over.<br/><br/>Idi Amin's life is definitely worthy of making a movie. It did not lack in drama.

","I was slightly disappointed with this film. I am usually not a stickler for the need for a sympathetic character, but in this film Nicholas Garrigan is seriously flawed by the lack of sympathy I felt for him. He seemed like he was created specifically to be a sympathetic character, and that is why the failure to be one is a problem for me.<br/><br/>The whole movie seemed to sketchy without flushing out details and character motivation. I would sum up the film with Garrigan's comment about having sex with Amin's wife. ""Oh, what the heck."" Everything in the storyline seemed to just be there without really flushing out motivations. Too much story was attempted without enough feeling for the characters.<br/><br/>There was definitely a good performance by Forrest Whitaker, but after seeing it, I didn't think it was Oscar worthy. Ghost Dog was a much much better performance. To me, portraying the megalomania of Idi Amin seems less of a challenge than some other potential roles. One that Whitaker does well, but it just doesn't move me as a great performance.<br/><br/>I wish I could say better things about this movie, but it just really didn't strike me as anything special.

It's that good. And Whitaker more than deserved his Oscar. I mean Amin (Whitaker) genuinely frightened me.

","Now that all the dust has settled, Oscar season has ended and the campaign to have Forrest Whitaker walk off with the Best Actor statue has subsided, it couldn't be a better time to re-evaluate The Last King Of Scotland. For when all the media frenzy has ended, the strength of any great film is on how watchable it is when not surrounded by a day to day frenzy of newspaper headlines and gossip columns. Much as I like tearing movies to pieces once the furore has died down though, it's simply not possible with this one, because The Last King Of Scotland is an excellent film that should rightfully be remembered as one of the greatest films of 2006 for years to come.<br/><br/>For the unenlightened, this is a fictional portrayal of the cruel Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, as told from the point of view of his personal physician, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). Having graduated from University, Nicholas is unsure of himself and frustrated with the short comings of home life under his over-bearing father, so spins a globe with the intention of travelling where-ever his finger lands. It hits Uganda and the young doctor sets off on a life-changing journey from which no-one emerges with clean hands. He winds up working in a small village delivering inoculations to African children and tending injuries, but a chance encounter with newly appointed ruler Idi Amin (Forrest Whitaker) leads to him becoming his personal physician. But as he is sucked into the charismatic Amin's inner circles, he finds his life beginning to spiral into an orgy of darkness and violence.<br/><br/>What makes this an interesting film to watch is the fact that Garrigan himself is not an entirely likable character. Upon arriving in Uganda, his mission seems to be just as much about going on a shag rampage as it is helping the needy and his arrogance makes him the sort of fellow you'd want to punch rather than celebrate. On the other hand though, it is a far more realistic portrayal of a naive, insecure youth and the film makers should be applauded for making this decision. Regardless of his unappealing side, when push comes to shove and Garrigan finds himself floundering in deep water it is possible to feel some sympathy for him, the end result being a fully fleshed out character of which McAvoy should be very proud.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly though, the chief focus is Forrest Whitaker as Idi Amin. That's right, big cuddly Forrest Whitaker isn't quite so lovable anymore and instead is ruthless tyrant. He is both charismatic and deranged and even in his early scenes you can tell there is something not right about the man. It's there in that booming laugh, the all-too easy smile and the nervous glances among his henchmen, a predatory monster lurking behind his promises of a free country and food for all. Whitaker deserved that Oscar and no mistake.<br/><br/>What ultimately leaves the biggest impression however is in the stark realism of the whole thing. Director Kevin McDonald brings his documentary experience to good use here, filming events in a manner which is frankly, a bit frightening. The sight of Whitaker snarling and ranting at captured resistance fighters before leaving so his bodyguard may machine gun them mercilessly is terrifying in the simplicity of the approach and some of the later scenes are horrific to watch. This is historical fiction in its most violent and unrestrained form.<br/><br/>All in all then, a fantastic movie. McDonald welds a fictional story onto a true life series of events and cranks the tension up to boiling point. The performances from the two stars are terrific and they are aided by a strong supporting cast, including a nigh on unrecognisable Gillian Anderson in a brief appearance as one of Garrigan's fellow doctors. And you'll never be able to look at Forrest Whitaker in the same way ever again."

If only the film had focused more on Idi Amin rather than the fictional Scottish doctor character who with his boyish looks and stupid behavior looked often completely out of place, highly unbelievable in the context of the film, and quite frankly, highly improbable too. Why do Hollywood movies about Africa seem to think that they must have a lead character who is white in them in order to succeed?

His towering inferno of a performance in The Last King Of Scotland deserves all the kudos he's been receiving this year, and hopefully he will take the Oscar at next Sunday's ceremony, to top it off.<br/><br/>Another great thing about Whitaker's receiving such high profile acknowledgment for his portrayal of Amin is that the film is finally getting wider distribution. I saw it this afternoon, and it was riveting from start to finish - brilliantly crafted, thanks to a supremely well-written script (with slow, subtle and ultimately overwhelming build), perfectly directed, and impeccably cast, particularly in the two main roles.<br/><br/>Whitaker's been getting all the accolades - his depiction of Amin as a lethally charming but horrifically psychotic two-faced ""president"" works because he never loses sight of the fact that he's playing a human being. This is something that informs every one of Whitaker's performances, and it is the major quality that also makes his work always stand out. There is another flawless performance in this film, however: it's James McAvoy, who plays the fictional doctor character through whose eyes we experience the movie.<br/><br/>The scenes between McAvoy and Whitaker are, in my opinion, some of the most powerful scenes between 2 characters ever filmed. The predicament which Nicholas finds himself is far more than he bargained for when he set out, at the film's start, to find adventure. The beginning, in fact, lets us know straight away that we're in good hands as far as the writing of the film goes: in just a couple of short scenes, we are shown everything we need to know about his character - the way he downs his wine so quickly at the table and wants more, the way he yells out with frustration in his bed, and the way he chooses to go to Africa by spinning the globe around and pointing to a location - twice; the first time he lands on Canada, which doesn't have the adventure factor he's clearly seeking.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, he has most definitely gotten what he was searching for, a thousand times over, and he knows it. McAvoy conveys this brilliantly through his facial expressions and body language alone. We feel what he feels. Although we might not have made the same choices he makes in the course of the movie, we still have tremendous compassion for him, or at least I did, without feeling sorry for him, because he did indeed make those choices. His character knows that, as well. McAvoy as an actor makes us feel all this without ever stating any of it. It is a masterful performance, right up there with Whitaker's, and even though he hasn't gotten the kudos that Whitaker's received for The Last King of Scotland, it is a performance that will not be easily forgotten."
"Jonathan_DeFusionFilms","10","1","4","8 February 2007"," Breathtaking Depiction of a Dazzling Man
","What a stunning evocation of the time and place - Whittaker imbues his portrait of the darkly charismatic Amin with such humour and humanity that when the reality of his actions is exposed, it hits the audience as hard as the naive Dr Garrigan. James McAvoy is equally superlative.<br/><br/>Most of all, it is a scandal, if a predictable one, that neither the film nor the director were considered Oscar worthy - sure, everyone understands their PR-purpose for mainstream US cinema, and many of the nominees are fantastic - Little Miss Sunshine especially -, but Kevin MacDonald proves what a potent force he now is in world cinema - the colour, the pace, the music - all fantastic. Compare this film to Blood Diamond - there is laughably no contest in which has better acting, direction, and, most of all, which one is a film infused with Africa and its realities, rather than Edward Zwick's use of Sierra Leone as merely a random backdrop to his clich√©d thriller intentions.<br/><br/>Go and see The Last King of Scotland and be stunned - but beware the shocking scenes at the end."

","Now both movies are very different, I just put that because City of God is one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years. The Last King of Scotland is remarkable and one of the best movies I've ever seen. Forrest Whitaker in a performance of a lifetime. From start to finish he is the shining star while playing one of the most brutal dictators in the latter part of the 20th century. James McAvoy is fantastic too. His story is complex and tragic with some of the decisions (spoiler possible) he makes that changes the course of his life and in some way Ibi Amin's life. McAvoy's character deep inner conflict (spoiler possible) about him becoming a doctor is well played out in the movie. I feel this is the main story of the movie. Someone choosing a profession to help out people in a land where a monster exist, only to be find out that he is a monster too. (Spoiler)"

","This is a fictional story about a young doctor from Scotland who goes to Uganda to do service to the common people, and thru a series of fortunate/unfortunate events winds up as an intimate of Idi Amin shortly after he assumes the presidency.<br/><br/>No doubt there are some technical inaccuracies in this film, and I'm sure someone out there will be able to spot them, but for this is really a very well written, acted and filmed story. We know well in advance how our young hero is going to spiral down into the madness of the madman's mad house, but still the story is so artfully told we are fascinated by every facet and twist of the plot. FW deserves an Oscar, and the young doctor deserves, well, some more good roles.<br/><br/>The only faults which bother me personally was the sudden appearance of the English doctor's wife at the end, on the bus. Is she fleeing the country. What happened there? Her whole sub plot was not really relevant except to establish the Scot doctor's raging libido. And the Englishman from the embassy was a great character foil, but his character and storyline never went anywhere. That could have been a rich look at the political side of the story.<br/><br/>But in the final analysis, this is not primarily a political film; it's the story of very flawed man, and how he destroyed massive quantities of people, one way or another. For such a heavy and grim movie, it's a surprisingly good time."
"zetes","8","1","4","29 January 2007"," Fine film
","Historical horror movie about General Idi Amin, the brutal Ugandan dictator of the 1970s. It's told through the eyes of a fictional person (as far as I can tell), Nicholas Garrigan. In the film, he's a Scot who comes to Uganda as a doctor. Upon a chance meeting with the new President, Garrigan is taken to the country's capital to be his head physician. Garrigan is more or less in isolation. He's having a ball while the rest of the country is going to Hell. Amin treats him well, and by the time it becomes apparent that he's hardly the benevolent dictator he presents himself as, Garrigan can't get away. Perhaps it's disingenuous to create a fictional character in this situation, but Idi Amin himself is too much of a beast to focus the entire film on. It works better to make him the monster at the edge of the frame. I wouldn't say Whitaker gives the very best performance of 2006, but he is excellent, and deserving of his eventual Oscar. It's not a great film, but I really liked it. It's scary and gripping from first to last."
"georgioskarpouzas","8","1","4","29 January 2007"," mad dictator
","Accepting the white paternalistic idea that Africa is land with a population of stupid villagers under the spell of paranoid-charismatic dictator such as Amin Dada the movie depicts the story of an adventurous, idealistic and rather naughty Scottish doctor who achieves the distinction of being the confidante of Uganda's charismatic if deranged dictator.This position makes him vulnerable to British advances who want to use him as an agent to gain access to the dictator's inner circle.This plot is enlivened by the charismatic performance of the actor playing the role of the dictator- he is very impressive and convincing although I do not think that a human being with such behaviour is possible to encounter. I am not going to challenge accepted historical and journalistic sources about the late's dictators life although I find the depiction of his character rather extraordinary by my standards. Of course African standards of leadership are different from Balkan and even more from European ones. That is what the movie wants us to believe at least. As all the films about Africa it is a movie made by white people and their perspective is exemplified- being also made to be consumed by a white audience. But how can one form an opinion if he has not the native's view. Where can he get it though."
"roland-104","7","1","4","28 January 2007"," Forest Whitaker is outstanding as Idi Amin in this otherwise mediocre docudrama
","Forest Whitaker is one of the finest yet most under-appreciated actors of our time. He is an extremely hard worker, having participated in 66 film and television acting projects over the past 25 years; and in that span he has produced and directed films as well. Among his performances, I highly esteem his Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's 1988 docudrama, ""Bird,"" for which he won a Best Actor award at Cannes, and his role as a self styled Samurai assassin in Jim Jarmusch's 1999 film, ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai."" Splendid as those performances are, they pale in comparison to his personification of the Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, in this docudrama about Amin and his relationship with a young (fictional) British doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy).<br/><br/>Amin, a fatherless youth from a dirt poor family, became a Ugandan Army officer trained by the British and later President from 1971 to 1979. If you wonder how megalomaniacal a character Amin was, just dig the title he is said to have once bestowed upon himself: ""His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular."" He idolized Scotland, often wore kilts, and also dubbed himself with the title used for this film (also the title for the novel written by Giles Foden upon which the film is based.<br/><br/>Regarded in the West as a buffoon, Amin became an increasingly dangerous and destructive tyrant over the years, perpetrating ruthless oppression against various ethnic and religious groups, Asians and Jews in particular. Estimates of the numbers slain by his regime vary from 80,000 to 500,000.<br/><br/>But Amin was not a simple fellow, certainly was no fool, and his initial rise to power seemed to derive from genuine populist sentiments and ambitions. Power, however, as we well know, corrupts. Amin's conduct in office darkens over time, and we see the changes. Whitaker's interpretation has Amin by turns eloquent, charming, visionary, ebullient, and, increasingly, arrogant and paranoidally hostile. If Amin was a man of extreme passions, appetites and mood swings, then Whitaker has nailed the man cold. It is an incredibly energetic, astonishing performance.<br/><br/>I wish I could say as much for the rest of the cast and narrative subtexts. But strip away Whitaker, look at the scenes and subtexts in which he is absent, and there's little to see but a soap opera. The Garrigan character is based a real man named Bob Astles, called ""Major"" Bob, a former British soldier who, according to Foden, inveigled himself into Amin's favor and became part of his apparatus of repression. British newspapers used to call Astles ""Amin's White Rat."" After Amin's fall, Astles was imprisoned for ten years in a Kampala jail.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is a charming, impish, natural comedian. He was terrific as a mischievous paraplegic in the irreverent 2004 comedy, ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" McAvoy's strength as Rory is his downfall here: he's a bright eyed comedic twit miscast as a seriously ambitious and substantial personality. He's not believable: it defies all sensibilities that Amin could take him seriously, much less make him a close adviser.<br/><br/>And, like Rory O'Shea, McAvoy's Dr. Garrigan is easily distracted by attractive women he has no business chasing. He tries valiantly to seduce the Medical Director's wife at the health outreach clinic where he's originally assigned. Later he manages to bed and impregnate Amin's youngest and most attractive wife, Kay (Kerry Washington), right under Amin's nose. Yeah, sure. I'd almost say Garrigan got what he deserved in the end. Not a good idea to cuckhold a murderous African tyrant. Who would be so stupid as to try? My grades: 6.5/10 (low B) (But an A for Whitaker's performance.) (Seen on 01/25/07)"

In fact, I was sorry that so many Africans had to die, but this selfish idiot gets away. I understand that was partially the point of the film - it's bluntly stated at the end for those of us who might have missed it the same statements of intent earlier ¬ó but it didn't service the suspense very well, especially since if you know anything about history, you already know how it will end ¬ó and also because it's no great insight any longer that white people in Africa are condescending, horrible elitists who have little respect for the people of the continent. There has to be some more insight than a few toss off lines and some oblivious guy looking for adventure. I also would have appreciated walking out of it with more insight to Amin - unfortunately, the story unfolds through the eyes of someone who is naive and selfish, so he doesn't actually notice the horror for most of the film and when he finally does, it's in the form of a very confusing stylized scene that doesn't really serve much more of a purpose than to shock you with brutality. Yes, we GET Amin is brutal, but I also know there's more to the whole damn thing. This could have been a fascinating political and psychological study ¬ó especially given Whitaker's fantastic performance ¬ó but instead I found it diversionary but very shallow."

","Given that this movie is based on historical events, I'm wondering if anyone knows how accurate to history it was? Did it leave out anything important or fabricate anything? What did it modify? Why did Britain install Idi Amin only to do a 180 and try to oust if not kill him? -- Did Amin fool the British that well, or what didn't they like about his predecessor? Once world opinion turned against Amin, why wasn't there more effort to remove him from power--or was there? Was there really a young Scotsman (or other white guy) who got so close to Amin? Was he able to expose anything to the world after escaping (or didn't he)? Did Amin ever face trial after leaving power in 1979--did the US, UK, or UN make any attempt to bring him to justice? Why would Saudi Arabia give him refuge? Was Amin allied with other murderous dictators like Robert Mugabe? <br/><br/>I thought Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy were great in this film. I'd suggest for people who like it that they might also want to see Lumumba, which is similar but has some key differences."
"charles-470","6","1","6","15 January 2007"," Forrest carries the film
","Having waited with some excitement to watch this film, I must say that aside from Forrest Whittaker, this is a weak adaptation of a good book. The continuity for starters is horrendous. We are treated to Gill Andersons rear in a pair of latest design jeans and McAvoy is clad in boxers? What's wrong with Y fronts? This is being picky, but I have to say McAvoy was painful to watch. He was neither believable nor convincing as, well anything. His was a performance of low standards. His forced emotional poses, were awful, he seemed neither able to show concern, or fear when needed. Jina Jay must have been having a bad day when she let this TV soap actor anywhere near the set. Now for the good bit. Forrest Whittaker, well he was made to play this role. He created menace and charm in equal portions for a character that used these two skills like the spear and shield he uses when we get our first glimpse of the main man. I will be very upset if Forrest doesn't walk away with the lead man Oscar, his performance fully merits first place. Now for the Director. Oh dear, Kevin MacDonald, you created fantasy where there was no need for any, as there was enough horrific and dynamic fact to spare. You dumbed down most of the Amin story and forced and MTV generation concept down our throats with puerile lines about race and international concern. If MacDonald had followed the book then he might have made a film of great magnitude, rather than having to rely on Forrest Whittaker to save the film. I suggest people read the book and do some research on Amin before crowing about how wonderful this film is. Because judging by some of the reviews we have a lot of easily pleased people out there, who don't see the world beyond the end of there noses."
"jboothmillard","8","1","8","26 February 2007"," The Last King of Scotland
","This is one of the best biographical films (mixed with some fiction) I have seen in ages, from director Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void). Basically newly graduated Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (BAFTA nominated James McAvoy) wants to travel, and he goes to Uganda (from landing there on a globe) to assist in the rural hospital. Not long after arriving, he meets newly elected President Idi Amin (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe Forest Whitaker), who promises a new golden age for the African people. They become really good friends as the President is a fan of Scottish people, and Garrigan is given a job in the national health department and becomes one of Amin's closest advisers. However, as years pass, Garrigan notices Amin's increasingly erratic behaviour that grows beyond a legitimate fear of assassination into a murderous insanity that is driving Uganda into bloody ruin. He also will not let him go home, he realises his lunacy and needs to make crucial decisions that could mean death. I have to admit, Amin seems a nice guy for a while, but it is when he admits to a murder, and then hangs McAvoy on hooks by his nipples I know he is insane. Also starring Kerry Washington as Kay Amin, Gillian Anderson as Sarah Merrit, Simon McBurney as Nigel Stone, David Oyelowo as Dr. Junju and Abby Mukiibi Nkaaga as Masanga. Whitaker deserved to win the only Oscar nominated for playing a truly extraordinary character, and in America on a college trip, at the 22nd Santa Barbara Film Festival, I saw him win the honorary American Riviera Award. It won the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it won Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. Very good!"
"crom-dubh","7","0","1","5 May 2020"," Mediocre storytelling carried by great performances
","While this isn't a bad film, in fact probably a good film, it's not a great film. Ultimately I think it's somewhat hurt by the fact that it's difficult to really sympathize too much with Garrigan. All the red flags about what kind of person Amin is are there from the very beginning but he seems too easily seduced by too little, and persists in being blind to the reality of his situation after far too much has happened to cause him to question anything, to say nothing of some genuinely horrible decisions.<br/><br/>I think this would be more compelling if we felt like he had really been deceived and that there was a stronger friendship between the two leads despite what a monster one of them is. But that's not really the case here. Both actors are outstanding, doing some of their very best work here. In fact the entire cast is great and deserves a mention. Similarly, I can't fault the direction. The storytelling is what kind of brings this down. Ultimately it's still a passable political thriller, and I think it is good that a film like this exists to bring awareness to Amin's foul deeds, but that could have been accomplished in a documentary. The implicit expectation here is that there is some other message beyond just that he was a bad dude - some development in the Garrigan's character. But I don't feel that development is ever really that significant. Simply regretting an obviously regrettable life choice does not really count as good character development in my book, nor does it make for a good story."

The choice of upbeat, local music also played a big part in the feeling of carefree bliss in the sunny country with the warm people. It was very well-directed. On one hand you experience what Nicolas is experiencing: joy. On the other hand it adds to the shock when Nicolas is systemically pulled out of this reality by Amin and enters a harsh and confusing reality.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of the story is true. I've watched some clips on YouTube afterwards with Amin to see what he was like in real life. Needless to say Forest Whitaker deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal. He dominated every scene he was in. He did a great job of being two people at the same time. A charmer who feels like an old friend and then on the other hand a scary individual who just by body language is able to confuse and frighten. It all felt natural and when you watch Amin irl you see the similarities. Some videos on YouTube are reenacted like the pool scene. However I don't know how much of Nicolas story was true. I mostly watched this movie as fiction. The only thing I believed because it's common knowledge is that Amin committed a genocide.<br/><br/>Nicolas is the viewer. He enters Uganda almost childlike. Not knowing anything about the Uganda under Amin. Learning as he goes along. And like the viewer he's spectating the story of a tragedy unfolding. Puzzle piece by puzzle piece he sees that things aren't what they seem. I liked this way of storytelling.

","Despite the title(which to be fair has a meaning that relates to the ongoing of this film) this is about the infamous Ugandan ruler Idi Amin- who has, I must add, has been portrayed stupendously by Forrest Whitaker(who won an Oscar for this). The Last King of Scotland explores the turmoil and troubles surrounding the beginning of one of the country's darkest recent periods: the Idi Amin regime, which lasted from 1971 through 1979 and resulted in thousands upon thousands of deaths. (The exact number is unknown, but is estimated to be between 80,000 and 500,000.) Based on actual events, the movie takes us into Amin's inner circle through the eyes of an outsider who is initially charmed by the charismatic leader until Amin's true nature begins to bubble to the surface. The Last King of Scotland does not refrain from showing the brutality of what Amin's reign becomes. The film contains its share of gruesome images, including a torture scene that depicts in unflinching detail what happens to someone who betrays Amin."

","Back during the late Seventies, I read a book by Henry Kyemba titled ""State of Blood: The Inside Story of Idi Amin"", and recall a situation involving the Ugandan dictator having numerous members of his opposition summarily thrown into a crocodile infested river as a way of dealing with them. So I was waiting for confirmation of that while watching this picture and the subject finally came up when the diplomatic aide Stone (Simon McBurney) mentioned it to Dr. Garrigan (Kames McAvoy). What was interesting was when I went to Wikipedia to look up the book title, there was a picture of Henry Kyemba looking remarkably similar to the actor who portrayed Jonah Wasswa, Amin's Minister of Health. It turns out that Kyemba WAS Amin's Minister of Health for a short time until he fled Uganda and it's tyrannical rule!<br/><br/>So with that extraordinary coincidence, one has to wonder why the film makers resorted to creating a fictional character in the person of Nicholas Garrigan to tell the story of Idi Amin. Amin's real life story would have made for a much more compelling picture to my mind, and would not have needed the first half of this movie to paint a disarmingly charming aspect of the ruthless dictator. Beyond that, even the most feeble attempt to portray Garrigan in a romantic entanglement with one of Amin's wives borders on the ridiculous, so why even go there? <br/><br/>So as far as fictional stories go, and forgetting about historical accuracy, this was a fairly decent thriller with Forest Whitaker in a significantly cast against type role considering some of his other projects in which he portrays more reserved characters. He makes the transition from faux charm to maniacal craziness work rather effectively, with a unique power of persuasion to keep Garrigan in line each time the doctor expressed doubts about his role at Amin's side as personal physician.<br/><br/>Having read a number of other reviews about the film, and seeing how it wasn't mentioned by anyone else, I'd like to comment on Gillian Anderson's role in the early going as the wife of another medical doctor stationed in Uganda. Her appearance actually stunned me somewhat, in as much as she looked a lot better (that is to say, a lot more attractive) than in any 'X-Files' episode I'd ever seen her in. Just goes to show what was possible after ditching Fox Mulder."

","**NO SPOILERS** This movie is a fictionalized, biopic period piece about Idi Amin, an African military despot who came to power in Uganda in the early '70's, who then quickly starts an undeniable, almost unfathomably, reign of terror. I was in High School when the real Idi Amin came into power, and remember well the news reports of the mass killings, torture and mutilations, and the political decay of the country due to his corrupt regime. The direction is adequate, cinematography and art direction good, decent script and a plot that moves along without any real hiccups. The movie is a 7 that gets upgraded to an 8 on the power of Forest Whitaker's Oscar winning performance. I liked this movie a lot in 2006(and just bought it on Blu-Ray)on the large screen , in spite of James McAvoy- the fictional Dr. Garrigan, who smiles his way through 95% of the movie, and even looks high on something in a number of scenes. Unfortunately, this was a poor casting job in my opinion, and McAvoy at times is distracting. They hit a home-run with Forest and supporting cast, and fouled out to the catcher with McAvoy. My dislike of McAvoy has been reaffirmed with his overplayed part in the X-Men series. That said, this is a movie worth watching if only to see a great actor in a perfect roll to highlight his skills, and see an Oscar worthy performance. Even knowing the real history behind the man, the story creates some tension as to when his diabolical side would come out. Considering Whitaker's body of work(The Crying Game, Ghost Dog, Panic Room and some great TV roles) I'm somewhat surprised he hasn't taken home more than this one Best Actor statue. Who knows, he is a very busy actor, and still has time to bag another one. Check this movie out if you haven't seen it yet, and yes the ""R"" rating is well deserved- definitely not for the kiddies."
"filipemanuelneto","9","0","1","25 June 2016"," An excellent film about recent history facts
","Based on true events, this film depicts the life and personality of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Directed by Kevin Macdonald, this film has a screenplay by Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan. The cast is led by Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy.<br/><br/>This film portrays, mostly, real facts which are part of the dark side of the history of a young African country: Uganda. Idi Amin led the country with an iron fist, not hesitating to kill all potential opponents. Despite all the cast have played their role with great quality, Whitaker deserves mention: he knew perfectly incorporate the several facets of this highly contradictory historical character: in some moments, his thought and personality can seem very positive but, as the film is rolling, the audience increasingly contacts with the darker side of a deeply paranoid personality, worthy of a Caligula. Whitaker was truly intimidating, and the staff of characterization and costume managed to complete his work by giving him a strong physical resemblance to the real dictator. So its not surprising that Whitaker has won (with merit) the Oscar for Best Leading Actor. But be friend with someone like Amin means walking on the edge of a knife and too close to death. The character of McAvoy, a young idealistic and naive doctor from Scotland who went to Africa in search of adventure, shows us these dangers, and its delightful to see his mind awakening to the problems of that country, while contacting directly with the madness of his new African friend.<br/><br/>Visual, special and sound effects were very good, especially in the most stunning scenes, and scenarios easily transport us to Africa. The script, in turn, is quite consistent and realistic, not falling into exaggeration nor blistering action scenes. Everything went as it should, everything was done in the correct measure."

"luke-a-mcgowan","9","0","1","3 April 2016"," Forest Whitaker gives one of the finest performances of all time
","Holds up very well on rewatch. <br/><br/>1. The opening scenes in Scotland are vital, and indicative of how director Kevin McDonald and screenwriters Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock set their movie up. Within two minutes of meeting Nicholas' boring and self-satisfied father, we're desperate for the young doctor to get away from a stale life at home for some adventure. McDonald leaves out any sound but the drone of his voice, and keeps the like dim and bleak as a contrast to the colour and noise of Africa. The way that Nicholas lands on Canada first is not only humorous but stops the film feeling like a make believe story. Sometimes those little things can improve a film's authenticity.<br/><br/>2. Forest Whitaker's performance in this film is not only one of the best black performances ever put to screen, it is one of the single best acting performances of all time. Only Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood eclipses him. I have no doubt that the real Whitaker is a very gentle man, which shows through when Amin shows laughter or friendliness. But when Amin has one of his many mood swings, he's a terrifying monster, with his imposing physical form, impeccable Ugandan shout and overbearing presence. <br/><br/>3. Without the film's screenplay, however, this film would've been very by-the-numbers. The writing and placement of Nicholas make us fearful of Amin ourselves, the way he gives a little too much credit to Nicholas, the way he does not respond to small talk, the way he comes into Nicholas' room with no respect for his privacy. By the time Nicholas' passport is stolen and replaced, we can practically feel Amin's iron grip around our chests.<br/><br/>4. James McAvoy's performance is one I took for granted on first viewing, but appreciated so much more the second time. Its quite unlike what McAvoy is best known for, and refreshingly unnoble and more than a bit arrogant. He is an arrogant, ponce school boy dropped way out of his league in Uganda. Even as people try to tell him about Amin's evils, his naive ideals keep him from seeing the truth. At no point do we question Nicholas' intelligence, because he's a fully realised character whose decisions are logical for him. <br/><br/>5. The toxic relationship between Amin and Nicholas is central to the film. He's getting praise for things he doesn't deserve, then he's being told to mind his business. He's not just a doctor, then he's just a doctor. Every time Amin says Nicholas is his adviser, we don't feel it - the one time Nicholas makes an order we can feel the shaky authority. <br/><br/>6. The subplot of the Cabinet Minister Jonah Wasswa is likely the strongest in the film. It foreshadows how easily Amin throws aside his advisors and demonstrates Amin's madness that he would execute a man on the mere suspicion of unsubstantiated wrongdoing. The subplot of Nicholas' affair with Kay is a close second. Some might complain that the flirtation with the doctor's wife at the start of the film is superfluous, but its a sensational foreshadow of his affair with Kay later in the movie. <br/><br/>7. Kerry Washington is almost unrecognisable as Kay, a completely unsexy and raw performance as the neglected and ostracised wife. Yet her chemistry with McAvoy somehow still causes sparks...and it works. David Oyelowo is also brilliant as a Doctor Junju.<br/><br/>8. The British agent played by Simon McBurney is also brilliant. From his first appearance, we get a nasty impression that he's smug and self-important, and when Nicholas finally breaks and goes to him for help all of his past behaviour fits in. <br/><br/>9. Amin's torture of Garrigan consists of some of the most wrenching torture scenes since Misery.<br/><br/>10. The film drags slightly towards the end, but as a whole its a remarkably satisfying experience. The way it works in fiction around fact is an achievement in itself."

Nicholas gradually realizes the problem of The Government by Amin. In my opinion, the characteristic of Nicholas is very normal as a young guy these days.

","The Last King of Scotland (2006): Dir: Kevin MacDonald / Cast: James McAvoy, Forest Whitaker, Gillian Anderson, Kerry Washington, Simon McBurney: Observant yet disturbing film about a Scottish doctor who travels to Uganda and ends up as the physician of the Ugandan President until discovering his true nature. Set in 1970 and directed by Kevin MacDonald who presents a culture of slavery within the illusion of freedom. Certain elements are predictable such as the doctor having an affair with one of the President's three wives. Otherwise the film holds together thanks to a menacing performance by Forest Whitaker. He gives off charm in his introduction but his true nature eventually sets in where intimidation haunts in resemblance of his image. James McAvoy is fantastic as the young doctor who gets caught up in the forbidden and suffers consequences. He will have to survive so to reveal the havoc in the Uganda territory. Kerry Washington portrays one of the wives who ends up pregnant and eventually in fatal trouble. Gillian Anderson plays a married woman whom McAvoy gets involved with but the role is the most underwritten. This is a well crafted film that really captures the era as well as create tension for the protagonist.

","Director Kevin Macdonald dives headfirst into a committed style of Hollywood documentary visual style. Something that he is comfortable with as seen in ""One Day in September"" and ""Touching the Void. "" McAvoy's boyish acting enhances Garrigan's apolitical foolishness and naivety. It reminds me of the Shakespearean style of story in relation to the doctor's catastrophic failings. On a dramatization note, The acting by Forest Whitaker was exceptional and well deserved for an Oscar. He is astoundingly multifaceted and convincing in his role and you can always feel the emotional response on screen, in real life. I think it carried well and although it was well done there were some unneeded sexual scenes that seemed to have little to no relevance and reason to be in the film. The reason i titled it unexceptional was because there was a sense of amateur production that was carried by the acting and story line. It didn't have the whole picture and even the story didn't unravel with completely conclusive results. Overall, I probably wouldn't watch this again. I would like to see maybe the same story line but done much more seriously."

Yes, Forest Whitaker's acting did greatly in building up the character for this movie. But that character wasn't quite portrayed evenly due to the heavy focus from Nicholas' point of View, which kind of balanced the charm and intimidation Amin had. Yet the truth of ruthlessness wasn't really covered, since the actual ruthless side the president wasn't depicted in the movie. Yet as I said earlier the acting overall is a very good one, all thanks to Forest Whitaker's performance in giving live to the character, despite the imbalanced depiction of the ruthlessness.

","Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a newly qualified doctor who heads out to Uganda to work at one of their rural hospitals with a couple of British doctors. Along the way he strikes up a friendship with President/General Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). Garrigan ends up working for Amin as his physician and one of his closest advisors. British doctor Sarah Merritt (Gillian Anderson) tries to warn Garrigan that Amin may not be all that he seems, but Garrigan refuses to listen. However, as time passes Garrigan begins to notice Amin's increasingly erratic behaviour and starts to discover exactly who he's working for.<br/><br/>I'm a fairly young pup so I wasn't alive during Amin's evil regime. For that reason I'm not really in a position to comment on how well Whitaker portrays Amin. However, I am in a position to judge his on-screen performance and I must say that he was outstanding. Like many of the great 'method' actors, Whitaker stayed in character both on set and off set and also put on an extra 50 pound of weight for the role. Whitaker is a good actor generally, but I really think this role meant a lot to him and his hard work paid off with a thoroughly deserved Oscar win. Whitaker's chilling portrayal was nothing short of incredible and is easily the best performance that I've seen from him. McAvoy is good here, but at this point in his career I still think he was a little rough around the edges - although I must admit he has improved over time. I still find it hard to believe that a fairly big Hollywood actor like McAvoy used to star in UK based sitcom Early Doors which is set in my neck of the woods in Manchester.<br/><br/>I did have a couple of minor issues with this film; I thought that the British doctors were a little under-used and contributed next to nothing to the film. It's possible Macdonald may have cast them in the film because Amin had British doctors working for him although this is unclear. The film also had a sleazy edge to it that it perhaps did not need. I also thought the ending was perhaps a bit too 'Hollywood' but it was at least fairly exciting.<br/><br/>Overall then there is a lot to recommend here. The film is well-shot with some very nice cinematography. Whitaker's performance was incredible and the film itself moved along fairly well considering its 120 minute length. It may not be totally accurate, but it's a powerful film that is well worth watching."

It sets forth by heightening the drama and high adrenaline, even creating a completely fictional character through whom the audience sees and experiences the story.

","Criticism after criticism about elements of historical biopics that either were left out or added in that don't work can butcher a response to a certain film. News flash! Making a textbook into a movie isn't what biopics are about. Talented writers and directors know how to get a controlling theme or idea about someone without having to read notes from their 7th grade history class. By adding in drama or even complex characters, we're able to get an interesting perspective at historical time periods and people. ""The Last King of Scotland"" is based on the events of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's regime as seen by his personal physician during the 1970s. Amin, played ferociously by Forest Whitaker in an Oscar- winning performance, was truly a psychotic human being. Responsible for over 300,000 deaths, we see the international outrage that arises due to Amin's brutality. The thing that turned people off from this film wasn't the harsh subject matter, but the fact that Idi Amin's physician, Dr. Nicolas Garrigan, never even existed. Many call that underachieving, I call it brilliance. James McAvoy portrays the fictional Scottish doctor as a crazy adventure-seeker who changes drastically once seeing Amin for what he truly is. The performances by Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy are remarkable and it's tragic to see the outcome of their characters bondage. McAvoy's character is used to show the world's realization of the horrific brutality Idi Amin caused. Through this doctor we get a heart- pounding political thriller that both transforms what we know into an unpredictable nail-bitter and reminds us of the horrors of Amin's reign. With a subtle memoriam to those who lost their lives in Uganda during the 70's, ""The Last King of Scotland"" is directed with perfection by the great Kevin Macdonald by illustrating history with a rapid heartbeat and an ounce or two of bold creativity flourishing with bravery. By adding intriguing shots filled with tension, he brings peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock's riveting story to live with ferocious talent. Hands down this is a true highlight of biography storytelling that educates us and provokes us."

","'The Last King of Scotland' is all about Forrest Whitaker; as soon as he graces the screen, he is Idi Amin. The unison of Whitaker's physicality and his superb East African accent, which is perhaps the most impressive element of his performance, transforms him into the Ugandan dictator.<br/><br/>Although it is clear that Amin is a manipulator and intent on getting his own way, he is loquacious, magnetic and, surprisingly, quite affable. He charms both the viewer and Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), the impressionable Scottish doctor who initially believes Amin's rousing yet hollow speeches.<br/><br/>It soon becomes apparent however that this is a charm offensive, a manipulative process that wears very thin once Amin's deeply ugly, frenetic megalomania is laid bare. Like many of history's dictators ‚Äì Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot ‚Äì Amin succumbs to paranoia, and mass violence ensues.<br/><br/>The film begins with the proclamation that 'This film is inspired by real people and real events', however it fails to state that the central character Nicholas Garrigan is actually entirely fictional. I hadn't looked into the film's veracity before watching it, however although there appeared to be clear narrative exaggerations at times, I had presumed that Garrigan was at least a real person. It is a typical example of the 'inspired by real events' clich√©, 'inspired' is always the key part of the sentence.<br/><br/>The film follows Garrigan as he inadvertently becomes Amin's personal physician and at times 'closest adviser'; it is indeed an extraordinary predicament, but I suppose stranger things have happened. McAvoy is good as Garrigan, his gradually souring relationship with Amin is interesting and intense, they have many great exchanges.<br/><br/>However, with the knowledge that Nicholas Garrigan is an invention of Giles Foden, author of the book on which the film is based, Scotland's narrative seems rather formulaic and implausible. I found Garrigan's relationships with medic Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson) and Kay Amin (Kerry Washington) to be hackneyed plot mechanisms.<br/><br/>While the film includes real events such as the Israeli hostage crisis at Entebbe International Airport, much of what occurs is either historically unfaithful or sheer fiction. The story was inspired by one of Amin's many self-bestowed titles ‚Äì The King of Scotland.<br/><br/>An example of the film's implausibility is the scene where Garrigan and Amin first meet. Amin's Citroen DS has been in a collision with a cow (what appears to be an Ankole-Watusi), leaving him with an injured hand that Garrigan tends to. The creature appears to be fatally wounded and wails in a pain until Garrigan, who has repeatedly asked for it to be put out of its misery, takes Amin's gun from the roof of the car and mercifully shoots it twice in the head.<br/><br/>Although the surrounding guards train their guns on Garrigan, predictably Amin respects his audacity, and, amusingly, is particularly pleased when he finds out he is Scottish. It is a scene that is quite bereft of credibility.<br/><br/>Although there are elements of character study, my main problem with the film is that it doesn't give an insight into Amin's rule and the atrocities committed under it. Although he is clearly a despot, a mentally ill bully, the film's emphasis on his fictional relationship with Garrigan rather than fact meant that I didn't find him hateful.<br/><br/>'The Last King of Scotland' features a superb transformation from Forest Whitaker and a series of well-constructed scenes, however ultimately the largely fictional narrative that surrounds Whitaker is rather formulaic.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

In this film, the cuddliness of evil is done very well. Even though the Scottish doctor is fictional, his story is believable because he is weak, needy and self-destructive (sleep with a murdering president's wife when there are plenty other women available, and it's why he bonds so well with Amin. He is slimy so it makes it easier for us also to bond with Amin and hate ourselves for doing so. People that are old enough, like me, remember well our ambivalent view of Amin. A monster, perhaps, but one who both loved and hated the British; a phenomenon that exists still in Africa.

","The Last King of Scotland is a biopic with a twist. It is ostensibly a film about young Scottish medical graduate Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy) and his somewhat aimless decision to travel to Uganda. Except of course it's not about him at all. Nicholas is merely a looking glass through which the infamous dictator Idi Amin (Whitaker) can be viewed. Amin's legend is such that a pure biopic may have been overwhelming. Viewing him and his larger than life persona though a naive young Scotsman's eyes makes him more palatable. <br/><br/>Naive is the optimum word for the young doctor. He is bowled over by Amin's rabble-rousing speeches, caught up in the excitement and the bluster. ""Come on, give the man a chance,"" he splutters to a more cerebral colleague. <br/><br/>This admiration turns to borderline infatuation when, during a chance encounter, Nicholas bonds with the Ugandan leader over a love of Scotland. Things escalate and before long Nicholas is appointed as Amin's personal physician. Not a bad post for someone just weeks out of medical school. <br/><br/>And who can really blame him for accepting the role? The danger signs in Amin and his regime are there - his exuberance, his certainty that he knows his date of death through a vision, signs of totalitarian violence on the street. But these (bar the last one) can be passed off as eccentricities, and must have been small fry when compared to the intoxicating aroma of power. <br/><br/>As Amin's paranoia grows, Nicholas gets more and more out of his depth. Officials disappear without trace, Nicholas is forbidden to leave and, slowly but surely, things begin to fall apart. <br/><br/>When the true horror of Amin's regime finally becomes clear to the doctor, the extent of his naivety and wilful blindness, along with his inability to keep his trousers on, catch up with him. In fact, they don't just catch up; they overtake, and then lap him. Twice. <br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland is a thriller at heart, and, in places, an incredibly grim one. The tension through the latter half is palpable, rising to an almost unbearable crescendo at its frantic climax. <br/><br/>McAvoy is excellent as the foolish yet ultimately good-hearted doctor, allowing the fear to seep through as he realises what he's got himself into. But it is Whitaker who steals the show, perfectly capturing the essence of Idi Amin in all his magnetic insanity and chronic instability. It's a towering performance that transforms the film from a good, solid thriller into an excellent and important character study."

","Kevin Macdonald's 'The Last King Of Scotland' tells the haunting story of Idi Amin from the perspective his doctor, Garrigan's point of view. Based on Giles Foden's novel of the same title, the book works as an excellent character study from an outsider's perspective and a chilling historical account (though slightly fictionalized). Before watching the film, I was a bit familiar with Idi Amin's history and what a powerful man he was but I didn't know about the extent of his atrocities. The film also depicts him as somewhat of a man of mystery. He suffered from paranoia which clearly indicates that he had mental problems.<br/><br/>Coming back to the film at hand. It is quite well made especially where visuals are concerned. However, I found the background score to be very intrusive at time reminding us that we're watching a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>'The Last King of Scotland' showcases Forest Whitaker's talent. Whitaker breathes fire into the role and he portrays the various shades of Amin with gusto. He owns the part. James McAvoy is superb as well and he effortlessly displays Garrigan's transformation from an adventurous, carefree, brattish young doctor to a President's 'advisor' who is spoilt by money and power to a terrified victim enslaved by the man he looked up to. Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington stand out in the supporting performances.<br/><br/>The film does primarily focus on Amin and Garrigan's relationship and the influence he had on him. I would have liked to have seen more about Amin's own inner conflicts (which the movie hints) and how he reigned the country and the geo-political implications of it. Yet, 'The Last King of Scotland' remains an intriguing character study of a ruthless, powerful and charming figure in history."

","I don't believe that ADD is a real disease, at least if it is it's grossly over diagnosed and mistreated. Still, I have trouble making through films longer than 90 minutes. There have been few films throughout my 33 years that have held my attention longer, but generally ‚Äì even if I'm pretty captivated ‚Äì I lose interest after an hour and a half. The Last King of Scotland was two hours, yet it felt like I didn't blink once.<br/><br/>The main character is Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who seems to be a spoiled Scottish man. The movie opens with him having graduated medical school. Him and a number of classmates strip their clothing and jump into a river, maybe showing his wild and untamed side. The next scene involved him at a dinner with his parents. His father seems to be a disciplinarian who, while proud of Garrigan, has snide comments. I wish there would've been more depth into Garrigan's family and the relationship between him and his father, as it may relate to the way he interacted with General Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) later in the movie.<br/><br/>Garrigan seeks adventure before settling down to his life of medicine and picks a spot at random to volunteer. He chooses Uganda (after a failed attempt in which his finger landed in Canada) and within ten minutes of the movie starting, we are transported to this colorful African country. It's 1970' only a couple decades have passed since the end of colonial rule, although the British still have a major influence. The white Garrigan moves freely, even getting off of the bus to have sex with a woman (his sexual desire will play a huge role later). It is against this background and with a carefree attitude that Garrigan starts his volunteer time a religious organization giving shots to Ugandan children.<br/><br/>While driving with Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson), his bosses wife, he is stopped by the military. At first nervous, the pair seems to relax when they're informed the General has been in an accident and needs medical attention. They arrive at a scene where the car driving General Amin hit a cow. There are armed soldiers who look like they are no older than 18 and have little experience handling the rifles they are in command of. Garrigan helps Amin, then brazenly steals a gun from the hood of a car and puts the suffering cow out of its misery. After a moment of tenseness, Amin takes a liking to Garrigan and trades shirts- giving the young man his General's shirt in exchange for shirt with the Scottish flag.<br/><br/>Back at the reservation Garrigan's attempt to make out with Merrit is rejected, although there is obvious passion. Shortly after, Gerrigan gets a call from Amin's men informing him that the General would like a meeting. In Amin's office, Gerrigan is offered a job as the General's physician which, after rejecting, he eventually accepts.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie moves quickly, with Gerrigan becoming the General's closest and most trusted adviser. There are clues throughout the movie that Amin is a tyrant, but nothing solid. A British diplomat keeps trying to get the attention of Gerrigan, who rejects the man and his request for information concerning the General. Around this time, Garrigan becomes interested in one of the General's wives, Kay Amin (Kerry Washington); bad things await.<br/><br/>The General buys Garrigan a new car and immediately asks for a ride. Gerrigan accepts and on the way armed militants attempt to kill the General. They manage to get away, but the rest of his team is killed and the General suspects everyone. By this point, Gerrigan is noticing more shady happenings occurring around the General. There is one other man whom the General trusts, but one night Garrigan sees the man at a hotel talking with some white men. Due to the paranoia of the General and Garrigan, he confesses to the General what he saw at the hotel.<br/><br/>Days later Garrigan is convinced to attend a meeting with the diplomat and a writer for the NY Times who has been reporting on the genocide committed by the General. It turns out that number two's meeting with the white men was because they represented a pharmaceutical company. Nothing underhanded. Now the man has disappeared, which makes the nervousness and guilt of Garrigan grow exponentially. Another personal complaint happens now; in addition to wanting more information about Garrigan's relationship with his father, I would like to know about what's going through his head while things go from great to bad to horrible.<br/><br/>The General is going crazier and crazier and eventually kicks out all British and threatens to expel all non- state run media as well. Garrigan asks if he can go home, but is rejected. That night at a party for the General, Garrigan sleeps with Kay. They are almost caught and when Garrigan returns home his house has been ransacked and his Scottish passport has been replaced with its Ugandan counterpart. Kay and Garrigan keep the affair going. Then things get crazy.<br/><br/>Kay gets pregnant and while attempting an abortion, gets caught by the military. This leads to Garrigan finding her body ‚Äì with arms, legs, and head cut off ‚Äì at his hospital. He freaks out and, following the advice of the diplomat (his new best friend) attempts to kill the General. He is caught, tortured, and left for dead. In the end he escapes and we public opinion of the dictator quickly drops; power is lost soon after.<br/><br/>All in all, some beautiful performances were given. It bothers me when the main character is an African, but played by a USian- was it really that hard to find an actual African? When all is said and done though, there isn't much to complain about."

Forest Whitaker encapsulates magnificently the shocking nature of Amin's fall into paranoia and the way Whitaker captures this is exponentially commendable. Whitaker aside, the rest of the acting in the film can drop and lack at points. I felt McAvoy at time doesn't find a balance between a character who the audience are both meant to hate, and somewhat warm to. He doesn't give us time to warm to him early on and this makes the latter scenes fall short, he is simply not a likable character for the majority of the film. As a protagonist I feel this can deter the audience.<br/><br/>However, the way Madonald has manage to draw in a whole range of themes and stories is amazing, it constantly keeps the audience invigorated in the overall political story the film revolves around. The romances, the friendships and Garrigans roller coaster through this world, that is like an open fissure to him gives the audience something to become involved and interested in.

"Tom-But","8","0","1","15 March 2012"," What Amin fella. Seriously, Idi know how he had any mates at all
","Forest Whitaker's performance as the murderous dictator Idi Amin in this film is an endlessly surprising and deeply disturbing spectacle, a multi-layered concoction of corrupted insanity that is at once ostentatious and yet often keenly understated. It reminded me of Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning turn five years earlier as Alonzo Harris in Training Day: both characters have an unmistakable charisma that, for the most part, masks the immorality and resolute self-interest that pervades their every action. In both films, the entry point for the audience is a young, naive character (for Whitaker it's James McAvoy, while Washington's is Ethan Hawke) in a fish-out-of-water scenario, both entrusting their lives into the hands of these sociopaths. As is often the case in such situations, both McAvoy and Hawke's souls are at stake, the outcome reliant on the choices they make, whether to stand by their deluded convictions of the greater good as purported by these crazy bast*rds, or acknowledge that they are... well, crazy bast*rds. In McAvoy's case, he holds his own splendidly, and The Last King Of Scotland, in all regards, is a marvellous achievement, but ultimately it is Whitaker's show. Watch as he exudes faux charm in his many press conferences, as he has a fiery and genuinely frightening overreaction to a small incident and then, perhaps most captivating of all, simply sits staring vacantly, suggesting no semblance of humanity or compassion within his emotional grasp, his eye twitching once or twice as the only testament to his acknowledgement of the words of another. But, God, what a twitch."

","Although the life and times of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin was as fascinating as it was disastrous for the Ugandan citizens, only two movies about Amins reign come to mind: ""Raid on Entebbe"", featuring the charismatic Yaphet Kotto as Amin and ""Rise and Fall of Idi Amin"", which was primarily an exploitation film.<br/><br/>Hoping for an authentic film with an impressive cast, I had high expectations for ""The Last King of Scotland"" since I had seen Forrest Whitaker in the trailer but left slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>Let me first say, Whitaker is excellent (and nobody was more deserving to win the Oscar) playing what may well become the role of his life ‚Äì but people familiar with the real Idi Amin will find very little similarity between the real dictator and Whitakers performance.<br/><br/>On the weak sides are actors James McAvory and Gillian Anderson (who has little to do but to confirm that McAvorys character is a wife-stealer); McAvorys is given the role of Dr. Garrigan whom the script dooms to be a very shallow and unsympathetic character, often making the viewer wonder why they would root for such a protagonist.<br/><br/>Apart from Simon McBurney, playing a suitably slimy Stone, the movie is carried by very strong African actors like David Oyelowo or Stephen Rwangyezi but none given more than fleeting screen time. Instead, the film centres on the main characters, often forgetting to show us the real implications of Amins action: the effects it had on Uganda, its economy, social structure and its people. The viewer would like to see more about life in Kampala but only gets to see corrupt politicians and, of course, the few Ugandan wives that Dr. Garrigan seduces. Essentially it's two hours of Whitaker, a (no pun intended) rather pale McAvory and many wasted opportunities.<br/><br/>If you want to see an excellent performance and a thriller along the lines of ""Blood Diamonds"", ""The Last King of Scotland"" is an excellent movie.

","I didn't have any preconceived expectations of The Last King of Scotland. I spotted the DVD on eBay being sold for a few dollars and I remembered that a friend of mine was discussing it a while back and got me curious. I was also aware that it was a film depicting Idi Amin and since I'm always interested in seeing movies about history's evil dictators I figured that since the film had very positive reviews it was something worth sitting through. With little to do one day, I popped in the film and was quite impressed by it.<br/><br/>The Last King Of Scotland chronicles Amin's regime through the viewpoint of a young doctor named Nicholas Garrison, who went to Uganda to escape his family life. He finds himself being appointed as the new President of Uganda's personal physician. He develops a close friendship with Amin as he provides him with the best possible life in Kampala, but over time he begins to see the horrors of Amin's terrifying personality as well as his brutal dictatorship that left thousands of people dead.<br/><br/>There are two key reasons why this film is effective. The first is the acting. James McAvoy is very good and certainly held his ground as being the central protagonist and everyone else did good jobs, but what is really worth seeing is Forest Whitaker's Oscar-winning performance as Idi Amin himself. He really brings the man to life and convinces you that he could be Amin's double. The performance not only portrays the side of him that is a psychotic dictator, but also the easygoing family man that would do anything to make the people he loved happy. It made him appear more developed as a character.<br/><br/>The second key reason for success is the film's willingness to push typical boundaries. The violence, while limited to just a few scenes towards the end, are really quite graphic and made me feel a little ill. Notably the 'hanging' scene which is just gut wrenching. The third reason is of course the great screenplay that made the fictional doctor, Garrison, seem like he may have been real and provide different sides to Idi Amin's character.<br/><br/>The Last King of Scotland is a highly engaging film that I highly recommend to any moviegoer provided they are ready to see some horrific things and know that what they are watching is mostly true. It's a great movie and well worth renting and watching, especially for Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>8/10"
"compi24","9","0","1","7 August 2011"," Review of ""The Last King Of Scotland""
","""The Last King Of Scotland"" is the mostly true story of Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy), a young Scottish physician who travels to Uganda and eventually becomes the personal doctor to the dictator, Idi Amin (Whitaker). Directed by Kevin MacDonald, this movie certainly struck a few dissonant chords with me. I'm not saying the film was bad, in fact I found it ""The Last King Of Scotland"" to be a very remarkable motion picture. However, it is a deeply disturbing piece that aims to show the audience just how deranged Idi Amin was as Uganda's President. Which brings me to the film's most noteworthy aspect - Forest Whitaker's amazing, Academy-Award Winning turn as Idi Amin himself. Forest Whitaker's performance in ""The Last King Of Scotland"" is incredibly dynamic because at times I found myself laughing, gasping, and cringing in anger at some of the things that Whitaker did on screen. Some of the stuff that Whitaker's Amin does in this movie is truly frightening and really made me realize just how much of a megalomaniacal sociopath Amin was in real life. In fact there is one moment in this movie (one that I won't fully disclose due to it's grisliness) where I found myself just gaping at my television set - yeah stuff gets pretty grotesque. Obviously, Whitaker rightfully earned the Oscar For Best Actor in 2007. As for James McAvoy, he did a great job in his role as the doctor who just can't seem to escape the madness of Idi Amin, and throughout the movie you really learn to feel for his character. The script, of course, was brilliantly written, as it was adapted from the reportedly excellent Giles Foden novel of the same name. In terms of cinematography, I thought that the film's use of close-up shots on Amin really helped to accentuate his sheer madness and insanity. As for the rest of the camera work everything looks clean and efficient. All in all, I found ""The Last King Of Scotland"" to be a very remarkable, and disconcerting film that effectively used it's brilliant performances and impressive script to highlight the sheer terror that Idi Amin inflicted upon Uganda and it's people."

","I have read other reviews before posting mine, out of curiosity and find really interesting the various takes people have on this movie.<br/><br/>Obviously, depending on what you were expecting from the movie, your take on it is very different, some wanted to watch the real story about Amin Dada, some others wanted to see Uganda as it was, etc.<br/><br/>I, for myself, didn't expect anything. My knowledge about Idi Amin and Uganda were almost non-existent, so I guess this is one of the reason I I liked it so much.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the performance of Forrest Whitaker is just mind-blowing and I really don't think I robbed the Oscar he received for it. Not only his ability to mimic Amin quirks and body language, but the easiness with which he can switch from charming/funny to downright scary and insane are just incredibly impressive.<br/><br/>That being said, James McAvoy delivers an incredible performance with a very difficult part, IMO. Nicholas Garrigan is no hero, he is just a somewhat cocky and arrogant Scotsman who came to Uganda not for humanitarian reasons, but to escape his Scottish life and dad. Many critics have been made about this character, but it is for me one of the strength of the story. We are not following a hero here, but a protagonist, a normal human guy, with his flaws, his mistakes, and the consequences he faces for his wrong choices and his refusal to face the truth. McAcvoy excels here and conveys superbly the gradual realization of Garrigan of the horrors Amin is responsible of and the trap he has been set up in. It was a really difficult role to play, and it's a pity his work is not more praised, obviously overshadowed by the showier role of Amin.<br/><br/>Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington give also good performances, despite a questionable use of their characters.<br/><br/>Now, as for Garrigan, I found him really representative of the Western civilization and its relationship with Africa, in the sense that Western people are more than ready to come and take whatever they can from Africa, but will easily turn their eyes when faced with the abrupt reality of the living conditions and the horror these people experience there. The movie depicts it really well through Garrigan's eyes, and I appreciated it profoundly.<br/><br/>There are two specifically violent scenes, very graphic, but the horror the film displays is more subtle and diffuse little by little until the end scenes with a great climax.<br/><br/>The only flaw for me are the useless subplots involving Garrigan's love life, that give too much a ""Hollywood"" tone to an otherwise great movie."
"imdb-21872","6","0","1","31 March 2011"," The real story of Idi Amin would have been a lot more entertaining.
","The last King of Scotland is (very) loosely based on the former president of Uganda Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) and the fictional story of a young freshly qualified Scottish doctor, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). The film is based on Giles Foden's novel of the same name and while a lot of the story told about Amin's Brutal regime is quite true, the whole premise of the film is pure fiction. After doing some research, the closest match to the fictional doctor's character was a man called Bob Astles, who was neither Scottish nor a doctor. Astles was a former British soldier and colonial officer who lived in Uganda and became an associate of presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin. Astles had a varying career in Uganda and was even imprisoned by Amin for 17 weeks. He eventually worked for Amin while running a pineapple farm as well as an aviation service. He later said, ""I kept my eyes shut, I said nothing about what I saw, which is what they liked."" A Wikipedia article states, ""He was feared, and considered by many to be a malign influence on the dictator; others thought he was a moderating presence."" Following the Uganda-Tanzania War which led to the demise of Amin's regime in 1979, Astles fled to Kenya, but was brought back to Uganda to face criminal charges. He was imprisoned for his alleged association with Amin's security apparatus, and was charged with everything from murder and corruption to theft. Though acquitted, he remained in Luzira Prison for six and a half years, returning to Britain after his release in 1985. I cannot for the life of me understand why all the so called 'based on a real story' mainstream films feel like they need to embellish the truth to such an extent! This period in Uganda's history has more than enough drama, war, and notable events like the 'Air France hostage' situation in Entebbe airport. Whilst this incident plays a major part of the ending of the film, it's a shame that they felt the need to fictionalise this incident as well by making the fictional doctor the key part of this incident as well. Again, I can understand why they had to, after all, the whole film is based around the fictional doctor! My point is that you can tell the story of Uganda and Idi Amin and his crazed behaviour and the slaying of more than 300,000 of his opposition and the Entebbe incident including the dramatic rescue of all but one of the hostages, and make all this one hell of a film! To date, no film has managed to achieve this and I for one think its a crying shame and a waste of a great opportunity. If it wasn't for the fact that that 25% of this story is real, I would have loved this film, but the fact that the film makers chose to use a fictional book to base this story on rather than the far better real story, spoils it for me. Having said all that, it's still well worth watching, I just waiting for some brave film producer to be the first to actually make a film about a true story that has nothing but facts in it!"

","Scotsman Kevin MacDonald (Touching the Void) brings to screen Giles Foden's novel of Idi Amin's rise to power in the early seventies. Like most dictators, the initial stages of Amin's period in office offer hope. But it soon becomes clear that Uganda has leaped head first from the pan into the fire and then cranked up the flames.<br/><br/>Amin was a notorious figure who crushed all political opposition and any other person he suspected of treason. His paranoia resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.<br/><br/>Much has been said of Forest Whitaker's performance and there is little doubt that he will win the Oscar and deservedly so. Whitaker has long been carving out compelling characters on the fringes of convention, from The Crying Game to Ghost Dog, with his role as Charlie 'Bird' Parker in Birdy as a particular standout. Whitaker is also a Producer and Director, helming such films as 'Waiting to Exhale' and 'Hope Floats'. His selection process as an actor seems to be more finely tuned.<br/><br/>This is a strong role and he is perfectly cast. Both endearing and frightening, Whitaker shows the many sides to the fascinating Amin without ever becoming too sympathetic. <br/><br/>However it is James McAvoy who is the real surprise. His confident persona as fictional character, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is charming at first, particularly to the Ugandan President, but he is soon in over his head. We're right there alongside his living nightmare. Gillian Anderson too, is a delight, having 'grown up' since her X-Files days. Let's hope we see more of her in future.<br/><br/>MacDonald wisely realizes that this is an actor's film and keeps them close by. However Amin's real reign of insanity is at a distance. There are a couple of key scenes that perhaps explains why. MacDonald is saving up the shocks. However it's hard to get a real grasp on the terror that Amin inflicted on his people. This was a despot, up there with Pol Pot, another lunatic who managed to escape justice and live to a decent age. Who ever said what goes around comes around?<br/><br/>There are stronger films on similar themes, notably 'The Killing Fields' and 'Cry Freedom', but this is a film about the relationship between two individuals and the balance of power within it. By introducing the fictional Scotsman, we are able to discover Amin through a stranger's eyes, though it is simply a plot device in order to tell Amin's story. By keeping his many atrocities at a distance, one wonders therefore, what was the point? <br/><br/>This is still a powerful film, with fantastic performances from its two leads. Nevertheless this will be remembered as the film that gave Forest Whitaker his Oscar, rather than the story of one of the 20th century's most terrorizing figures."
"paul2001sw-1","6","0","3","22 October 2009"," A good book spoiled
","Maybe it's a mistake to see an adaptation of a book if you've already read the novel. Giles Fodden's 'The Last King of Scotland' was so very good - and I liked it for its three insights: into the real, tragic history of Uganda; into the man-child madman who was Idi Amin; and into the (imaginary) mindset of a Scottish doctor whose entanglement with Amin is the basis of the story. Unfortuantly, Kevin MacDonald's film, while superficially broadly true to the book, loses all of its main qualities. The plot is simplified, partly (I guess) for length, but also, I fear, to provide more of what I might call ""Hollywood moments"". Nowhere in the book does Amin personally attempt to murder the doctor in public, for example; indeed, I came to dread hearing the film's score, because whenever music started in the background, it was normally to accompany an action sequence that was that little bit more simplistic than anything in the novel. And it's not as if there wasn't plenty of action in the book to start with; just that it was all more nuanced, and in my opinion, the book's merit lay wholly in that nuance. Without it, the story is less convincing, tells us much less about Uganda and although Forest Whittaker tries hard, he can't fully convey the remarkable nature of Amin's personality when the film almost sanitises his madness to make it fit a little more closely to what audiences expect of a movie villain. The film even commits what I consider to be among the cardinal sins of adaptations (but a surprisingly common one); retaining a scene that has been stripped of all context by decisions made elsewhere in the movie. The hijack of an Israeli plane, which is used here to end the story, occurred in the middle of the original and then it made sense; here it makes none, and when the film tells us that the hijack turned international opinion against Amin, it's wholly baffling (in fact, I'm not even sure it's true, but even in the world of the film, it is not a coherent conclusion). Finally, the very end gives the doctor a hope of redemption marred by clich√© (""tell the world. they'll believe you. you're a white man"") when Fodden's story was deeper, murkier, more ambiguous and so much more interesting. A great disappointment, particularly as the source material is clearly recognisable; but sadly dumbed down at every point that matters."

","I am not really a fan of movies based extremely loosely on real life events or people. The only thing that set this movie apart was Whitaker and McAvoy. The story was meh and the writing was meh. The directing was nothing special, but what a performance by Whitaker. This will down in my memory as one of most memorable performances of all time for me. He really was electric to watch and hard to take your eyes off. He really propelled the movie into something that was actually enjoyable to watch. I have to say that I was pretty impressed by James McAvoy and I think he has a lot of potential and if he manages his career well has a hopeful future as an actor. I guess there is not a lot more to say about this movie. I loved watching Whitaker and that was about it. Whitaker is the only reason this movie is an 8 and not higher."

","The Last King of Scotland (2006) ¬ñ Having read the book a few years ago I was very intrigued to see this film, and I was very impressed. Whittaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is nothing short of spectacular as he embodies the charismatic sadist with every ounce of his flesh. McAvoy is also remarkable as the young doctor seeking a change from his mundane life in Scotland. The story is played out perfectly with Amin becoming increasingly erratic throughout and Garrigan's conscience being etched away at slowly but surely. It raises many compelling questions about what you'd do in that situation and the extraordinary conflict between Amin's affable, captivating personality and his merciless, genocidal tendencies is portrayed beautifully. The Ugandan scenery is shot beautifully and always seems to carry with it a sense of menace. This was a brilliant film that I loved every minute of. ********* 9/10."

","I was curious to see a movie about the notorious Idi Amin but also had the erroneous notion that this movie would be about him in exile in Scotland, or something.<br/><br/>Then I was pleasantly surprised at how this movie managed to draw me in immediately. The story of a Scottish young MD doing a stint as a bush doctor had me from the start. James McAvoy as the protagonist Dr Nicholas Garrigan is great, the story is extremely well told and captivating. It has enough flesh on the bone to make a palatable movie on its own. Then Idi arrives on the scene, played exceptionally well by Forrest Whittaker. A behemoth of a man who could charm the pants off the pope. Young Nicholas gets his chance to live the good life at first as Amin's personal doctor, then as the health secretary.<br/><br/>I switched off the DVD player after about one hour and had the impression of an exceptionally good movie, one which believably, authentically captured the situation in a post-colonial African state. As I found out the next day, the movie sadly declines from there on and becomes an African version of Escape From Castle Wolfenstein. Nicholas -- otherwise a sensible feller -- elects to shag one of the dictator's wives, who is consequently, inevitably, brutally murdered and dismembered (this is based on a true-ish account of how one of Amin's wives died in a botched abortion and her lover committed suicide). Then Dr Nick becomes involved in the Entebbe hostage situation, suffers horrible torture when Amin reveals to him that he ""knew all along"" that he'd been shagging his missus but had apparently waited for an international diplomatic drama to evolve to spill his beans, and eventually escapes James Bond-style.<br/><br/>OK, so the first 60 minutes are great, the rest is a bit lacklustre. Still a remarkable movie overall, if a pretty fictionalised one. Keep in mind that it's not biographical and take it as an occasion to do a bit of reading-up on Uganda."

","The Last King of Scotland rightfully earned Forest Whitaker an Academy Award for his performance, and it showcased James McAvoy to the world as something vivid and highly talented. It's a dark, almost twisted film that uses much of its time to present to us McAvoy's alienation of himself and digging himself into something he can't control - something that looks like it may just take his life, something he slowly but horribly understands.<br/><br/>The country of Uganda is beautiful at first glans, but the deeper you go, the darker it gets. Uganda has all the qualities of an African country in progress, but the terror within is a boiling, intense, psychotic and sometimes twisted place where you'll feel just as lost and regretful as in the deep jungle facing a lion. McAvoy, the Scottish and we face upon a regime controlled by a psychopath.<br/><br/>McAvoy's trip from screaming in frustration in his Scottish-room-ceiling to joining a health-care organization in Africa to falling into a labyrinth of wrong is a hallucinatory journey into a man's alienation of himself. Turning to, and away, from himself throughout, the Last King of Scotland shows two men who stand upon each other with interest, fascination, even sometimes love but transforms into disgust, unreasoning, fear and hatred. The powerful use of real-footage in the ending gives the film a brilliant resonance."

He likes drink and dope and women ¬ñ black or white, married or otherwise. These he finds.<br/><br/>He also finds, or is found by, president Idi Amin. On learning that Garrigan is Scottish, Amin takes an instant liking to the young doctor and invites him to become his personal physician.<br/><br/>Watching events unfold, I found myself willing the fictional doctor to run. Amin is going to turn into a monster. That is history. But in the film it is still 1971 and the signs are not yet clear.<br/><br/>They say that a frog dropped into scalding water will hop straight out again. But Garrigan is stepping into a pleasantly warm bath. The president seems clown-like at times, charismatic at others. He has wealth and pleasure at his disposal, some of which he bestows on his young doctor. He is strong, perhaps ruthless. But that's what it takes to govern a newly independent country, isn't it? The temperature rises a degree at a time.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this film is in the characters of Amin and Garrigan, played by Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy. The portrayal of Amin is multi-dimensional and terrifyingly believable. His relationship with Garrigan is paternalistic, domineering and corrupting. The doctor has fled from one father to be adopted by another. The dynamic between the two is mesmerising.<br/><br/>The insanity of what is happening in Uganda is revealed gradually as the president slides into paranoia. Towards the climax of the film, where some of the horror of what is happening is graphically revealed, Amin confronts the terrified Garrigan with the words: ""This is real."" Superlative performances and a fine script combine to make this film feel very real. It also feels close. We see the Asians being expelled from Uganda. How many of my friends and neighbours in Leicester were among those thousands, forced to leave with nothing but the clothes they were wearing? And what of the people who stayed? I remember seeing Enoch Olinga speaking at a Baha'i conference in 1976. That wonderful man was later killed in Uganda, together with his wife and three of his children, victims of unknown gunmen. No one knows the number murdered during Amin's rule. Three hundred thousand is the figure quoted by the film.<br/><br/>The numbers are incomprehensible. Butchery of this kind is incomprehensible. But through the film, the tyrant is revealed as human. The steps that led to the madness are small enough to be believed. Just about. That doesn't make this, our history, easier to cope with. But hopefully it will make it harder to forget."

As the Scottish doctor who serves as Amin's adviser, Garrigan is neither heroic nor admirable. In fact, well, he's pretty much a je*koff throughout who gets in way over his head, and is finally forced to go along with a very drastic act.

","""All aberrations of nature are possible."" Freshly graduated in medicine, young doctor Nicholas Garrigan chooses Uganda over Canada to escape his father's stifling influence. He ends up with a surrogate father in the shape of Idi Amin, and being stifled becomes the least of his problems.<br/><br/>Kevin Macdonald's adaptation gives its protagonist the standard arc from ignorance through awareness to a form of redemption. Garrigan gets caught up in events he is too immature and self-centered to comprehend. His own downfall is foreshadowed by characters in his periphery. Older, wiser Sarah resists his seduction and silently pities his gullibility to Amin's charm. The pompous Embassy staffer is hardly likable but his realpolitik cuts right through Garrigan's naivety. Garrigan sets out to drink, lay a few women, have some fun. When he wakes up to the real world, he finds himself carrying a Ugandan passport, culpable in murder, and charged with carrying out assassination on behalf of Her Majesty's government.<br/><br/>McAvoy is perfect as the young doctor mentored and then destroyed by a more powerful, charismatic monster. Forest Whitakker has been universally praised for his depiction of Amin, and rightly so. Garrigan tells him he is a child and that is what makes him so scary. True, but scary isn't the half of it. Cleverly, Macdonald keeps Amin's atrocities off-stage, so that the slow dawning of the man's terrible nature comes to the audience at the same time as it comes to Garrigan. When it does rush in, in a scene of brutal mutilation to Garrigan's lover, the shock is visceral. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is an element of Heart of Darkness here, Africa viewed through the white man's eyes as savage and untamed. There are shades of grey; Garrigan and the Brit diplomats are unsavoury, though certainly more palatable than Amin and his henchmen. The only virtuous, and in the end heroic character, is the black doctor who eventually saves Garrigan, only to be summarily disposed off for his troubles. It is an ignoble, perfunctory death, symbolic of the 300,000 Amin inflicted on his people.<br/><br/>More than biopic or historical drama, Last King is the tale of a weak man taken in and then beaten down by an overpowering, charming but destructive presence. Like the doctor who gave his life for Garrigan, we hope he goes on to live a life worthy of the sacrifices made for him. It is a pity Nicholas Garrigan is fictional, I would like to know if he lived up to that call."
"bandw","9","0","1","28 July 2008"," Eases you into the horror
","I put off seeing this film since I did not see how the horrors of the Amin regime in Uganda could make for anything but a depressing movie. But inserting the fictional Dr. Garrigan, a young naive doctor who wants to escape a domineering father and experience life, makes for an excellent plot device. Garrigan's decision to go to Uganda to help out at a local clinic provides an agreeable prologue where we get to see some of the Ugandan countryside and native culture, filmed in luscious color. Also, adding the doctor enlarges the moral dimensions as we follow his ethical challenges.<br/><br/>Early on we see Amin as being somewhat likable and charismatic. Falling under the spell of his power and prosperous lifestyle is very understandable, so when Dr. Garrigan (who through a couple of random events has helped Amin) is offered being Amin's personal physician, we see the appeal. The plot is cleverly structured - since we can identify with Garrigan we share his alarm, and ultimate desperation, as the scales fall from his eyes and he gradually becomes aware of just what Amin is up to.<br/><br/>Even though we are provided enough information to pass final judgment on Amin, he remains somewhat of an enigma. When he talks about setting up a fund for England and offering to send food for the staving English does he actually believe in that? When a quirky somewhat childlike character like Amin is given absolute power it is likely that ill consequences will result. It is only natural to want to eliminate one's detractors and, when Amin uses his dictatorial power to do so, it is not clear that it reflects a strain of evil at his core, but rather he does it because he can.<br/><br/>Several of the scenes in this movie are reenactments of actual scenes in the documentary ""G√©n√©ral Idi Amin Dada: Autoportrait."" That outstanding documentary is a great complement to this movie.<br/><br/>Then there is Forest Whitaker who gives the performance of a lifetime. He clearly studied the documentary mentioned above, since he perfectly captures the speech patterns and body movements of the real Idi Amin. James McAvoy is good, but believing that Amin would come to regard such an immature and inexperienced young man as his chief adviser was a bit of a stretch for me."

HOWEVER, after seeing the original documentary about Idi Amin Dada by director Barbet Schroeder: G√©n√©ral Idi Amin Dada: Autoportrait, I realised The last King was a bad copy. If you really want to meet general Amin and his madness, you have to watch the original interviews ! How Shroeder manages to capture Amin's craziness is impressive: You can feel complicity between the director and the dictator. When you watch Schroeder's documentary you really understand how men lose they mind when they are given absolute power. Actually, schroeder's documentary is funny and educational in his way.

"pedrodebiasi","7","0","1","22 April 2008"," Troublesome, yet complex portrait of the Uganda dictatorship
","Many say that Whitaker's role is a supporting one in ""The Last King of Scotland"", but I disagree. I take this as a two-protagonist movie. Forest is not less than brilliant, believable in every second, even more because the dictator almost suffers from split personality. He can be a tall and fearsome general in one moment, and then shift to a joker and laugh out loud. He can also say one thing at the morning (""You're my closest counselor"") and another in the afternoon (""And you call yourself my closest counselor?""). In the end, it becomes clear that he has mental disorders (""You did not persuade me!""), and Whitaker manages not only to show this with subtlety, but also to explore the populist facet of Amin - it is easy to find yourself laughing and sympathizing with him.<br/><br/>On the other side, McAvoy portrays the naive Nicholas fiercely, piling up, in his face, feelings in a chaotic and quick manner, as soon as they hit his character. His dramatic ark is profound: he goes from an irresponsible kid who thinks that f***ing and smoking makes him a man to someone terrified of the perilous political position he is stuck into. He is a tragic character, especially when he sees himself as a lonesome, abandoned pawn in a game of interests between Amin and Europe - and the film is brave to show the ultimate consequences of his acts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the script has its moments of concession, with self-sacrificial dialogs and weak plot twists that feel like poor tools bent on creating more conflicts and drama. It's on the already cited character development that the screenplay shows its strength. When it comes to the direction, things get complicated. While Kevin MacDonald makes a great choice in blending moments of efficient tension with cheerful party scenes, to show Nicholas silly vision of his mission in Uganda, the director presents annoying errs. The epileptic camera (not a tool, just an empty choice) and the lousy moth-who-flies-into-the-light metaphor appear in the whole movie, weakening the experience. Likewise, the editing, for some unjustifiable reason, screws up and cuts most scenes too early, giving a episodic feel to a screenplay that rarely bears this flaw, and the cinematography goes over the top and never impresses.<br/><br/>The pulse of the movie is on the character development and in the faithful portrait of the Uganda dictatorship. The genocide is shown in painful, gruesome details, and using Nicholas as the eyes to this tragedy is a right choice, for the dictator's true face is slowly unveiled, and, before he is shown as a despicable monster, there is access to his human image. In the ending credits, a typical, dancing song is played, and feels like a post scriptum: ""The film is over, now, you, viewers, can go home and pretend this has ever happened"". This is the journalism, the TV news programs that insist on softening the tragedies that happen in the world. And if this is not the pessimistic vision of Africa as it is today, it's because the movie has a different focus. It shows how irresponsibility (Nicholas'? Amin's?) can lead to monstrous deeds, and how common sense lacks for people when it comes to noticing the horrible things they do - and see."
"RJBurke1942","7","0","1","10 March 2008"," Where life is not a game, as the good doctor discovers.
","I saw Forest Whitaker first in that great British thriller, The Crying Game (1992), and was quite impressed with his performance; only later did I catch up on his earlier movies like Platoon (1986), The Color of Money (1986), Diary of a Hit-man (1991) and many others. In this one, his skill at acting reached a new high and he deservedly won the best actor award at the Awards in 2007.<br/><br/>I'm not so enthusiastic about the story, however, for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>As with all historical dramas, there is the problem of stepping into the shoes of real people, and developing realistic scenarios and dialog with which to integrate the addition of fictional characters. I'm aware that that the author had access to a lot of material with which to write his novel and that the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) was based in part upon a real-life English mercenary who was a confidant of President Idi Amin.<br/><br/>For this story, however, it is a young Scots doctor, fresh from graduation, beginning his career in Uganda at a medical mission. Through a fortuitous accident, Garrigan gets to treat Amin for a sprained wrist after the President's car crashed into a local cow. Amin is so impressed with Garrigan's spunk at that scene, that he invites the young doctor to Kampala and offers him a job as the President's 'advisor' ¬ñ and as the chief medical officer at the local hospital; the previous occupant is demoted or fired ¬ñ I'm still not sure which. Now that's what I call a meteoric rise in status. In that, I can just suspend my disbelief to let the story continue...<br/><br/>For the next hour or so, we are then treated to scenes of the strengthening bond between Garrigan and Amin, and seeing only what Garrigan sees: Amin playing soccer with local lads, swimming with his friends at a big party, letting Garrigan take charge of negotiations for the design and construction of a new hospital, and so on. Only occasionally, do we hear the sound of gunfire and smoke from somewhere on the horizon. The good doctor is vaguely uneasy, but is not sure why.<br/><br/>However, telling the story from the doctor's perspective allows the author to indulge in whatever takes his fancy ¬ñ or, in this case, the doctor's fancy. Being a very normal and active heterosexual, live-action Scot - and almost red-headed - Garrigan eventually gets involved with one of Amin's wives. Things get out of hand, and they eventually become highly erotic lovers. The situation worsens when she tells him she is pregnant, and pleads for an abortion. At first he balks, but then agrees. From that point on, his descent into horror is guaranteed - and just as the Israeli hostage situation at Entebbe begins...<br/><br/>Whitaker very effectively shows Amin for what he was: an egocentric, erratic, violent, drug-addicted and paranoid dictator of the worst kind; mild words for a man who is reckoned to have slaughtered 300,000 of his citizens. It's not a pleasant portrayal at all, and Whitaker is to be commended for taking on the task. <br/><br/>Garrigan, as played by McAvoy however, is totally vacuous, in my opinion: a character so caught up in his own egocentricity that he fails to notice the web in which he's become entangled, and obviously fails to do sensible things like listen to the BBC for real news, read foreign newspapers or even call friends and family in the UK to find out the truth about Amin. No, he does none of those things because he's too busy having a good time, driving the convertible Merc that Amin gave to him, and getting in too deep with one of Amin's wives. And, all the time, he thinks he's getting away with it all... Can a doctor really be that stupid? I suppose so, but in that case, his character is totally unlikable, and he thoroughly deserves the contemptuous nickname for him that is bandied about by Amin's goons.<br/><br/>And, on that score, the only likable characters in the whole story are Dr Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his wife, Sarah (Gillian Anderson) who appear only in the first twenty minutes, with Sarah only reappearing once, briefly, as Garrigan tries to flee Uganda. Her look, when she sees him, says it all.<br/><br/>It's a well produced and directed film, however; and the soundtrack is lyrical and yet stirring at times, full of the rhythm and beat of African music. It was a real pleasure to hear. In the final twenty minutes, however, the scenes of violence are such that many, I think, will be sickened ¬ñ but, it's where the good doctor finally wakes up to the living nightmare in which he had been sleepwalking.<br/><br/>Not recommended for children. As a piece of real history, it's not worth your time to see. For superb acting, however, Whitaker is worth your time. And McAvoy does a good job with an unappealing role. But, there's a lot of blood at the end."
"dave13-1","8","0","2","9 February 2008"," Seduction of the Innocent Abroad
","Not just a historical chronicle, this film also tells an important lesson about morality in a world without consequences. The viewpoint character, a newly-graduated Scottish doctor, is presented as being morally uncentered to begin with. He is not driven to practice medicine in a Uganda clinic out a sense of moral obligation to his fellow man but to escape the shadow of his illustrious surgeon father. His other choices, to join Idi Amin as his personal physician, to turn a blind eye to rumors of atrocities being committed by Amin's regime, and later to seduce one of Amin's wives are made with similar casualness. Amin, as portrayed by Forrest Whitaker, is a man of seductive charm but with the appetites and vindictiveness of a spoiled child. He is a man without restraint in a world which imposes none upon him. As the film chronicles Amin's descent into butchery, it gives us the parallel story of the young doctor's slow slide into decadence. The climax to both stories comes at Entebee, during the famous Israeli hostage crisis, when the crimes of both the doctor and Amin himself can no longer remain hidden from the world. It is this two layered story structure that gives the film its great power. A western audience watching simply a day-to-day retelling of events within Uganda during this time, would likely remain emotionally distanced, tut-tutting at the misfortunes of others. The character of the doctor and his parallel story forces the viewer to participate in the day-to-day world of Amin's Uganda and to examine and question his own moral strength in the face of similar opportunities and choices."
"foxface","8","0","3","11 January 2008"," Madness and Power
","The Last King of Scotland is an good examination of how the mind of a dictator works and the juxtaposition of madness, intelligence, corruption, and manifest destiny.<br/><br/>Of course Forrest Whitaker deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Amin. He took you into the inner cerebral working of a historically one dimensional figure. James McAvoy was equally outstanding as someone with idealistic goals, who is easily seduced by money and power.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of issues to tackle, but the main themes were Amin, racism, violence and sexism.<br/><br/>I think the film subtly covered the racism from the British point of view, in which the characters felt they were more intelligent, cultivated, and civilized than the Ugandans. This imperialistic attitude is something that Amin is all too aware of and he knows the British would just prefer him to be their puppet. McAvoy's character feels he is above these attitudes, but there are times throughout the film when you see he is a product of his countrymen. Though he staunchly waves the flag for his native Scotland, he takes on imperialistic attitudes, by turning a blind eye to the true nature of Amin's government and the killing of many Ugandans, because it doesn't affect him and the good time he is having and the material profits he gains. When Amin's wife tells him she is pregnant, they decided to dispose the baby, but he doesn't want to do it, because he would be guilty and feels he is morally above murder, so he asks the black doctor to do it for him at the hospital. When that doesn't work, he decides to do it himself, but it is too late.<br/><br/>This moral defects in McAvoy's character is a foil for the moral defects in Amin, and it is no wonder he thinks of Dr. Garrigan as a son and tells him so. Both men's moral defects set up the violence in the film that some people feel is gratuitous, but when you kill 300,000 people, you have to keep it real in the film. Amin feels the violence is necessary for the good of Uganda and to retain his power and is part of his manifest destiny. Amin feels he has a special insight into people and fate and can predict his future. On the other hand, our Dr. Garrigan's participation in the violence is passive. He knows he has influence with Amin, but doesn't use it in the right way to make Amin do good. He mentions to Amin, in a blind showing of loyalty for a friend, a meeting between a cabinet member and a British official and essentially carries out an stay of execution on that man. When confronted with this fact by Amin, Dr. Garrigan becomes upset, because he doesn't think it is his fault. He didn't carry out the murderous act, but he spoke the words and in this film words are a tool of violence.<br/><br/>As far as sexism in this film, I have to step outside of this film for a moment. As a African-American woman, I was disturbed by the images of the black women in this film because that old promiscuous hag showed up again. There was nothing loving in the scene between McAvoy and Washington, it just seemed primal. The way it was looped in with the gyrating female dancer, just said here is a white man that is sleeping with a black woman, because he has access, he is in Africa, and no one will find out back home. A lot of the black women in many of the scenes just seemed to be giving it up to anybody, or dancing in a provocative manner. Yes, I realize some scenes were in night clubs and people were dancing. At one point, when Garrigan laughs when he tells Washington's character he could just imagine her back home with him and the possible uproar it would cause, you see him at his imperialistic best. By this point in the film, we all know he is a horny hound dog and would jump any female, black or white. But why is it that Gillian Anderson's character is the white woman who shows restraint while in the midst of moral decay. She chooses to have virtue. This image of the promiscuous black woman won't go away. I know the director is a white male and I wonder if this was intentional in keeping with the themes of the film or something that has never been brought to his attention. I do wonder if the director had the counsel of some black women, if their whole affair would have had a different tone to it. To be honest, the love affair just could have been left out all together and wouldn't have hurt the movie at all. <br/><br/>However, I did like this film, despite the stuff I mentioned above. I think McAvoy should have got more praise for what he did with his role. And it seems the world is still learning that madness and power don't mix, but often go hand in hand."
"dead47548","8","0","2","9 January 2008"," A gripping thriller. McAvoy excels.
","Although it drags at times and some of the scenes are just unintentionally laughable, The Last King of Scotland still manages to be a great blend of the tragedies created by dark political dictator, Idi Amin and the (fictional) adventure story of the young Scottish physician who realizes what's happening and escapes Idi Amin's terror to help bring peace to Uganda. When I first saw the film I put most of my focus onto Forest Whitaker's powerful performance that perfectly combines Amin's intense but horribly childish tantrums with his charismatic charm, but on this re-watch I found myself being more drawn towards James McAvoy's absolutely flawless portrayal of the naive Nicholas Garrigan who slowly realizes that the man he's become attached to is a monster. In my opinion, McAvoy upstages the Oscar-winning Whitaker and gives one of my favorite performances of 2006. The subplot featuring an affair between Garrigan and one of Amin's wives, played by Kerry Washington, felt pretty pointless aside from it being the reason why Amin strings Garrigan up by his skin near the end of the film instead of just shooting him (which is one of the most unnerving, painful to watch scenes I've come to witness). Overall it's a highly engaging story that shows the beauty of a country, the dark underbelly that a dictator can create and the incredible journey that one man takes to bring him down."

McAvoy's portrayal of the young, ""speak his mind"" doctor was also strong.<br/><br/>Although this movie takes some time to develop into an engaging story, the last third of the movie was ultimately was worth the wait. In the beginning, we are mostly exposed to the introduction of characters and situations. Things are happening, but there is no goal/suspense/etc. That occurs in the last third of the movie when the doctor starts to have problems and wants to leave.<br/><br/>If you have any interest or curiosity about the man Idi Amin, this movie delivers some insight into his character through a good story."

","This movie is incredible not only for the performance of Forrest Whittaker but for the all-around outstanding performances, effortless directing and editing, and screenplay that deftly educates the viewer even as the protagonist becomes more aware of the complex and dangerous political situation of a foreign land. This is fictionalized history, so how much dramatic license should be allowed is up to the knowledgeable viewer; nonetheless, the education of the character in the context of Idi Amin's Uganda is well-constructed. The young doctor is a brand-new MD from Scotland who randomly picks Uganda as an exotic destination for his first job, knowing nothing about its culture or history. He thinks he'll go have some fun and adventure in a Third World country, doctoring to the natives, having sex with any attractive woman, black or white, married or not. He considers himself apolitical, free of prejudice against anyone, and perhaps so, but that shallow code of decency derives from insensitivity to others' delicate relationships and thoughtlessness about the consequences of his own acts. His ignorance allows him to be brash and frank with Idi Amin in a chance encounter, which charms the dictator, just as Amin then charms the young doctor. Eventually, the young man's thoughtlessness leads to the unwitting betrayal and death of one earnest government officer, and of women with whom the doctor gets involved, forcing finally some awareness as the atrocities escalate around him. He has been a fool, not realizing that a Third World country is not an exotic playground, but the poverty and strife there is the result of legacies of colonialism and brutal egos seeking power amid a disempowered people."

","Forest Whitaker was very good in this and deserved the awards he won. He looked like the real Amin and I bought him as a brutal dictator. From reading other reviews, the doctor role was fiction and used to tell Amin's dictatorship though rose colored glasses. The doctor sees Amin with his kids at his nice house throwing pool parties. He pretends like he really doesn't know what is going on after hearing reports of people turning up missing in the country. And one of those guys is missing after Nickolas tells Amin he saw him conducting a suspicious meeting at a hotel. Nickolas wasn't exactly someone you root for since he goes after 2 married women and turns a blind eye to some of Amin's business.<br/><br/>The story was entertaining and it didn't even have to show a lot of killings and mass graves that went on during Amin's tenure.

","Starring Forrest Whittaker. Whittaker looks more like the real Idi Amin than Idi Amin ever did. Amin took over Uganda in a military coup against what was considered Britain's puppet government in the early 1970's. With that done, he became the President, and, oddly enough, gained a fetish for all things Scottish, since they too sent the English packing. We watch this semi-true story unfold through the eyes of a fictional character, first impressed and dazzled by Amin and his ensuing power, later suspicious and horrified by what might be the truth of his rule. This is NOT a film for children, and although the violence is not often shown (by contemporary standards), WHEN it's shown, it's memorable. Whittaker does a great job as the manic/depressive, power crazy, paranoid killer, Idi Amin. The fictional character (of a young doctor) gives an unbroken thread to this story, which allows for the tension to be established and move along. I have watched it twice this year."

And I believe it was - sadly - very effective in the way that the film closes with more or less factual information followed by real images of Idi Amin and Uganda during his era.<br/><br/>But it seems like there aren't any protests really, because Amin was still a dictator, right?

","**possible spoilers**<br/><br/>A curious film, which takes us into Idi Amin's Uganda, through the eyes of a fictionalised character, a Scottish doctor who becomes the tyrant's personal physician. Dr Garrigan is supposedly an amalgamation of several real people who surrounded the Amin regime of the 1970s, but it definitely feels like a dramatic device to enable the film to do business in the West. The film follows the young graduate as he takes a break from his stifling father and heads off to do some charitable work in Africa. What transpires is scarcely believable, and should leave you in no doubt that this man did not really exist. Some of the plot scenes seem so contrived, you could be forgiven for thinking that this is the director's first feature. It is. Enough said. However, despite the problems with the narrative, this movie is all about one man. Mr Amin. If his portrayal had been anything less than brilliant, this movie would be just another thriller. It isn't. Forest whitaker delivers a truly great performance...Charisma, humour, menace, madness, all rolled into one giant bear of a man. it's a frighteningly effective piece of acting, and i suppose a fitting way to nail the part of a dictator...by dictating the entire film. The story of Dr Garrigan fails to convince you that he is anything other than a window into the world of Idi Amin, but once you get a look through that window, it's a phenomenal feat of acting."

","Given Africa's recent history, it's all but inevitable that a movie about the continent will venture into grim territory, and when it explores the regime of one of its worst dictators an unpleasant viewing experience becomes a certainty. However, its decidedly dark subject matter doesn't prevent The Last King of Scotland from being one of the best and most intriguing films of 2006. Told from the perspective of Nick Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor who comes to Uganda to find some adventure and make a difference and ends up becoming Idi Amin's personal physician, The Last King of Scotland is partly about Amin himself, partly about the struggles of post-colonial Africa, and partly about what happens when youthful idealism encounters harsh reality. Much like The Pianist and Hotel Rwanda, it's a horror movie of sorts, albeit one focused squarely on the horror of real events (yes, I know this is a fictionalization, but Idi Amin and his crimes were certainly real enough). Under Kevin MacDonald's generally matter-of-fact direction, the film's imagery is frequently unsettling and occasionally shocking in its depictions of gruesome violence and general depravity, but it's more notable for the mounting sense of dread it conjures as the depth of Amin's barbarity becomes ever more pronounced.<br/><br/>As countless others have pointed out by now, the film's portrayal of the Ugandan president is aided greatly by Forest Whitaker's incredible, absorbing performance as Amin. Anyone who witnessed Whitaker's extended guest run on The Shield knows what an imposing and powerful actor he is, and his explosiveness and gift for unconventional rhythms are put to good use here. Whitaker's schizophrenic performance manages to turn Amin into an examplar for the banality of evil, a complex character who can be funny, charming, and philosophical even as his paranoia and ruthlessness escalate. James McAvoy naturally gets overshadowed somewhat by Whitaker's commanding presence, but he's certainly more than competent as Nick, the comsumnate young idealist who quickly finds himself in over his head in every sense imaginable. Nick is a fundamentally decent guy, but whether intentionally or not his naivete is frequently self-serving as he finds himself enjoying his cushy position in spite of the moral concerns his employer's actions raise.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie's plot arc and pacing were a bit conventional for my tastes, but the central performances and moral complexity were more than enough to carry the movie through. Hell, just seeing Whitaker relentlessly chew the scenery for every second he appears in makes it worth one watch. As cautionary tales about the corrupting power of privilege go, this one is definitely more compelling than most."

The main Character Nick Carrigan (Mr. Tumnus from Narnia) was nothing short of brilliant as the young doctor. His enthusiasm and lust for life just filled the screen.<br/><br/>Nicks first meeting with Amin was terrifically tense and I think a great job was done of portraying the mistrust around at the time. The quick editing and skillful direction gave the meeting its full weight, it was then I knew this was going to be a fantastic film. 2 actors and a dusty dirt track, yet it was gripping.<br/><br/>We see the benevolent side of Amin at the start and his attempts to improve the situation and the world view of Uganda. However even from the start Amin was already slaughtering his opponents or anyone who dare speak out against him, wholesale. It was during this first act that I realised that the Nick Carrigan character may be fictional. I am old enough to remember Amin coming to power and being exiled to the middle east at the end of the 70's, but nothing about the 'little white monkey'. No matter, if this was just a vehicle to portray the life and times of Amin, it was working well! Whittaker stole the show, a total powerhouse performance, from the hulking frame, the accent and the mood swings that turned him from a teddy bear into a monster in the blink of an eye. He was genuinely scary on screen, but you also felt for him, such is the power of Whittakers talent, his level of research into Amin and the masterful story and direction. Of note too were the sets of the time and his equally frightening death squads.<br/><br/>One scene really took me and it was where we see Amin playing an accordion at a party. He sits almost in a trance like state whilst slowly squeezing the instrument and captured within that short shot was in my view why Whittaker got the Oscar he so deservedly won.<br/><br/>My only real criticism was the over use of the zoom lens in this film. I don't know whether it was to give a news like feel but whereas it had its uses in places, I felt it becoming annoying after a while.<br/><br/>No special effects, no pirates no lavish sets, just a handful of quality actors, a story rooted in fact and a good production team.

I have been a Forest Whitaker fan for a number of years, and he is sufficient reason to see this movie. In my mind it must go down as one of the best ever dramatic performances in film.<br/><br/>As the DVD extras clearly tell us, the story is fictional, set during a real period.

"esteban1747","6","0","1","13 June 2007"," Amin Dada, the Ugandan dictator
","It is always a good entertainment to learn about history in films. In this case, the film is about the dictatorship of Amid Dada in Uganda during the 70s. I did not read the novel written by Giles Foden, on which the film is based, so it is difficult to assert that all historical events are real. However, the plot has been conformed in a way that gives an idea of the personality of this dictator and his similarities with others existing and in power at present in other countries. Demagogic, populist giving false promises; a lier to justify his misdeeds, eccentric, these are the main characteristics of several dictators in the so-called developing world, and Amin Dada is another one in the long list of these caudillos, thirsty of power to the extent that they become worse than absolute monarchs. When things start to move not in the desired direction, they become mad and discharge all mistakes on his subordinates. <br/><br/>The film could have shown a bit more about the thoughts of the dictator, and related events that compelled him to become a criminal or to kill more than 100 000 people in Uganda. Amin Dada could not become such a killer just because he had the opposition of the supporters of Milton Obote, the president against whom he committed the coup d'etat. There must be other reasons, which are not seen along the film. For somebody not knowing a bit of the history, it would be impossible to understand the metamorphosis of Dada. The film shows nothing about his Islamic believes and practices as such. Therefore this material should be taken just as a story of what Dada was, but not a real description of the problem he and his misgovernment created in Uganda.<br/><br/>It is necessary to acknowledge the excellent job of Forest Whitaker playing the role of Amin Dada. Physically he is similar to the dictator; and his movement and gestures were excellent. The rest of the cast did also a good job, particularly those African or Africa-origin guys who played as minions of Amin Dada, the doctor (James McAvoy) and nice Kerry Washington. The photographs of Kampala were good in general although Lake Victoria was only shown once or twice. Local music was also nice."

","Much like the story of every man who has risen to the top of a country and has misused his power for the sake of power itself, the predictability that he will be of unstable mind, less stable hand, and eagerness of executions that will ultimately be the cause of his own demise -- physical or political -- is a perennial theme. Idi Amin Ada is no different from the heap -- born into abject poverty, slowly making his way rung on rung until he reached the level of ruler of Uganda in the 1970s and let loose a reign of terror in the name of assuring his own hand in a nation that was brimming with restlessness. Loosely based on Ada's short rule is the riveting movie THE LAST KING OF Scotland, which traces Ada's period in power from the point of view of an Everyman, Nicholas Garrigan, who from being a simple adventurer looking for experience wound up being an insider into Ada's own machinations (to which he ultimately would find himself implicated). It tries not to expound on the gore that must have prevailed at the time -- Ada's means of execution were notoriously hairy -- until the crux of the action where Garrigan's own mortality comes into play, and for the most part the movie is a tense battle of wills between Garrigan and Ada who foil each other like dancers in a shifty ballet. James McAvoy and Forrest Whittaker balance each out like a ying/yang, both men containing bits and pieces of the other within, although Whittaker's is the clear winner for the showier role (as is the case when there are two strong egos involved; one half has to be the balanced role which can at times be underplayed and thankless, McAvoy having to settle for this role). An extremely unpleasant movie to watch at times -- particularly in a scene involving the fate of one of Ada's mistresses played by Kerry Washington -- but a fascinating, involving, lush movie this is."

","Last King of Scotland is an excellent movie. It's a mostly fictional story set in Uganda in the 1970s. Idi Amin is the country's dictator. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a newly qualified British doctor who arrives in Uganda looking for fun and adventure. He initially works at a medical mission run by Gillian Anderson and her husband. Garrigan meets Amin in 1971 and becomes the dictator's personal physician and ""closest adviser."" He drives a Mercedes and lives in luxury. He initially gets on very well with Amin and when a London Times reporter questions the regime's brutality Garrigan naively defends Amin. He also declines to spy for the British government. Over time Garrigan notices that people keep disappearing and he slowly realizes that Amin is a monster. After having sex with Amin's wife (Kelly Washington) he becomes a target and eventually escapes in 1976. <br/><br/>Forest Whitaker gives a brilliant performance and captures Amin's manic personality. Amin is at times charming, devious, ruthless,cowardly, amusing, ridiculous, paranoid and a sadistic bully. The film implies that Amin used the British government to achieve power, but he becomes friendly with the Libyans and eventually severs diplomatic ties with the UK. <br/><br/>Overall it's a thoroughly riveting and enjoyable movie and works well as a thriller. Garrigan gradually unravels the evil around him and discovers he is out of his depth and on his own. Garrigan is a fictional character and the film gives the impression that he is in Uganda for a much shorter period of time than six years. Although Garrigan is depicted as an irresponsible hedonist who makes bad choices it's hard to accept that he was in the dark about Amin for so long. McAvoy is excellent in this movie."

","With ""faction"" flicks, you never know -- unless you're already up on the subject -- what license is being taken. That aside, Last King of Scotland is a tour de force for Forrest Whitaker, a strong actor who finally get to show just how amazing he can be. It's also a nice showcase for Kerry Washington as one of his wives. One thing about which there can be no doubt, it gives an unnerving account of a man who indisputably was one of the most brutal power mongers ever known to walk the earth. You want to talk black- on-black crime? This is a horrifying example (as is Tears of the Sun) of how Africans are in way above the sort of atrocities that characterized Hitler's holocaust inflicted on millions of Jews. It's a profoundly disturbing experience about a monstrous individual whom Whitaker brings to full life with riveting immediacy."

","If you have no idea what ""The Last King of Scotland"" is about when you first turn it on, then the first few minutes might throw you off. It begins in 1970 Scotland, where young physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) decides to go to Uganda. That's where the movie takes off. While he is there, Gen. Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) overthrows Pres. Milton Obote. A chance encounter with Amin turns Garrigan into Amin's personal physician. But as time passes and it becomes clear that Amin is turning as bad as those whom he once vilified, Garrigan not only starts having doubts about his position as Amin's friend, but starts fearing for his life.<br/><br/>Rarely have I seen someone get into a role as much as Forest Whitaker gets into this one. He makes Amin equally charismatic and scary. Although Garrigan is the main focus, it's hard to focus on anything other than Amin's switch from populist leader to vicious thug. Even though I knew about how Amin kicked the Indians out of Uganda and then cannibalized his enemies, it's still very tense just to see how crazy he goes, even as his country's economy collapses. And yet you still manage to see some things his way, as he lashes out at Garrigan for not taking Africa seriously (""You thought 'I'll go to Africa and play white man among the natives'? This is real!"") All in all, I really recommend this movie, not just as a part of Africa's history, but as an example of film-making done perfectly. Forest Whitaker definitely deserved his Oscar. Also starring Gillian Anderson."
"blanbrn","6","0","1","20 April 2007"," The Ugandan giant. Forest Whitaker is ruthless as Idi Amin.
","""The Last King of Scotland"" is a pretty well done movie, with good acting, a great performance from Forest and yet somewhat brutal and sad with many bloody scenes and you feel sadness for the people of Uganda who are at the hands of such a brutal leader. I really don't see Idi Amin as a good anti-hero to me, I really feel this is a film that should pay more tribute to the young Soctsman doctor Nicholas Garrigan though the film is told through his eyes, many people still praise Amin which he shouldn't be because he's so brutal. As Garrigan found out on his trip to Uganda that it would become a nightmare of brutal suffering and pain. And really the only connection left over for Amin and Garrigan was Idi's love of Scottish culture. So really the performance given from Forest Whitaker is great and well worth a watch, but this is a film in my opinion to be remembered for the young Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan who is the real hero of this brutal tale of dictatorship."

","I am currently watching the movie and I agree with the previous posters review about the movie. <br/><br/>But if the movie had been told from Amin's point of view or one of his wives or someone in his cabinet it would have been distorted. <br/><br/>I think telling it from the doc's POV is perfect because it gives a true account of what took place. JMHO<br/><br/>But as with the original poster, Forrest W's performance, as in any movie he does, is excellent.<br/><br/>His characters are believable and you forget that he's an actor at times."

","When an actor gets ""into"" a role, it can often make or break a film. If they've researched and prepared and are ready to give 100% to the production, then you're more than likely going to have a successful movie. Movie-goers saw this with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his portrayal of CAPOTE which won him the Oscar, the Golden Globe and so many other accolades that it'd take up half of a page to list them all. Not surprising, Forest Whitaker has mirrored Hoffman's success with last year's astounding THE LAST KING OF Scotland.<br/><br/>When you don't see the actor and only see the character, the person doing the portrayal has bottled solid gold for viewers, and Whitaker certainly did this. His breathtaking performance as the deranged dictator General Idi Amin, former president of Uganda, was perfect. Mannerisms, voice, those strangely vacant eyes, they were all eerily present.<br/><br/>Although a fictional representation on real events, The Last King of Scotland holds more fact than fiction. Even though one of its main characters (James McAvoy as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan) never really existed, the film inserts him in order for us to see what it was like being on the inside of this bizarre man's government. The brutality of 300,000 slaughter Ugandans is never seen but only hinted at because Dr. Garrigan and the rest of Amin's advisors are never privy to such information, being held tightly to the General's chest. As Idi Amin's paranoia begins surfacing more and more, Dr. Garrigan realizes how dangerous a position he's in ¬ó that being so close to such an unstable figurehead.<br/><br/>The cracks in Amin's persona are brutally and perfectly presented by Whitaker. His mood swings from friend to foe happen in the blink of the proverbial eye, and Whitaker makes it all completely believable. The stress Dr. Garrigan (McAvoy) feels is ratcheted up as he realizes he's not really the President's doctor but the prisoner of a genocidal maniac. This added an excellent level of texture to the film, giving the audience someone to care and worry about.<br/><br/>Probably the strangest thing about this entire time in history is that many Ugandans still view Idi Amin as a ""great President/leader."" This is focused on in the extra features of the DVD, making many watchers scratch their heads in dismay, no doubt.<br/><br/>Regardless of your views on the man, Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is so impressive you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen."
"monk_e_fish","8","0","2","7 February 2007"," Captivating portrayal of brutal but charming dictator
","Hollywood is a place that loves a fad, even more it loves a surefire winner. Ever since films like The Constant Gardener and Hotel Rwanda, not to mention Tsotsi, won both critical and awards success last year, films highlighting social and political issues in Africa, past and present, have been the fashion for serious, awards hungry filmmakers. With Babel and Blood Diamond yet to come, The Last King of Scotland is the first of this year's big awards contenders to look at Africa and, on the strength of its showing here, is already in a strong position to at least win something. If the current climate of Hollywood producers desiring African stories has enabled Kevin MacDonald to make this adaptation of Giles Foden's novel about Idi Amin and his fictional Scottish doctor then this can only be a good thing as MacDonald has crafted a gripping thriller. Rather than show the effects of Amin's brutal and destructive regime on the ordinary people of 1970s Uganda, The Last King of Scotland focuses instead on the relationship between Amin and doctor Nicholas Garrigan and this decision is both the film's greatest strength and its one significant weakness. MacDonald is best known for his acclaimed documentary work on films like Touching the Void and One Day in September and yet here he chooses to avoid attempting the true life story option to tell a story removed from the suffering of the ordinary people. Indeed, the film's closing use of actual footage of Amin telling us what happened next seems strangely artificial. Thus, the film does not function in an entirely satisfactory way if its intentions are to draw attention to the horrors of the regime for Ugandan people. However, this focus on the two characters does allow for a fascinating character study of a megalomaniac as seen by one of the people closest to him and for two very strong central performances from Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy. McAvoy's Garrigan being cut off from what is really happening in the country at large goes some way to explaining why he remains loyal to Amin. There is also a clever usage of the British diplomat predicting how the regime will turn out and later trying to tell Garrigan what is really happening being a smarmily obnoxious upper class Englishman (played with great unpleasantness by Simon McBurney) who is such a dislikable person that we do not want to think he is right and neither does Garrigan. McAvoy plays Garrigan with just the right amount of laddish wide boy charm, managing to seduce almost all the women he meets including Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington in small but significant roles, and untraveled naivety to make him likable even while accepting the friendship of a dictator. Garrigan clearly is a bit of a berk sometimes but he is obviously seduced by the combination of living the high life and the promise that he could have the power to do something significant. Of course, the other reason he is happy to accept Amin's friendship is the character of Amin himself. Forest Whitaker's captivating performance gives great depth and range in a way films do not usually allow bloody minded dictators to make Amin truly a compelling and fascinating character. In the early scenes when he is making speeches and inviting Garrigan to become his personal physician, we can easily see why Garrigan is swayed by him. His charisma is unquestionable and he has a good humour and infectious laugh. It is only very gradually that Amin lets Garrigan and therefore the film's audience get more glimpses into the real him as his paranoia threatens all those around him. That infectious laugh becomes threatening, like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas you never know whether it is a laugh of genuine mirth or madness and there is always a sense with Whitaker's performance that Amin could easily slip from one to the other at the slightest nudge. In the final scenes, Garrigan tells Amin that he's a child and that's what makes him so scary. It's a very apt description of a man who wields power with an arbitrary petulance, meaning Garrigan must increasingly act cautiously around him even as he tries to get away from Uganda as the truth begins to come out and he sees images of what Amin's regime has done. There is one particularly disturbing moment late on of a horribly mutilated body that means a lot to Garrigan. However, even in the final scenes, Amin is capable of turning on the charm, making his moments of evil more disturbing. A final hostage situation, MacDonald building on what he learnt making One Day in September, has Amin moving from charming the world's press to torturing his victim in the other room. Of all the torture scenes there have been on screen in recent months, this is the most harrowing. Taking its cue from Fernando Meirelles' strong work on The Constant Gardener, the film is shot with a rich colour palate and soundtracked with African rhythms, although MacDonald manages to conjure up an impressively 1970s feel, not just visually but in this style of issues film/thriller crossover. Once it gets going in the second half, the pace is relentless and the thriller aspect is gripping as Garrigan's desperation to escape gets him caught up in plots to assassinate the dictator, leading to the violent conclusion. A top notch thriller with two excellent leads, The Last King of Scotland should practically guarantee Forest Whitaker that Oscar for providing a glimpse behind the mask of a powerful madman. ****"

","I really shouldn't complain. I didn't realize until the credits that this was based on a novel and not on fictionalized accounts. I concur with all the other readers that Forrest Whitaker's performance is astounding and Oscar worthy. I don't know another living actor who could have pulled it off. I loved the way the film hooked you into thinking that there was hope and promise somehow, even though we all know the history. Many of the historical elements were skimmed over, as well as the historical relationship between Great Britain and Uganda (a former colony). I'm impelled to read up on this whole unfortunate period of history and to delve into the status of the country now. Anyway, to sum up this movie, I can tell you that it was fascinating, compelling in a ""driving by an accident"" way. You know you may see things that was disgusting and tragic, but you can't take you eyes off the screen. See this movie, if only so that you know a little about the history of Africa. It may cause you to read more and realize how sad the history of the continent has been under black rule. This is not because of race, but because it has had to compare to the European structures that were in place for a century and more. When the colonial powers pulled out, they left people unable to take the reigns for the most part. The African spirit took over and most countries have become the third world entities they were before, replete with scandal, graft, corruption, chaos and tribal rivalries. Sadly, there has not been a truly successful black-run state in Africa without a huge amount of aid from the U.S. and European powers. We all would hope that these stats will change in the years to come."
"mtomlins","7","0","1","22 October 2006"," Excellent performance from Whitaker but many flaws otherwise
","The reason to see this film is for Forest Whitaker's performance as the brutal, insane Idi Amin¬óhe brings a nuance to the role that demonstrates how he has grown as an actor and what we can expect of him in the future. But as to the rest of the film, I personally found it flawed. Not enough of the history of this period is covered, which would truly show us what a monster Amin was. There are mentions of genocide but they come late in the film. The big problem is that the character of Nicholas Garrigan is essentially unsympathetic. The main reason to tell a story from an alternate POV is because the main character (Amin) lacks sympathy. But we have little to root for with Garrigan. He is a naive opportunist who quickly turns his back on his original goal when the wife of his boss turns down his advances. He doesn't even attempt to use any of his influence once he becomes Amin's right hand man to help the struggling mission. And to sleep with Amin's wife is on par with the teenagers going out into the woods where the maniac is waiting with a chainsaw. Garrigan not only puts himself at risk--he condemns the woman to a hideous death. He takes an awfully long time to assess what's going on in Uganda and then his only motivation is to save himself. We are supposed to think he somehow redeems himself when he doesn't cry out during the torture scene¬óanother improbability. The film itself could have benefited from some editing to contrast the chaotic, under lit tone. It felt as if we had one hectic scene after another, with frequently mumbled dialog (between a Scotsman and an African no less!) shot in low light with a soundtrack that, although interesting at first, grew overbearing, and felt inserted."
