","***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just knowing that it would be seen over seas. It's amazing how a submarine can withstand 40 depth charges while another could be put out by two. And I believe it would also be a virtual impossibility for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine NOT the Americans. We have no right to take credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood simply has a historical ignorance. But beyond that it is still just an awful, awful movie. No one with half a brain would be entertained by this garbage."
"marquis2100","1","215","292","28 April 2000"," Offensive & revisionist, it should not have been made.
","I have only one comment about the movie and it isn't about its suspense, direction, acting or musical score.  It's about deceit.  Reading through user comments, I see that many are in touch with the idea that this is a British story, not American.  But do they grasp how much more ignorance this is fostering?<br/><br/>People are saying that the supply lines between America and Britain were being threatened by the U-Boats and that America had to come to the rescue. This folks, is simply untrue, revisionist garbage. And people are buying it. It offends me, because as a Canadian, I am painfully aware of the fact that America risked nothing at all to supply Britain in its hour of need - that was Canada's great claim to fame, and America's claim to shame. The British captured the enigma first, the Canadians caught another later and the U.S. WASN'T EVEN IN THE WAR YET!<br/><br/>This is beyond ""just entertainment"" as Americans are now laying quasi-historical claim (and we all know how many will take some or all of it as true - most) to victories and sacrifices purchased by people of other nations.  If you want to spit on someone else's flag, just spit on it, don't steal their histories and dishonor their heroes and their fallen soldiers. Nobody can fall back on ""it's just a movie,"" unless they already feel at home with a British movie about how the Brits won the Battle of Midway and saved the Americans.<br/><br/>Americans have plenty to be proud of, plenty of heroes from that war, plenty of stories they could bring out to show their pride and grit without resorting to such theft.<br/><br/>This movie should have been made as British or not at all. Another sad day for film."
"Prosinecki","1","272","385","2 March 2002"," Hollywood history
","This is a review written by a specialist on the U-boat warfare:<br/><br/>First off, I am pleased to say my worst fears were not realized. This movie is not a retelling of the capture of the Enigma machine from U-110 with Americans substituted for British. The only thing the historical incident and the movie have in common is that both include an Enigma machine and a U-boat.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the movie is this: It is spring, 1942. (Although not stated explicitly in the movie, this coincides with the implementation of the 4-rotor Enigma machine and the subsequent intelligence blackout which proved quite inconvenient for the Allies.) Allied intelligence learns that a crippled U-boat is awaiting a rendez-vous with a supply submarine. An American World War I S-class submarine and its crew are disguised to resemble that supply submarine, with the goal of boarding the U-boat and seizing the Enigma. Naturally the operation does not go as smoothly as predicted. The American boarding party ends up trapped on the U-boat and must figure out how to get home with their prize.<br/><br/>The special effects, including sound effects, are good, and there are lots of satisfying explosions and interesting underwater camera views. The plot is a bit predictable, and seems to owe a lot to many previous submarine movies, including Das Boot. There are a few technical issues that purists will notice; for example, American S-boats were not actually equipped with radar, an awful lot of bullets were sprayed around the interior of the U-boat without appearing to damage anything vital, and the plan to open the torpedo tubes at a depth of 200 meters seemed ill-advised, to say the least.<br/><br/>One scene was disturbing, however. Early in the film, the U-boat comes upon a lifeboat full of British sailors. The U-boat commander orders his gunner to kill them all, because ""The Führer has ordered us not to pick up survivors."" It is disappointing to see the myth of U-boats executing occupants of lifeboats perpetuated yet again. The truth about the Laconia order is it did forbid picking up survivors but did not specify that they be shot, simply that they not be rescued or aided as well as the only case on record in World War II in which a U-boat purposely fired on survivors in the water.<br/><br/>In general, this is a good action film. It's no Das Boot, but then I knew it wasn't going to be. For one thing, it lacks the emotional impact and suspense of Das Boot; also, the grim wartime mood that pervaded Das Boot is absent from this movie. In fact, for U-571 the World War II setting seems almost incidental, as the plot could be adjusted easily to fit any other twentieth century war, real or fictional, involving submarines.<br/><br/>In sum, this is not really a World War II movie. It's a submarine movie with nonstop action and plenty of explosions.<br/><br/>29 April, 2000: One more thing which needs to be mentioned. In an interview in the 23 April Washington Post, the director, Jonathan Mostow, states that the movie Das Boot was ""based on a lie"" because ""[...] it pretended that the captains and crews were submariners first, and only incidentally Nazis. They were dedicated Nazis; they had to be to fight that hard.""<br/><br/>As anyone familiar with U-boat history knows, this is nonsense. It is well known that the U-boat arm was the least political of any of the German military branches in World War II. While some U-boat men were indeed confirmed Nazis, many were not. Men fight hard in every war, not for reasons of ideology, but for reasons of personal survival and out of a sense of duty and obligation to their group or unit. Mostow's opinion on this particular topic is just that - an opinion, apparently not founded on any knowledge of U-boat history or military psychology"
"fjhuerta-2","3","387","555","22 July 2001"," Mel Brooks does Das Boot
","This movie is another one in a long line of pro-U.S. war films. You know the kind. Those are the films where north american soldiers are the only ones capable of any wit, wisdom, intelligence and courage.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, by now the rest of the world is a bit brighter, and we know that, really, Ben Affleck didn't save Great Britain from the Germans. There is an undeniable and deep love and respect for all veterans and U.S. soldiers that lost their lives in Europe during both World Wars from the rest of the world, the kind of respect that only comes from defending an ideal with their lives. It's Hollywood who is keen on destroying those heroes' reputation by making them seem so superior as to be ridiculous.<br/><br/>In summary, this film is a parody of the amazing ""Das Boot"". It's quite obvious that the same things will happen in any submarine: depth charges, marine battles, etc. But U-571 makes everything seem sweet: there is no claustrophobia, the crew gets along pretty well, they kill every german in sight, and even a destroyer. Das Boot shows a destroyed boat, terribly strained relationships, a sense of quiet desperation and resignation. Where U-571 plays glorious fanfare, Das Boot counters with powerful silence. Where Das Boot puts grime, U-571 substitutes pretty faces. Where Das Boot has realism, U-571 doesn't.<br/><br/>But most insulting of all, where englishmen should have been, U-571 cleverly substitutes them with U.S. soldiers. Oh, the nerve.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this movie makes for a great surround sound demo disc, or a nice coaster. Hollywood is still clueless when it comes to making war movies. If a future historian only had U.S. war movies to base history upon, he would decidedly declare the rest of the world sub-human idiots, and the U.S. civilization as a more evolved race.<br/><br/>A theory Hollywood debunks quite nicely."

","The REAL story behind the films exploits is far more embarasing & not one that Hollywood is going to tell the great American public.<br/><br/>The British cracked Enigma before the US even entered the War! Admiral Doenitz, suspicious that the UK had cracked the 3 code wheel Enigma (used by the German army), ordered a 4 wheel device & the British no longer were able to decode the U-Boat's messages. Sinkings of convoy vessels went up as a result, until a Royal Navy officer had the bright idea of knocking over a German weather ship in the North Sea & pinching the Enigna (they couldn't decode the messages from this ship so suspected, correctly, that it was a new, 4 wheel device). Code breaking recommenced & the U-Boats suffered such heavy losses that Doenitz eventually recalled them.<br/><br/>In ""Operation Drumbeat"", where the US, now in the war, had the shipping of it's East coast targeted, the British supplied the US Navy with intercepts, giving the U-Boats locations, courses, speed & intended target areas. Also passed on were suggested tactics for dealing with the U-Boat threat, all learned the hard way & shown to be effective. The US East coast commander, Admiral King, IGNORED them!<br/><br/>A bigoted Anglophobe, Admiral King refused to mount any anti submarine patrols & so condemed thousands of his own countrymen (the people he was supposed to PROTECT) to death. So many ships were sunk the U-Boat commanders called it ""The New Happy Times"".<br/><br/>Contrast this with Canada, also the target of the U-Boats, where the UK supplied intelligence was used & the anti submarine tactics employed. So few were the sinkings of ships & so heavy the U-Boat losses they were withdrawn to the SAFER waters of the US coast!<br/><br/>Only when Admiral King was finally replaced, after losses to shipping which could no longer be covered up, did effective anti submarine operations begin off the east coast of the US & the menace receded.<br/><br/>One man's obstinacy, stupidity & wrecklessness sacrificed thousands of US lives to satisfy the cravings of his ego. No Hollywood studio is going to dramatise that, so crap like ""U571"" is churned out. This is even more shocking when you consider that the people who died in this shameful episode still have living relatives.<br/><br/>The film Titanic was bad enough, but this is a step too far.I am appaled to think that if this carries on what the next step might be? How about the US wins the Vietnam War really? The US actually invented pennicillin (it was Dr Flemming, he was born in Darvel, just down the road from me)? The US wins the Battle of Britain?<br/><br/>Hollywood needs a kick up the pants for this film. Sadly most will go & see it & believe it's true. Ignorance is bliss, I suppose, but for the Americans killed & the families bereived, it is not the case."
"timofejewitsch@gmx.de","1","299","463","6 July 2002"," U-571 is a movie with a horrible story and contains a lot of false pathos
","Thank god for the US-Navy. The german U-571 is seriously damaged, so that the full, perfectly trained german crew isn`t able to run it. Of course a hand-full american sailors, who even can`t read the (german) instruments of the different machines in U-571 probably manage to get away with the submarine immediately. After being heavily bombed by a german destroyer, they are even able to reach an absolutely incredible depth. But not enough, of course they send the destroyer to the bottom with only one (coincidentally their last) torpedo. Not only the fact, that this heroic voyage is absolutely implausible and ridiculous, makes U-571 the worst movie I´ve ever seen. Also the story, that the Americans found and decoded the Enigma is just a falsification of history. Of course America did a lot for ending the nazi-tyranny, but in this case, it was the achievement of english sailors and scientists. I´m really not a german nationalist and there were a lot of good and even great movies about WWII ( e.g. Saving Private Ryan) but U-571 isn`t. It´s really a disgusting, poor effort of making money with the most primitive sort of patriotism."
"caziii-1","1","103","153","19 March 2005"," insulting all around
","This tripe was perpetuated by a director who has no appreciation for history, and who sets himself up as an authority on ""what appeals to American moviegoers..forget for a moment the fact that the British first secured enigma from U-110. Forget also that there was only one incident in which Germans ever machine gunned survivors in the water and that was after the sinking of the Greek ship Peleus by one Heinz Eck, who, along with the ship's doctor and Executive officer were executed for this crime.( I guess we had to believe that the Germans were more sinister this way.) Forget also, that in Mostow's world, the laws of physics do not apply. I especially liked the scene where the torpedo is fired against the bow of the destroyer and the ship is stopped dead in its wake!! If you want a good Submarine movie, try Das Boot, or The Enemy Below. actuals, the incredible Mister limpet was more historically accurate than this garbage."
"Karl Self","1","47","70","20 October 2007"," Shipwreck
","I rented U-571 thinking that a movie with submarines and Harvey Keitel in it would at least be vaguely entertaining, but boy, was I wrong. As for its mindless entertainment value, if you have only ever seen one u - boat movie you will essentially have seen U-571 because it goes to great pains not to miss any cliché in the book; the first third in particular is an almost exact copy of ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>What really angers me about U-571 though, apart from it being a really bad movie, is the premeditated way it tries to remanufacture history. Without going into details: the actual Enigma machine was relatively well known, the difficult bit was cracking the code -- which was brilliantly accomplished by the British (after some spadework from the Poles). Next there is the cheap attempt to whitewash racial segregation in the US by throwing in a black sailor and then putting the onus on the Germans by showing a German sailor being shocked at seeing a black person -- maybe it was the historical inaccuracy he was astounded by. Even worse, the film promotes an almost fascist type of ideology, namely the leader principle, mindless submission to authority, the objective must be achieved regardless of the cost of human life (enemy or comrade). So ironically, U-571, with reversed sides and minus the special effects, could pass for a German propaganda movie of that era."
"m.cordell","7","43","64","4 June 2000"," Glitches?
","SPOILER-ME-DO<br/><br/>Number 1: It was the BRITISH ROYAL NAVY who first captured an enigma machine from a u-boat, but we don't get to see that now do we because Brits (specifically English) are the evil bad guys in most period movies these days (Braveheart, The Patriot). A recent example of British heroism and American villainy (Amistad where a British lawyer defends the mutineer slaves against the American courts) bombed at the box office. Wake up America, you aren't always the good guys.<br/><br/>Ok, on to the plot problems, but first i admit I have hardly any knowledge of submarines, but the following points are worth considering: 1) Why didn't the Germans lock the hatch to the deck when they were being boarded? 2) Didn't the American crew realise the supply u-boat would show up behind them? 3) Why didn't the German captain order the crew to destroy the enigma machine while they were being boarded? 4) How come the Germans' aim with artillery and small arms was so bad? Stormtroopers in every sense... 5) Why didnt the German captain do more to damage the engine while he had the chance? 6) Why didn't more Germans fight back?<br/><br/>The movie itself is a very straightforward WWII adventure action flick, tense and fast-paced, although the 'being a hard decision maker' subtext was both heavy handed and unnecessary. Also there was some rich manipulation prior to the boarding. The makers thought 'hmmmm not too heroic, sneaking on board a u-boat and then murdering the crew.... we'd better make the Germans look evil by executing a load of adrift Allied seamen'. This little piece stuck out like a sore German thumb. Perhaps those who wrote and directed this should acknowledge the current wisdom that war creates few, if any, real heroes. In war, both sides do bad things."

","Having read a couple of books on the capture of Enigma from the Germans, which is the central theme in this movie, I was shocked by the story told in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't know why it seems to be more important to Hollywood these days to glorify America than to tell a story the way it actually happened.<br/><br/>I found this movie both predictable and unrealistic at the same time.<br/><br/>Why is it that the heroes are able to hit an enemy with a torpedo at first try using unfamiliar equipment while successfully evading numerous enemy torpedoes ?<br/><br/>Why are they able to evade a destroyer and sink it using one single torpedo, which they're only able to fire, because a vital repair is finished about a split second before they had to fire the torpedo, less they be killed ? How can they do it in a uboat which is able to do little more than float ?<br/><br/>Why is one single American portrayed as being more clever and skillful than an entire uboat filled with Germans ?<br/><br/>Why are the characters in this movie so shallow, that you can predict what's going to happen to most of them ?<br/><br/>I was left with a feeling like I had just been subjected to a couple of hours worth of really bad propaganda."

"jpoppenk","2","155","261","28 December 2001"," American Military Pornography
","This is yet another epic film about heroic Americans stepping into a situation, destroying everything, and creating an unhealthy and polarized sense of morality (the good Americans kill the evil Germans). You could label this film racist... perhaps acceptable when the propaganda was necessary (in the 40's), but certainly not 50 years after the fact.<br/><br/>The film also fails to capture a good sense of life in one of these submarines... since the film concentrates on military glory and good triumphing over evil, the potentially powerful, subtler moments of suspense are hopelessly lost, and the film degenerates into a muffled confusion of trumpets and excessively justified violence.<br/><br/>It is impossible to watch this without thinking of Das Boot, and how much more powerful the cinematography and directing are, not to mention how much more tolerant and accurate a picture it paints of the morality of warfare and of Germans as real people during the war.<br/><br/>My rating is 2/10 on this film, because it has wasted a potentially powerful concept on mindless and destructive entertainment, questioned Germans as human beings, took millions of dollars to do it, and is essentially a cultural regression from its ancestor Das Boot, made 20 years prior."

"screenman","5","35","55","17 January 2008"," Best Worst Submarine Movie.
","With all of the new advances in sound and visual technology, there was ample scope for a truly authentic, modern American re-make of the classic 'submarine movie' of the 1950's and 60's. And heaven knows, it doesn't require much study to realise that Yank submariners played a huge part in the war. The Pacific war, that is - not the Atlantic. There were some tremendous daring-do escapades with memorable victories. In fact, I understand that the American fleet was the most successful submarine fleet of the war, with also fewer casualties per unit vessel. They accounted for over half of all Japanese maritime losses.<br/><br/>Movie-makers don't need to invent heroes and scenarios then; they are already spoilt for choice. <br/><br/>So why this? Why a completely fictitious movie not only about an event that didn't happen, but a travesty of true naval history? I believe it is generally agreed that the 'enigma' capture was a British success. The Yanks weren't even there. Moreover when Britain began supplying the USA with intelligence intercepts garnered from its application, they were ignored by their naval high-command, with appalling consequences to coastal shipping. But then, Hollywood's air-brushing out of American mistakes and British successes is almost as inevitable as the type-casting of Germans as dumb, robotic bigots. It's not something to take personally. Though after all this time it does get a bit tiresome.<br/><br/>Audio-visually at least the movie was right on the money, especially if you have a decent home cinema. Bangs and clangs come over solid and visceral. There was clever, though rather obvious use of CGI. Little issues of personal tension didn't harm the rather shallow Alistair Mclean style plot and gave a little substance to its equally shallow characters. Unfortunately, all the old clichés were stowed aboard too: conflict between skipper and first officer ('Run Silent Run Deep', 'Up Periscope', 'Crimson Tide'), cat-and-mouse conflict with a destroyer ('The Enemy Below', 'Das Boot'), diving below the vessel's test-depth (Yawn - 'Das Boot', 'The Enemy Below', 'Ice Station Zebra', 'Crimson Tide') and so on.<br/><br/>And there simply isn't enough space to enumerate all of the tactical-technical errors that could have been avoided with just a little research.<br/><br/>Like so many Hollywood offerings today, - 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbour', 'Gladiator' - a wonderful opportunity was abandoned in favour of crass spectacle. Instead, we got a movie that shamefully ignored all of the American submariners' sterling accomplishments - true episodes at least as remarkable as those depicted here - in favour of well-engineered, implausible, and frankly misleading pap.<br/><br/>Don't worry about snubbing us Brits. We're thick-skinned and used to it. But if I were a Yank instead, I would regard this movie as an act of treason, so shamefully does it disavow their true nautical heroes.<br/><br/>It's a pity the director didn't just update 'Torpedo Run'."

It is an insult on all Germans today and especially those who fought in the damned war. Why is it necessary to demonize Germans in a Hollywood movie produced sixty years after the war? Do the Americans plan to make war on Germany? Or what the hell else might have been the producer's intention? Worst of all: the scene where the German crew machine-guns the helpless people in a boat.

"iaboud","2","24","37","5 March 2017"," A propaganda movie 60 years late
","This movie uses great effects and realistic settings, but the rest is fantastic superhuman nonsense. The U-571 was never captured by Americans and was sunk with all hands off the coast of Ireland by British aircraft, so I hope nobody gets his history from this. The Germans were furthermore quite humane when treating survivors in the sea, and while they could not take them on board, they rarely shot them all or deliberately killed them. The German navy commander Karl Dönitz was not found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. In fact, in 1942 the captain of U-156 tried to rescue survivors from a sunken British ship after radioing the allies, only to be attacked by American bombers which killed many of the survivors on the deck of the U-boat and forced it to dive, which killed the rest. The allies often killed German sailors who survived sunken U- boats or left them to die even when they could have saved them. This film is also short on realism. The German movie Das Boot was criticized by former U-boat sailors for its portrayal of depth charges being too close to the U-boat and not sinking it. Well, this movie had the depth charges a lot closer, the hull shaking like crazy, yet no rupture or major leaks occur. Depth charges don't have to hit the craft; they're designed to cause a crack or dent in the hull, and water pressure does the rest. Machine guns that fired from a German destroyer were enough to compromise the hull's integrity, but the boat still dives beyond its accepted limit after all that with no problems. The ability of a handful of men to operate a damaged foreign U-boat to achieve all these deeds and still survive to tell the tale is about as fantastic and unrealistic as you can get. It's a propaganda film with all its cheesy music, of pure good us versus pure evil them, and a pretty unconvincing one."

","This film pulled me away from lurking at the IMDb, and actually writing a review. That in itself says something about this film. Sadly it's not because I loved it, in fact quote the opposite.<br/><br/>It wasn't a boring movie, my attention wasn't especially wandering. The fault lies mostly with the simplistic story telling. Some scenes were so blatantly exposition, and predictable to boot. Take, for example, a scene where a character explains how a submarine will implode when it goes too deep. Well, that's a no brainer. He takes an egg (yes, eggs are so common in an officer's barracks) and it's rather obvious that it's going to be crushed for dramatic effect. The sailors sit enthralled, as if they didn't know of such things as going too deep is a bad thing. And, as he predictably crushes the egg, one character jumps in fright. They were supposed to feel tension, but I certainly wasn't feeling any. It was then also plainly obvious that the crew themselves would be put in such peril later on... and sure enough, they were. This was by no means an isolated incident.<br/><br/>The style of the movie was also unsatisfying. An early scene at a dock just looked like it had been constructed on a soundstage. And, when on the submarine, it was always felt too clean and brightly lit... I would expect a more gritty atmosphere. The movie's feel and ambience was never quite involving enough.<br/><br/>Because of my complete lack of history knowledge, I didn't know what happened in the real events relating to this film. I didn't even know what happened in this film. So I can't debate the morals of whether it was accurate or not.

Who can possibly believe that a crew who had never visited such subs before could handle it with such precision, and not only solve problems that the German crew could not solve but also destroy one German sub and one destroyer? *Sigh*.<br/><br/>And why didn't they kill the German captain from the very beginning? Why didn't they guard their own sub when they stole the enigma in the beginning? Why are the persons in this movie only boring and annoying?

The hype was nonstop to the point of hauling out WWII vets to the openings in local theatres. For the most part the vets were trying to figure out which war they had just seen.

","Often this film is compared with the classic of all Submarine films ""Das Boot"" . U-571 has in any respect got the worst of it. It has to be criticized that they tried to copy the older German film, which was so successful, with the difference that the heroes are Americans. ""Das Boot"" was written by a German submarine man of WWII. It was realistic, no exaggerations, except perhaps the feasting in the harbour. A human drama that took place a thousand times during the war in the Atlantic. But here with U 571 it is apparent that the US patriotism had to be satisfied. They are not interested in German heroes. They want to see US heroes. As always when the history is faked this is sometimes ridiculous. Nevertheless the film has dramatic moments. The film earned many critic especially in Britain, because the Brits were the guys who captured the Enigma"" machine, not the US. So far an audacious, almost incredible falsification of history. But be sure that this is common practice of movie makers! For the sake of entertainment. One has to understand that patriotic films have their own logic and their own legitimacy.

","U-571 (2000): Dir: Jonathan Mostow / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Havey Keitel, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith: Based on a true story yet it has been made a zillion times because Hollywood believes that everyone should be subject to the same bs under as many different titles as possible. It regards the commandeering of a German submarine to gain access to its coding but the crew are trapped when their own ship is sunk. Deep in hostile waters they are not sure what action to take. My first suggestion would be to just leave the set. Mathew McConaughey plays a Navy Lieutenant who is denied the opportunity to command his own fleet. Harvey Keitel plays a chief who was active in the first World War and who trusts McConaughey's judgement. Directed by Jonathan Mostow who made the much more suspenseful Breakdown. McConaughey and Keitel are at the mercy of flat material, and Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi yell over loud noise. This is an example of taking a cast of great potential and giving them absolutely nothing worth them showing up for. This film is about as suspenseful as a game of Battleship.

"tkapeta2","1","12","20","10 May 2010"," US patriotic garbage
","This is what happens when you think you already know everything there is to know about a subject and don't do any research. Jonathan Mostow's ignorance is the main problem of this movie; he had his mind made up on what submarine warfare was like in ww2, and didn't see fit to base his opinions on historical facts. Having been a deciding factor in defeating the Nazi Germany, the US should be able to make pro-US movies about ww2 without resorting to historical distortions, inaccuracies, and blatant lies. U-571 is, from a historical accuracy point of view, as bad as it gets. As the History Channel reviewers wrote - they got one thing right: there were indeed German submarines in the Atlantic in ww2. Almost everything else is wrong, and not just the history, but the technical and tactical aspects as well. The impossible sinking of a German submarine in the beginning illustrates this point well. A US submarine disguised to look as a German boat (?! as welding some stuff on the conning tower would fool experienced sailors whose lives depend on the ability to recognize other ship classes from large distances. An S-class with a weld job conning tower looks like an S-class with a weird conning tower, not a type XIV German resupply sub) docks next to a German submarine pretending it's a resupply boat. They take over the ship by surprise. But they have a bit of bad luck as a real German resupply sub appears and torpedoes the US submarine. Really? At that time the Germans used type XIV resupply submarines, which were modified IXD's. They didn't have any torpedo tubes, so if this was a resupply boat how did it fire from a non-existent tube? Unless the Germans used a regular type IX to resupply the ship in haste.. but that doesn't make sense either - resupply subs would generally hold positions all over the Atlantic, so it would be a lot faster to just redirect a nearest type XIV already stationed in the Atlantic then send a type IX from Lorient or Brest. Anyway with the US sub sunk the surviving US crew on the captured German sub do an emergency dive, even if they have no idea how to operate the ship and every control is marked in German, a language most of the crew don't speak. Then somehow they magically obtain a firing solution on a submerged German submarine and torpedo it under water (an impossibility at the time). I won't even go into the facts that at the time this movie is supposedly happening the US wasn't even in the war, and the stealing of Enigma wasn't done by the US but by Polish operatives and later on the British.<br/><br/>Skip this garbage and go watch ""Das Boot"" again, this movie isn't worth the medium it's recorded to."

This movie was pure non-stop action, from beginning to end.

I think the acting, camera work, and sound was excellent.<br/><br/>Now, regarding other issues.<br/><br/>The movie is NOT historical; it is fictional. It is based (loosely) on history (history being that there once were German and Allied submarines that fought in a war known as World War II, and that there was a German code machine the Allies called the ""enigma"").<br/><br/>Not only is it not historical regarding the event (the capturing of U-571 and the enigma code machine by Americans) but in many other areas such as what submarines of that era and their weapons could and could not do (such as dogfighting underwater with torpedo's).<br/><br/>Don't look for character development either.

It's more like the first 1/2 hour of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (the landing on the beach episode ) throughout the length of the movie.<br/><br/>Thankfully, in my opinion of what a ""war"" movie should be, it was not muddled up with ""love"" scenes or anything stupid and mushy like most are.

","It's 1941. The German U-Boats are wreaking havoc in the North Atlantic, sinking every Allied ship in their path and threatening to cut off the critical supply line from America to Britain that is saving the Allied War Effort. In a Special Operation Mission a US Submarine Crew, headed by Captain Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), are sent to capture the Enigma Code (the German Code that is allowing them to position there submarines without alerting the Allies) which will change the course of the war.<br/><br/>The main plot of the movie, thought completely fictional, works well and maintains a viewers interest. However, it is sure to raise a lot of controversial discussion as it was the British and not the Americans who recovered the Enigma Machine in World War II. Unlike standard submarine movies U-571 is full of twists and turns, especially in the first hour. Because of this U-571 is definitely a film that you have to concentrate in otherwise you'll miss a lot of vital information.<br/><br/>It is obvious that writer-director Jonathan Mostow has researched U-571 well as the nail-biting tension is ever present in the confines of a cramped submarine with a very stressed crew. Mostow's strongest point in this film would be his directing which keeps any viewer tuned in and on the edge of their seats. The camera work is brilliant and Mostow in several scenes keeps the viewer guessing what will come next in this nail-biting epic. The most notable sequence occurs when a Nazi Destroyer is dropping depth charges to try and kill the US Navy Crew. One second the viewer is watching a depth charge mercilessly head for the submarine and the next moment the viewer is watching the reaction of the Navy Crew. Sequences like this truly bring a realistic touch to the film.<br/><br/>The acting is just as brilliant as the directing. This is mostly because the cast were out at sea in a fully working submarine while filming U-571. Actors such as Matthew McConaughey are truly brilliant. Fear and stress is ever present on their faces and highly emotional times come across brilliantly. Other actors such as Harvey Keitel are brilliant but Jon Bon Jovi is the biggest surprise of the film. He does a brilliant job with this film and you're left wondering whether or not that was truly him.<br/><br/>My main disappointment in the film was the musical score by Richard Marvin. Don't take that the wrong way, the score was good. However, at times it could have been just that little bit better. There were scenes where the music was raging but dead silence would have had a better effect on the audience.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed with the end of the film. As a fan of 1981's Das Boot I don't think the ending of any submarine film could ever be as good. However, that's not to say that the U-571 was bad.<br/><br/>All in all U-571 is a brilliant film that is well worth seeing. You'll be left on the edge of your seat as you wonder what is coming next. Twists and turns will at times leave you a tad confused but just add to the emotion that you have for the characters.

I've been reading many comments here regarding the historical inaccuracies, and they may be true, but I don't care.  If you watch this as a documentary, you will be historically mis-informed.  Just enjoy the action.  <br/><br/>There are plenty of quibbles here beyond the history:  the ship models aren't that great, the casting could have been better, the brief conversations regarding Matthew McConaughey's growth into a leadership role seemed one-sided.  Then, with two sentences from Crew Chief Harvey Keitel, the Exec is transformed into a great sub commander.   <br/><br/>But there's plenty of action, so much that you may find yourself saying ""Gosh, what the heck ELSE could happen to these hapless bums?""  Lots and lots of explosions, sparks, flames, bursting pipes.  An especially effective scene was when the Americans are unable to read any of the labels on the guages on the German sub.  That's like a nightmare most of us have had at one time.<br/><br/>This movie is the doofus-y little brother of films like ""Das Boot"" and ""Hunt For Red October"".  It's a cheap thrill, so enjoy it for what it is; don't hold it to too high a standard."

","The yarn is interesting and based on real deeds with thrilling screenplay and authoritative direction by Jonathan Mostow. There are suspense, thriller and action, though the scenario is mostly into submarines . This exciting underwater drama concerns about stirring battles between US and German submarines . Bill Paxton stars as a veteran commander who is scheming a dangerous voyage to capture a stricken U-boat carrying the enigma coding device and solid Mathew McConaughey as the second in command who attempts anticipate his every move. Tensions run high and rise between commandant Mike Dahlgren and Lt. Andrew Tyler and the crew as they set out from a port to take and destroy the German sub . The crew as Harvey Keitel , Jake Weber , Jon Bon Jovi , Tom Guiry , Will Estes , Erik Palladino are pushed to the brink of death by risked mission full of dangers , twists and turns. The film is famous as one of the best and recent WWII submarine movies .<br/><br/>This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the sea maneuvers going after the mightiest battle submarines of the Atlantic Ocean that are decimating the Allied convoys . The motion picture is meticulously mounted by Jonathan Mostow who always manages to make a course correction in the nick of time and deliver another direct success . Impressive, rousing musical score by Richard Marvin and appropriate, colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood. Perfect production design by Gotz Weidner who also made 'Das Boot' .<br/><br/>The film belongs to submarine genre, along with : ¨ Torpedo(1958) ¨ by Robert Wise with Burt Lancaster and Clark Gable 'Torpedo run(1958)' by Joseph Pevney with Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine; 'Das Boot(1982)' by Wolfgang Petersen with Jurgen Prochnow; 'Hunt for red october(1990)' by John McTiernan with Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery ; 'Crimson tide' by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman; 'K19' with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and in similar style ¨U-Boat(2004)¨ by Tony Giglio with Scott Caan , William H Macy and of course Tomas Kretschmann who in U-571 also stars a German officer , as usual .<br/><br/>The movie produced by the great producer Dino De Laurentiis is based on historic deeds , thus the construction of new U-boats continued at a record -breaking during WWII. In 1942-43 Hitler raised enormously his U-boat strength,the German submarines sank numerous ships,in early 1943 the called ¨Wolf packs¨sank 90 ships in 20 days.Then,suddenly ,between March and June 1943,an exceptional change took place .The Allies began to win the war against Hitler's underwater in the Battle of the Atlantic . By this time the technique of submarines warfare had advanced far beyond that used in the beginning the war.The Allies pitted thousands of boats,seamen,destroyers,cruisers,subs,cannons and billion of dollars against the undersea craft .As early as December 1943 Karl Doeniz ,the architect and designer of U-boat campaign,admitted the grave turn in events . The cost was great on both sides .In the six years of war ,the Germans,by their own statistics,destroyed more than 2000 British,Allied ships in the sea.Hitler had built 1162 subs ,of which 783 were lost.Of the 41000 men recruited into the underwater service ,between 28000 and 32000 lost their lives and 500 were taken prisoners.The film provides a realistic detailing of life aboard and a portrait about the crews subjected to stressful and psychological tensions . In fact the sailors had sleep in shifts.For months they were lodged in close quarters because every inch the space was needed for machinery,supplies and torpedoes.The air was heavy with odors from bilges,diesel oil and unwashed bodies.The men faced sudden death from depth charges ,aerial bombing attacks or the sharp bow of a swift destroyer as happen in this film. The movie that achieved big hit , will appeal to action enthusiasts and WWII aficionados. Rating 7/10 , above average ."

","As a retired USN Master Chief I found the action scenes to be interesting and entertaining but was not convinced that the actors made their audience believe that they were submariners, or even- sailors. I know that a sailor would never get away with direct disobedience of an Officer's order as Palladino did without severe consequences during WWII. The underwater scenes were weak and the models just passable. Must not have had a real submariner for Technical Adviser....be I did get the feeling that the leaky, squirting episodes represented the condition of an old boat. The German sailors, on the other hand, seemed more realistic. For that matter, I doubt that the US Sailors could have put up much of an offense."

","!!!   Spoilers ahoy!!      This film does not do justice to the people who experienced WW2. It is typical hollywood trashy film. How the Americans could even think that they can pass an old clapped out US sub for a state of the art German U boat just by sticking a badge on it I do not know. It insults the intelligence of both the Americans and the Germans. Sending out a crew in that is surely condemning the crew to a watery grave.<br/><br/>
Radar. When the disguised American sub approached the real U boat would it not appear on the radar? And would not radio contact follow? And therefore code words used by the German crew? ANd therefore would not the Americans be sussed out way before they actually got close enough to discuss the quality of French porn? This is war, and in war certain practices are followed. They crew are well drilled. And why was there not a Nazi salute in the entire film? <br/><br/>The American crew ran the real German U boat like as if it were their own. I fail to understand how a German engineered boat would in any way be similar to and American one. Yet we are to belive that just by translating a few labels a foreign crew can run a sub, and not just run it but use it in battle? Very doubtful.<br/><br/>The scene where the American soldier gets shot point blank by the Nazi, another example of stupidity. 1 bullet shot at point blank range and the victim is felled instantly. Shot dead. Not 4.<br/><br/>I could go on but you get the drift. Other than that the film is watchable as the story is quite good."

"Aaron1375","7","10","20","29 October 2010"," It was an action movie, not a historic recount so for what it was I enjoyed it.
","A lot of movies use historical events such as wars or tragedies as backdrops for their movies. ""Titanic"" for instance was completely untrue for the most part. This movie for some reason had lots of people complaining about how Americans were not the first to find the decoder depicted in the film. So what? Really, some people are just so anal. If England wishes for the true story to be told make a documentary on the subject with their money. This is an action movie made with American dollars, this is not to be confused with fact, seriously did you look up the Titanic's manifest and see if that poor Jack or his love Rose was on it. The decoder was just a way to get some guys on a German U-boat so we could have a pretty good action movie. It was nothing to ponder or for historians to dissect, I mean did we believe that Forrest Gump was real too and that he was a very important person in American History too or what? The main problem I had with this one is that Matthew McConaughey is the lead in this one. I think someone else would have been better, though he was not to bad in this one. Just when I see him I usually think chick flick, though I did like him in ""Sahara"" too. So a nice action movie, with some good submarine battles, I preferred ""The Hunt Red October"" and I have heard the German film ""Das Boot"" is the superior submarine film of all of them, but have never seen that one. Would like to though, until then though I enjoyed this one and I realize the English were the first to find said decoder."

It isn't even a comedy. It doesn't deserve the qualification of ""1"" but there is no possible way to give it a negative value.

","In this movie, the US Navy is given credit for the accomplishments of the Royal Navy. The movie circulates around the capture of the enigma device (the code device for deciphering the secret codes of the German Navy) from a Nazi U-Boat. According to the movie, the brave Americans hijack the U-boat and smuggle it and the enigma device back to the United States. In reality, what happened was that the British Navy captured the enigma device from a U-boat before it sank. This was in 1941-for all intents and purposes before the US Navy was even in the war. I just thought that everybody should know of the lies this movie is telling the public, and prevent the US from becoming a world such as that described in 1984."

It's just a movie, it's not pretending to be history, it's a story. My suggestion... save up your money and commission a film that shows the British SAS taking Iwo Jima, HMS Ark Royal winning the Battle of Midway and the Japanese surrender taking place on HMS King George V, after the dropping of The Bomb out of a Lancaster flown out of Burmah.

"rmax304823","2","6","11","2 January 2009"," Silly Fictional Submarine Fare.
","There really isn't much to be said about this hokey story of an event that never happened during World War II. The movie involves ratty German U-boat sailors, scared but brave and religious American sailors, the capture of a German coding device called Enigma that we already had, impossible triple somersaults in the incidents -- and every submarine cliché in the cinematic code book.<br/><br/>The main plot has an American crew trying to maneuver a damaged U-boat into an Allied port while simultaneously keeping it afloat, causing it to move, avoiding the Germans who are searching frantically for it, and meanwhile being attacked by another German submarine and a German destroyer. I had a bit of trouble keeping that all-American crew straight. They're all blandly even featured, except for Harvey Keitel who definitely is in the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The B story is about the Lieutenant in charge, about his character, about the crew's doubts, about whether or not he has the guts to command and order men to their deaths. (Guess whether he does or not.) The writers, producers, and director have absorbed lessons from other submarine movies, from ""Destination Tokyo"" to ""Das Boot."" At one point, the captain has to dive to plutonian depths the U-boat was never designed for and we can watch the arrow on the familiar Tiefenmesser mope its way into the red part of the dial -- and then beyond -- while the hull creaks from the increasing pressure. The men hold onto fittings and gawk at the bulkheads and one of them mutters, ""Man, them Krauts sure know how to build 'em."" (Cf: KaEl Curt Jurgens' line in ""The Enemy Below"" under identical circumstances, ""They build them good in Germany, huh?"") So the hull is creaking and the men are scared to death and the minatory destroyer circles overhead and the only lights are from feeble portable lamps and flashlights and I'm thinking, ""Wait a minute! Where are the popping bolts? Where's the squirting water and the shattered glass instruments?"" Didn't have long to wait.<br/><br/>To trick the destroyer into believing that the U-boat has sunk, the captain has fuel released from the tanks and shoots some debris from one of the torpedo tubes. The debris includes a dead conveniently body, as in -- which one was it? -- ""Run Silent, Run Deep""? You know, the one with Clark Gable? Not that the sleight-of-hand works. If it did, we would be deprived of the thrill of watching the pursuing destroyer blown out of the water with the wounded submarine's lone remaining torpedo.<br/><br/>The clichés never seem to end, and they're not drawn entirely from the submarine genre either. Two men -- one good guy and one bad guy -- are struggling face to face with a pistol between them. A shot is heard. The struggle stops. The good guy wears a shocked expression and backs slowly away. The bad guy smiles slightly -- and then slumps dead to the deck. I'm fairly sure the first time such a scene was presented to the public was in a comedy by Aristophanes.<br/><br/>Where was I? Think I had a period of microsleep there. Anyway, there are thrills galore during the action sequences that seem to comprise half the movie. The cuts are instantaneous. Depth charge patterns yield a dozen explosions in speedy sequence. The camera jiggles. The men dash about, shouting. Lights flash on and off. Sparks fly like the Fourth of July. The chuckling director darts for a second in front of the camera lens and gives the audience the finger. BANG! BOOM! ""She's coming apart!""<br/><br/>Want to see a submarine movie you can believe? Rent ""Das Boot."" Of course ""Das Boot"" is long, precisely observed, contains some leisure moments that tell us things about individuals, and it has subtitles, so if ""U 571"" is your kind of movie, ""Das Boot"" probably is not."

","I had great expectations before watching this movie, but when I came out of the cinema, I was totally shocked, how BAD a film can be.<br/><br/>In addition to this opinion of mine, I want to tell, what really happened to U-571: Commander of U-571 was Kptlt. Möhlmann, who had obtained the Knights Cross. Therefore, he was in no way, like this cold, naive and dumb Captain in the movie. U-571 went on 11 patrols and was destroyed by depth-charges on 28 of January by an Allied-Aircraft.<br/><br/>I think the film refers to U-570, which was captured by the allies, but in U-570, all documents an the enigma machine had been destroyed, when the boat was taken over.<br/><br/>In reality, the enigma was captured from U-110.<br/><br/>One last thing about the torpedo: In 1941 the Germans mainly used the TI, TII. They were armed with 250kg of TNT. Never ever could there be such an explosion. The destroyer would had to be full with TNT or something alike to cause such a fireball.<br/><br/>So much for some historical background information."

","Once again Hollywood produces a WWII movie in which the US wins the war single-handed. Despite the director's denials this film is based on the true story of U-110 which was captured by the British destroyer Bulldog on May 9th 1941 - several months before the US entered the war. The cracking of the German Enigma codes was in fact a joint Polish-British success. The danger of films such as this and Saving Private Ryan is the way in which they distort history in order to satisfy America's desire to feel good about itself. By ignoring the historical facts this film does a disservice to the bravery and sacrifice of those who did serve in the North Atlantic.

Why can't someone make a movie that is factual about some of the most interesting things in American history? If you want to just watch a movie that is fiction this may just be what you want.

","If you want to see a good submarine movie, go rent or buy Das Boot.<br/><br/>WARNING: SOME PARTS OF THIS REVIEW CONTAIN POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>If you have any knowledge of World War II German submarines this movie will drive you up the wall.<br/><br/>The submarine is not a World War II Submarine. The external shots of the sub show 3 main guns. The German Subs of that time only had 1 main gun. Also the sub is way to wide, German subs were made extremely narrow. This can seen really well in Das Boot (1981) where the sub is an exact replica of the original German Sub.<br/><br/>The music was okay, but not very memorable. It did fit the film, but was not used very effectively. Now the folly was atrocious, nothing added more to the disbelief of the movie more than the folly. The most noticeable mistake was the depth charges sounded like land explosions and at other times like slamming doors. Explosions under water have a very distinct muffled sound which was completely missing.<br/><br/>Since I'm on the matter of depth charges I should mention that U-517 would have been blown to shreds with how close those depth charges were exploding to the hull.<br/><br/>Another unbelievable event was at the end when the torpedo blows up the destroyer. I'm sorry, 1 torpedo of that time could not cause the size of explosion that one torpedo did. Worse off, if you watched while it was exploding, where the torpedo supposedly hit, there was no hole in the hull even thought the rest of the ship was exploding. Obviously the model was blown up by people with no knowledge of how things explode since the explosions did not look to originate from where the torpedo hit.<br/><br/>The machine gun fire in the sub was completely unrealistic, when bullets are fired inside something metal most of the bullets will ricochet inside of object, where others will stick in to the metal or rip through it. With the number of rounds fired in the ship at least one person would have been hit by their own fire, many of the gauges and pipes would also have been riddled with bullets. If the gun fire didn't get some of those gauges the grenade they dropped down in to it would of. As it was the whole taking of the sub didn't do any damage to it at all.<br/><br/>Other things some people might find trivial were the misquoting of technical information such as safety sub depths, the unrealistic results of when the sub went down to 200 meters, the color of the German crew's skin was way to dark, and the bad German speech of the first submarine's crew.

Time for small leaks, cracking gauges and a pipe bolt being shot across the cabin...) I am no military historian, but many things seemed wildly amiss.   In 1942, the German Navy had been largely reduced to commerce raiding and submarine warfare.

As a fan of undersea war adventures this movie was a major letdown.For a movie to be remarkably good, you can't just depend on action to stand alone, and though this is high on entertainment, the holes in everything else is quite flabbergasting. <br/><br/>One of the biggest flaws about ""U-571"" is that it lacks in any kind of historical accuracy as facts are disjointed and the execution was banal. Once again the United States glorifies itself as the heroes of the undersea initiative, but the reality was that it was the British that accomplished the bulk of the task. Why does Hollywood try to fabricate the Americans as the only heroes during the 20th century wars and manipulates its audience by concocting false historical diatribe in order to sell ticket and promote patriotism like they really deserved it?<br/><br/>I was really letdown by the acting here. Such a terrific cast of characters like Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel, I expected at least an emotionally charged film. Instead the acting was pure cardboard, they should have hired mannequins instead of performers to star in this movie.For a submarine water movie, emotions and identifying a character is mandatory, by the end of the movie I couldn't tell who's who because of the lack-luster emotions between the performers.<br/><br/>The directing put into this movie is absolutely shameful. The crew has no personality at all, it looks like as though they didn't put much heart into this movie. Where's the quality of this movie? The opening scenes are at a snail's pace and then it just drags on skimming over the important scenes which makes the movie very choppy and hard to get adjusted. I suppose the director just wanted a patriotic movie that will make the American audiences have something to be prideful about, which they did, but at the cost of them feeling naive because of the inaccurate story.<br/><br/>The visuals are what really saves the movie. The shots of the submarine were excellent and the explosions were quite enjoying to watch. However, it still never saves itself from the mess this movie possesses.<br/><br/>If you compare this movie to Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"", it's like comparing prime rib to puppy chow. It's clear that this movie is a sad waste, and had a lot of material to be really good. But with a lot of misery this story develops I can't score high in this review. The action just keeps coming along, but there's no story to tell with no tell with no lessons learn-ed. With poor historical accuracy, bad acting and abysmal direction, this movie should be seen once and then find something else to regain those near two hours you have lost."

Oh, and about the US stealing Britain's history, remember the old movie ""Breaking the Sound Barrier"" had an Englishman break the sound barrier.

"UnclePaul","Null","4","8","1 May 2000"," decent movie, but it's all been done before.....better!
","I would never want to serve on a submarine.  The claustrophobia combined with the fact that you're in a metal tube submerged beneath the ocean would be too disconcerting.  Add combat conditions, and I'd really be inclined to stay on dry land.  Maybe that's why many good movies have been set in submarines.  No personal space, no way to see the surrounding dangers, nowhere to escape, and constantly fearful of a torpedo, a depth charge, or a mechanical breakdown.  Perfect opportunities for good film-making.  See ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990), ""Crimson Tide"" (1995), or ""The Enemy Below"" (1957) to prove my point.  Those are all excellent films that I personally recommend.<br/><br/>Now Writer/Director Jonathan Mostow (1997's ""Breakdown"") brings us ""U-571"", but unfortunately it's not in the league of those films.  It's a pretty good movie, but nothing more than that.  It has intensity, drama, and action, but I found myself constantly thinking that each of the above-mentioned films had already done it......better.  Most of the characters were poorly developed, so I ended up as a detached observer rather than really caring for the men onboard U-571.  As a result, I was interesting in the dramatic scenes, but not in a 'white knuckle' sort of way.  And that's what makes a great action film--submarine or no submarine.<br/><br/>McConaughey and Keitel are very solid in the two best-written roles. McConaughey has cooled off since his big hot streak in 1996 and 1997 (""Lone Star"", ""A Time To Kill"", ""Contact"", and ""Amistad""), but he's in good form here.  Keitel's Klough reminds me of Sean Connery's role in ""The Untouchables""--the grizzled veteran instructing/teaching the higher-ranking but much younger and less experienced Tyler.  Their conversations are the highlights of the non-action scenes.  The other roles are quite thankless--a character will shine for a moment, then you won't see him for a long time. Or he'll die.  Suffering the most is well-known actor Bill Paxton (""A Simple Plan"", ""Twister"", ""Apollo 13"").  His lines are so cheesy and stereotypical that I found myself knowing what he was going to say before he opened his mouth!<br/><br/>I don't mind suspending disbelief for 2 hours and accepting that these men (and this ship) could do these things.  But most of the characters are paper thin, and I knew within the first few minutes whether each one would live or die.  No surprises at all!  The action scenes are fairly well-done, but nothing I hadn't seen before.  The depth charge scenes are very intense, but by the third time they lose most of their drama.  The ""we're in a sub we've never seen before....how do we operate it?"" was done better in ""The Hunt for Red October"".  The ""we're sinking and the hull is about to be crushed"" was done better in ""Crimson Tide"".  And the overall ""we're trapped in a leaky WW2 U-boat with enemies all around us"" was done MUCH better in ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>If you're looking to grab some popcorn and be entertained for 2 hours, you could do MUCH worse than ""U-571"".  It will entertain you, but you'll come away wishing that it had delivered more bang for your bucks."

I felt it did a good job with depicting what it would be like to serve on a submarine.<br/><br/>It saddens me to see several reviews that are scathing in nature because the reviewer felt the movie slighted all nations other then the US.<br/><br/>To the credit of the movie makers, at the end of the movie was a message that went something like this, ""This movie is dedicated to all the brave sailors of the allies who risked their lives during WWII."" <br/><br/>I will agree this movie makes the Americans appear to be head and shoulders above the Germans they were fighting, but it was made by Hollywood, don't be mad at the whole USA.<br/><br/>The ending credits make it clear the British were the first to capture an enigma. I guess the negative comments are from those who didn't wait to see the ending credits otherwise they would know that. <br/><br/>I like to learn where the movie was made and how. Near the end credit was given where due. It clearly stated: <br/><br/>9 May 1941 HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia captured an enigma from U-110.<br/><br/>30 Oct. 1942 HMS Petard captures a weather cipher from U-559.<br/><br/>4 June 1944 U.S. Navy task group 22.3 captured an enigma from U-505.<br/><br/>Each incident was important as the Germans would change the codes at any time they suspected the enigma had been compromised. It was a major breakthrough when the Brits were able to figure out how the enigma worked. My hat is off to them.<br/><br/>I hope everyone who watches this movie on DVD in the future will go to the special features and see how much effort went into making this movie as realistic as possible. They actually built a whole copy of a U-boat.<br/><br/>The U-505 is on display in Chicago. I have walked through that old girl and watched the video of her capture. She is one of four U boats that are now a museum piece and she is the only surviving copy of the type IXC.<br/><br/>The companies that made parts for U-505 donated replacements free of charge when they learned she would be a museum piece.<br/><br/>Watch the movie with an open mind and I think you will find it entertaining."

Still the movie itself is rather good, if you're looking for an exaggerated action and primitive patriotism.

My favorite errors regarding U-571: the scene early on where the disabled U boat just happens to meet up with a boat full of people and thus must destroy them. I am sure this is a common occurrence in the middle of the Atlantic. Let's see, its PG-13 so anyone with half a brain can't figure out the whole good-guy-vs-bad-guy thing.

This movie rewrites history with the obligatory ""we made it up"" prologue. Note to Hollywood: dont do anymore sub movies. You cannot better Das Boot.

Lets start with this simple fact, the Americans did not steal the Enigma machine, the British did. Secondly it is was not stolen in a daring raid on a submarine, the submarine in question was shot at and then ransacked by the British crew of a destoryer. Never was it commandered by some gung-ho group of sailors to be shot at by every underwater thing bar whales.<br/><br/>
The reason this irates me so much is that so many people take what they see at the cinema for granted (especially when it says 'Based on a true story' in its heading), and so to many people will say ah yes, those brave americans, they hapled change the course of the war with that daring effort.<br/><br/>

","Okay, I admit it.  I love naval dramas, particularly where there are submarines involved.  Three of my top ten favorite films are submarine movies (The Hunt for Red October, Das Boot, and Crimson Tide).  So when you look at the rating I've given U-571, you can assume that two of the stars were guaranteed based on the subject alone.<br/><br/>For me, U-571 was eagerly anticipated.  I'd see the previews, sitting on the edge of my seat, with my knees bouncing like a kid about to receive his first ice cream cone of the summer.  My one concern was that this movie was going to completely distort the true history of the capture of the enigma machine in World War II.  However, they easily alleviated that concern at the end by describing the actual events.<br/><br/>Set near the U.S. entry into World War II, this is the fictitious story of an American submarine outfitted to look like a German submarine and assigned the task of capturing a crippled German sub's code-decryption machine (enigma).  The mission was nearly a success when the boarding party found itself stranded on the German sub in hostile waters.<br/><br/>The cast of U-571 was nothing short of phenomenal. It starred Bill Paxton (Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren), Matthew McConaughey (Lt. Andrew Tyler), and David Keith (Major Coonan).  Also in a leading role was one of my favorites, Harvey Keitel (Chief Klough), who finally gets to play a good guy!  I also thought that the relative unknown, Jack Noseworthy (Sonarman Wentz) deserved honorable mention.<br/><br/>I want to say that the special effects were great, but I can't remember a single one.  I never thought, `that's a great model' or `boy that explosion looked real'.  When you think about it, the best effects are those you don't notice.<br/><br/>I will admit that there were a few lines that bordered on clichÃ©.  `You never gave up Sir' immediately comes to mind.  But ultimately this movie was a lot of fun.  The action was nearly constant and the claustrophobic sense was second only to Das Boot. During one particularly intense depth-charge scene, I glanced at the friend watching the movie with me.  His mouth was hung wide open and the shudder from each explosion caused him to twitch.<br/><br/>This movie will be on my shelf the day it's released on DVD"
"beckums","Null","1","1","1 May 2000"," This could have been a great movie
","Minor spoilers. U-571 could have been a great movie. It has suspense, drama, action, and thrills. However, it lacks heart and humor. The truly perplexing reality is that humor and emotion were intertwined with the suspense in the script, yet did not find their way into the film. I have read what was meant to be and went into the theater with expectations that were unfulfilled. Where was the relationship between Andy Tyler and Pete Emmett? For that matter, where was Pete Emmett? In the book Lt. Emmett is the character that brings both heart and humor to story. The relationship of Andy and Pete, best friends since their days in the Academy, was center to giving the reader a reason to care about those characters. Emmett was vibrant and cocky, yet willing to express his  vulnerability to his best friend. The rich dialogue between Andy and Pete strengthened both characters, let the reader peek inside their souls, and opened the door to truly caring what happened to these men. To see the friendship and the bond between them allowed one to empathize with characters. In the movie, Emmett is just an expendable body. Aside from the mentioning of the fact that the two are best friends, the only connection we see is the looks between them, in which Jon Bon Jovi conveys more with his eyes and expression in a few brief seconds than he was allowed to convey with his all too brief (edited out) lines. Anyone who has seen Bon Jovi's work knows he is quite a capable dramatic and comedic actor. Writer/director Jonathan Mostow shot himself in the foot by cutting out the work of this man. His performance alone would have brought the film to a higher cognitive and emotional level. U-571 could have been both action packed and thought provoking. It was all there in the story. Anyone could have related to Pete's admission that he was scared and his request that Andy tell his parents he died for something important, if he happened to die and Andy lived. For some unknown reason, they decided to keep only half of what makes a film great. I'm sure it will still do fine at the box office, but it's sad that heart and humor were sacrificed for the sake of...  what? A few more explosions? Added lines of technical jargon? A few more shots of the blue-green sea? It's a mystery to me that any writer would leave out the best parts of his story!<br/><br/>See the movie.

","It's something of a surprise to find a slickly commercial popcorn war film like ""U-571"" coming out so soon after ""Saving Private Ryan"" took the war genre to new depths of brutal, de-Hollywoodized realism.  Still, it's almost unfair to compare two films with such radically different ambitions.  ""Ryan"" wished to immerse its viewers into the combat soldier's experience with unprecedented verisimilitude, and it accomplished this royally.  ""U-571"" is basically trying to give us a rollicking thrill ride aboard a World War II submarine, to excite us and stir us up in our seats.  And this film likewise accomplishes its mission quite well.<br/><br/>The picture is inspired by actual World War II missions on which American and British soldiers recovered Enigmas, secret German coding devices which allowed the Allies to read encrypted messages, and thus to anticipate the Nazis' moves.  ""U-571"" joins a hearty band of American sailors as they board a disabled Nazi U-boat (posing as Nazis themselves) to get an Enigma.  The mission is a success, but before the Americans can get back to their ship, it is destroyed by a nearby German vessel, and their captain is killed.  The remaining sailors take over U-571, and, with untested Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) at the helm, negotiate perilous, German-infested waters to get the Enigma back into safe hands.<br/><br/>It's a neat plot, but it's basically unimportant to the film's success (the Enigma, in fact, is barely mentioned after it's captured).  The real meat of the film lies in the action sequences, which are handled by director Jonathan Mostow with smooth, energetic efficiency.  As the sub is bombarded from above with depth charges, as the boat boldly draws down on a German destroyer's radio tower, the tension and excitement are rich and honest. This is greatly enhanced by the film's tremendously handled sound and some truly impressive effects work.  Often, we are quick to praise films like ""Star Wars"" which bombard us with unusual sights and sounds, and we neglect films like ""U-571"", which use Hollywood's technical magic to bring the real back to life (besides, if you got a Gungan wrong, how would anyone know?).<br/><br/>""U-571"" is not a film without its problems.  The picture's a bit slow-going at first, and the action during the taking of the U-boat is so frenetic that it's often hard to lose track of the action.  Don't feel too bad, though, because the film has the same problem; Jon Bon Jovi's character vanishes without a trace about an hour into the picture, and for the life of me, I can't remember what happens to David Keith's intelligence officer (I assume he is killed; if anyone remembers this, please drop me a line).  It doesn't help that a number of the film's young actors look an AWFUL lot alike. Still, working against these obstacles, there are a number of nice performances, with McConaughey making an effective transformation from petulant sailor to gung-ho captain, and Harvey Keitel and Keith doing effective work.  Mostow (along with co-writers Sam Montgomery and David Ayer) are also wise enough to know that you don't always need a tremendous amount of backstory to set up character.  Sometimes seeing how people handle the situations they find themselves in is all it takes.<br/><br/>""U-571"" is not a great war film, but it's an effective and engaging thriller, and I think audiences will enjoy it a great deal as long as they're not expecting the ""Saving Private Ryan"" of submarine movies."

Most of the characters are flat and boring. The plot is sub par (and not just for the fact that the U.S was nowhere in sight during that phase of the war).

I liked the movie's appearance and its tension filled moments in deep, dark aquatic zones. Even then, however, there are nothing memorable. The characters lack emotional development as well. There is Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), who feels he is ready to command a submarine, and Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), who believes Tyler is courageous and determined, but is not willing to sacrifice others in the line of duty. American U-boat crew supporting roles go to Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, Jake Weber, Jack Noseworthy, David Keith, and Terrence ""T.C."" Carson. These characters, living in the early 1940s, are summoned to capture the German Enigma Code, which allows the foreigners to communicate their U-boats without alerting the Allies. The German submarines in the North Atlantic are causing trouble. Thus the US Navy team hijacks their ship and kills all enemies on board, only to have their own sub blown sky high by another German battleship. Although this proposition develops the German circumstances, American motives, and briefly introduces each character, the movie takes a lengthy amount of time to set all this up. In its effective ways, the audience becomes concerned for the Americans, and the action scenes are involving, but the story simply has no where to go after achieving its premise. After the Navy crew members become stranded aboard the enemy submarine, the movie represents situation after situation involving noisy combat and shouting characters. Such characters are well acted, especially Matthew McConaughey's. This fine young actor captures Tyler with a clear perspective challenging the audience and creating interest with other characters. Harvey Keitel also performs with dramatically correct intensity. Jack Noseworthy (""Even Horizon,"" ""Breakdown"") and the rest of the supporting cast offer strong secondary performances, although most of these characters are simple minded and one-dimensional. However, even some of Hollywood's most famous names cannot recover a frivolous script by Jonathan Mostow. Mostow is a talented filmmaker; his last production was ""Breakdown,"" the tantalizing thriller starring Kurt Russell and a broken down car. Maybe this filmmaker is better off with his feet on the ground rather than in the water."

I once met one of the men from U571, a former crew member, He felt very offended that Hollywood would do this for the 'glory & entertainment"" factor. The main issue is using a REAL U boat serial and a REAL event (the capture of the first enigma machine) and basing them around a fiction. this clouds uneducated viewer's understanding of the real events and thus; causes anti truth in history. <br/><br/>if you want to make a fictional film; do it just as that! otherwise, the titanic may as well have got into port and sunk on its way back!? right? or even maybe ended up fighting in the first world war and became the first aircraft carrier?? where is the line? <br/><br/>Hollywood makes some excellent films! true. the responsibility to make a docudrama is a stern one. we are mixing up truth with fiction or 'hollywoodising' as one British director once said. <br/><br/>docudrama is a document, re enactment of a historical event. regardless of how old or new the event. <br/><br/>truth is far More amazing than fiction!"

The short bit by Bon Jovi was amusing. McConaughy was actually pretty decent for this particular role.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie like its a documentary. Watch this movie for entertainment.

What do you expect? Its about WWII, and the Germans were the bad guys. That is Fact, not fiction. Depicting Germans as sub-human? I didn't see that in this movie, but that did kind of happen during WWII as well. (Trying to exterminate an entire race of people generally classifies as sub-human.)<br/><br/>I would say that Hollywood typically puts out movies with the opposite perspective. CIA conspiracy, US Government cover-up, etc. How many more of those movies do we need? In fact, a typical plot-twist in this movie would have been that the Enigma device was actually given to the Germans by a pro-Hitler OSS faction within the US government. Its actually nice to see a movie from the straight-up patriotic rah, rah perspective once in a while instead.<br/><br/>I don't normally write reviews very often, but most of the reviews that I read here did not reflect on the movie much at all. Just said it was terrible because it glorified Americans and bashed Germans. I didn't get that feeling, but many of these reviews did appear to be from those who may be trying to forget about the past.

One note in her history is that she was the most heavily damaged submarine to make it back into a safe port for repairs. But anyways, I digress. Captain Daniel V. Gallery, commander of the USS Guadalcanal, was ordered to sink any U-boats his carrier task force encountered. He had a different idea, however; to capture one, if possible. And so, to make a long story short, his efforts were successful in capturing the U-505, the first enemy man-of-war captured by the United States since the War of 1812.<br/><br/>Correct my mistakes, all you history buffs out there(I wrote most of it from memory and left out the big details such as the actual events leading up to the capture) but if you don't know about the history of the U-505 I would definitely suggest reading into it.

The story goes that a U-boat's mechanics were all killed by fire, so it drifts in the middle of the Atlantic long enough for the American navy to disguise one of its own subs AND for said sub to FIND the u-boat that has been drifting for days in the ocean. If that story doesn't strike you as stupid, then you don't know how hard it is to find a ship at sea. Many movies have bad science or illogical plots in order to make an artistic point, but this movie made no point. Actually, the story was about an American officer who wasn't tough enough to be captain, and the entire impossible set of events was to set up the drama of the (SPOILER!!!!) officer sending a sailor to his death in order to save the ship.

Matthew McConaughey's Lt.

He learns that to achieve a crucial mission in a crucial war, he has to use the love and respect of one of his young sailors to get a job done, one where the sailor does ""do _and_ die"" (to quote Lord Tennyson correctly). <br/><br/>
	Lt. Tyler learns the art of war and enters military manhood, doing what must be done in a Just Cause.  <br/><br/>	Still, these Yanks at sea are in a U-boat, a German sub, dressed in German uniforms.  In fighting for that Just Cause, they take on the appearance of their enemies and two crucial doctrines of their enemies: that democracy is dispensable when really serious issues are at stake and that the individual may and should be sacrificed--killed off--if necessary for the greater good. <br/><br/>	According to the movie (SPOILER COMING), Tom Guiry's nice young Trigger is the kid too young to die who bloody-well _will_ die to save das Boot--sorry, the Boat--and do much to win the war for the Allies.

","In short terms: ""U-571"" is maybe the second worst war film of the 90s, worst being the vastly overrated ""Three Kings"". The acting is wooden, I'd say plastic at best. McConaughey is totally misplaced as captain and Keitel does one of his worst roles. Rest of the crew is just bunch of pretty boys with make-up dirt and sweat on their faces. Dialogue is ridiculous and so is the plot. You might ignore these issues by thinking it's ""just a semi-fictional WWII adventure flick and tries to be nothing more than that"" read more on why I couldn't just think so...<br/><br/>This sub film was clearly marketed to the audience that was attracted to WWII movies by the excellent ""Saving Private Ryan"" and questionable ""Thin Red Line"" who haven't seen magnificent 1981 sub movie, ""Das Boot"". The director has taken plot from actual WWII event, the capturing of Enigma Coding machine, and reworked history to Hollywood standards. So the heroes have to be Americans and the cast consists of some hot young actors and even a pop star, who fancies acting. Young actors themselves can't handle the task so there has to be also an experienced father figure in secondary role, and Harvey Keitel fills that slot. But then of course, the crew can't be totally white, so there has to be a black crew member too so no-one could claim the movie to be racist, like the US Navy in fact was in WW2. But of course, this is a fictional WWII adventure film, so who cares about minor details?<br/><br/>The first scenes look like direct rip-offs from ""Das Boot"", with Germans sinking British ship. The German sub suffers engine breakdown and some casualties in a depth charge attack. They are forced to surface, but don't mistakenly feel sympathy for their misfortune, since the same crew is later shown machine-gunning helpless lifeboat full of sailors in a senseless scene. It's only meaning is to prove they are fanatic nazis and deserve to die later in the movie.<br/><br/>In Das Boot style there is the shore leave scene in the beginning showing US crew having fun in their cleanly-pressed uniforms in a dance hall. As they arrive to capture the coveted Enigma machine from the damaged Nazi Sub, none of the nazis recognizes the US sub even when it's vastly different than any German one. The heavily armed US crew then assaults the U-Boat in one of the most ridiculous gun fights since 50's B westerns: In addition being fanatic nazis the Germans can't even hit barn door from 5 feet.<br/><br/>In one typical scene a german is lies on a bunk, hidden behind a curtain. His pistol is aiming directly at Matthew McConaughey (starring as US captain) when he opens the curtain. The German fires several shots at him from 2 feet but hits nothing and McConaughey kills him with a tommy gun. Then in one similiar scene a german is aiming at a small hatch where US boarding crew is coming. McConaughey jumps in and the German fires at him at about 5 feet but is instantly killed with a single burst of tommy gun.<br/><br/>There are more of these scenes, but maybe you got the point. Then the US sub that brought the boarding party to U-Boat takes a hit from another german sub and explodes like a refinery hit by nuke.<br/><br/>The skeleton crew easily learns how to ""drive"" the german U-Boat and knocks out the other german boat in a totally unrealistic underwater battle (they didn't have nice homing torpedoes or modern sonars in '41). Quite soon after that sole German survivor, the captain of U-571, tries to sabotage American efforts. He steals a pistol and when lone US crew member comes to investigate, the German captain shoots (and surprisingly hits!)him in the chest. But the sailor doesn't fall down, instead he stares at the captain, then his bleeding wound and makes mad dash with bare hands at the captain and knocks him on the floor...and rest of the crew restrain the nazi. At this point I was in major pains but I forced myself to watch.<br/><br/>At the last half of the movie US crew meet a German destroyer while surfaced and pretend to be the real crew of U-571. At the last moment they shoot the German destroyer directly into radio room to prevent it from reporting their position. They manage to dive as germans just manage to scrape the boat's paing with machine guns. They dive under the destroyer's keel and the classic depth-charging and hull-screeching-pressure scene follows. The boat naturally takes some damage and is forced to surface, but no worries. As destroyer is chasing and firing the U-boat from few hundred feet hitting nothing but tuna fish, the americans use the rear torpedoes. KABOOM! German destroyer blows like it was loaded with V-2 Rockets and sinks in seconds.<br/><br/>The damaged U-boat starts to fall to pieces and US crew is forced to abandon it. Happily they paddle into sunset with their small raft.<br/><br/>For a moment I really hoped a German sub would surface and machine-gun them to the bottom.<br/><br/>But the movie reaches The End and tries to give some credit to the British who in fact stole the Enigma coding machine and won the battle for Atlantic. Im not sure would they appreciate that they are even mentioned.

See the information filmmakers clearly provide at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Did the Brits rely on fake duplicates of German subs to capture an enigma machine? Maybe but I suspect not. Should such a plot device up counted against the film then? Not if inserted for entertainment value only. Your only question in that case should be, ""Did it work?"" I'd say yes."

","A) It's fiction, you twits!<br/><br/>B) Watch the ending of the movie before writing a review.<br/><br/>C) PM Neville Chamberlain.<br/><br/>I get worried when I see foreigners watching Hollywood movies with gun fights and car chases, cars blowing up, trains being hijacked with nuclear bombs aboard. Would you believe there are foreigners who have never been to America because they believe these movies are real?<br/><br/>I'm sorry to have to break the news to you: It's make believe! <br/><br/>Man, some of you are like the simple minded aliens in Galaxy Quest, who thought every episode of Star Trek was an historical document! I hear there are some foreigners who are actually gullible enough to believe Fargo is a true story!<br/><br/>Hollywood is not the Department of Historical Documentaries, and it's not the Ministry of Patriotic Propaganda, which I suppose is the way movies are actually made in some countries. <br/><br/>Sorry, but Americans do not go to movies like this for patriotic inspiration; they go to be entertained. And the Hollywood studios don't make them out of patriotic duty, they make them to make money, and mainly for American audiences. <br/><br/>I, for one, was entertained. And I think most non-xenophobic viewers would be, too.<br/><br/>I was skeptical at the beginning, afraid it would be another action movie with cartoonish characters and a shallow, improbable plot. But the movie did a good job of setting things up, especially with the captain explaining to his No. 1 why he was not ready for command, and the duties command entailed. <br/><br/>The acting, all around was very good, the directing was fine, the script was well above average in creating and holding tension over a sustained period. My heart was beating hard and fast through much of the movie, so it worked.<br/><br/>Yes, I have seen the full version of Das Boot, along with the entire commentary track, which is one of the finest movies ever made. It was a composite of actual historical events. The fictional Hunt for Red October was based loosely on rumors of some possible secret events described in the non-fiction history, Blind Man's Bluff. <br/><br/>U-571 makes no claims to being based on any historical events. IT IS FICTION! To enjoy most Hollywood movies you must be willing to suspend disbelief. If you can't, go watch a National Geographic or BBC documentary (I have seen some BBC documentaries that had less historical accuracy than this movie, namely the Rome series).<br/><br/>(Spoiler:)<br/><br/>That said, at the end of the movie, the producers pay tribute to those historical events some posters claim the movie maligns:<br/><br/>-- ""This movie is dedicated to the bravery of Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials from U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic:<br/><br/>-- May 9, 1941 -- Enigma machine and coding documents captured by from U-110 by HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia of the Third Escort Group, Royal Navy.<br/><br/>-- October 30, 1942 -- Short weather cipher captured from U-559 by HMS Petard of the Royal Navy <br/><br/>-- June 4, 1944 -- Enigma machine and coding documents captured from U- 505 by U.S. Navy Task Force 22.3.""<br/><br/>It's generally a good idea to actually watch the entire movie before writing a review. <br/><br/>And when watching a movie like this with an historical setting, it's a good idea to go online and read about the actual history of the period. If a movie like this can inspire viewers to learn more about history, that's a good thing. But a fictional movie can sometimes breathe life into dry historical accounts, which I think U-571 does, and better than many movies made during World War II, which were, indeed, made in part to provide patriotic inspiration.<br/><br/>I hope viewers will follow up by watching the episode about submarine warfare in the BBC's excellent 1973 documentary series, ""The World at War."" It is a good place to start, but I feel it doesn't fully explain why the German U-boats ultimately proved so vulnerable. <br/><br/>Some other notes. I talked to a submariner, and he said that every member of the crew was cross trained on every other member's duty stations, even the cook. This is hinted at in U-571. <br/><br/>Yes, the Allies had an Enigma machine from the beginning of the war. It was smuggled out, piece by piece by Polish cryptographers. The Allies still needed the daily code settings, and the new four-rotor version introduced in 1942 for U-boat traffic. To decipher daily settings, they used an early digital computer at Bletchley Park called Colossus, part of the Ultra project, supervised by Alan Turing. (The ABC computer was the first fully functional digital computer.)<br/><br/>Ultra was one of the technological devices that helped the Allies win the war, along with RADAR and the analog computer Norden bomb sight, which was kept secret long after the war, and so is little mentioned in films. <br/><br/>While the Germans had Enigma machines, the Americans invented SIGSALY, encrypted PCM AD and DA spread spectrum companding voice transceivers. (You may have something similar in your pocket.) The Germans and Japanese hadn't a clue how to decipher the transmissions. It was called the Green Hornet because it sounding like buzzing to an undecoded listener. Bet you didn't know that (it was secret). <br/><br/>I think all American fiction movies and TV shows should be banned from export because foreigners, especially children, often think they are real. This won't happen because so many foreigners insist on watching American shows, even when they say they are junk. <br/><br/>Oh, and thank you, Britain, for for sending us millions of troops, planes, weapons and food to save America from being bombed and invaded by Nazi Germany. And thank you, Britain, for making ""Mrs. Minniver"" to build American morale."

","U-571 is the semi-historical tale of the capturing of the Enigma Code Machine used by the Nazis during WWII.  Suspenseful throughout, though historically inaccurate.  Not sure just how much so, but enough to taint the movie (e.g. Enigma was captured by Britain, not USA; Nazi sub commander munches fresh fruit, a distinct rarity on board a sub that has been out of port more than a few days).  A little bit predictable in the plot. Submariners say that life on a sub is ""hours of sheer boredom, punctuated by minutes of sheer terror.""  This film depicts the terror well, but misses the boredom.  I know, I know, moviegoers don't want to see boredom, but it was (and is) a very real part of the story.  I like movies like this because we are quickly losing sight of how hard WWII was, and particularly, how close we came to losing it.  If not for the capture depicted in the movie, the war could have had a very different outcome.  Unfortunately, history belongs to those who write it, not those who make it.  This movie is a fine example of that.  Worth a rental."

The film was made in the USA to make money, not be a historically 100% accurate film about any Nazi U boat. As far as whether the US Navy ever captured a U boat, yes they did on June 4, 1944. They arrested the crew and got the enigma machine which was sent to Bletchley Park England. The boat U 505 was then towed the boat to Bermuda. It now sits in Chicago at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. The US under the Lend-Lease Program gave the United Kingdom $31.4 billion (equivalent to $427 billion today) during WW 2.

","I'm not going into the main stuff wrong with this movie; see the many other reviews for that. Everything they say is true. But I'm going to hit some small but outrageously idiotic things.<br/><br/>One is the ineffectiveness of depth charges. This movie is hardly unique in this, but it is very bad. Charges are shown exploding right next to the ship's hull, without destroying it. What do depth charges have to do to sink a sub, open a hatch and climb in? <br/><br/>One that bothered me a lot was the part where the U-571 dives and passes under the German destroyer. The sub passes under while descending from 15 to 20 meters depth, and barely clears the destroyer's keel. How much water do these idiots think a WWII destroyer draws? 15 FEET would be more like it. 15 METERS would get you under a battleship! <br/><br/>And there is one stupid thing that is not technical, but just shows an appalling lack of any feeling for the story environment. Preparing for the dangerous mission to board the enemy sub, our hero takes off his big class ring and places it on a shelf in his cabin. Now never mind that a sub in a combat zone is no place to wear a class ring in the first place. The thing is, he's shown pausing, gazing at his reflection in a mirror after he sets the ring down. It's supposed to be a poignant moment, as he thinks of duty and honor and 'will I measure up' and stuff. But watching, all I can think is 'what kind of idiot puts a thing on the edge of a shelf on a sub and expects it to stay there?' <br/><br/>I think all this is not just nit-picking. It and much else go to this movie utterly failing, for me, to 'create and sustain its world.' And that pervasive failure is the mark of a very bad movie."

","Just as we'd expect from the better DVD commentaries and documentaries that accompany movies, this one adds dimensions additional to the flick itself, and add to our enjoyment of the flick. At the time, I was irritated at the theatrical release of ""U-571."" The special effects are kind of lame-- wooden and fake. The the ""all-too-human"" hesitations of the supposed ""excellent"" executive officer would never happen in real military life. The guy simply would NEVER have made it that far or lasted that long with that kind of psycho-drama going on. And the insubordination displayed by some of the crew would also never have been tolerated in a real military situation. The mouthy, smart-assed crewman Mazola, for example, would have been shot on the spot in a real combat situation. Really.<br/><br/>But then you watch the making-of segments, and you hear the film school dude-- Mostlow, I think, talk about the kind of movie he wanted to make: An actual replication of a 1940s era WW II movie. And elderly Dino DeLarentus talking in the same vein-- and then you get it. And the effects guys and the set designers and the costume lady show off the research they did, and you appreciate ""U-571"" even more.<br/><br/>OK-- it's a little cheesy, a little corn-ball. But knowing what the producers and director set out to do, it's also spot-on entertainment!<br/><br/>One point that should be addressed: Some British viewers wrote early on that the movie was ""bad"" because it insinuates that the Americans first captured Enigma, rather than the British. The points should be made: 1) No American student of history would ever deny the British the hallmark of being the first to capture the Enigma device (although the British actually had their first machine delivered to them by a Finnish businessman; it wasn't captured). Everybody over here knows that the British combined bravery and genius to round up a few of these priceless gizmos, and contrive Bletchley Park's amazing and heroic team of code breakers and communications analysts on a scale almost equalling America's Manhattan Project. Yaay Britain. It is also true that even with the machines, there was much more work to do. Consider that by mid 1942, the movie's time frame, the allies (due, of course, to the British) had the Enigma machine for close to 2 years, and we still had NO idea what the German U-Boat service was saying to itself. And, the Americans had been able to crack the tough Japanese 'blue' Naval Code that same year, in time to defeat the Japanese at Midway, without an Enigma machine. And with continuing mechanical and cryptographical improvements and alterations introduced by the Axis Powers throughout the war--- code breaking and daring military raids throughout the war were on-going affairs.<br/><br/>The movie does not claim America was the first. In fact it dedicates the film to the British submarines who actual were. But American submariners did mount such attempts-- one which actually succeeding in 1944. AND, this is just a MOVIE!

"Buddy-51","Null","2","4","21 October 2000"," pale imitation of the great ""Das Boot""
","Every so often a film comes along that so completely fulfills the demands of its genre that all such films that come after it seem to be little more than pale imitations in comparison.  Such a film is the 1981 German classic, `Das Boot,' undoubtedly the gold-standard against which all other submarine sagas must  fairly or unfairly  inevitably be measured.  Since that film pretty much exhausted the great humanistic themes of brotherhood and survival to be found in this category of films, the American submarine films that have come afterwards  `The Hunt For Red October,' `Crimson Tide,' and now, `U-571'  have been forced to turn to high level suspense plotting to supplement the standard genre conventions.  Each of these films has its moments but, the truth be told, one ends up invariably comparing these pieces of pulp entertainment to a genuine work of cinematic art  and there is just no comparison.<br/><br/>In a way, this genre, more than virtually any other, suffers from the cramped restrictions of its underwater setting.  There just isn't a lot to DO in a submarine and, hence, the directors of these films are obviously very limited in the way they can approach the material both visually and dramatically.  Thus, we are subjected to the endless tight close-ups on the men's worried, perspiring faces as they cast their eyes upward and strain their ears during the inevitable depth-charge and how-low-can-they-go-before-they-break-apart sequences.  We know that, before long, we will be watching that needle moving precariously into the red zone on the depth gauge, followed by the customary popping bolts, creaking hull and spouting water mains as the ship challenges the limits of its diving capabilities.  (Not one of these subs, in the history of the movies, by the way, has ever failed this test).  To get a little visual action into the picture, the cinematographer will, at some point or other, begin shaking the camera chaotically to simulate exploding depth charges a mere stone's throw from the ship's egg-like outer shell.<br/><br/>Unable to even approach `Das Boot's cinematic and technical expertise, `U-571' attempts to generate excitement with its action movie plotting and ambiance.  Regrettably, neither the story nor the characters in this film are particularly engaging.  Mathew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andrew Tyler, a naval officer who manages, through a complicated series of partly planned, partly inadvertent circumstances, to lead a group of men on board a German u-boat, kill most of its crew and cruise around the North Atlantic in a Trojan Horse type operation, while uncovering the German codebook they have been sent to find on the ship.  Unlike `Das Boot,' whose primary concern was to make its recreation of life aboard a sub as realistic and convincing as possible, `U-571' loses its way in a welter of action film histrionics, cardboard cutout characters and maudlin sentimentality.  Taylor is supposed to be a second-rate, overly-sensitive officer whom the bigwigs trust so little that they refuse to assign him a boat and a command of his own - but do we doubt, that by finale time, he will have proven himself to be a leader in the true-blue military tradition?  None of the characters in this film seem to differentiate themselves from one another in any way that would make us care about them.  They all seem to be, essentially, a group of dressed-up actors playing at soldier  a far cry from the fully fleshed-out and convincing set of characters that comprised Wolfgang Peterson's crew. <br/><br/>
Perhaps it is unfair to judge `U-571' in relation to that earlier epic work. (After all, `Das Boot' runs several hours longer than this film). Nevertheless, it is a measure of the true greatness of that incomparable German masterpiece that it literally left nothing for future films to add to the genre.  It is all there in that one work  complete and perfect in its artistry and form.  Very few films sum up their genres as consummately as Wolfgang Peterson's `Das Boot.'"

","This was exciting enough from an action standpoint but failed in several areas.  It wasn't believable as 1942 period; way too much attitude by the characters for example.  Pretty much followed the classic U-boat checklist. I liked it OK, but didn't really challange the viewer; no character development or script.

","U-571 was an enjoyable thriller, with many moments of high tension. The action never let up, but was not of the usual predictable, 'oh well, here comes another explosion/fist fight/gun battle. The impression of the men being trapped with very few options was very well presented, and events appeared with suddenness and ferocity. All of the performances were strong and quite believable, but there were moments of male bonding where you could almost hear the producers saying 'we need a close scene here, where the characters can learn from each other'; you could almost taste the testosterone. Other than that I felt that the music score was intrusive at times, and would have been more potent if used sparingly.<br/><br/>Of the fact it is an American team that did the rescuing of the enigma, much has already been said, but if this was accepted as a film, rather than an historical document, then I am happy to enjoy it. The enigma was only ever a plot device to make the mission urgent, and the stakes high.  If the film had intimated that the codebreakers were a bunch of American academics holed up somewhere in America, and had invented a programmable computer to solve the problem, then I might have got more upset. Few realistic moviegoers get cross when cowboy films mangle historical fact to make a good story, so why bother about a war fantasy?<br/><br/>On the plus side, we watched the film on a ferry from Spain to Portsmouth. The gentle rolling of the boat, and the vibration of the engines, really made the whole experience much more intense!"

I don't have anything to add to that. It's frustrating to realize that many audience members will believe it did really happen the way this movie presents it. Although fortunately, we do today have The Imitation Game, which is a depiction far closer to reality of the significant challenges faced in cracking Nazi codes. I think the worst part is the demonization of Germans. It plays as though this was made around sixty years prior to when it actually came out. It is puzzling to see a country that is a strong ally of America depicted as consisting entirely of one note evil villains. I guess it's one thing that at least they get to speak their native tongue, rather than English with an accent?<br/><br/>If what I mentioned in the first paragraph bothers you a lot, then nothing in this movie makes up for it. If it doesn't, then essentially what you have here is a marriage of Das Boot and your typical Hollywood patriotic war flick. It's shamelessly cheesy without being obnoxiously over-stylized like Michael Bay's work. The dialogue, acting and directing are fairly bland. The action is competent, something Jonathan Mostow tends to manage on a regular basis. He might be the only person who worked on this who hasn't done much better elsewhere.<br/><br/>I recommend this to those who love, as I saw someone else perfectly expressed it, ""military porn"".

But if you are looking for a accurate WWII movie or another Das Boot, look elsewhere. For starters the whole submarine duel, though entertaining, is almost completely impossible in the era not to mention the fact that a German resupply sub, known as a ""milkcow,"" was unarmed and wasn't in the war until '43. I would think that the writers would take that into consideration considering that they tried so hard to get other aspects historically accurate.  Another confusing fact is why would there be a German destroyer(ive seen people calling it a ""Battleship"") out in the atlantic(German surface navy stayed in port during most of the war) and why is it equiped with sonar.

Also, everything here has already been done in every other submarine movie. Depth charges. Stuck at a depth that the sub is supossedly not able to handle. Stuck in enemy waters. All old news. The only original aspect was the idea that they were stuck in an enemy sub. But with that in mind, so much more could have been done to make this film more original.

","Think of World War II submarine movies and the trail always leads to ""The Enemy Below"" and ""Das Boot"".  It seems anything else, like ""U-571"", would just be imitation. And yet this film throws in lessons about leadership which transcend it from merely a submarine yarn to a moving account of the conduct of Navy men and their commanders.  As commented on by others, it also marks a new beginning for actor Matthew McConaughey, emerging from the throes of the forgettable ""ED-TV"" and ""Contact"", to a strong film presence that develops before our very eyes, like John Wayne in ""Stagecoach"". ""U-571""  doesn't have a very believable plot (a super-important project with no backup support) but that is more than compensated by the nervy scenes that transpire. You can always thrill an audience by depth charges thrown at a defenseless sub or the seals and bolts popping as the sub dives beyond its limit or the torpedoes that have to be aimed squarely to blow up intended targets.  But ""U-571"" also tells the story of a Navy Lieutenant who can't measure up to being a Captain until he is willing to give up not only himself but also his men for a mission.  As skillfully acted by McConaughey with a bevy of credible support - Harvey Keitel as the Chief, Bill Paxton as the Captain, Jon Bon Jovi   as Emmett, and Jake Weber as Hirsch, ""U-571"" more than entertains you, it teaches you a lesson about the military sacrifice of men."

","I remember hearing the title of this film, I recognised it was something to do with a submarine or ship, but I was also attracted to it by the all-star cast in it, directed by Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Surrogates). Basically set in World War II, allied forces have been having trouble against the German Navy, especially their U-Boats, because of their highly sophisticated cipher machines and the Enigma code. One German U-Boat is damaged and awaits assistance, the Americans decide that this incidence is an opportunity for them to get the cipher machine. So they have a submarine made up to resemble a German U-Boat, it is called U-571, and they plan to pretend to be the ship sent to assist the damaged U-Boat, to take control and take the machine and destroy it. Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) takes command of U-571, after Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) is seriously wounded during a torpedo attack on his ship, other crew members include Chief Gunner's Mate Henry Klough (Harvey Keitel), and Lieutenant Pete Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi). Everything goes according to plan, they get the machine and are ready to leave, but out of nowhere they are torpedoed by a German relief ship, initially Dahlgren did not feel Tyler was ready to make tough decisions, now that he is commanding he and the survivors must do whatever it takes tor survive. Also starring David Keith as Major Matthew Coonan, King Kong's Thomas Kretschmann as Captain-Lieutenant Gunther Wassner, Homeland's Jake Weber as Lieutenant Hirsch, Jack Noseworthy as Seaman Bill Wentz, Tom Guiry as Seaman Ted 'Trigger' Fitzgerald, Will Estes as Seaman Ronald 'Rabbit' Parker and Final Destination 2's Terrence 'T.C.' Carson as Steward Eddie Carson. The cast of Americans are all alright, but you cannot believe the story, because it was the British who got hold of the Enigma cipher machine, it is definitely a fictional story, this is essentially just popcorn fodder, nonsense, but with plenty of exciting explosions and engaging enough underwater battle sequences, a reasonable Second World War action thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Sound. Worth watching!"

In reality, America had nothing to do with finding the Enigma Coding Machine, but the British were the ones responsible for taking it away from the Germans.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that this is nothing but a B.S. movie, I'd found it to be quite enjoyable without losing interest.

","(WARNING: Plot Spoilers Aplenty!)<br/><br/>For probably the first time in my life, I went to see a movie today about which I knew absolutely nothing - had read no reviews, had seen no trailers, hadn't seen any publicity of any kind. I had 2.5 hours to kill, so I went to the nearest cinema and saw whatever was starting. It happened to be U-571. I'd enjoyed all the other sub movies (The Enemy Below, Das Boot, Crimson Tide, Hunt for Red October, etc.) so I settled down to enjoy this one.<br/><br/>Boy, was I disappointed!<br/><br/>Movie-going fans of Star Trek might know that one the best episodes of the original 60s series, ""Balance of Terror"", was a transposition of the plot and characters of the classic sub movie ""The Enemy Below"". The two are equally classics of their genre, and both shine primarily because of excellent scripts and some wonderful acting.<br/><br/>By comparison, U-571 ran like a transposition of the corniest elements of Star Trek: The Next Generation. The producers and writers also seem to have borrowed the automatic Star Trek plot-and-script generator.<br/><br/>First we have the baddies (or rather, single baddie), truly evil, with no compassion, humanity or other redeeming characteristics whatsoever (unlike his crewman, who hesitates before firing on the dinghy-load of escapees).<br/><br/>
Then we have our hero, dashing and roaring to go, who hasn't been promoted (with a conversation taken straight from several TNG episodes: ""you can't take command until you're able to send a man to his death without hesitation""). <somebody give me a bowl, I'm gonna puke!><br/><br/>The moment that scene happened, I knew *exactly* how the film was going to end! Lo and behold, the great denouement is our heroic Lieutenant all but ordering a crewman to sacrifice himself for the mission.<br/><br/>
And another exchange straight out of bad militaristic sci-fi: As soon as our hero answers ""I don't know"" to a question from a crewman, the next scene came as no surprise to me, as the Chief calmly tells him he can't show any weakness in front of his crew. <a bowl's not enough, I need a bucket!><br/><br/>Plot & Script-by-numbers doesn't begin to describe the awfulness of this movie's approach to story-telling. When the crew discuss the fate of an earlier sub which dived deeper than it was designed to, surely it came as no surprise that our valiant crew would be obliged into just such action? (of course, as our hero is THE Hero, he will survive unscathed...<br/><br/>As a (mild) claustrophobic, one of the reasons I like sub movies is because the enclosed space remains a theme throughout well-made movies of the genre. This one had no such feeling (yes, the cramped spaces were shown, but we the audience had no actual feel for it!)<br/><br/>OK, the SFX were exemplary and the set pieces weren't bad. But the utter monotony with which they appeared in sequence like an old jigsaw puzzle one can put together in one's sleep (the original skipper's death, the argument over whether to fire or not to fire, the cat-and-mouse game with the German destroyer dropping depth charges, the blocked torpedo tube), the ham-fisted acting from the experienced members of the cast who should have known better, and that music rising to crescendi of cheap emotion to make up for the lack of direction, acting or cinematography when filming human beings, left me desperately wanting to get home to pull Das Boot off the shelf and watch a submarine war movie that knew what it was doing, filmed by a director who knew how to direct and written with a little flair and originality. Three people sitting in front of me in the half-empty cinema had the right idea: they walked out after an hour of this cliche'd rubbish.<br/><br/>
And I won't even go into the historical inaccuracies, slightly corrected by the ""tribute"" at the end of the film.<br/><br/>If I had to give this film a score out of ten, I'll be generous in awarding it a 3."

I know that the movie makers played around with history to make the story work, but it in no way made the movie any less entertaining, nor did it hide the fact that being depth charged in a submarine has got to be one of the most horrific things a man could go through. The only serious flaw that I found in the storyline (besides the previous statement about who first got the Enigma) was how the resupply submarine knew from over a thousand yards away that the S-33 was American, while the U-571 crew couldn't tell when S-33 got right next to it.

Impossible is more the word.  I would need no less than three hands to count how many times I said to myself, ""Now that was stupid,"" during the course of this movie.  In fact, there was one point when the entire audience, as an aggregate, basically screamed the words ""Yeah, right!"" at the screen.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, they actually had a military advisor for this film - a vice admiral, at that.  Seems to me they couldn't have listened to him, though.  I mean, granted, I don't know the first thing about military life, but I know enough about physics to realize that starting a diesel engine while underwater is a really bad idea.<br/><br/>True, the film could be worst.  Parts of it are somewhat suspenseful, and the acting is passable.  I wouldn't recommend you pay money to see it, though.<br/><br/>But, if you do, know this: there's no good reason to pay attention to anyone except McConaughey, Paxton, and Keitel.  Anyone else in U-571 is important for maybe ten minutes - at best.  In addition, this movie falls into the usual war movie trap of casting a whole bunch of people that look alike. And it doesn't help that they don't mention many names.  For example, even knowing the name of Jon Bon Jovi's character from the credits, I can't place him in the film (granted, his fans will recognize him, I'm sure, but, no offense to the man, I'm not one of them).<br/><br/>Really, though, I should have known better than to go see U-571 in the first place.  It's the type of movie that's usually rated ""R"" and usually released in the summer.

","If you don't like war films, fine. But don't comment on history facts unless you know what your are talking about. This isn't a documentary or even a docudrama. This is an action/drama MOVIE! Fact: Special OP forces recovered several enigma-type of devices during WWII, and used this information against the Germans. Did the enigma decoders win the war? Of course not, but in my opinion it doesn't diminish its significance. I urge the reviewers who posted ignorant opinions as fact to read about the Enigma, the Ultra, and the impact it had on the war with our allied forces (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)<br/><br/>Back to the MOVIE. I love this film: the characters are real, there's no posing or cartoon cliché's. The script, like the story, is no-nonsense, simple and focused. The directing is superb and the sound-design is first rate. The suspense is palpable, really drew me in and kept me there. Its easy to see why it had so many (9) Oscar nomination. The film, in general, sort of was never on the radar ( pun intended) very long, and didn't garner the interest I felt it deserved."

","Having seen other world war II u-boat thrillers, such as ""Das Boot,"" I would say that this film ranks high on the list for suspense and authenticity. <br/><br/>The movie is well paced, with never a dull moment. The characters are believable and not two dimensional. The growth of Matthew McConaughey's acting and depiction in the screenplayh from a novice to a champ is well crafted. The photography and editing are above the norm. <br/><br/>The action is believable. I found myself in a semi-state of panic with every depth charge facing the crew. Unreal how an American sub sailing crew could take charge of a German u-boat on such short notice, but this is Hollywood and anything and everything is possible. <br/><br/>A classy touch to the script is when a German prisoner taps on the u-boat's wall --""destroy me."" His sabotaging stunt is soon found out and done away with! I wondered how could the Americans understand the German message? Later I realized that the American radio tech who deciphered it, spoke German earlier in the film and could have easily deciphered the message."

","When my dad first told me he wanted to see this movie, I thought, ""blah. A guy's movie."" (He likes Jackie Chan and wax-on-wax-off.)  So I went to see it to humor him and also to have another movie under my belt.  I was held on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  We all know what happens at the end (they eventually *must* deliver Enigma to the Allies), but what I liked about was that we don't know how they're going to get out of it, and that's what takes us on a suspense-ride the entire length. Also, out of sheer coincidence, I'm studying World War II in U.S. History as well, which gave it a little spice, as nerdy as it sounds. See this movie, but see it only for the entertainment value, because as another user commented, it has no historical basis whatsoever.<br/><br/>I can't say everything I want to say about this film without boring you but I definitely recommend experiencing this movie."
"William-of-Baskerville","8","2","6","14 February 2014"," Better than Das Boot
","Yes, I know, this is history rewritten, but it's entertaining storytelling not a documentary, I mean, come on, who thinks that Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter after going to the theatre? Back to the movie itself. I've seen both Das Boot (German spoken with subtitles) and U-571. U-571 is the better entertaining film in my opinion. Das Boot has a very linear story, and apart from the same pumping music, it never becomes real exciting, more than that, it misses a compelling and gripping storyline. U-571 on the other hand has all the interesting and exciting elements you would expect from a submarine movie, including a very nice hunt sequence. If you want entertainment, go for U-571. If you want to know what's all the fuss about, watch Das Boot too. If you want authenticity, watch a documentary."
"lee_eisenberg","7","2","6","8 November 2006"," U turned
","As I understand it, ""U-571"" is less than totally accurate, as it was actually the English who captured the Nazi submarine and figured out the code. But ignoring that, the movie is still quite fun, as the American crew sees their duty and won't let anything stand in their way. I will say that the portrayal of the Germans could have been better (""Das Boot"" showed how they weren't really Nazis, some were just drafted; this one makes them all look like Nazis).<br/><br/>But anyway, the whole thing is pretty fun to watch, without any sappy love scenes to drag it down.

A German U-boat is attacked by an allied battleship and almost completely disabled.  It doesn't have enough power to return home so it becomes a sitting duck.  The sub, however, is carrying an enigma machine, a priceless piece of communication equipment that encrypts/decrypts German messages.  In the hands of the Allies, it could be the difference between losing and winning the war.<br/><br/>An American sub is immediately sent out to retrieve the enigma from the German sub.

","It isn't often you enter a cinema and instead of checking your watch you have to check a calendar instead.  Now that doensn't mean U-571 was even more boring than usual, it just means I had to make sure I wasn't in the 50's or 60's watching a film, so effective is this flick in transporting the viewer back to the era of war films, espionage, Cold War shennanigans and so forth.<br/><br/>The plot concerns the retrieval of the Enigma machine, a small typewriter like device that German U-boats used to communicate, using an encryption that the Allies had failed to crack.  Upon hearing that a U-Boat lies crippled after a blistering attack, the Americans disguise one of their own subs as a german u-boat, and attempt to get to the german sub before the enemy can send their own resupply and repair ship to aid the distressed tub.<br/><br/>Their goal is to grab the machine and scupper the ship before the repair ship gets there.  Of course it wouldn't be a film of this nature without the whole thing going wrong, and some of the crew end up on the German U-Boat, fighting for their lives to get home with the precious ""typewriter"".<br/><br/>U-571 is quite simply an excellent film, full of suspense and excitement. The cast are totally top-drawer, with McConaughey giving what is probably the performance of his career, in a role that seems tailor made for him. After years of floundering around with horrible roles that demanded little of him, this film allows McConaughey the scope and range he needs, and he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The special effects are also very well done, with some fantastic underwater photography and digital hokery-pokery adding to the suspensful moments very well.<br/><br/>This one is a definite must for the big screen.  Make sure you find a cinema with the biggest speakers possible, cause those depth charges sure sound great!<br/><br/>10 out of 10.  It's that good."

"phd_travel","3","1","2","6 September 2016"," Confusing and unbelievable
","If you accept it as a fictional submarine battle movie than it's an okay watch for die hard WW2 movie fans. But bear in mind there are some faults. The first storming of the U571 was confusing with too much machine gun fire and it was hard to keep track of what happened to some of the characters. That's simply bad directing. Later on there were too many violent explosions on the submarine for them not to have sunk immediately. Sometimes less is more. Things get a outrageously unbelievable as the battle proceeds.<br/><br/>There was some noise about historical inaccuracies but face it would Hollywood make a movie about British finding an Enigma machine in a submarine? How are they going to put Matthew McConaughey in it?"
"edwagreen","6","1","2","5 March 2016"," **1/2
","Nice seeing Will Estes, Jaime of television's Blue Bloods in a minor role in this film.<br/><br/>I think that the film basically torpedoes itself with the constant barrage of firing. Naturally, the scenes are confined to the ships whether they be above or below the ground and this is always a disadvantage to film viewers.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays the guy who was told by his superior that he isn't ready to head a naval ship only for the one to tell him this dies on board and Matt steps up to the helm. Notice those bulging eyes of his as he directs the men to follow his orders. Harvey Keitel plays one of the men on board who is fiercely loyal to McConaughey and urges the others to do so. Interesting to see how McConaughey tells the men that we're not running a democracy here and they're to do what he tells them to do. <br/><br/>The film becomes essentially a cat and mouse game with the Americans over powering a Nazi submarine while attempting to get a valuable recorder used by the Germans to communicate with Berlin."
"The_Other_Snowman","3","1","2","28 September 2013"," Who's the Hero?
","With only a few minor changes, this could have been a suspenseful thriller about a heroic German U-boat captain trying to take his vessel back from the Americans who have captured it, after slaughtering his crew. He's so sympathetic in his first scene -- and the Americans are so unlikable -- that I imagine the filmmakers must have panicked. They threw in a ""kick the dog"" moment, of the German captain ordering the massacre of a lifeboat full of people, just so the audience would know who was meant to be the villain.<br/><br/>This kind of thing happens in war movies all the time. The Americans -- led by Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel -- trick their way onto the U-boat and shoot just about everyone they run into. This is supposed to be heroic, because these are supposed to be the good guys. The German captain manages to hide out, and makes several attempts to sabotage the boat. This is supposed to be villainous, because he's the bad guy.<br/><br/>Of course, the real trouble with this sort of stark morality is that the entire film is a fabrication of the screenwriters. The situation is an invention, the characters are fictional, and every action is calculated for maximum effect. U-boat crews were not known for any cruelty beyond that exhibited by the Allied submariners, and yet the makers of this movie were compelled to upgrade their historical villain into a really nasty character. The point of all this is to make an exciting action movie -- it's not a documentary, right?<br/><br/>But then why is it a historical movie at all? Why bother making movies set in historical periods if you're just going to ignore the details? Nearly sixty years passed between the war and the movie -- so why not use the opportunity to educate the audience about what really happened, rather than simply aiming to excite them with tired clichés?<br/><br/>Well, apart from all that, it actually is quite an exciting ride. The camera never stops moving and things never stop exploding -- and Matthew McConaughey apparently never stops shouting. McConaughey makes a great villain, but this movie designates him as the hero -- the same way most stupid action movies do."
"thescab","Null","1","2","22 April 2000"," Some great suspense and intensity in this film.
","My girlfriend and I went to see 28 days, but ended up walking into U-571 as she changed her mind at the last minute and wanted to see an action movie. How sweet is that?<br/><br/>Sadly, the best part of the experience for me was seeing the M:I 2 preview. Which was awesome, just awesome.<br/><br/>U-571 was a good movie.  Not a great movie, but a good movie.  There was some great suspense and it gave me an interesting perspective of what it must have been like to be in a U-Boat in WWII.  Granted this film was not made to be referred to as a historical document but since I have zero frame of reference in this category, I learned a few things.<br/><br/>We know this is a film that was (loosely) based on the true exploits of Her Majesty's Forces in WWII, but since Costner butchered the British accent in Robin Hood all those years ago, the producers thought discretion to be the better part of valor and told the story with the good ol' boys from the US Navy as the heroes.  I don't want to bore you with plot points, as it lacks many surprises in that respect, and let's talk about what was worth seeing.<br/><br/>It was extremely claustrophobic.  U-Boats don't have a great deal of room in them, and this film made me feel trapped.  By the end, I was ready to get out.  With nothing to see, and in a crippled submarine, the movie generated real suspense, and the digital sound really helped in this capacity as we hear the depth charges falling down from the passing Destroyers.  These were the scenes that worked for me in a big way.<br/><br/>There was great tension as we got a taste of what being on board U-571 had to offer.  The sailors couldn't read German so they had trouble operating the controls, the ship was damaged and wouldn't run properly, no weapons, and very low on power. These elements helped to raise the emotional level for the exchanges between the characters, and made it seem very real in certain scenes.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey's character was impacted the most by this tension, giving him the most development in the film.  You could clearly see him traverse from caring X-O of the American sub to hard nosed Captain of U-571, with a little help from Harvey Keitel of course.  If you like McConaughey, you won't be disappointed here.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was good, but we really didn't get a chance to see them and spend time with them so we could empathize with them.  We met certain characters briefly, but sacrificed their development for the action sequences.  Films like Saving Private Ryan should be a case study in how you can have both.  If you see the film you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie if you haven't seen Das Boot, which is a vastly superior film.  Unlike Das Boot, U-571 has few plot surprises, doesn't let us get inside the characters and doesn't revolutionize storytelling as it relates to a U-Boat film.  Fortunately, U-571 tells an interesting story, and generates some real suspense and tension, and the sound will leave you rattling in your seat."

The Hunt for Red October has Sean Connery. And Crimson Tide had a Quentin Tarantino penned screenplay.  But they don't have the sheer thrills that this film provides.<br/><br/>The cast was quite good, and it was nice to see Harvey Keitel play a good guy for once.  Matthew M also gives a good bravado performance.  I'd want to be a member of his crew.<br/><br/>One word of caution.  Do not see this in a theater with the best sound system around.  I went deaf for several minutes after this was over.  While it's cool to have the floor shake during the explosions, I would have also wanted to hear the film.

","U-571 was the most fun I had at the theaters all year long in 2000. No other film gave me the same amount of excitement, though VERTICAL LIMIT came damn close. I enjoyed U-571 so much I went back at least two more times to see it. It was a thrilling movie with a lot of action and a pulse-pounding pace. Matthew McConaughey and the entire cast was great in this film. Who cares if it wasn't historically accurate? I'm tired of hearing people complain that the film denied the British's involvement in being the first to steal an Enigma code machine. That's true, but obviously those complainers missed the dedication at the end before the credits that directly says they were responsible for the first Engima victory. This is supposed to be a movie, not a historical document, people. Even the director knows that, saying in an interview that it was his hope people would see the film and become interested in learning how things actually happened in real life. He knew the film wasn't a documentary, and more people need to learn that as well. Anyway, U-571 is thrilling entertainment, a nice throwback to the WWII films of the 50s. The action is adrenaline-pumping, the score is full of heroism and tension, and the film is so fast-paced it flies by before you know it. The DVD looks and sounds magnificent. Even all the way to the end of the year, U-571 remained the best, most fun movie I saw all year long."

"ArgonautV4","8","1","2","7 June 2001"," The best submarine flick since ""Das Boot""
","Nothing can or will ever measure up to ""Das Boot,"" but ""U-571"" comes pretty darn close. I've seen about two dozen submarine movies, but this is the first one to leave me with no fingernails. I can't help but scoff whenever some hypercritical so-and-so gripes about it being historically inaccurate. To appreciate the movie for what it really is, you need two things: an open mind and an utter lack of cynicism. I saw absolutely nothing--not a prop, not a line, not a premise--in that movie stating that this was the first attempt ever at capturing an Enigma machine. Remember the dedication at the end? May 9, 1941, the British took the Enigma for the first time. Now, almost every time such a machine was captured, the Nazis eventually got wise and CHANGED THE CODE. They kept on changing it and changing it, and the Allies kept having to try again. So, who says the Americans can't try again a year later, fictionally? They tried and succeeded factually with the U-505--a lot of people seem to be ignoring this.<br/><br/>""U-571"" also has the best sound and underwater photography I have ever seen in two dozen submarine flicks; it deserves the Oscar it received for sound editing. When I first saw it in the theater, the sounds were edited so that certain sounds came out of certain speakers; for instance, if the crew heard a noise in the rear section of the boat, that noise came out of the speakers at the rear of the theater. WOW!! Together with the terrific photography, it was just like being inside the boat with the characters. All told, the sound effects in this movie are mind-boggling.<br/><br/>This gets an 8.75 from me, the -1.25 due to pithy little things like mooring lines and diving alarm. Other submarine movies have gotten a lot more wrong than that. ""U-571"" is realistic, mostly well-acted, and wholly well-written--to fans of submarines and submarine movies like me, it's a treat and a half. And there wasn't much character development going on, so what? There was too much else going on without making the movie overlong. As I say, it's no ""Das Boot,"" but it sure follows that new standard. So, watch ""U-571"" with an open mind and no cynicism, and you won't even be able to go to the washroom till it's over."
"BobLib","Null","1","2","23 April 2000"," Latest entry in a great tradition is more than up to the test.
","Make no mistake, even if it is a bit weak on historical accuracy, ""U-571"" is one to rank with ""Run Silent, Run Deep,"" ""Ice Station Zebra,"" and ""The Bedford Incident"" as one of the great submarine movies of all time.<br/><br/>Set in the early days of World War II, when the allies were taking a massive walloping, it deals with the efforts of a handful of submarine crewmen to retrieve a valuable coding device from a partially disabled German submarine, the eponymous vehicle. I won't give away anymore of the plot than that, except to say that, if you're looking for an action-packed thrill-ride of a movie, ""U-571"" delivers and than some.<br/><br/>The performances are all top-notch, particulary Matthew Macaughnehy as the executive officer who suddenly finds himself in command. His crew includes always reliable Harvey Keitel (who should get an Emmy nomination for ""Fail-Safe,"" but probably won't) and a suprisingly good Jon Bon Jovi. I almost didn't recognize Tom ""The Sandlot"" Guiry, all grown up, but he turns in a good performance, as well, as the young crewman who manages to save the mission but loses his own life in the process.<br/><br/>In short, if you're looking for one of the best action pictures to come along in years, ""U-571"" is definitely it."

","All you Brits out there just need to get over yourselves. About three of you have mentioned the Royal Navy capturing a Kriegsmarine Enigma machine in 1941.  This is true.  But many Enigma machines were captured, off of U-Boats, weather teams in Greenland, North Africa, etc.  And many were captured far earlier than 1941 (Bletchley Park was reading the majority of German military Enigma traffic as early as the Battle of Britain in 1940). Most were captured by the British, but some were captured by the Canadians and the Americans.  I would love to see a movie about the spectacular British contributions to ULTRA. But in the mean time, just enjoy (or not) U-571 as a movie on its own merits.<br/><br/>""it's annoying to see such historically inaccurate films like this coming out that takes the credit away from one nation and gives it to another that, and let's be honest here, doesn't need much more really now does it?""<br/><br/>Perhaps you should learn your own lesson.  The first Enigma machine was captured and smuggled to England by the Polish Underground in late 1939 (as I recall). The British are in no position to complain about others not sharing credit for wartime victories.<br/><br/>And the comparison to a movie about the British dropping the Atomic bomb on Japan is stupid.  No British planes dropped the Bomb, while Americans did, in fact, capture Enigma machines.<br/><br/>To learn more about ULTRA, Enigma, and Allied crypto-analysis during WWII, read ""Bodyguard of Lies"" by Anthony Cave Brown."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ""U-571"" is the fictional German U-boat in this story, set in the north Atlantic in 1942. The basic premise are the several ""allied"" boats which recovered German message encoders which helped win the war. This is a fictional account of one of them.<br/><br/>The human interest story is the young officer Tyler, played by Matthew McConaughey, who had just been passed over for a ""captain"" assignment, because his commander, played by Bill Paxton, didn't think he was ""ready"", including being able to sacrifice some of his men to save a mission. So, you very quickly realize that taking command and sacrificing his men will become part of the script.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the sub U-571 being attacked and damaged, and a fire kills all the mechanics, so they cannot get the boat running. They use the encoder to send a secret mesage to get help. The Allies pick up the location of the transmission and figure out it is a U-boat and send an American sub dressed up as a german sub to get there first, with plans to capture the encoder and sink the sub so the Germans won't be wise to the deed.<br/><br/>The plans go awry, the American sub is sunk, Paxton is killed, ""Tyler"" becomes the de facto captain of the injured U-571 and attempts to get to Greenland for safety. The American mechanic gets one set of engines running well. The one German survivor, their captain, is chained up but still manages to wreak near havoc until they ""wrench"" him! But the German destroyer figures out what is happening, uses depth charges to further damage the U-571, ""Tyler"" hatches a plan to outsmart them, and finally gets their last torpedo on target. As the story ends an American airplane spots them and rescue is near. ""Tyler"" becomes the captain that he wanted to be. In a somewhat syrupy scene, Harvey Keitel's character said, ""I'd go to sea with you anytime.""<br/><br/>The DVD has both DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 selectable sound tracks. I wasn't able to notice any difference between the two. The surround sound really puts you in the middle of the action, and the explosions, all 38,751 of them, are very realistic. The picture color and sharpness are without flaw.<br/><br/>My wife and I found the film very entertaining. To those few critics who think this film is not historically accurate, see the DVD ""extras"". They used experienced WW II submariners as consultants, and built the sets very accurately. The story itself is fictional, and fiction is ""fiction"", so portrayed events are not intended to be real.  For total enjoyment with a somewhat predictable story I rate it ""7"" of 10."
"krazykat11","4","1","2","3 February 2001"," What are people thinking?!?!?
","First of all, I've been reading other reviews of this movie that seem to praise it for realism.  Let's get one thing straight, in no way is this movie realistic.  For one thing, the whole mission is to board a crippled german sub that is stranded in the atlantic.  When their own sub gets destroyed, the americans are forced to pilot the german sub instead.  Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isnt this sub crippled?  Isn't this the whole point of the film?  Well, apparently, its only crippled for germans, because a skeleton crew of non-german speaking americans can decipher the controls and out-manuver german subs and destroyers alike while sailing home the whole time.<br/><br/>But then again, this appears to be some sort of super submarine.  After all, it can withstand depth charges blowing up several meters from its hull all day.  Apparently, the only way for a depth charge to take out a sub is if someone aboard leaves a hatch open and it happens to drift into it. Beyond this, the sub can dive deeper than any sub of its time even when damaged.  And even beyond that, it has some sort of super-torpedo that can take out a ship with one hit.  In real life, this crew and their stolen sub would have died around 50 times over, but whoever wrote the film must have figured the audience was too stupid to know that and was somehow able to pass this piece of c**p off as a realistic WW2 Naval movie.  As for realism, it would be more credible if the sub had been sunk, and they had all simply swam home."

We discover the usual ""rivalry"" between some of the men and their ranks.  And we get to know Matthew McConaughey's character.  He, of course, is the typical ""buddy buddy with the troops"" commander.   A leader that is stuck behind higher command.  He is the underdog of the picture.  The one who will lead when the odds are against him.  <br/><br/>	The film really gets going when the men take off on their mission.  The whole second act is filled with rich imagery and exciting action.  The thrill of the voyage... the intensity of the espionage... the fear of survival... but I don't want to give anything away to anybody.  Just trust me on this, the second act is well worth sitting through the first act. <br/><br/>
	But, once the action is over, once the story goes in a calming direction, once the second act comes to a close, the film just seems to end.  In fact, they seemed to have forgotten a third act!   No third act.  No resolution. No nothing!  We were just left to wonder what must have happened to them. <br/><br/>
	U-571 is an enjoyable film once we get aboard the subs.  The action is fast paced and the suspense keeps us glued.  Actually, there aren't many submarine movies I can think of that are bad, and this one isn't that bad either.   It isn't as good as DAS BOOT, HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, or CRIMSON TIDE, yet you will still enjoy this voyage."

","There's no mistake that ""U-571"" is intended to be a suspense thriller - there is little dialogue and an huge emphasis on special effects and dramatic music.<br/><br/>	And as a thriller, ""U-571"" is among the best in the category.<br/><br/>	However, what puts ""U-571"" over the top is how intelligent it is when it tries to be more than a thriller. The movie is also a first-class drama, with superb acting, dialogue, plot and character development.<br/><br/>	Set during a fictional naval mission from World War II, ""U-571"" tells the story of an American submarine crew sent to steal secret code information from the title Nazi submarine. However, during the mission, another Nazi submarine destroys the Americans' ship, leaving the crew stranded on an enemy ship in enemy territory.<br/><br/>	The movie is able to accomplish a lot of difficult blending. Not only is it able to be both dramatic and action-packed, but it is also able to remain extremely detailed to naval lingo without being confusing to average viewers.<br/><br/>	From an acting standpoint, the movie is a huge success. This is Matthew McConaughey's finest performance to date, and the supporting cast is equally superb. Few movies allow a character to be defined without words, but the view knows within the first minute McConaughey is on the screen exactly what his character is all about.<br/><br/>	Harvey Keitel leads the list of co-stars, brilliantly portraying the ship's wise chief petty officer. Also terrific in the film is Jake Weber, who plays a suave operations commander who has to learn the ropes of being aboard a submarine.<br/><br/>	All in all, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It perfectly gauges when to build tension, and when to relieve it. Its special effects are hardly noticeable because they fit in so seamlessly with the rest of the film. The sound is well distributed around the theater to give the viewer the feeling of actually being in the submarine. And the music is a masterpiece at setting moods of vulnerability, fear and triumph.<br/><br/>	""U-571"" will undoubtedly be chastised for creating a piece of fiction about historical events. However, some of the most successful historical movies draw a tangent away from the history books into a completely fictional story (""Titanic,"" ""Saving Private Ryan""). ""U-571"" is no different.<br/><br/>	This film deserves plenty of attention from viewers for what can only be called an achievement of action filmmaking."

I thought the best performances came from Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, Harvey Keitel and Matthew McConaughy. The basic story has been covered by others, so I'll not bother with it here. There is enough drama and action to keep anyone interested (well, people who like that sort of thing anyway). It's a story of survival, of courage, respect and teamwork.

There is no other way to say it, this movie is enjoyable to watch, but the entire cast seems like they are very nervous.  Every time you look at them they look as if they are afraid of doing something wrong.  Especially Harvey Keitel, who looks as if he was kept in a box without food or water until they pushed him in front of the camera and forced at gunpoint to spit out a few lines.  As me and my friends were watching this film, we were just waiting for Gene Hackman to pop out of one of the pipes and start barking orders at all of the crew.  How they ever managed to stay underwater so long in such a tight confined space, and not have a heart attack is a mystery to all of us.  My suggestion to the actors is to take some Prozac before you come on set.  My suggestion to the audience is to watch this film and enjoy it for what it is, but also watch it a second time and crack jokes throughout the movie with your friends."

Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel couldn't use their full potential, because their characters were too flat and where was Jon Bon Jovi. Another point of criticism is the lack of originality, a couple of scenes seemed to be stolen of U-571 greater German brother.

","I have a few issues with this movie.  I can say very frankly that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I could go on and on about the problems with U-571, but I don't want to drone on about it.  Aside from the mediocre story my biggest problem with it is the submarines.  How can anyone expect the viewer to believe that a WWI S class submarine can be disguised as a German WWII Class VIIC U-Boat.  The U-571 was a Class VIIC boat (according to historical documents).  The S33 skippered by the Americans looks virtually the same.  First of all a US Navy class S submarine does not look anything like a VIIC type U-Boat.  I would provide examples if I could attach an image, but I can't.  Sorry.  Secondly the only re-supply boats used extensively in the Atlantic ocean by the Germans were XIV class U-Boats.  These were know as Milkcows and were quite large and had a very different conning tower and deck gun arrangement, so did not really resemble a VIIC.  The only VII class boats used as re-supply subs were VIIF class. However only four were produced, two of which were stationed in the Pacific. They were ten meters longer than VIIC type U-boats so quite different in appearance.  They also were not fitted with 88mm Deck guns like the other VII type U-Boats.  Thus it is very unlikely that the German crew of U-571 would have mistaken a modified S class that resembled a VIIC as a re-supply sub."

"Leofwine_draca","9","2","7","23 November 2016"," Claustrophobic submarine thriller is a real treat
","U-571 garnered a lot of negative publicity on first release, due to the fact that it's completely historically inaccurate – the Brits were the ones who captured the first Enigma machine, not the Yanks. Still, inaccuracies aside – and let's face it, a LOT of Hollywood films are far from the truth – it's best to remember that this is a movie, nothing more, nothing less, designed to entertain and that's it. And I'm pleased to say that it's VERY entertaining.<br/><br/>Submarine thrillers have been fairly rare over the last couple of decades; everyone remembers DAS BOOT, the classic German miniseries, but there are no films so to speak of other than THE HUNT FOR RED October and CRIMSON TIDE. U-571 seeks to re-address that, presenting a taut thriller that mainly takes place in a single location. The good news is that Jonathan Mostow is the director, and he wrings every ounce of suspense, tension, and atmosphere from his confined setting. Mostow is that rare beast – a director who manages to turn even lacklustre scripts into entertaining movies; see TERMINATOR 3 for a case in point. His earlier BREAKDOWN, a fantastic thriller with Kurt Russell, remains a favourite and U-571 is just as entertaining as that movie.<br/><br/>Being a Hollywood movie, there are the requisite number of clichés and outlandish situations, but the premise seems fresh and the film is bolstered by some brilliant action scenes that make great use of CGI effects for a change. The cast have no choice but to give it their all; this is an ensemble outing and there's no hiding from the camera. Harvey Keitel is fine as the elder statesman, letting his younger co-stars do the hard work; Matthew McConaughey, an actor I usually dislike, is actually very good as the wannabe-captain. Elsewhere, the well-established likes of Bill Paxton and Elias Koteas fill out character roles, and there are two unusual casting choices: a bit part for cheeky chappy Robin Askwith, best known for his performances in '70s comedies like CONFESSIONS OF A WINDOW CLEANER, and a supporting role for musician Jon Bon Jovi, who is actually pretty decent. This is a frequently edge-of-your-seat film that packs in some great twists. After the initial set-up it keeps pounding away until the ending, and I enjoyed every minute; a minor classic for sure that just looks better and better as the years pass."

From a submarine movie you normally just don't expect this many action.

The very first scene was stole straight from Das Boot. The way the destroyer looked was EXACTLY like it was in Das Boot. The line ""we broke its back"" was straight from Das Boot. The party scene, eating the orange with no peel, all of the depth charge scenes, and several others are also stolen from Das Boot.<br/><br/>A big part of this movie was to make the Germans look dirty and evil. What purpose did the scene of the gunning down of the lifeboat serve if not to contradict the latter scene of the Americans ""graciously"" saving the German sailors. It's simple, show the Americans as being kind and nice and show the Germans as being evil and inhuman.<br/><br/>Another big part was making sure the only mentioning of Britain was to insult her. The one time they mentioned British was to show how the destroyer had made a mistake, and then they show how ""allied"" radar stations fixed the problem. Calling the British destroys ""tommies"" as in ""the tommies are c******g all over us"" was just a way hiding the fact that it was a British destroyer.<br/><br/>The German destroyer somehow prowling the atlantic was also a joke. It was most likely put in to show how the Royal Navy was so incompetent and they needed the Americans to save them.<br/><br/>The final straw was the American Flying boat spotting the survivors. The writer could of made the rescuers British just to show that indeed there were Brits in WWII, but no, he felt it necessary to make sure the British had no chance of doing anything that would put them in any possible positive light.<br/><br/>I give this movie negative 1 out of 10 stars.

F*** Yeah!<br/><br/>Many people with any sort of knowledge about the actual Allied apprehension of the Enigma machine and ensuing code breaking probably laughed out loud at this movie. It does in fact deviate from history. No wait, I take that back, it creates its own history. Then in doing so it puts the Americans at the forefront when it was really the Polish who acquired and first deciphered the Enigma and then it was reconstructed by the British. Sure, the history is wrong, but the action/suspense is first rate and the characters are actually likable. Take ""Pearl Harbor"" which also has gross inaccuracies in history, but then it doesn't provide anything else to make up for it. It just shows a clichéd love triangle and lots of explosions. ""U-571"" has great action scenes and a genuine sense of danger that all audiences want for their heroes of figure out a way out of. Predictably they, do, but that's part of the fun of these movies.<br/><br/>Also, it should be noted that while ""U-571"" makes use of many war and action movie clichés it doesn't do it so shamelessly. In fact, it's one of those movies that takes familiar elements and rearranges them into its own rhyme and rhythm. The resulting story has about as much structural integrity as the submarine that carries our heroes - it takes you on a tense ride, but that's it. And what more could you really ask for from an action movie? In fact many movies are much better when viewed as action movies. What is probably my favorite movie of all time, ""Where Eagles Dare,"" is not a war movie. The book was mildly believable, but the movie not at all. But that's why they call it ""escapist realism"" so you can escape from the reality and enjoy a reworked set of rules. When used right, these new rules, hopefully, provide good entertainment. And in ""U-571"" they do so and they do it very well. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for action/violence. Ages 7+"

The British reneged on the deal.  Sorry, Yank, but we jolly well DON'T care if you have one, not our chaps being sunk, and all that...<br/><br/>And so an American destroyer team trained and trained for a special mission to force a U-Boat to the surface and capture it and the Enigma on board before the Germans could scuttle it.  DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR? Want some proof?  Go and see the U-505 in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.  But, perhaps y'all'd rather whine and bad mouth the United States.  It does seem to be a popular hobby.   So, the U.S. had to go and get its own Enigma machine.  This is a fictionalized account of all that, and tremendously entertaining.  Under the circumstances, it's not something the Brits should be mentioning.  It's stuff like this that lets you see how far Europe IS falling. The movie is taut, well-directed, well-acted, reasonably accurate historically with modifications.  A lesson on the basic nature of military command is better put here than in many other movies.

The real U-110 was captured (complete with an Enigma machine) by the British Royal Navy in 1941. Actually U-571, was a legendary German Boat, that sunk over 42,000 tons of Allied shipping. Whilst 'Das Boot' is a strong candidate for the best ever movie, 'U-571' remains a shameful turkey. I think it's the only film in history, to spark a serious debate in the 'House of Commons'.

","As submarine movies go, U-571 gets the job done - that is to say, it tells an engaging (albeit predictable) story and features several scenes of nail-biting suspense. All of the usual plot staples are in evidence: tension between crew members, deep diving where the hull threatens to collapse, dodging depth charges, and sub-to-sub battles. Director Jonathan Mostow should be commended for taking a thin script and crafting a compelling film out of it. U-571 doesn't hold together well upon reflection, but, while it's playing on screen, it works. All the actors are more than adequate and this film further brings forth the dilemma of whether a strong character is needed or a strong performer can suffice to let the plot take precedence."

Keitel, after reluctantly obeying McConaughey's order to sink to a super red-zone depth of 200 meters (I don't think she can take much more, cap'n), says, gratefully (and predictably), ""Those Germans really know how to build a boat."" Now if only those Americans (or those French, whichever B-movie producers did it) knew how to make movies like those Germans, too, they'd have known that casting Keitel in support of McConaughey, who starts to come apart at a meter-depth of about 20, would prove to be the real disaster."

","Submarine movies are a subclass of their own, and almost entirely male-specific. There are few female characters, those are very peripheral, and women tend not to like the movies. U-571 is a typically Hollywood but fairly entertaining submarine movie, with action, suspense, bravery, sacrifice and some psychological twists and moderate character development. Not a fantastic movie, but certainly entertaining and worth a rental.<br/><br/>As for the fuss about it being historically inaccurate, my thinking is, c'mon people, it's Hollywood. Get a grip. They're not in the business of making documentaries, but rather they are trying to sell a product. This movie was made by an American studio, and they decided, and rightly I think, that the film would be much more profitable with American characters. So they altered history, like they almost always do when making movies based on a true story.<br/><br/>People who know their history know of the remarkable heroism and tenacity of all of the British people in WWII, and especially their armed forces.

","First off, I myself didn't like that although the story is based on true events it was an English submarine, not an American. Luckily there was not a lot of ""flagwaving"" and the main reason seems to be realism, American Actors should play American soldiers if possible. As Madonna has proved to the world; Americans aren't real good at acting British.<br/><br/>Second, this movie is very decently made, it is the blockbuster version of the famous movie ""das Boot"" and captures the same situations which submarine crews faced in WWII. However, being a Blockbuster it has different strengths and weaknesses then that movie. In fact, this movie is a poster-child for blockbusters because it has everything a blockbuster should have: action, excitement, great special effects, decent acting all around, heroism and of course a decent storyline.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the plot I can honestly say that there are some good plot-twists in this movie although some can be seen in advance. This however does not damage the storyline a bit. The acting, especially by the old dog Harvey Keitel is more then adequate and even the front-man of Jon Bon Jovi turns out to be a decent actor. <br/><br/>The action Sequences in this movie cause great excitement as well as a sense of claustrophobia and panic. This is improved dramatically by surround sound. The cinematography (camera) is brilliant despite some minor mistakes, shots are taken from a wide variety of spectra such as the ""frogview"" which also adds to the feeling of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>In conclusion I'd give this movie 7/10 because it is nothing more and nothing less then what a Blockbuster should be."

I have yet to read a review about Saving Private Ryan that argues the fact that there was no Private Ryan to actually save. And I'm pretty sure nobody ever complained that The Perfect Storm couldn't possibly be accurate, considering the entire crew died. This movie is good, no matter how you look at it.

Not much though. This film's purpose is keeping you on the edge of your seat and it succeeds to the fullest.

Dahlgren (Paxton) advised against it. Suddenly the entire crew of their submarine have their leaves cancelled and the sub is sent off on a covert mission. A possibility to capture a German encryption machine, called the Enigma, has arisen. A German U-boat has been critically damaged during combat and is immobile at sea. The American sub is disguised as a German U-boat, and the plan is to pose as a relief boat to the damaged u-boat and then board it. However, during the boarding the real relief boat turns up and a sinks the American submarine. A few of the boarding party now find themselves stranded on the damaged German U-boat...<br/><br/>Comments: The greatest strength of this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. Cryptic enough? Need an Enigma? Let me try to explain. This is a war/action movie, with some thrills and nice effects. It does that very well. It never tries to send an message or be philosophical or anything. Just plain action. As an audience it is just to sit back and enjoy. The cast is full of competent actors and they don't disappoint. I especially like McConaughey's and Keitel's performances. A good entertaining story with as mentioned good effects to augment. An extra plus for the language difficulties that the movie portrays, i.e. that the Germans do not speak English nor do they make any English manuals to their subs.

Sadly a lot of the younger generation might choose to skip all this after the 'action' is all over. <br/><br/>I had also heard many write ups say how poorly it compared to 'Das Boot' whilst ripping many scenes off.. well no, Das Boot does a far better job of instilling a sense of claustrophobia and the feel of being on a U boat (the lighting in U 571 is all abit even for instance and these no sense of crowding, foul air or depth) but most of the situations in U 571 were pretty unique to this film.<br/><br/>If you have to see a U boat film, see Das Boot, if you've seen it and want an adventure film along those lines then U 571 is.. okay, especially if you get past the first 20 minutes."
"r-van-weers","4","1","3","11 January 2005"," Typically Hollywood
","U-571 is a terrible film that everybody who values great movies like ""Das Boot"" from director Wolfgang Petersen should avoid watching. It is nothing more than an America-saves-the-world kind of movie which is overloaded with action and the typical Hollywood film music. It completely lacks historical objectivity and the characters are superficial hero's who have a difficult time showing realistic emotion.<br/><br/>Let's put things in perspective here: An Enigma Code machine was never captured. Not by the British and certainly not by the Americans. In reality over a 1000 English scientists had been working for more than a year before they were able to crack the code. The movie is indeed full of twists and turns. In fact, the movie is so full of action that it can not be taken seriously. The scenes that were supposed to be the best scenes of the movie were nothing more than colorless copies of the most beautiful scenes of ""Das Boot"". But even in the proces of copying mistakes were made: depth bombs are exploding extremely close to the sub without causing much damage. The crew tries to look scared but there's no claustrophobia. Then there is this scene in which the American sailors have to dive with the German sub. They're all in a panic because they do not know how to operate the boat. First they state that there are no instructions on the machinery, then they claim that it's all written in German? All this takes about a minute and suddenly nothing seems so be a problem anymore?! In another scene they are confronted with a German destroyer that pops out of the sky and is easily defeated with one single gun hit in the radio hut. In reality German commanders as well as their crews were known and feared for their expertise. No German battleship would ever have been defeated so easily.<br/><br/>All in all U-571 is a typical piece of Hollywood crap. Everything that makes ""Das Boot"" beautiful is missing in U-571. There's no great acting, there's no claustrophobia. So don't watch it, unless you are looking for a flick to fill up your time while you're eating popcorn."

","Imagine, it's 1941 and a German U-boat is roaming the North Atlantic in search of Allied ships to sink and to make an end to the supply line from the USA to Britain. This would have been a great theme for a movie on itself (remember Das Boot). But apparently the director was afraid it wouldn't be enough, he had to make it a little more spectacular. He wants us to believe that the Americans sent out one of their own submarines to recover an enigma-machine from a German U-boat who broke down in the middle of the ocean and who had to wait for another U-boat to arrive with spare parts... Why they added this? I really don't know, but in my opinion it doesn't do any good to the movie. <br/><br/>If you've seen Das Boot and if you are a great fan, like me, you'll probably notice that several of U-571's scenes resemble to the scenes from Das Boot. I'm not saying they copied it, but from time to time I really had a feeling of: Been there, seen that... The same for the acting. It wasn't bad, but wasn't brilliant either. You can see that they watched Das Boot several times before starting to act themselves. This means that you sometimes will have the feeling that you already know the characters, that you've met them before... I would say the actors did a good job, without excelling. They helped me to forget about the bad story ... from time to time.<br/><br/>All in all U-571 isn't a good movie. You'll find it well worth seeing when you haven't seen Das Boot before and when you don't know anything about World War II. They should have asked advice to the director of Das Boot. He certainly knew how to give you the feeling that you were into that boat, being attacked by the enemy, alone with the crew and no-one to come to the rescue. I really missed that in U-571. To me, this movie isn't worth much more than a 5/10."

I think I cannot say anymore than that what has been written in the comments before. Even if I would forget these lies and untruths I could not describe it as a good action movie as the plot is too predictable and boring. It has some entertaining moments though.

Americans don't seem to grasp the concept that England is one country and that Great Britain is 4 countries - merchant shipping was lost going to Britain, including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Opps - the submarine lands itself into trouble. Now the Allies plan to disguise themselves as the enemy, capture the Nazi submarine, take the machine and safely decipher all future German communications. They have just the man for the job - Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) and his band of merry men (plus some others along for the ride). Does it all go swimmingly or do some end up as bodies swimming? What do you think?<br/><br/>It's based (loosely enough I imagine considering the furore it caused in certain circles upon release) on real events so I cannot really poke at the plot too much. It's safe to save though it's conventionally structured - introduce characters quickly in a social gathering, have mini-climax in middle leading to final resolution in end (complete with weak character building). It's a tad clichÃ©d (look mommy - the man has learnt a valuable lesson) but not to the point of irritation and the action is never left out long enough to make you into Billy Bored.<br/><br/>Acting? Well Matthew hasn't quite found his wings here yet but does a passable job. Bill Paxton is good, but not in it long. Keitel is mostly great but he doesn't get enough `wise old seaman' lines to deliver. The rest you'll have seen off of TV and low movies  (and rock bands). All fine, nothing outstanding. Next.<br/><br/>Jonathan Mostov does a grand enough job directing. There are some genuinely tense moments when the crew are silent in the submarine, waiting to be blown apart by depth charges. The actual gun battles are far less satisfying, feeling mundane with an over-bearing musical accompaniment. Still the pacing is fairly solid and it wouldn't leave me overly worried for his current work on Terminator 3.<br/><br/>U-571 is again an enjoyable enough thriller thing.

U-571 sets up the plot very quickly, a Nazi U-boat is disabled, and an American sub has a chance to capture the Enigma device.  With the Enigma device in hand, the Allied forces would be able to break the U-boat's codes.   However, things don't go well for the American sailors who commandeer U-571.  They have to evade the Germans in order to make it back to safe waters, and the submarine is not in the best shape. The cast works well, and you can see the tension in their faces when depth charges start rocking the ship.  The film works well on several other levels, especially when there is no sound.  The lack of noise brings out the most tension during the film.  You wait in anticipation for a charge to go off, and you never know when one might.

The British used it and made their Ultra machine, which was the machine that decoded all of the Enigma messages.<br/><br/>Stories tell that the Enigma was stolen off of a British Sub, but in fact it wasn't. The story above was taken from an official British government document. <br/><br/>Now being Canadian, I am upset that the Americans made such a movie. Why can't they make a WWII movie about someone other than themselves?? The last WWII movie where they included other countries was in 1969 with the Devil's Brigade. I mean, why can't Americans understand that other Allies helped in winning the war?? There were other countries involved, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA, Russia, and China, and others. Why can't the American public see movies about these other countries?? Why must Hollywood skew history to make it so American?? They could make a historical WWII movie about the British, you know. When the American public, and in fact Canadian and British public see this movie, most will believe it to be historical truth, no matter what the movie says. They will believe it because they don't know of the true history, unfortunately so. <br/><br/>Too bad that the Americans had to make this movie. because I am tired of seeing American heroism everywhere.

(""It's all in German!"", he exclaims as though the brass didn't brief him that Germans didn't mark all their U-Boat dials in good ole American). When will Hollywood quit making this kind of tripe. Not any time soon apparently seeing Behind Enemy Lines is now playing. Revisionist history in the extreme, from the capture of the enigma machine right down to the black cook who doesn't seem to confront 40's bigotry whatsoever as he goes about handling every onboard task imaginable. Not likely I'm sad to say. The special effects are typically exaggerated and the bubble-gum action repetitious and lacking any kind of tension. Pacing and realistic suspense is what made Das Boot the great film it is. It was also about the real fear men face when they're trapped in a fragile sub and at the mercy of enemy depth charges and air attacks. U-571 is an atypically brainless Hollywood imitation short on realism and long on noise and phony heroics. <br/><br/>Written and directed by a hack and made for an exceedingly stupid action market.

","Ok, so some people might say, 'gee but it's only a movie, stop bitching about the history and enjoy it'. What they don't appreciate is the massive potential for the media, and films in particular, to change the public perception of history. Just look at how Shakespeare has changed the  public perception of King Richard III. Everybody accepts it as common knowledge that he was a hunch backed evil tyrant because Shakespeare says he was, for the sake of creating a great evil character in his drama. In fact Richard was a good looking and generous King. This is just one example from history. It is irresponsible to dress up fiction about history as truth, because people will believe it.<br/><br/>It worries me that future generations will get a distorted view of WWII because of movies like this changing the facts. OK, so that might not worry you American viewers much, as you say it is your movie. But it does worry us when our county went through so much destruction and suffering in order to keep up the fight for freedom, on our own. My family lost members and friends who were serving in the Royal Navy and Merchant Navies trying to keep Britain alive in the fight against the nazis. We beat the German U-boats, we decoded enigma, and we saved our own country from starvation. It is deeply offensive to those who died to say otherwise. How would Americans feel if we made a movie which claimed that the British army liberated France alone? It would be deeply offensive to your dead who made such a big sacrifice to save Europe from the nazis.<br/><br/>Apart from all this there are dozens of technical errors in the film, which would be pedantic to go on about, but these ruin the film for anyone even vaguely educated. German destroyers never went into the North Atlantic, they got blown out of the water as soon as they left the Baltic sea. A single engined German reconnaissance plane in the Atlantic? Duh! Don't think so. Yet they were supposed to be outside ALLIED air cover!! A British destroyer half sinking a German sub then leaving it alone on the surface?? American submarine sailors fighting as sea borne commandos?? A German sub sailing around on the surface near British waters? They would have been blown out of the water by the Allies, never mind any Germans!! Only a complete dim-wit could watch any of this without laughing.<br/><br/>Apart from all this the film is actually quite exciting!

American personnel did capture an enigma of course, but this was in 1946 when you could just about buy one in a car boot sale. This fact altering trend even infiltrates film created specifically for children, take the laughable Disney reworking of the Pocahontas story.

The beginning is promising, but some cliches (bad guys shoot their own to show audience they are evil etc) distract. As the story moves on, excitement fades as every problem is instantly fixed by turning the right valve in the hijacked enemy submarine - this move is executed at least 10 times as remedy for almost any problem, which makes the second part of the movie uninteresting.

Things don't exactly go as planned. ""U-571"" has a good opening, then drags for about a half-an-hour before the real excitement begins. Matthew McConaughey gives a strong, effective performance as the leader of the American crew, and gets good support by the supporting cast. The action scenes are well done, and all-in-all I wasn't disappointed. ""U-571"" kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time, which makes it a pretty good film. However, it's not quite as good as another submarine thriller, 1990's ""The Hunt for Red October"".<br/><br/>

","WARNING: REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>U-571 gets off to a good start- a group of American soliders are sent to find a damaged German sub, take prisoners and get their secret enigma machine. They get to the sub alright and as they are about to leave, their own sub is blown up. They have to board the German boat and try to  get away. These opening scenes are very well done- but it's when the boat is destroyed that everything goes wrong. It takes a long time for the audience to realize who has died and who hasn't. The movie never does make this clear. Then, the entire second hour of the film is the crew bracing themselves for depth charges, and then repairing leaks. It's boring. U-571 is nothing like the wonderful submarine movies like DAS BOOT or THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER- those films make us feel what it might be like to be aboard an actual sub- this one just recycles cliche and cliche."

","First of all : you should go and see the film...the effects are great, the photography great and the acting, ... well the acting is quite good too. But then comes the thing that bothers me so much : it's so predictable!!

","Suspend disbelief and get ready for moments of fear puncuated by blind terror. Although it was the British who captured the Enigma machine the story holds together as a plausible alternative. Aside from having a cook with a goatee and a couple of minor details, the realism was stunning. American Cinematographer magazine had a great article on the technical aspects of how the film was shot. The German dialog was also well done with the characters using idiomatic phrases and believable sentiment. In all a well done film and we all should look for more from  Mr. Mostow."

","U-571<br/><br/>During World War II, Adolf Hitler's Germans had 1,100 U-Boats in commission in the North Atlantic Ocean. On one of those boats existed a small, typewriter-shaped apparatus called simply Enigma - a code machine with which the Nazis transmitted messages from submarine to submarine.<br/><br/>The boat holding the Enigma is unexpectedly disabled in the middle of the sea. While the crew waits for help from its countrymen, the U.S. covertly approaches it with a mission: board the vessel and obtain the Enigma at all costs. Drafted for this dangerous mission are a group of sailors - not soldiers - led by the redoubtable Lieutenant Andrew Tyler  (Matthew McConaughey, his ample locks shorn). But getting on the boat is only half the task, of course. Soon the Americans are stranded on a foreign sub, with all of the instructions and designations written in German! Luckily for them (!) they were wise enough to include in their number a young sailor who speaks fluent German. What're the odds, really? And while they're trying to translate the German post-haste for a dive, they're suddenly in the sights of a German destroyer! Kind of one of those days when you just wish you had not gotten out of bed.<br/><br/>This another popcorn action movie, a white-knuckler that will leave you gripping your chair - our boys are in such peril throughout the movie, and they use up just about every life and chance they have coming to them - that while you know that in the grand Hollywood tradition of the Good Guys winning (and with the knowledge that the Germans did lose the war), you still root and cheer for the sailors to pull through. Plus some really DAZZLING effects, which are even nicer on DVD. Torpedos slam into metal! Subs DIVE DIVE DIVE! The pace is electrifying, if not altogether believable. Pack a lot of MREs for this one!"

","I really enjoyed this movie. It being a WWII-movie, I was relieved that it wasn't as close to real life as recent WWII-movies like 'Saving Private Ryan', but went slightly for a more Hollywood-style movie. This means you don't have to sit three+ hours in the cinema, however it doesn't also mean that it's just your typical american 'action-hero-movie'. It felt real, and I liked the plot a lot, with all its surprises. I recommend this one to all WWII-movie fans and to action/thriller fans in general."
"Mr. Tobar","5","1","3","9 October 2000"," Historically inaccurate ""based on a true story""
","This is an OK movie, as far as entertainment value goes, but it has no relation to reality.  It does a nice job of making you feel like you're watching something that took place in the past, so I'd have to rate it highly on the clothing and props.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of psychological drama, in the moments where you know it's going to end up one way or the other... a fair amount of suspense.  But considering that it IS a movie about submarines, it would be hard to make a movie that you can sit through that contains submarines and no suspense.<br/><br/>I'd say that overall, I'm just disgusted by movies that make Americans look like we all think that it's OK to say that a movie is based on reality, when it compiles different events into one story, and compiles different nation's soldiers (British, Australian, and US) into American soldiers.  It makes us look uneducated and overly self-worshiping."
"pgoggins","3","1","3","9 October 2000"," Banal
","If the intent was to make a maritime follow-up to Saving Private Ryan, the producers of this film miscalculated in a big way.  Compared to SPR, U-571 loses in about every category.<br/><br/>The writing was banal.  I didn't care when the men died.  With the possible exception of ""Trigger,"" they just died.  Mostow didn't give us the sense that these men had something to live for or that they died for something worthy dying for.<br/><br/>The direction was uninspired.  During the standard (and by now trite) submarine-diving-below-specified-limits scene, the rivet popping and pipe bursting shots were no different than any of a hundred other submarine films.<br/><br/>The acting was flat.  On this point, I will confess a predisposition against Matthew McConaughey.  I find his southern accent affected, and his delivery inappropriate to the character's situation.  Keitel and Paxton were better, but overall I sensed that there was a big casting problem among this ensemble: they didn't look or act like it was the 1940s.  If heroes are ordinary men who do extraordinary things in extraordinary times, these guys weren't heroes...they were just guys."

","""U-571,"" from writer-director Jonathan Mostow, takes on too much water, along with every submarine movie cliche. It's a great concept, gone under. Set in 1942, the film is intended as an homage to Allied sailors and their underground lookouts, seeking to end the stranglehold of German U-Boats on Atlantic shipping lanes. The Germans' trump card ins Enigma, a typewriter like encoding device, the solution to which has eluded the efforts of cryptanalysts. The secrecy of German coded ""traffic"" is thus preserved. Capture an Enigma device and you can change the face of the Battle of the Atlantic considerably. A German sub is crippled at sea and is attempting to rendezvous with another, loaded with replacement parts and mechanics. An American sub is enlisted to masquerade as this repair vessel, board the U-Boat and seize its Enigma machine. Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) commands the sub; and Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaghey) is the exec officer. Tyler has just become an unhappy camper because he didn't get his own command. Dahlgren did not recommend him, basically because, although he's a great submariner, he lacks the hard edge to demand the ultimate sacrifice of his men. Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) is an old World War I vet. Then there's Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber), introduced by admiral as really being ""The man in charge ... what he wants, he gets."" Marine Major Coonan (David Keith), also answerable to Lt. Hirsch, will lead the ""boarding party."" Then there's Seaman Wentz, recruited by Hirsch because he's bi-lingual (German) ... educated at Brown no les Sounds okay, so far, even with the screwed up organization chart. Sadly, it's Dive! Dive1 Dive! from here on out. Seaman Wentz fears his crewmates will hate him if they learn he's part German; the obviously green American crew receives invisible commando training from Keith; we're expected to believe that German mechanics are incompetent (guess Director-writer Mostow never drove a Mercedes), and one German sailor is challenged by a black American sailor, ""Guess you never saw a black man before? Get used to it!"" (Nope, guess he missed the Berlin Olympics where Jesse Owens took Gold and twisted Hitler's shorts in a knot; also missed the two Joe Louis-Max Schmeling fights, too).    We're not picking nits here. We know the film is a composite of many events surrounding Enigma; but give us a break! Give us a sense of the time. Realize that the subs and the effects of submarine life and warfare on human combatants provide all the drama one needs.    Finally, is this a war tale or a coming of age movie? Submarines ... and the most patient audiences have their limitations."

","While in technical terms and background research this film deserves a solid A, it does not excel in the story or cinematography department. Maybe a few scenes touch sensitive nerves with German audiences, but the frequent attempts to use propaganda style devices to label the enemies (i.e. the Germans) as stubborn Nazi villains in a simple black/white style might be in order in a Fifties' movie. U-571 does have its moments, but if you want to see a truly thrilling submarine movie, rent ""Das Boot"". Jonathan Mostow frequently ""quoted"" that film. Compare the similar scenes when the surfaced German sub encounters survivors from a sunken ship, and it will make my point clear on who did a better job; but do read the comments on ""Das Boot"" for a few non-German voices about the film.<br/><br/>U-571 puts way too much heroism into a story like this. Having lost a grandfather in a sub who left behind his diaries I think that few submariners felt heroic when going out there."

","I saw ""U-571"" when it first came out in 2000 and posted the following comment:<br/><br/>""I was deeply impressed by the uniforms worn by the U.S. Navy personnel in ""U-571."" They appeared to be absolutely authentic. I was, alas, a lot less impressed by the story. The heroic sailors in this epic had enough adventures for an entire war. A strong ability to suspend disbelief is needed for one to enjoy this movie. Nevertheless, the special effects were excellent and my seven year-old grandson loved it.""<br/><br/>I recently saw it again on Universal HD and thought that I would extend my earlier comments. First, the 5.1 soundtrack is outstanding. In fact, its sound effects won the Oscar and it was nominated for its overall sound, too. The appearance of the film in high definition was also marvelous. <br/><br/>Its weakness was how badly miscast its star, Matthew McConaughey, was. He is wonderful in light romantic comedies, where his charm and good looks can effectively be brought to bear. Here, though, he plays a hard-bitten careerist naval officer with a skinhead hair cut and no sense of humor. He simply lacked the chops to pull it off. An action hero McConaughey is not.<br/><br/>Bill Paxton was equally miscast but that didn't do too much damage because of his relatively small role. He plays the captain of a submarine that is on a super-secret mission to retrieve the Enigma code machine from a disabled German U-boat. The always reliable Harvey Keitel plays the chief of the boat and, as usual, is very effective.<br/><br/>The photography of the scenes inside the submarines was well done but, it seemed to me, derivative of Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot."" Still, the action sequences at sea were very well done.<br/><br/>Six out of ten."

","It's a submarine movie. It's wet, horrible,and they get depth charged.

It's pure fiction though, and so far from any credibility that I didn't care.  The use of a US Navy seaplane in the closing scene over the Western Approaches though, rather than a Coastal Command Sunderland from Pembroke Dock, did strike me as a little disrespectful though, and for no valid plot reason."
"Oro-Indiano","Null","1","3","4 July 2000"," Leaky... and sinking.
","It's interesting that people (both on this site and elsewhere) seem to have reacted so bitterly against this movie for distorting the historical facts. Is it because there are still people alive who lived through the Second World War?  Is that why it's alright for ""Braveheart"" to be utter nonsense (albeit supremely entertaining nonsense) and for this to be so heavily criticised?  Maybe there's something else.  I wonder... <br/><br/>
It doesn't bother me as much as it seems to many others.  I certainly don't think we Britons can take the moral highground when we're about to put out our own terrible Enigma-related picture - in this case the movie is called ""Enigma"" and no matter how good the acting, direction, production values and score, it will be a dog (with fleas) because the abysmal novel on which it is based almost totally overlooks the fascinating goings-on at Bletchley Park in favour of a cheesy romance and an implausible spy subplot.  Talk about not honouring the memory of those who did the work and won the war... Though frankly, I have never had a significant problem with movies being historically inaccurate - I see it as a necessary limitation of the medium. So fine, ""U-571"" isn't historically accurate, but so what?  Is it any good?<br/><br/>Frankly, it is not.  Clearly a great deal of effort has been put into the production, hence the sets look authentic, the special effects... effective, and even the much-maligned performances from the likes of Matthew McConaughey and Jon Bon Jovi didn't cause me any problems.  However, the script gives us no discernible characters about whom to care, and the sequence of events therein is completely and utterly feeble.  From moment one, it is pretty clear what will happen to our intrepid hero, a man unfit to be a captain because he can't send a man to his death...  Thus there is not one moment of genuine tension to be found amongst the impressive looking depth charges, where there should be plenty - all the more disappointing since writer-director Jonathan Mostow conjured so much tension from nowhere in his previous feature ""Breakdown"".  And, as others have noted, the score is intrusive and distracting, obliterating rather than heightening the drama.<br/><br/>Also, the film is completely humourless.  I'm not saying that this situation would engender wisecracks aplenty from these characters, but there is surely scope in the movie for the occasional moment of levity shared between frightened crewmates?  Anything to dispel the notion in the audience that this is a film taking itself unerringly seriously.  If there were some respite from the empty intensity, I probably would have enjoyed the film and written it off as big, dumb, summertime fun.  But I suspect that this is meant to be taken seriously, which makes it all the more irritating.<br/><br/>""U-571"" is undeniably quite an accomplished film in terms of its visuals, but not many films these days aren't.  Many people will no doubt be able to enjoy it if they can suspend disbelief totally, but for anyone with a brain working in their head, it will cause problems; more so if they use that brain to think about the script rather than the historical truths bent therein.  Others have said it, but I can only concur that anyone hankering for a decent salty yarn and thinking about seeing this movie should see ""Das Boot"" or ""In Which We Serve"" instead.<br/><br/>(4.5/10)"

Direction is dull and script can be described as a collection of missed opportunities.Mostow,Montgomery and Ayer sink the movie when Americans enter the German sub. Authors chose the worst possible path after that potent moment and they turned a suspenser into a massive bore. By the time Americans meet the German destroyer the audience is brought to the brink of a suicide and the climax is particularly unsatisfying. `U-571` has other barely believable aspects.First of all,I can`t believe that a major studio actually released this.I also can`t believe that studio payed or blackmailed so many critics to say affirmative stuff about this movie.I mean flops like `Saving Private Ryan` are in line with this piece of incompetence.I hoped that Hollywood wouldn`t let anyone make another `Saving Private Ryan`but here we go they did it again."

In your opinion, should Steven Spielberg be REQUIRED to choose a story with a British framework when he chooses to make a war-film?  Do you honestly think FOR EVEN A SECOND that by making this film, Spielberg intended to downplay all the pain, suffering, and sacrifice that Great Britain had to endure during this war?  If you do, then you're a fool.  And anybody (British or American) that walks into a film starring Hollywood's finest and expects complete historical accuracy needs to get their head examined.

"notlehs","7","1","3","25 April 2000"," Excellent Action Movie
","Attention would be Hollywood Directors:  If you want to see how a great action movie is done, Watch U-571! The Directing was top notch.  Having seen many other WWII movies, I was greatly impressed with the way the director took some of his plot tools and scenery tools from movies of the past and incorporated them in a newly creative way.  The Cinematography was of extreme high quality.  The Cast was just perfect.  Matthew McConaughey had a great performance, I didn't detect even a trace of Wooderson in him in this role.  He was a deadly serious Naval Officer, and he pulled it off with flying colors.  Harvey Keitel, Jake Weber, David Keith, Bill Paxton, and little known Dave Power, who was excellent as the mechanic, all put in great supporting performances.<br/><br/>On the critical side of things, some will say that it wasn't the true story. They would be correct, it is pretty clear after you watch the movie that the writer/director took the story from several of these missions and put together an outstanding action movie, with some historical relevance, but not actually telling a ""true"" story.  I don't have a problem with this, but some will.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like action movies, I recommend this one."
"jlthornb51","10","2","10","28 April 2015"," Magnificently Rousing & Breathtaking - One of the Truly Great WWII Films
","Academy Award winning motion picture that is an overwhelmingly authentic, incredibly realistic, and simply superb movie that not only is excitingly entertaining but stands as a stunning tribute to those who served the U.S.A. in the WWII Atlantic. What a fabulous film! The director, Jonathan Mastow, is a wonderfully gifted film maker and his script shows magnificently the heroism of the Americans who so selflessly captured the Nazi Enigma machines. In essence, by their brave acts they won the war against the Germans and destroyed the Master Race single handedly. Tremendous special effects and beautiful performances from an all star cast are highlights of this wonderful film but it is the dramatic, tension filled story of the exciting adventures Americans in the North Atlantic that will overwhelm audiences with its power. Certainly in the top ten productions depicting any aspect of the Second World War ever filmed. It is deeply satisfying how recent years have seen this and motion pictures such as Pearl Harbor and Inglorious Basterds pay tribute to true American heroes."

","OK,first things 1st.this movie is almost certainly not completely accurate historically,so if that's what you expect,you'll be disappointed.but if you can put that aside,you should love this movie.anyway,on with the show.this movie takes place during the 2nd World War.it focuses on a small group of Americans and a very important mission,one that would eventually turn the tide of the War.virtually all the action takes place at sea,and i gotta say,the tension in this thing nearly wrecked me.there were times i couldn't breathe and other times i thought i was=as gonna explode.if you like nail-biting down to the millisecond suspense,i can't see how you wouldn't love this one.there's not a lot of room for character development,but that's a good thing in this case.in fact,it may have ruined the movie.it's so well directed,i still can't believe.as a matter of fact as i'm writing this,my nerves are still shredded.this brilliant film was directed by Jonathon Mostow,who also wrote the story and the screenplay.He also directed and wrote both the story and screenplay for ""Breakdown"" another really good film,but nothing compared to this.anyway,i could go on forever,but for sheer tension and suspense,this is hands down,the best movie of its type i have seen,and i have sen some great ones.""U-571"" is off the charts for this rating system,so i'll give it 10+++/10"
"Mr. Movies","10","2","11","22 April 2000"," An unforgettable action classic
","Sometimes in a theater, you become so wrapped up in the action, you feel that you are a part of the action. The suspense, the sound (oh, definitely the sound in this one) the level of reality in the characters, plot, etc. just pulls you right in to the story. And when you realize its just a movie, you sit back and smile to yourself. This happened to me several times in U-571. I mean, I actually felt the action. Director/writer Jonathan Mostow keeps the viewers pleased and on the edge of their seats throughout the film with this amazingly shot, beautifully choreographed and knock-you-dead (literally) sound effects with explosions, depth charges, machine guns, and more.<br/><br/>After reading my review of The Hurricane, you can probably tell that inaccuracies have nothing to do with a movie being great, as well as it is still realistic. The only inaccuracy in this movie is that the soldiers were British, not Americans. Why this was changed, I don't know, but I don't really care either. It is still an amazing film. It was also brought to my attention that this particular event did not actually happen, but events like it did happen. So, I will agree with other critics on calling it a ""gripping piece of historical fiction.""<br/><br/>A team of U.S. soldiers are sent on a special ops mission to sneak aboard a disabled German U-Boat, or submarine, to steal an encryption device that would give the Allies the edge they need to win the war. The U.S. soldiers must trick the Germans into believing that they are comrades and are to help the Germans, and soon kill them all, steal the Engima and get back to their ship, completing the mission. It doesn't quite turn out that way and what happens puts nine American sailors in the most unusual situation and in despair, not only of failing the mission, but losing their lives.<br/><br/>
While the acting itself and the dialouge isn't particuarly memorable, the story and the events in the movie keep it alive and suspenseful. It isn't predictable, and when you think it is going to resolve, it doesn't. One piece of advice: If you don't mind sound being terribly loud, you'll love this. Obviously, I don't mind at all and I think the only way this movie should be viewed is with maximum, shaking-the-ground volume. Yes, my chair vibrated from the sound at times. But the sound is great. Sometimes sound is way too loud, and it just isn't right, but in this it is done very well.<br/><br/>
The characters in the film are very likable and believeable. I particuarly enjoyed the chemistry between all of them, and how well they obviously worked together. The film is an adequete length, and one of the greatest action films of our time. It doesn't have very many slow scenes at all, and if it does they are there for a reason. To make the film real. Character developement is neccessary. What makes people totally loathe films starring Sylvester Stallone and Jean Claude Van Damme is that there is no character developement. Plenty of action, but no actual conflict and no where to go back to for reference. But in U-571, its not like this at all. We feel what the characters feel.<br/><br/>This slightly edges out Rules of Engagement in being the greatest movie I have seen this year. I can sense this being at the top of the box office for some time. The PG-13, and not R, rating helps this out a bit. It is actually good to see a great PG-13 movie, as I have not in a while. Where this was very good, it had its share of flaws, but none very noticable. That's why I give this a sturdy  out of ."

","This one is a better movie than some of those other World War II movies out there. PEARL HARBOR was good, except that it was basically a re-doing of TITANIC. U-571 is much better. It follows a submarine crew as they try to fool a German U-boat into believing that they are friend, not foe, and to get aboard and steal a secreat weapon that the Germans have control of. Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton lead the cast as the officers aboard the American sub. *SPOILERS* There are no women in this movie except for in the beginning sequence. Which is a good thing. If there was, you wonder how their part would have fit in with the rest of the cast. This movie is intense and gripping. It really makes gives off good suspense. The only thing that I found bad was that Bill Paxton's character is killed off within the first half of the movie and he is listed as the film's second leading star! He hardly has a part in the movie! Other than that, I really can't find much to complain about. Just sit back and relax (try to atleast) and get ready for some intense stuff....5/5."

","*Warning - slight plot details revealed....*<br/><br/>It isn't often you enter a cinema and instead of checking your watch you have to check a calendar instead.  Now that doensn't mean U-571 was even more boring than usual, it just means I had to make sure I wasn't in the 50's or 60's watching a film, so effective is this flick in transporting the viewer back to the era of war films, espionage, Cold War shennanigans and so forth.<br/><br/>The plot concerns the retrieval of the Enigma machine, a small typewriter like device that German U-boats used to communicate, using an encryption that the Allies had failed to crack.  Upon hearing that a U-Boat lies crippled after a blistering attack, the Americans disguise one of their own subs as a german u-boat, and attempt to get to the german sub before the enemy can send their own resupply and repair ship to aid the distressed tub.<br/><br/>Their goal is to grab the machine and scupper the ship before the repair ship gets there.  Of course it wouldn't be a film of this nature without the whole thing going wrong, and some of the crew end up on the German U-Boat, fighting for their lives to get home with the precious ""typewriter"".<br/><br/>U-571 is quite simply an excellent film, full of suspense and excitement. The cast are totally top-drawer, with McConaughey giving what is probably the performance of his career, in a role that seems tailor made for him. After years of floundering around with horrible roles that demanded little of him, this film allows McConaughey the scope and range he needs, and he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The special effects are also very well done, with some fantastic underwater photography and digital hokery-pokery adding to the suspensful moments very well.<br/><br/>This one is a definite must for the big screen.  Make sure you find a cinema with the biggest speakers possible, cause those depth charges sure sound great!<br/><br/>10 out of 10.  It's that good."

Anyway, I'm commenting on the reviews that were crying about the Americans portrayed as the one's who captured the Inigma machine, when the British did it. (first?) I took a look at the reviews for ""Sink the Bismark"", and noticed that no one (British) complained about the FACT that a U.S. PBY Catalina, flown by a U.S. pilot, discovered the Bismark after the British lost it. Historically inaccurate, yet a very good movie. So, when I do watch U-571, I will discount the FACT that it is inaccurate, and try to enjoy it for what it is, a fictional movie.

","While this film stirred some controversy regarding its portrayal of history, particular in the media in the UK, this needs to be totally ignored and there was a complete lack of understanding that this was a work of FICTION. Some of the hysteria around the release was to be frank, totally irrelevant and the focus needed to be on whether the film was any good or not as a story.<br/><br/>So, as a old fashioned adventure film, it's very good indeed. The film's plot is simple and straightforward, helped a lot by portraying both the American and German sailors in a rounded and grounded way. Performances are solid all round, with Matthew McConnaughey in good form as the lead, with excellent support from both Jack Noseworthy, Jake Weber and Harvey Keitel in supporting roles. The script by Director Mostow, Sam Montgomery and writer/director David Ayer is lean allows that action to zip along at breakneck speed, supported greatly by excellent and authentic directing on the part of Mostow and excellent photography by Oliver Wood. Wayne Wahrman's outstanding editing, convincing production design with Richard Marvin's thunderously rousing score helps create a thrilling and exciting experience full of tension. Kudos also need to go the to the visual effects crew, who make excellent use of life size submarines and truly excellent sets, to highly effective underwater miniature photography. <br/><br/>However this film's biggest technical credit is the excellent atmosphere created by the excellent sound work, with Jon Johnson winning an Academy Award for his sound editing. His work contributes massively to creating a genuinely real and claustrophobic atmosphere aboard the submarines that feature in the story, and helps put the viewer in the action. He had already worked on a number of high profile films prior to winning the Oscar, including Star Trek Generations, Independence Day, Breakdown (Mostow's previous film as director), and Payback. Subsequent to U571 he would go on to work on other high profile pictures such as A Knight's Tale, The Rookie, Amazing Grace, Captain American, Saving Mr Banks, The Blind Side and Surrogates – yet another collaboration with Jonathan Mostow. <br/><br/>If there are any quibbles, the way the core crew get out of an initial rendezvous with an enemy destroyer does stretch credibility. The fact that a supply submarine would still have space to carry torpedoes also comes as a bit of a surprise, as does the use of a spotter plane that looks suspiciously like a short range Messchermitt (which you would never find out in the middle of the Atlantic – or a German destroyer for that matter – Germany only tended to send it large battleships into this region). However the fun and enjoyment of the film will grab you to will tend to overlook any flaws. <br/><br/>So in summary if you just accept and experience it as a work of fiction, you will have a great time"

They were fooled by the NSDAP because they struggled at each effort to survive after WWI. However, I am not here defending for the war crimes nor stupid crazy nationalism. To be frank, there were enough reasons for the German captain to shoot the Allied sailors at the beginning of the film, because the U-Boat was severely damaged and no more materials were prepared for POWs. Although he repeated certain order from his Führer that no POW should be kept alive, he got no other better choice but to shoot them due to the strict political surveillance at his time and side. Meanwhile, the captain was later saved not because of the humanity of the American sailors but that he might be useful since the Navy special force was then on a German U-Boat. These are my opinions. No offense, but I enjoy democracy..."

","People that suffer from claustrophobia may crack under the pressure of watching the Matthew McConaughey movie ""U-571"" that emphasizes plot over character. Writer & director Jonathan (""Breakdown"") Mostow's white-knuckled World War II suspense yarn concerns a gallant group of U.S. Navy submariners that capture a Nazi U-boat and confiscate its ultra-secret Enigma decoding device. Predictably, this secret mission saga charts a hackneyed but hair-raising course with each cliffhanger situation dwarfing its predecessor until the action concludes with a slam-bang! Combine elements of director Dick Powell's ""The Enemy Below"" (1957) and Wolfgang Peterson's classic ""Das Boot!"" (1981) and you've got a fair idea what Mostow and co-scribes Sam Montgomery and David Ayer set their sights on with this rugged, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred nail-biter. Despite a raft of technical flaws (ranging from errors in naval rank to submarine technology and ultimately history itself), ""U-571"" excels as an above-average, adrenalin-drenched adventure about deep sea heroics. Seldom does a war movie rack your nerves, race your pulse, and make you squirm with such consummate skill as this seaworthy epic.<br/><br/>""U-571"" imitates but never surpasses ""Das Boot."" This aquatic chronicle opens in the North Atlantic as a U-boat sinks an Allied supply ship. An Allied destroyer spots the Nazi sub and seeds the ocean with depth charges. The Germans escape by the skin of their teeth, but their engines conk out on them and all their mechanics are dead, leaving them stranded at sea. When the Americans learn about the disable sub, they launch a last minute mission to storm the ship and steal its Enigma decoder. The Enigma was a sophisticated super-typewriter that the German High Command used to communicate with its subs. If the Americans can steal an Enigma, they can cripple Hitler's wolf pack strategy which has enabled the Nazis to dominate the seas. Not only must they heist the decoder, but they also must either liquidate or take the entire crew hostage, so the Nazis will never suspect their decoder has fallen into enemy hands; otherwise, the Germans would change their codes. Accomplishing that ambitions feat turns out easier said than done.<br/><br/>The U.S. Navy disguises the S-33, one of its vintage World War I submarines, as a U-boat. They hope the Germans will mistake it as one of their own when the rendezvous at sea occurs. Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (""Twister's"" Bill Paxton) skippers this leaky but reliable sardine can, while Matthew (""Contact"") McConaughey serves as executive officer Lt. Andrew Tyler. Tyler champs at the bit for his own command, but Dahlgren has torpedoed his ambitions. The skipper doesn't think Tyler has the guts to order men to sacrifice their lives for their country. Meanwhile, as the architects of this daring 'Trojan horse' night-time raid, German-speaking Lt. Hirsch (Jake ""Meet Joe Black"" Webber) and jaw-jutting Marine Major Coonan (David ""An Officer & A Gentleman"" Keith) come aboard before they cast off. Coonan plans to train the S-33 crew as his raiding party.<br/><br/>""U-571"" does best what only upper echelon war movies can. Neither its heroes nor its audiences get a break. Overwhelming obstacles and even worse odds confound them at every turn. Surprises energize the lean, mean plot, and events wax from bad to worse. The super-charged action never lags under Mostow's taut direction. Pacing is paramount here, and Mostow deep-sizes anything that doesn't enhance the headlong momentum. As the story unfolds, Mostow takes the heroes from the wild open spaces then bottles them and the viewer in the coffin-like confines of a U-boat. The harrowing depth charging sequence that punctuates the final reel will make you clench your teeth and know your fist. Deliberately, Mostow pares characterization to the bone. Of course, the usual stereotypes abound, but a persuasive cast breathes enough lift into them to make them interesting. The hero that wanted to captain a sub doesn't exactly get what he wants, but when he finds himself in command, he manages to make the best of a terrible situation.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey of ""Dazed & Confused"" and Harvey Keitel of ""Bad Lieutenant"" take top acting honors. McConaughey shows more psychological depth and poise here as an angry young sub commander than he has in all his earlier films put together. As Lt. Andrew Tyler, he goes from being an officer scorned to an austere-minded commander. He learns the meaning of being second-in-command, of making decisions based on imperfect information that may prompt combat casualties. (Rent ""The Guns of Navarone"" if you don't get it.) Moreover, McConaughey's physical appearance compliments his performance. Hollywood actors all too often ignore the military rules about haircuts and wear their locks at lengths that no officer would dare. McConaughey has his hair shorn to the scalp. The variety of facial expressions he wears manifests the utter desperation that he feels as a green American submarine commander trapped inside a Nazi sub with nothing but his own wits to keep his crew and himself between a depth charge and a deep place. Meanwhile, cast against the grain in a genre new to him, seasoned actor Harvey Keitel provides solid support as the chief of the boat. He helps Lt. Tyler complete his transition from everybody's friend to a feared and respected Naval skipper.<br/><br/>History buffs and navy specialists may not enjoy ""U-571"" as thoroughly as less demanding moviegoers. Keep in mind, this is Hollywood, not history. This frantic but formulaic actioneer deploys all the standard war movie clichés, but Mostow stages everything with such style and verve that he swamps the flaws. Despite all its blood and gore, a clearly inspirational message underscores ""U-571."" Every character in this weather-beaten yarn 'does their job' and never quits. Similarly, ""U-571"" does its job by never letting you off the hook until its thrilling conclusion."
"AdamWhite1421","8","1","5","18 July 2004"," Give it a try, it may surprise you
","From the start it was obvious that this wasn't going to be the no-brain actioner that I was expecting. Jonathan Mostow has done a good job at creating a respectable World War 2 submarine movie. The scenes on the bridge were as realistic as any other submarine film I have seen, truly giving you the sense of claustrophobia, especially during the depth charge sequences. The underwater shots of the submarines were surprisingly realistic, the way they reacted to the explosions around them was as if it was really happening, count me impressed.<br/><br/>The true winners of this movie however were the main actors. Harvey Keitel and Matthew McConaughey were outstanding, they really controlled the screen whenever they were on. The supporting roles were all very good, convincing me at every turn that they were the characters they were portraying. The only disappointments when it came to the actors was that Jon Bon Jovi couldn't act and Bill Paxton was cruelly miscast, but fortunately their screentime was limited. The biggest error with the movie was the terrible score that did not fit it with the feel of the film at all. It made it feel comical at times instead of rousing. <br/><br/>I know that a lot of people say that the history of the film is inaccurate because it was the British that got the Enigma encoder first but that doesn't bother me. I can overlook historical inaccuracies when the film they are in entertain me as much as this.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Thorsten_B","7","1","5","12 June 2004"," Unsinkable
","What I like best about films is when they manage to be entertaining while at the same thing avoiding to repeat the common clichés of their genres. 'U-571' is quite a good example of how that can be achieved. If you like submarine movies like 'Crimson Tide' but wish that had some more war-like-realistic action packaged into all the thrill, then this one may serve your wishes. McConaughey, though usually not the best of actors (but quite good in 'Frailty'), has one of his more memorable roles. Bill Paxtons part is shorter, but it's always a joy to see him act (not to mention if his acts and directs, as was also the case in 'Frailty'). Harvey Keitel has had much worse parts than this one. The German Thomas Kretschmann is fine too, and Jon Bon Jovi looks twenty years younger than he actually is. Direction and script, given it is typical Hollywood warhorse, are good as well, and Richard Marvins music score offers a congenial essay in orchestral tour-de-force. If you don't mind that the historic reality looked a bit different (but who minds that when watching fiction?), then 'U-571' is one of the better entries into the genre."
"brandy-24","9","1","5","3 July 2000"," U-571 - British Complaints
","It is quite amusing to read about complaints relating to the actual history of the capture of the Enigma machine.<br/><br/>I am English and there has been a bit of a backlash over here. There have been complaints of Americans distorting history to create a good story.<br/><br/>I think it is extremely hypocritical of the English (yes, me) to take this stance as we have made plenty of films about WWII that have distorted the facts.<br/><br/>For instance, I have never seen anyone of any colour at all in any English WWII films! There were plenty fighting the cause for the freedom of the whole planet. (the same could be said about US WWII films too)<br/><br/>The one thing I would take note about in U-571 is that there was a token black man in the crew (shock, horror!). I thought that there was segregation of the whites and coloured throughout the war.<br/><br/>I only learnt of people of colour fighting in WWII 10 years ago when I was 24! This monumental fact is not in any history books, it is not depicted in British and US films.<br/><br/>So shut up, you whinging Brits. We've done the same and possibly worse!"
"trudy.keenan","9","1","5","22 June 2000"," Gripping Action
","I am not particularly a fan of action movies or indeed ""war"" stories. However, I really enjoyed this movie and was gripped by the action throughout.  Although the story has led to some controversy in Britain, it should be pointed out that at the end of the movie, it is stated that it is a work of ""fiction"" and that the Royal Marines did carry out effective missions of this nature prior to the US being involved in the war and in similar events.  Perhaps it would have been more pertinent to place the story later in the war rather than the time period picked, but at the end of the day, the movie does not credit itself with representing an actual historical event, but is only a story based on events.  Personally, I found the story very interesting because I was not aware of such missions being undertaken during the War and whether it was the Royal Marines or the American Marines, to find out that such missions were undertaken is of interest in itself.<br/><br/>Only one other criticism would be that the depth chargers fired at the submarine and that basically skimmed the surface of the sub, would have (I am told on good authority) detonated.<br/><br/>What was intriguing in this movie, although it was presumably shot in something much larger than a submarine, was the feeling that all the action was taking in place in a confined space and I can only admire the directing and editing, which must have been a nightmare.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are not an absolute historical fanatic, and like a good action story, and can live with the usual ""all works out in the finale"" Hollywood ending, this movie is enjoyable.<br/><br/>A very slickly produced film, with a great cast of actors, dialogue and effects."

Their efforts to get through safely, while avoiding numerous depth charges, provided the foundation of the plot.<br/><br/>

","Modern movie critics disdain special effects.  The good movies are quiet and make you think.  They may be true in some cases, but well done f/x can be very good at causing emotion.  Who wasn't thinking ""All Right!"" when the alien spaceship was blown-up at the end of ""Independence Day""?  Who didn't have a tinge of fear during the flight through the meteor shower in ""Armageddon""?  ""U-571"" has many very good tense moments due mainly to special effects.  Watching the deadly depth charges floating down, ready to explode at any moment was edge of your seat.  This movie had several flaws, but these can be overlooked in light of the strengths.  ""U-571"" is not a thinking movie.  Like most summer blockbusters it's meant to cause emotion. I enjoyed this flick and recommend it."

","World War II movies have pretty much become its own genre of film. With everything from beach landings, air battles, and naval skirmishes. Now we get a great look beneath the waves on board a submarine to see what happens when a top secret operation goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>U-571 is the true story of a crew of sailors who are assigned a secret mission: to find and obtain the secret German coding machine known only as the enigma. Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) leads his crew with the executive officer Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) and CPO Henry Klough (Harvey Kitel). Along for the ride are Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) and Maj. Matthew Coonan (David Keith) of the USMC. Along with the crew, they venture out into the Atlantic, disguised as a German U-boat (subamarine). When they surprise a vessel carrying the enigma, there celebration is short lived, those who stayed behind on the boat are blown away by a another German U-boat. Those that were on the boarding party are forced to go into the actual German U-boat they were attacking and use it against the aggressor. With the exception of one German prisoner, they are on there own now and must find a way to get back home or to an ally port. The only problem is they are in enemy infested waters.<br/><br/>What this group must do is follow their new commander in Lt. Tyler and try and stay alive through depth charge attacks and other German encounters. Luckily some of the crew speak German so they get by. Through the madness that was World War II, this boat will become a part of history with the recovery of the enigma machine. If the German don't know that they have it, the US and other allies can intercept other German U-boat's signals and search and destroy. If the German's suspect something, they might change the code and make the operation entirely useless. Lt. Tyler has some big decisions coming up ahead.<br/><br/>The growth of the crew is tremendous and shows a real change in the relationship between officers and their fellow sailors. When these men are faced with a daunting task, they must come together to solve it. McConaughey is marvelous as the Lt. thrown into the captains role. With his student/teacher relationship with Kitel, he learns how to think and lead and to have an solution for every problem that arises.<br/><br/>The movie really does a good job of illustrating the strength of a crew in war fare. Submarine movies are dicey to make. It's a confined space and it can sometimes get repetitive. With a new problem arising every other minute, U-571 will keep you on the edge of your seat. It almost makes you feel like you're in the boat with them. U-571 will cruise right into your movie collection."
"bjones","9","1","6","25 April 2000"," Slightly Off Technically But a Great Action Story
","As a former submarine sailor I had high expectations going in to see this film. I have been aboard all of the types shown here and more, American ""S"" Boats, German ""U"" boats and I served on the crew of a WWII era boat Gato class boat. So, I thought the technical aspects of the crew and their handling of the US sub were pretty well done. The technical advisor should be highly commended for translating some real submarine feel to this film.<br/><br/>The American Navy was not a participant in the early captures of Enigma equipment, although they did capture both a U-Boat and an Enigma machine and books later in the war. That was pure Hollywood, of course, but artistic license prevails. I personally would have liked to see a more modern action yarn of some of the incredible actual exploits of real American subs in WWII. There are many, many stories to choose from. Even a bio-epic of the career of someone like Dick O'Kane would have surpassed this in real action. Imagine a fresh pass at the special effects in something like ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" or ""Up Periscope"". But, I suppose the producers were looking for a fresh angle, which this was. I just thought it opened them up for criticism for diverting from historical accuracy. As for the film:<br/><br/>Actually, the only areas being a bit ""Hollywood"" action-wise were the depth charge attacks (detonations that close in real life would have killed the boat) and the ease with which they assumed the operation of a German U-boat. It would takes weeks to assimilate all of the technical knowledge necessary to operate a strange submarine. A lot of the actual details necessary to plot a firing solution for a torpedo were left out, doubtless for drama's sake. But, other than that it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>One impressive aspect was an attempt to re-create an actual sub vs sub duel. One such incident, nearly identical, actually happened during the Second World War when the US boat U.S.S. Scamp had a close range duel with a Japanese sub. The Japanese boat missed and Scamp sunk her adversary when both boats fired torpedoes at each other simultaneously. In all i know of at least eight other instances where subs sank other subs.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes were very well done. As for the action parts of the movie and the plot, it was well done and well acted. Paxton and McCounaghy were great in their roles as was the impeccable Harvey Keitel. In fact, Keitel reminded me a lot - actually exactly - of a real Navy Chief Petty Officer I worked for once. He was a joy to watch perform as Chief Klough. The others should aspire to be so good one day. A young actor named Jack Noseworthy also did a great job with his role as the German speaking sailor, Wentz. Also noteworthy was Erik Palladino, a reluctant hero. I only wish they had done more with the Paxton character's background; the name Dahlgren is close to royalty in the Navy. And a more fitting tribute should have gone to the ""Trigger"" character played by Tom Guiry. In real life his deed would have warranted at least a Navy Cross, perhaps a Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>But, the real star here were the special effects. It was all very well done and a very enjoyable movie to see, over all. A top quality action film."

","Hey, Brits, if you don't like U-571, why not make your own movie where YOU steal the FICTIONAL German Enigma machine back from the FICTIONAL American sub? I'm sure you would feel a lot better!<br/><br/>Things must be really, REALLY BAD in England if your entire sense of self-worth is wrapped up in rage over a Hollywood movie set more than 60 years ago. <br/><br/>I know things haven't been too good for the United Kingdom since the bumbling appeasement of Adolph Hitler by your democratically elected Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain led to the loss of your colonial empire of unarmed third world countries, but you can't blame America for everything. Don't you have more important things to worry about than a fictional movie about a submarine, like whether it is time to replace David Cameron with someone who knows his ass from his elbow?<br/><br/>Although the story of U-571 is fictional, there was, indeed, a war called World War II, and Americans did, indeed, capture a German sub with an Enigma machine, which doesn't mean that British sailors didn't capture one, too. Germany had lots of subs.<br/><br/>Does anyone in Britain, Mexico, Denmark, etc., know what the term ""fiction"" means?<br/><br/>If a movie is historically accurate it is called ""non-fiction,"" or sometimes a ""documentary"" or ""re-enactment."" A movie that is ""FICTION"" is, by definition, not historically accurate; it is about something THAT NEVER HAPPENED. U-571 doesn't claim to be true; it is fiction. There was no German U-571. Somebody made this story up; he is called a ""writer,"" for example, Stephen Ambrose. He gets paid to write screenplays that entertain us. A person who writes about history is called a ""historian."" He gets paid for not making things up, like David McCullough.<br/><br/>Complaining that a fictional movie is not historically accurate is like complaining that pizza is not fried chicken. If you want pizza, order pizza, and don't go complaining to the restaurant after you get it that it's not fried chicken. Or to put it in more Anglo-friendly terms, if you want bangers and mash, don't order fish and chips!<br/><br/>I suspect that a lot of the negative reviews are by people who didn't actually watch the movie, or at least didn't finish watching the movie. They are certainly by people who confuse current events with history, and because they don't like America's recent foreign policy and military actions, they criticize America over fictional movies about World War II. Makes sense to them. I'll bet these people, most likely children, know next to nothing about the real history of World War II. If they did, they wouldn't be confusing a Hollywood adventure film with historical fact.<br/><br/>The British reviewers complain that they were the ones who captured and broke the Enigma machine code, and U-571 hurts their feelings because it shows Americans capturing an Enigma machine. <br/><br/>If you bothered to read anything about the real history of the Enigma machine, you would know that Polish cryptographers were the first to crack the German Enigma code in 1932, and they presented a smuggled Enigma machine along with their code-breaking techniques to the British shortly before WWII started. <br/><br/>If you want to know more about the true history of the Enigma machine and the actual historical capture of submarine Enigma machines, just watch the ending of U-571; it is in text just before the credits. Or try Wikipedia or the Encyclopaedia Britannica. <br/><br/>One of the things you will learn is that the British and the Americans both recovered enigma machines from German subs, including U-505. Yes, Britain, there was more than one Enigma machine in the world. <br/><br/>These incensed reviewers complain about U-571 not being historically accurate, but then they go making up a bunch of patriotic British bosh and posting it as historical fact, when actually they don't know what they're talking about. At least U-571 doesn't claim to be true, unlike these reviewers. <br/><br/>As to the accusation that U-571 is a knock off of Das Boot, well, this must be so because they are both set aboard submarines in WWII and they both begin with farewell parties, though there do seem to be some minor differences, such as that Das Boot was about a German submarine crew, and U-571 was about an American submarine crew, and most of the crew of Das Boot die when they are bombarded by Allied planes. <br/><br/>If you want to see how ridiculous this ""But it ain't pizza!"" type of reviewing looks, see my review of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - 2005 - the movie."

Is it perhaps, the ensemble cast of top names such as Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel? Is it the production design of the submarine ships themselves? Is it the lighting and cinematography? Or is it the gripping tale of the United States Navy securing the German Enigma? It's all of these things and none of them.<br/><br/>U-571 is charged and driven in a powerhouse action thriller. It's nothing short of extraordinary. It's the most amazing war film I've ever been a part of. Yes, part of -not just watched. U-571 is so authentic, thanks to an retired Admiral of submarining on set, that you feel a part of every explosion when a depth charge shakes the foundation of the submarine.<br/><br/>Production designer Wm Ladd Skinner should be commended for his ability to re-create the submarines and set design to make you feel claustrophobic as much as the actors in the scenes. Along with Oliver Wood's ability to capture the character of the film with a feeling of claustrophobic and unrelenting pressure for these characters.<br/><br/>Let's not forget writer-director Jonathan Mostow, who is truly a marvel director in my mind. He was inspired to write this fictional tale about historical facts by visiting a submarine. He was so fascinated that he created this movie. It's a masterpiece of a tale and while it's not based on or created from a true story, it has a lot of historical accuracies to it.<br/><br/>My most favourite part of this film is watching with the volume way up, the lights all off, and just experiencing the quietness of being in the submarine and just anticipating the characters actions. A ten second shot of Matthew McConaughey saying nothing and just looking simply terrified of those depth charges is amazing to watch. There is not one shot of this movie that is boring. It's paced so perfectly and each character is individually developed with perfection.<br/><br/>While no movie is perfect, U-571 comes intensely close to being a movie that is perfect. Short from model shots and some CGI effects that are somewhat obvious after multiple viewings, this movie is a perfect movie all around.<br/><br/>I can personally watch this movie over and over in a week's time and still not be bored nor sick of it. During it's action sequences, during it's quietness, during it's talking and development periods, this movie is an experience like no other film you've ever seen. If you like war movies, if you like being a part of a movie, you'll love U-571!"

Except for Harvey Keitel and Jack Noseworthy(who was also in BREAKDOWN), the rest of the cast wasn't distinctive, but they were good.<br/><br/>Now to answer some of the criticism of this movie I've read: (1) It's not just that this is a fictional story and not fact, it's that the Enigma is a McGuffin; just something to get the plot rolling.  The real story is the crew trying to survive on the enemy submarine and McConaughey's character learning if he has what it takes to be a captain.  If we found out the characters were also supposed to be able to use the Enigma as well, that would have been a problem, but all they're doing is taking it. (2) If I remember correctly, and it could be I'm not, the German captain who orders his gunman to shoot the survivors on lifeboats says those are his orders from ""the Fuehrer.""  Of course, that's no excuse(given that following orders was the defense for My Lai), but we weren't meant to think, ""Oh, these German bad guys"" because of this scene, especially since they didn't look particularly happy about it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do agree one torpedo blowing up a destroyer was a little ludicrous.  But it does seem to me a lot of comments which nit-pick films like this are by people who go in not caring if the movie works as a whole, but who have to be satisfied about every little detail in the movie, and go through it as if they were studying something under a microscope. People like that, in my humble opinion, need to get a life."

"sddavis63","10","1","9","5 May 2001"," A Perfect 10 In Every Way
","I was glued to the edge of my seat from the start to the finish of this magnificent account of the crew of a US Navy submarine given the mission of boarding a German U-Boat in World War II to capture a top-secret German coding device known as ""Enigma.""<br/><br/>This movie is action-packed and full of suspense. A dull moment never intrudes on your enjoyment of it. Matthew McConnaughy is brilliant as Lieutenant Andrew Tyler. In addition to the sheer excitement of the mission, McConnaughy is the central figure in the coming-of-age subplot. Tyler, Executive Officer of the US sub, was denied a command of his own because his captain (played by Bill Paxton) felt that, when push came to shove, he would be unable to order men to die when necessary. When the captain is killed during the mission, Tyler has to take command and overcome his shortcomings to save as many of the crew as he can. Harvey Keitel offers a strong performance as Chief Engineer Klough, a Navy veteran who has doubts about Tyler's ability, and serves as something of a father-figure to him. Keitel's best scene is undoubtedly his confrontation with Tyler after a particularly powerful display of Tyler's self-doubt. ""Don't you ever say `I don't know' again,"" he says. ""The captain always knows - even when he doesn't.""<br/><br/>Marvelous performances, great directing by Jonathon Mostow who gives the viewer the feel of being on the sub, and a wonderful original score by Richard Marvin all add up to make this the finest movie I've seen in a long time. Recommended for anyone who wants to have some excitement in their lives.<br/><br/>A perfect 10."

The battles between the destroyers and the submarines are realistically and authentically captured.  <br/><br/>Forget the historically inaccurate label some of the comments have cited.

","U-571 is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years, if not ever.  When I first saw it, I hadn't intended to watch it at all.  I glimpsed a few moments, though, and couldn't leave.<br/><br/>I've always loved World War II movies, and personally think that U-571 ranks up there with the best of them.  It was an action movie, but, unlike most, was not made just to be senselessly violent.  It told a definite story.  The production was remarkably well done.  The acting was very good, too, and the characters well developed.  They were honest, good, genuine people who you sympathized with.  If anyone of them died or got injured, you felt bad for them.  You missed them.  When they were sitting in the water, listening for the depth charges, you leaned forward in your chair, listening with them.  That is not a common trait of movies.<br/><br/>The story kept you involved and on the edge of your seat.  There wasn't one moment I felt like I could leave, no matter how short, for fear I would miss something important.  The living conditions on a submarine seemed to be accurate, too.  Now, admittedly, it was the British, and not the Americans, who first captured the Enigma.  However, not once does U-571 claim that historically it was, in fact, the Americans.  They just wanted to tell the story of battles to capture Enigma equipment.  Maybe they felt that the movie's predominantly American audience would sympathize better with an American sub.  Besides, if they'd used a British submarine crew, people would just complain that their accents were too hard to understand. Believe me, I know.<br/><br/>All in all, I would give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you want a documentary about exactly what happened in the war, go find one.  If you want an tense, enthralling dramatization of World War II, see U-571."

He proves that a little bad publicity can't keep a good man down.  Harvey Keitel does a great job as McConaughey's second in charge.  Keitel's character hands confidence and wisdom to McConaughey's Tyler without stealing the show.  Harvey always does an incredible job at being a greatly understated supporting character.  Did anyone else recognize Erik Palladino of ER fame as the unlucky sailor who gets slugged by McConaughey and who later unwittingly creates the diversion that will save all of his pal's lives?  He does a great job doing what he has done so far on ER, be the voice of dissent.  The rest of the crew is made up of less note-worthy, but extremely recognizable young faces.  I was sad to see Jon Bon Jovi's character eliminated so early, I would pay the seven dollars just to watch him eat.  Unfortunately, in this picture he doesn't get to really prove himself as an actor, but if you take a look at his other films, he is one to keep close tabs on.  All in all I loved U-571.

The subject is an important historical lesson from WWII, the German ""Enigma"" machine. It doesn't matter who ""really"" retrieved the Enigma, the important point here is that the strong allied forces of the USA, GB, and many other countries worked together to make the operation a success.

","Forget the history aspect and just accept that this is a completely fictitious story, which it is. In this way you are far more likely to enjoy the very entertaining and suspenseful U-571. Factual accuracy is not a strong point of this film. What is a strong point however is the clever and unorthodox employment of typical submarine film genre tropes, to create a tense, absorbing war drama, with plenty of action and unexpected twists.<br/><br/>The U - 571 is a World War II German submarine boarded by American submariners to capture her Enigma cipher machine. In an extended prologue we see her and her crew attacking an Allied convoy in the Atlantic Ocean, but sustaining badly damaged engines in escaping. A distress call for assistance from the German Navy is intercepted by American naval intelligence, who hatch a plan to use the crew of American sub S-33 to try to steal the Enigma machine coding device and sink the U-571 through subterfuge, before German assistance arrives on the scene.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey is Lieutenant Andrew Tyler the ambitious, but socially popular XO of the S-33, skippered by the ever reliably stoic Bill Paxton playing Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren. But the talented cast list, like the submarines, is long and deep. There is plenty of well choreographed and photographed action both above and below the ocean surface and in and out of various submarines. Challengers to survival for the S-33 crew arrive from depth charge, cannon and other torpedo attacks, as well as those caused by onboard fires and explosions, the machinations of untrustworthy prisoners and even a possible mutiny amongst various sailors.<br/><br/>While there have been better war films over the years, U-571 is a well-paced, stirring and at times exhilarating adventure that never lets up from start to cessation of action. Worth putting your shoulder to the wheel for this one."
"a_chinn","7","0","2","17 September 2018"," Ripping good old fashioned WWII action/adventure submarine tale
","Exciting and suspenseful WWII adventure tale is more ""Where Eagles Dare"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Dunkirk."" Those are all great WWI films, but the former are lighter depictions of war and primarily use this period of history as a backdrop for a ripping good adventure tale than any sort of historical insight. In ""U-571,"" a small group of US navy seamen set out on a secret mission to steal an Enigma machine to help crack German U-boat coded messages. To get the machine, they plan to pose as German mechanics and meet up with a Nazi sub in the middle of the Atlantic and to then hijack the sub like it's the opening of Steven Seagal's ""Under Siege."" Their plan succeeds, except that (SPOILER ALERT!) their own sub gets blown up and they find themselves marooned on a German sub with a skeleton crew. To make things worse, mission commander Bill Paxton is killed and young officer Matthew McConaughey now finds himself in charge and struggling with his new leadership position. When this film first came out, it was at the same time I was getting my school administrator license, so I found the film's themes around leadership and qualities of a good leader interesting. I particularly liked Harvey Keitel's lower-ranking Chief Petty Officer and how he coaches McConaughey on how to be a leader, telling him what the men he's leading need and helping him to step up into that role. The cast also includes Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith, and Jake Weber. ""U-571"" was directed and co-written by Jonathan Mostow, an underrated action director who made the excellent Kurt Russell thriller ""Breakdown"" and the under appreciated third Terminator film. All of his film have echos of classic Hollywood adventure and action films in a way that's a welcome contrast to the a majority of the over-directed Hollywood action films nowadays. Mostow's action feels more Robert Aldrich or Walter Hill than say Michael Bay or Paul W.S. Anderson, which is something I wish we had often in action films. I'll take 70s and 80s muscular action films over bombastic 3-D, IMAX, CGI blockbusters that predominate today's multiplexes anytime. Overall, ""U-571"" may not be all that historically accurate or be some magnum opus about men-at-war, but it is a ripping good adventure story. FUN FACT! The allied forces did steal an Enigma in real-life, except it was the British and not the US to led the daring mission."

","Well this caused a hullabaloo upon release, such a big hullabaloo that it even involved our British Prime Minister, some MP's and eventually President Clinton! I do recall at the time that Britain was not too pleased about the historical rigging so Clinton had to smooth things over, was quite the headline.<br/><br/>Anyway if you can see past the huge numerous historical inaccuracies this wartime submarine thriller is pure adventure and action in a real boys own way. I don't mean to take anything away from the real memory of the maritime war effort but this really is a rollicking good fun film that will grab you and not let go.<br/><br/>A gripping plot surrounding the need to capture the Enigma cipher machine of the German U-boat U-571. The crew of the US S-33 are sent in disguised as a German U-boat to infiltrate U-571 and capture the machine without anyone ever knowing they were there. Of course things don't go to plan and this is where the thrills begin as the US crew fight to remain undetected and escape with their valuable cargo.<br/><br/>At first the film isn't overly impressive visually, seems to cozy, but as the story progresses things seem to get better, probably due to the moisture, sweat, heat and dirt buildup on crew and set. External visuals are lovely as we get many excellent pan shots of a real sub ocean bound with people on board (not sure whether they are the actual actors). <br/><br/>Like other sub flicks ('Crimson Tide') most of the film takes place inside the German U-boat. Not as stunning or large as interior shots in said Scott flick but naturally size/tech varies between subs of then and now. What you do get is a very tight cramped experience which really offers an insight into how these boys lived in these tin cans. Realism is assured and is enough to give anyone a fear of confined spaces, the constant dripping from pipes and seals would do it for me.<br/><br/>Cast is quite a unique mixed bag here too. 80's action men Paxton and Keith are reunited after 'The Lords of Discipline', Keith looking the slick Bond type in his turtle neck and leather coat, a bit clichéd maybe.<br/><br/>Other main leads went to hard man Keitel alongside wannabe action hero/romcom regular McConaughey. British actor Weber struggled to maintain his US accent which unintentionally gave me some chuckles. Of course one noteworthy element was the inclusion of Jon Bon Jovi in the cast, I think his first major role in a proper major flick. At the time most did ask why they couldn't have found a real actor for the role, his presence certainly made you wonder about the films credibility before release, a rock star in a legitimate war film?<br/><br/>So with a mixed bag of various actors from various genres the film still managed to be one of the best war thrillers I've seen in a long while. Like I said the sub interior sequences are perfect and capture the hellish mood whilst the few special effects are nicely done and not over the top. Musical score doesn't quite hit the emotions as well as other war films, not overly memorable. <br/><br/>Despite the Americanisation of the truth this film still wins and delivers a ripping yarn alongside a good dedication to the real men of the time. Love the films poster also. <br/><br/>8/10"

There is something about submarine movies which will always be appealing. The tension, the distance from the rest of the world, the fear which underlines every operation under water. All in all this movie had a good setting, what I referred in the title as ""the frame"". The final package is still far from impressive, it delivers too much action and too little subtlety. Some scenes are too excessive and far from real, like every scene where lots of bullets are fired inside the submarine. And the ending had too much of a cliché.

I think almost the entire white uniform party scene and all of the ensuing ""I'm bitter because I was passed over"" and ""You must behave like Captain if you want to be one"" bits could be removed – edited out – and the rest of the movie would perk up quite a bit.<br/><br/>With hindsight, not a good use of two hours."

","Lovers of ""Das Boot,"" get in line and see ""U-571."" Submarine warfare has returned to the big screen, and it's a non-stop thriller! While not a true story, it's still a lot of fun. And besides, who goes to a summer action movie to actually learn something?<br/><br/>The set-up is genius. A U.S. Navy Submarine led by Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) is given a crucial assignment. Steal a code machine from a crippled U-boat (German submarine). Everything goes according to plan, except the U.S. sub is destroyed by a nearby German vessel, and the boarding party, led by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) is left to command the broken sub.<br/><br/>This is an action movie, and it doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. In a movie like this, all that matters is action, action, and more action. Suspense is desired, but a movie can succeed without it. Fortunately, ""U-571"" has both, and in great amounts. The story starts out slowly to help us get to know the characters, but once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Ever.<br/><br/>""U-571"" is populated by a number of good performances. In general, I don't like Matthew McConaughey. In the right role, he can be effective, but usually he just mails in performances in formulaic romantic comedies. But ""U-571"" calls for him to carry the movie on his own, and he delivers. Andrew Tyler is a man who thinks he knows what to do, but it turns out he has a lot of learning to do. He can alternately be like a father figure and a tough-as-nails, do-what-I-say-or-else commander. McConaughey hits every note. He's aided by his CPO Henry Klough, ably played by Harvey Keitel. Klough is a man who does his job no matter what, and expects everyone to do the same. He's the veteran among the crew, but he knows his place, and he stays there. Jake Weber is suitably mysterious as the man who knows everything about the code machine, but doesn't talk about it unless he has to. This is a guy who spends his time behind a desk instead of out in the field, so being in an situation is not something he's used to (then again, nor is to for anyone else, but they're submarine sailors, and he isn't). Rounding out the young (though severely underdeveloped) cast are David Keith, Jon Bon Jovi, Tom Guiry, Will Estes, Jack Noseworthy, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson, Erik Palladino and Dave Power. All are likable and perform ably. Thomas Kretschmann is the German hostage, but again, he's not that developed.<br/><br/>One of the reasons that ""U-571"" works as well as it does is that director Jonathan Mostow is able to create a claustrophobic atmosphere. Any personality deficiencies are not as problematic because we feel right like we're there with the crew. But Mostow's skill doesn't end there. He keeps things moving, and the audience never has a break from the tension. Just as one situation closes, another one is right around the corner. In retrospect, this decreases credibility, but for the constraints of a two-hour movie, it doesn't matter. Besides, you won't be thinking about it while you're watching it.<br/><br/>Comparisons to the classic WWII submarine movie ""Das Boot"" are unavoidable. In terms of quality, Wolfgang Peterson's classic is better, but for those who don't have the time (or can't stand subtitles), ""U-571"" does the trick. Or if you're just looking for a two-hour jolt of adrenaline, this movie will work for that too. Either way, ""U-571"" doesn't disappoint."

","One of my all time favourite movies is Das Boot. I tend to like all movies with submarines and this movie is no exception. I guess it could be my fascination for underwater vessels. When I rate a movie I often choose to rate it by its entertainment value. This movie entertained me a lot. It had good action, good suspense and good casting. So if you like naval war movies then I can recommend this one. However, if you're looking for a new Das Boot then you should keep looking, U-571 is more or less a pure action movie.

","I understand how upset many people are at the creative license used in this movie. I am very proud to be English/Scottish/and Irish American. The movie DOES give full credit to the HMS Bulldog and her crew, as well as all other British crews who captured Enigma Machines before we did. I certainly think that, in no way, shape, or form was there an intent at stealing the credit from the Royal Navy or the factual dates of British success would not have been put into the film. I am of a mind that, I don't care which Allied country captured the machine as long as one of us did. I also understand (and this IS FACTUAL), that not only were not all Nazis bad, but many hated Hitler and the Third Reich and were genuinely good men (just look at the attempts on the Fuhrers' life). There were U Boats in the Gulf of Mexico and true accounts of U Boat crews giving food and rations to crews of sunken vessels in rafts after sinking their ships. There were also accounts of Nazi sailors coming ashore on American Soil for food and entertainment, while in the Gulf. The bottom line is, the good guys (all allies and Germans who hated Hitler and the Third Reich) won, and freedom-loving people the world over have the veterans of all allied troops and their bravery, courage, and sacrifice to thank for our freedom today."

A destroyer from the German navy sinks their own sub, and the US Navy team is left to return safely to base in a crippled German U-boat. To make matters worse, the Germans have gotten wise to their plan, and are making efforts to put the crippled U-boat to rest permanently, at the bottom of the ocean. Depth charges are dropped every few minutes, just to shake the viewers up, and attempts are made to make the U-boat an effective weapon to use against the destroyer trying to sink the craft.<br/><br/>The cast includes Matthew McConaughy as the leader of the US team, and ably backed by Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, and David Keith.

","The ""unreachable"" air valve in the bilge. What reasonable sailor would not have simply used a belt or a bent piece of wire to reach it the first time? Sure, his air line was short but he could have extended his reach a meter or more with just a bent piece of wire, looped cable or almost anything and slipped it over the handle which we saw was pulled toward him a quarter of a turn to open it to air flow. This is a major stretch of the imagination that someone would have failed and reported this to his commanding officer and then went back down to his death when incoming rounds destroyed the encroaching pipes as later seen which enabled him to reach it but to be trapped and die. To me, it is just a display of total abandoning simple logic."

Perhaps if the script centered on something else it wouldn't disturb so many people. It really is a great action/war movie.

Harvey Keitel is the chief petty officer, an old salt who's seen action in WWI.  Jon Bon Jovi plays one of the seamen.

","Well, this is my first time reviewing a movie in IMDB. I apologise if I inadvertently make some mistakes in my comments.<br/><br/>I came to be interested in U571 because of Director Jonathan Mostow (I haven't figured out how to pronounce his last name: Mos Tow or Mos Tao as in ""Moscow"") Anyway as we all know he directed the latest Terminator sequel, and the movie got good reviews.<br/><br/>I can't recall the last submarine story I've seen, but Crimson Tide comes to mind, and The Hunt for Red October, though I can't really remember their stories.<br/><br/>U571's cast also attracts me. We have Bill Paxton, though his role is quite minor, Matthew McConaughey (I still have difficulty spelling his last name right!), Harvey Keitel, David Keith among others. And of course, Jon Bon Jovi. His character didn't last long I guess, but it's good to see him in a movie. Keeps me wondering was that really him, as I'm sure many of his fans will too.<br/><br/>The Story (Possible Spoilers) I don't know much about war history, so this kind of movie helps give some insight into the war. Though the story is fictional, the Enigma does exists and the British did capture it.<br/><br/>The story is tense in that it's about infiltration and covert ops, like a mission impossible (which is possible anyway). Capturing the Enigma is one thing, and being stranded in an enemy vessel with no way to radio for help is another.<br/><br/>Scenarios whereby you're so close to an enemy without them realising yet who you are, always puts you at the edge of your seat. The slightest wrong move and all hell breaks loose and your cover blown.<br/><br/>Though our heroes are expert submariners, the enemy vessel's control is all in German. And there are only two of the team that can read the language. That's the first hurdle they have to cross.<br/><br/>One thing I'm quite annoyed is that how come the Uboat keeps getting depth-charged? Couldn't they have steered away from the Destroyer's path or something? I'm no war expert, so pardon my ignorance.<br/><br/>Finally, it is amazing to see how just one well-directed torpedo could damage an entire destroyer as such.<br/><br/>Was it my imagination? Or did I notice a resemblance in the sound track for the film to Saving Private Ryan? ;)<br/><br/>I look forward to Terminator 3 once it hits the shelves!"

"bob the moo","Null","0","2","13 July 2003"," An enjoyably tense war movie despite the obvious issues
","The Atlantic is a hunting ground for the German U-Boats as the British and Allied forces are unable to crack their codes and their convoys are easily picked off.  When a U-Boat is damaged it sends out a distress signal to Berlin for rescue.  The signal is intercepted and the Royal Navy is sent out in a S-boat to reach the U-Boat first, board it, claim the Enigma machine that allows the U Boats to translate the code, sink the boat and return to base.  They board the U Boat but the S boat is attacked and sunk by another U Boat leaving some of the crew on board the U Boat.  With no other way to transport the Enigma home they take control of the U Boat and make the perilous journey home.<br/><br/>I approached this film on the back of knowing about the real life scenario and must admit to being a little snotty about the depiction of the men involved in this part of war history as Americans rather than British.  To get it out of the way, those involved were actually of the Royal Navy and these events happened several months before America got involved in WWII.  I felt that, because the film was an American film then let them do what they want  as long as they acknowledge the real situation (which they do just before the credits).  I'd rather the film was made and audiences inspired to find out more rather than way for the British industry to have the capacity to make such a film.<br/><br/>So away from the controversy (which is understandable after all) the film is actually a solid war movie that mixes silent tension with moments of action (to keep the punters happy).  It is by no means a perfect film but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  It manages to move along quite well and do the traditional thing of having men valiantly giving up their lives etc for their country.  It is not as amazing as I'd have hoped, but I must admit that it is because I'm used to seeing American movie stars doing amazing things  so this felt very ordinary.  I countered this by thinking of English sailors doing the same and that enabled me to feel more involved in the film  perhaps a cast of unknowns (British or American) would have been better.  However I still enjoyed the film as a solid war thriller.<br/><br/>The cast is probably too all star for it's won good.  It has a mix of well known named as well as familiar faces.  McConaughey is a good lead and has a more complex character than he might have had in a film such as this. Harvey Keitel has less to do than I had hoped, as did Bill Paxton.  Happily Bon Jovi is quickly forgotten and the American crew of the U Boat are all pretty good despite their lacklustre credits outside of this film.<br/><br/>It may take extreme liberties with history and it may over-egg the action scenes somewhat (witness a destroyer go up like a firework factory with just one torpedo) but it is an enjoyable thriller anyway.  Yes the flag waving side of it may be wrong in terms of the flag, but at least it does acknowledge who really was responsible for this heroic part of wartime history, albeit it as part of the end credits.  Despite all this, as a film it is quite enjoyable and that's that.  Watch this as a movie  if you want the real story and the real people involved then there are plenty of good books and documentaries out there on this subject."

","(major spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Based on a true story, it is the plan to get hold of the German code machine Enigma by  capturing it from a U-boat.  This feat was actually pulled off by the British Navy  by scuttling  a  sinking sub already abandoned by its crew.  But as this is a US movie Hollywood takes over : the boarding party becomes entirely US and movie turns into some high adrenalin but ludicrous adventure caper.<br/><br/>U-571 is very reminiscent  to  those   propaganda movies made during WWII to boost morale.  It's got all the simplistic ingredients and stereotypes: on the one hand you have the Germans : Nazi b*****ds all single one of them, either  fanatics or cowards, and ofcourse  very lousy shots.    Just to make case in point that they are no good ,  at the very beginning of the movie, they machinegun a lifeboat full with survivors of a just torpedoed cargo.<br/><br/>On the other hand the US sub crew : resourceful, smart,  brave, self-sacrificing, multicultural (even including a  black cook) and above all : they can hit anything, no matter the odds.<br/><br/>The basic premise may ring true historic wise, the rest of the movie is ludicrous. Just imagine this : the US crew, down to about half a dozen, manning a crippled German sub, succeed in sinking another U-boat and a German destroyer !  This would even be deemed too wild by WWII propaganda standards. So as for sheer accuracy and credibility the script is sub (haha)-zero . Even the assault to capture the U-boat is  ridiculous, attacking with mere handguns  through the various parts of the submarine while Jerry is waiting for them with  machineguns.<br/><br/>I also have to admit I couldn't care much for the American crew, except for David Keith as a though OSS-officer, but  he gets sadly  offed mid-picture. Matthew McNaughty is pretty annoying as the leader,  so it is  a 'controlled' Harvey Keitel, as the CPO, who is the most likeable of the characters.<br/><br/>I will admit though that  U-571 is  rather fast-paced  and reasonably well directed  so during the movie  you tend to forget most of the improbabilities. So director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-scripted and produced, does an above average job, but if it was sufficient to hand him the job to helm `Terminator III' remains to be seen.<br/><br/>Many reviewers refer to the Germanmade `The Boat' as the prime example of the quintessential submarine movie.  An excellent choice undoubtedly, but let me (as also IMDb does)  point to a  US flick from the fifties: `The Enemy Below' which starred  Robert Mitchum and Curd Jurgens and was directed by actor Dick Powell.  This is a solid and realistic account of a duel on the high seas between a US destroyer and a U-boat .  It stays clear of the usual  clichés and Nazi stereotyping (quite an achievement for US movie from 1957) and builds up to  a very exciting climax.<br/><br/>Conclusion :  U-571 is  fairly entertaining until you begin to see through the enormous plot holes and the sheer incredibility of the whole thing."

This is a very good action movie that holds your interest from the opening scenes to the end. The story plot is simple and focused. What many viewers do not comment concerns the sub-plot involving the ruthless moral courage the executive officer had to demonstrate in order to have an opportunity to become a commander of a submarine.<br/><br/>If you are only interested in absolute historical fact don't watch it -but if you want to be entertained by a great action movie by all means see this film.<br/><br/>Oh yes - a couple of other points for the naysayers - there were dozens of recorded instances of German submariners machine gunning hapless sailors and civilians in the water - if you don't believe it just do some research involving the lesser war crime trials at Nuremberg as well as numerous other official documentaries on this subject. Secondly, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" - a great classic, was no where close to being historically accurate - yet there are very few scathing political comments on that film. Grow up historical anger mongers - just enjoy this film for what it is -  a solid adventure, well written, well directed, with good cinemaphotography."

","I'm reviewing this action film because it's showing on cable right now and I'm reminded what a piece of throwback garbage it is. I won't comment at all on the effects, because the state of the art is good enough for all but critical professional eyes. I also won't comment on technical errors concerning the Kriegsmarine, its U-boats and their crews. Why bother? There are always some artifices necessary to convey the central plot situation, in this case a depiction of the Allies' capture of vital information about German naval codes.<br/><br/>No--what I'm talking about is the fact that historical standards for a film of this kind have gone way up. Need I mention recent titles? This film distorts or invents on most major points, especially those of who captured which vessels. That's been covered elsewhere and in detail, and I don't blame the British or the Germans for heaping scorn on the film. The treatment of the Enigma machine itself, about which many have heard, but most are still ignorant, was likewise so simplistic as to be worthless for anyone but a 12-year-old.<br/><br/>Today we are sophisticated enough to make movies that both entertain and inform. It's too bad this film does barely half the job."

","I thought U571 was pretty cheesy and definitely very Hollywood. Overall though it was a fun movie to watch if you aren't looking for much in the way of brain matter. In fact it had me laughing out loud in some spots. The part that made me laugh the most was when a German destroyer appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the Atlantic! -a poorly modeled one at that.<br/><br/>It is most certainly 90% made up with a 10% grain of truth and I wish I could see a little restraint from our European friends when it comes to telling the facts of what actually happened. Yes the British did in fact get their hands on a few Enigma machines and their ciphers (one from Poland in the opening days of the war and several more by the end) but the US Navy also captured one when U505 was forced to the surface and boarded. Please read about this! Don't write about historical events being true or not unless you know what you're talking about!

","Before starting my own critics about the movie, I would like to say that U-571 was the first movie of submarines I've seen in many years.  My last one was ""The Hunt of the Red October"" (that's undre which name I know it).<br/><br/>Ok, in a very short tagline the movie was good but, like one user already commented, the cast didn't represented REAL sailors and, even more important, the history was 100% innacurate.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy (British navy) was the first allied force to get a Enigma code machine and, thanks to them, the war drasticaly changed it course. Wasn't the americans who did that for the first time.  As a matter of fact, as I'm starting to recall some movie parts, the ""allied"" forces are not named in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Seems like USA was in one side, Germany in another and the British in another one.  I truly don't know if history was exactly as that, and British and Americans didn't consider themselves in the same Allied group, but at least that's not what is shown at this movie were a selfish nation makes an heroic move to save the world... once more.<br/><br/>The submarines didn't gave me the impression of an aislated enviroment, and seemed extremely big and even short.  Only 15 meters from the main control room to engines room?.<br/><br/>Good movie, great production, excelent FX (despite the movie was filmed entirely in an out-sea tank), nice cast (I would personal prefer other actors).<br/><br/>I would personaly recommend it to see a good movie a friday's night, and is very interesting to see because the topic of the movie is really well picked, since the recovery of the Enigma code machine really changed the direction of the Wolrd War II.<br/><br/>Thumbs up!"

","If, by chance, this film doesn't send your pulse and blood pressure up into the red, you have nothing to worry about. You're already dead! If, as some pundit said, adventure is some other guy or guys in a hell of a fix a long way from where you are, then this film represents adventure with a very large capital A. Briefly, the crew of an old S-boat (late WW1 vintage submarine) in 1942 is charged with capturing a disabled German U-boat in the Atlantic in order to get the coding machine known as Enigma. With this, the allies would be able to track U-boat positions and deployments, and slow the terrific loss of allied shipping. They do get control of U-571, but their own sub is sunk by another German sub, forcing the boarding party to save themselves in the all-but-sinking U-571. They manage to do so in spite of a later attack by a German destroyer, and keep U-571 afloat long enough to get rescued in the western approaches.<br/><br/>I won't even attempt to detail the horrific ordeal of these guys portrayed in a non-stop succession of special effects not seen in any previous submarine flics. Not just the sea and hostile enemy vessels assail the remnant of the S-boat's crew, but also there is dissension in their ranks, a commanding officer liked but not entirely trusted by all the crew, and the captive German captain of U-571 who manages to get loose. When the sinking U-571 begins the plan to sink the attacking German destroyer, you will certainly inch forward on the couch! Not just the amazing special effects but ingenious and seamless editing add to the non-stop thrills. The fact that the characters are believable and well portrayed adds to the general quality.<br/><br/>But, you must keep in mind that the story thus unfolded is fiction. Allied crews did retrieve Enigma machines from U-110 in 1941 and U-505 in 1944, but not in the way shown here. I would venture the opinion that what we are shown would have been impossible, though some submarine crews did manage to survive some really difficult situations, both in peacetime and war. Some critics have complained that the scene early in the film showing the crew of U-571 machine gunning a boatload of allied survivors is manipulative. Maybe so, but fairly late in the war in the South Atlantic the crew of a German sub did just that to the crew of a merchant vessel they had sunk. It is a well documented case. <br/><br/>Regard this film as a high adventure tale with convincing special effects and you should find it enjoyable. Regard it as history and you will have trouble suspending your disbelief."

","Although this film has been out for some time I just saw it.  I had just recently seen ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" and I liked it well enough to want to see another submarine movie.  It is hard to really make an accurate comparison of the two movies because I saw K-19 on the big screen and I watched U-571 on my laptop computer.  I honestly believe the only way to really appreciate a film is on the big screen.  However, with that said, I would recommend this movie to people who like military movies.  Women might not particularly like it because there is no romance in this movie.  This is not a chick flick; It is a man's movie.<br/><br/>My review is this:  the movie is a fictional movie based on real events which took place prior to and during WWII.  Many of us who have watched the History Channel or Discovery know that the Enigma coding machines used by the Germans during WWII were very difficult to decipher.  Messages intercepted often took many days to decode.  It was absolutely imperative that the Allies get hold of an Enigma machine so as to help give us an extra advantage in the war.  This movie is about that endeavor.  Of course, getting the machine had historic value but that, by itself, would not have made a really exciting movie.  So this movie has lots of action and elevates normal men to the status of heroes.  We all like that.<br/><br/>Beyond that we see the transformation of a young Naval Officer, Matthew McConaughey from a graduate of the Naval Academy to a leader of men.<br/><br/>As an ex-military man I would recommend this movie to any person who likes movies with a military theme."

","An American submarine crew sets out to capture a disabled German U-boat in order to steal the enigma coding machine away from it...<br/><br/>With a plot starting like that, one knows what to expect: exaggerated bravery on the part of the Americans, treacherousness on the part of the Germans, lots of explosions, sadness over the death of a crew mate, heroical speeches in critical times, and a romance. Well, this movie contains most of the clichés of its genre, but it doesn't indulge into them too deeply. For starters, there isn't any love story !<br/><br/>We are immediately thrown into the action, which more or less manages to sustain itself throughout the movie. There is one major subplot, about the captain who still needs to prove himself worthy to command a submarine. But of course he passes each test imposed upon his commanding abilities with great splendor, with the coaching of veteran Harvey Keitel.<br/><br/>During their hazardous journey, the crew will encounter another German U-boat, a reconnaissance aircraft and a torpedo hunter, while they are at the same time hindered from the inside by a renegade German crew member from the first U-boat. The biggest merit of this movie is that all those events follow each other rapidly, without the tension being broken down by tedious discussions in between.<br/><br/>A few scenes are annoying because of their simplistic portrayal of the good guys versus the bad guys. Throughout the movie it seems to be a scientific fact that anything which contains Germans can be blown to smithereens with one single, well-aimed shot. The U-boat in which the Americans flee, however, immediately receives some kind of Divine protection, effectively shielding it from torpedoes and tons of depth charges.<br/><br/>And then there was this obligatory, but totally superfluous scene in which the Germans show how evil they really are. You probably know this cliché: in order to make it acceptable for the heroes of a movie to mercilessly slaughter the bad guys, the script writers always work in a scene in which the antagonists ruthlessly and without provocation murder a bunch of innocent and mostly unarmed people. In this case, the already damaged first U-boat encounters a lifeboat full of survivors from a sunken ship, who seek refuge on the submarine. Unfortunately, they hadn't taken into account the blood-lust of the screenplay authors...<br/><br/>But all in all the pace of the action is quite fast, and doesn't give the viewer a lot of time to even get irritated at some clichés or inconsistencies. And Harvey Keitel keeps the acting on the level. So as an action movie I would rate this a 7/10, minus one for the seemingly unavoidable American patriotism: 6/10."

","Before you mouth explodes with criticisms, remember one thing: this film was not made to be a heavy, fact-reliant war account. It was made for pure entertainment, and it fulfills all its demands in that area. Forget the 'Americans winning the war' content (which Hollywood was releasing over 50 years ago in films like 'Objective, Burma) and the improbable shots of torpedo near misses, and view it as it should be viewed. The action scenes are good, and there is sufficient suspense to keep you awake. Its many inaccuracies weigh it down, but ignore them: this is not a film to be taken too seriously.

"chrisbrown6453","8","0","2","19 June 2002"," Lots of good action, good acting, made you feel like you were really inside a submarine.
","I must say I rather enjoyed U-571. I'm not so sure about the story. Not that I don't believe it was based on reality, just that there really wasn't a strong plot. It was basically a testosterone flick that went from action scene to action scene with a thread of plot to help it along. I think if there had been a little more investment in the characters and the dialogue, this would have been a great movie. As it is, it's just a really good movie.<br/><br/>
Matthew McConaughey plays Lt. Andrew Tyler. Apparently he was supposed to be commander of his own sub, but because of a lack of recommendation from his superior officer Captain Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), he will not get his own sub. It's at this point that you can tell that dialogue was not taken into consideration a lot in this script. We get the old ""you need to have the heart to do something you don't want to do"" speech that I've heard before. This means of course that this exact thing will come into play later on in the film, and something bad is going to happen to someone we're supposed to care about. Anyway, they get informed that they are going on a secret mission. A Nazi U-boat is stranded at sea, and the Americans are supposed to head out to the sub before the Germans get there, and steal an important German encoding machine known as the ""Enigma"". With this machine the Allies will be able to intercept and understand German secret messages. However, at the end of the movie you find out something that had you known it before seeing the movie, may have slightly changed your opinion of what they were doing, and how important it really was. Anyway, it's not giving away too much to say that when they arrive at the U-boat, things go very wrong. The Americans end up on the U-boat, and need to find a way to save themselves before the Germans find out what happened. Along with McConaughey and Paxton, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi also star in this film. I generally am not a big fan of Harvey Keitel, but I didn't hate him in this movie. Most people probably won't even recognize Bon Jovi in the movie, but he did a good job. Overall the acting was very good in this movie. Now I have never seen the highly acclaimed film Das Boot but I understand that it's the benchmark for claustrophobic submarine films. I can say that U-571 accomplished the same goal. I felt like I was trapped inside that sub right along with the actors. It makes for a very disturbing and scary feeling while you're watching. Every time there was an explosion, I swear I could feel it in my seat (which may be more of the sound in the theater than anything else). The director, Jonathan Mostow, did a very good job of making you feel like you were part of the action. The camera movements were very first person NYPD Blue-ish with a lot of shaking cameras and close up of the sweat on the faces of the actors. I thought that some of the scenes were very tense which was exactly how you were supposed to feel.<br/><br/>
So I guess the biggest problem I had was with the plot. Yes I realize that getting the ""Enigma"" was important, but that occurred early on, and it then became a fight for survival. But I got lost trying to figure out where exactly there were, and how much danger they were actually in. At one point they say they're headed straight for Nazi waters, and then all of a sudden the movie ends. And early on they say they can't destroy the Nazi ship that's headed towards them, and then all of a sudden they think they can. Weapons seemed to come from nowhere on the ship. I felt there were a few too many holes in the story to make this a truly great film.<br/><br/>
Overall I thought for what it was, a guy film, it was really good. If you like war movies, if you like guy films with a lot of action, a lot of sweat, a lot of yelling, and a lot of explosions, I think you'll like U-571."

Too bad, because I was really looking forward to this film. <br/><br/>Detractors up here have also complained that Holywood has co-opted a partially Canadian story- the capture of a German Enigma coding machine. Heaven forbid that the US ever acknowledges that Canada has a contribution to world history! But I digress...<br/><br/>Editing problems also spoil the film: the marine major, Jon Bon Jovi's character, and all the captured German submariners disappear without any narrative acknowledgement within the film. We do know courtesy of Mr. Bon Jovi that his character's demise was edited out to preserve the PG-13 rating in US theatres. Presumably that is what happened to the rest as well. All in the name of cranking up the action quotient. <br/><br/>""Das Boot"" spends considerable time dealving into the characters on the U-Boat. U-571 creates one superficial character arc for Matthew McConnahy, then devotes the rest of the film to one submarine cliche after another. I took the liberty of watching Tony Scott's ""Crimson Tide"" a few days ago: it too trots out the cliches, but because the film also layers character conflict and some social commentary, it actually succeeds.<br/><br/>

Just make sure the theater has a good surround sound system, as gunfights, exploding depth charges, pipes bursting, and other such events will give the speakers a workout. Unfortunately, while it claims to be ""character driven"", the characters are awful shallow and do not react the way they should. Several times, they are given orders, and always hesitate and question their new commander. Veterans will especially cringe at a scene in which a low - level crew member directly contadicts his commander and tells him to fire on a plane. Such action in real life would get him shot. Then there is the virtually indestructible sub, unsubtle foreshadowing (especially the egg metaphor), broken equipment that miraculously works when needed, and the question of why such an important undercover mission would be handled by a green crew that has only one German - speaking member.

","U-571 is the horrorific tale of being trapped in a enemy u-boat during World War II.  Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) has his crew run and operate a very worn down German submarine while trying to protect a top secret enigma<br/><br/>machine that will decode German messages.  What's bad about being on this sub is that they are in a German sub, where they can't understand most of the things written on there.  And the sub before, is in very bad shape that it's barely holding itself together. Along with Lt. Tyler, there's Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) a old ""sea-dog"" who has been in a submarine in battle before in World War I.  Lt. Pete Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi) who has worked with Lt. Tyler and befriended him before. Lt. Hirsch (Jake Webber) who is from the government, who's main concentration on the mission is the enigma machine.  And Marine Major Coonon (David Keith) who is leading and training the men into combat by taking over the German sub with the enigma machine.  The crew is led by Capt. Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) who feels that this is a important mission, and that if they fail, the U.S. could lose the war. U-571, is quite a outstanding film from director Jonathan Mostow.  He succeeds much better than he did with his previous film, BREAKDOWN.  Is this film a historical fact tale of the second World War?  I wouldn't bet on it, but is it a suspenseful action-thriller?  You bet it is!  I haven't been this intense with a submarine movie since Wolgang Petersen's 1982 classic, DAS BOOT.  Both films have the men waiting below, as enemy battleships sit above dropping explosions onto them.  What's rather ironic is that the first couple of minutes into this film, reminded me a lot of DAS BOOT, with the German sub and the Germans speaking their native tounge. From start to finish, this movie does grab the viewers attention.  It shows why we should root for the U.S. sailors, and boo the German sailors, without giving us any cliche.  And one is so into the movie, that they too would care on what happens to these sailors throughout their mission.  I was so tense during the movie that I almost pulled off the arm rest of my seat.      The acting in the movie is good, McConaughey is good, as usual, so is Paxton, Weber, and Jovi.  But I have to give special kudos to Harvey Keitel. He is a pro at acting, and having him act along such new faces as McConaughey and Jovi, it shows that he still has his acting touch, after twenty-five years. But I will give writer and director Jonathan Mostow full credit for U-571.  He really made a intelligent and suspensful action thriller, that is not a rip-off of DAS BOOT, but more like a homage to it.  I sure he was watching DAS BOOT over and over while making this film.  Because he managed to pull off the same tension in a sub film, that Wolfgang Petersen did in his film.  Don't miss it!!  ***** (out of five)"

He was later tried for this crime and executed. German submariners were, by and large, conscripts, not fanatical nazis, and doing the same dirty work our subs were doing in the pacific theater. This is a FACT attested to by Admiral Nimitz at the nuremberg trials, testifying in BEHALF of CinC Uboats Karl Donitz. I guess the Germans had to be so sinister for this plot to work. II. defiance of the laws of physics: If anyone can tell me how a single torpedo fired from a stern tube at the narrow silhoutte of a destroyer can stop the destroyer cold in its wake please email me with this little miracle of physics! I DID actually enjoy this movie. The production company actually built a u-boat from the actual blueprints at Blohm and Voss shipyards in Germany. I was impressed with the accuracy of the models, but the plot was trite and predictable. Tell you what, though.. A type VII uboat only had a pressure hull that was 3/4 of an inch thick.

ENIGMA was used extensively by the Nazis to send secure communications to the various fronts (and even domestically), and the capture of such a device had the potential of shaving years off of a godawful war.<br/><br/>Things don't go smoothly however, and the crew is soon fighting for its life.

This is a white-knuckle thrill ride with tense moments galore.  Sure, some creative liberties were taken.  But I think the realism of the sub scenes is a testament to the submariners to whom the film is dedicated.  And if adding some drama allows the story of their real-life sacrifices to be shared by more people, so much the better.  U-571 is a blast.  Just remember to come up for air."

","(moot warning: this comment might reveal plot details on a predictable film)<br/><br/>
U-571 was a disappointment, especially for a big fan of Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"". Basically, the plot is as ludicrous as it was fictional. It should serve as a warning to future directors never to make a one-sided propaganda 'war hero' movie ever again.<br/><br/>Negatives: (1) The plot is entirely in terms of Good and Evil. The 'Nazis' who originally commanded the U-571 are shown in one scene mowing down a boatload of shipwrecked helpless people ONLY to establish that they are Bad and deserve to be massacred later on by the Americans. The Americans, on the other hand, are all heroic patriots who are willing (like Trigger) to die for their country. And like Spielberg's mistake ""Saving Private Ryan"", the one German who the Americans save is the film's Benedict Arnold figure. ""U-571"" very much resembles old WWII era propaganda films in that respect.<br/><br/>(2) The plot is risible. In an early scene, the American sub is completely blown out of the water (twice) by one measly torpedo. And then there's the whole idea of 6-8 Americans mastering the control (passive sonar, engine room, etc) of an Unterseeboot, diving, shooting multiple torpedoes at and destroying another submarine without a skipper in a matter of minutes. THEN there's the scene where they pop up in front of the German destroyer and shoot a torpedo at it. Considering the destroyer is charging at the sub guns blazing its incredible that they survived long enough to get a shot off. Not only does the torpedo hit the oncoming frontal-profile destroyer, but it literally vaporizes the entire frickin' ship. The destroyer must have either been an oil tanker carrying liquid hydrogen in disguise or the U571 was equipped with nuclear torpedoes. In either case, I missed an important plot development.<br/><br/>(3) In terms of technical artistry and approprietness, this film is really pathetic. The creaks and groans and pops that are so awesome in ""Das Boot"" don't start until the U571 goes below 200 meters. The director, who seems to just imitate Petersen's film (Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery aside), just doesn't capture the tense atmosphere and claustrophobia. The omnipresent, bland, vaguely patriotic theme music doesn't even come close to Klaus Doldinger's excellent soundtrack for ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>(4) Predictable. This goes along with (1); obviously the Good heroes don't die, they kill all the Bad Guys, and save the world etc.<br/><br/>(5) Dedicating the film to the men who 'risked their lives' to get the Enigma machines is, bluntly, stupid. Most of the Enigma coders were not obtained in ludicrous commando raids (big surprise!), but usually were taken when a U-boot emergency surfaced and was intercepted by a BRITISH destroyer before the skipper destroyed the books and scuttled the ship.<br/><br/>Positives: (1) Decent acting and cast.<br/><br/>(2) Spectacular sfx, which, though not appropriate (ie. destroyer going up like the Hindenburg), are good eye candy. Technical aspect aside though, all the explosions just make the movie cheesy.<br/><br/>In all, a pretty pathetic movie next to ""Das Boot"". The director shouldn't have even attempted it. For the viewer, only see it if you want to satisfy your curiosity."
"Swampfox","Null","0","1","22 April 2000"," RUN SILENT, RUN NOT SO DEEP
","THE NUTSHELL:  At the height of the WW II German U-boat campaign in the North Atlantic against allied transports, one member of those dreaded ""Wolf Packs"" is disabled and adrift. Military Intelligence catches on to the situation and realizes it has the opportunity to capture the key to all German communications, the cipher machine code named ""Enigma."" Pressed into the service of an intelligence officer and Marine Commando leader (David Keith), is the crew of an aging U.S. submarine. XO (Matthew McConaughey) and his men find themselves camouflaged as another German sub and in a race to reach the U-boat before the actual supply ship does. The name of their quarry is: U-571.<br/><br/>If you think you can faintly hear the sound of a military drum march while reading the above, the producers of U-571 are your type of moviemakers. Not only is the standard rousing march provided, so is almost every single element from every submarine niche movie ever made. To call them clichés is a little unfair, for as with any setting there are certain rudiments that are hard to avoid. A movie made around semi-trucks is bound to contain shots of the wheels turning, gears being jammed and the occasional hiss of air breaks. So too will your underwater warfare flick feature such stock items as the skipper at the periscope, the call of DIVE! DIVE! DIVE! and fish (torpedoes) being launched. When it comes to theses obvious expectations, U-571 delivers handsomely. Therein lies the problem.<br/><br/>Moviegoers who simply want a good, well told story delivered with the current level of craft regardless of unoriginality cannot ask for a better return on their two hours of time and seven bucks. Go see U-571, it doesn't disappoint. Yet, neither does it surprise. With the exception of the basic premise of the actual mission to retrieve the code machine (seen in countless other genre pictures, including one of the better Roger Moore Bond films - FOR YOUR EYES ONLY) there is not a single scenario left unused by the end of this thing. Crews being rattled by depth charges while looking fearfully up? It's here. Cat and mouse games with a destroyer dropping those depth charges? That's here. Putting debris in the water to fake the sub's ""death?"" Yep, it's here too. RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, CRIMSON TIDE, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and the uberfilm of submariners DAS BOOT have all contributed to U-571's bag of tricks.<br/><br/>None of this is meant to insult the audience's intelligence. In fact, there's plenty of evidence that the filmmakers actually respect it. Several characters are killed without the usual fanfare to make it clear to the audience what has happened (although the similarity between Jack Noseworthy and Jon Bon Jovi made it a little confusing who ""bought it"" there). The sub lingo comes as fast and furious as it must in real life when lives are at stake, made even more cloudy when the characters themselves can't read the identifications on the German boat. The positions of the various crew members have to be sussed out as they do their job instead broadcast bad-movie style, ala: ""Ensign Huff here is the best rudder man in the Navy.""<br/><br/>Not that U-571 is without it's clunkers. Harvey Keitel is the chief of the boat, a salty dog who actually says (while belting whiskey no less) ""I got da sea in my blood."" McConaughey has been passed over for his own command because his skipper (Bill Paxton) doesn't think he's cut out for command yet because of the XO's closeness to the crew. And in one of the biggest insults to the audience, just in case they don't get it that it's wartime and you must kill your enemy in sometimes cold-blooded ways, the Germans machine gun a life raft of survivors from ship they just sank so when the Yanks pull a Trojan horse maneuver later it won't seem less than sporting. There are a few technical gaffs the pickier viewer will pick up on: there's no light at the depth the sub is seen at and a seasoned sub pro has pointed out that you cannot start diesel engines underwater (WWII era subs cruised on the surface, submerging only to attack or evade using precious battery reserves to do so).<br/><br/>The most surprising thing about this lack of surprise is who is presenting it, co-writer and director Jonathan Mostow. Two years ago he reworked the well-trod thriller path of a driver against unknown assailants out in the American wasteland into the excellent, stipped-down, very underappreciated BREAKDOWN. For filmgoers sake, I hope the blame for U-571's failures can be traced to the probable culprit, Dino De Laurentis. Writer-directors who make first rate action films are few compared to those working in strictly dramatic or comedic arenas. Outside of James Cameron and possibly the Wachowski Brothers, most helmers are hired guns.<br/><br/>Back in the 30's and 40's, studios like RKO and Republic churned out basic genre pictures that stuck to a tried and true formula which satisfied audience expectations if only rarely giving them anything original. It was escapist fare, judged solely on meeting those expectations. That's U-571. In addition to all the usual sub aspects listed above, the period details and the subs themselves bear mentioning. Along with the various duty uniforms, there's a dance scene early featuring a room full of dress whites and women's 40's era clothes for those who love the details of nostalgia. The dockside set is toyland of jeeps, trucks and naval personnel milling about. The production definitely did no skimp here.<br/><br/>Then, there are the sub sets. Anyone who assumes that they simply went to some place like Chicago (home to U-505, from which an enigma machine was taken during the war) and shot the real thing can be forgiven their misinformation. Using Cinecitta's famed craftsmen, the production built their sub interior in Rome. It is a marvel of pipes, moving gears and gauges. Universal will be criminal if they do not campaign next winter for Best Design on their behalf.<br/><br/>The best praise, albeit somewhat faint, I can bestow on U-571 comes down to who I would recommend this to: my dad. Like most of the general public, my dad sees maybe half a dozen films a year (not counting Bond repeats) mostly on cable. He grew up during the war and was raised on those RKO and Republic features. A war movie can ONLY mean knocking the hell out of Nazis or Toho's boys. For any regular film habitué who demands a little more out of cinema, the movie is forgettable and unsurprising tale that might not exactly make your 10 or 20 best list for 2000. It won't make your worst, either. But my dad's gonna love it. RECOMMENDATION: Can see now with no rush or wait for video."
"hudson-11","5","0","1","22 April 2000"," A couple of interesting scenes, but more cliche than satisfying
","I don't understand why this movie has been rated so highly. Sure, it looks authentic, and there are a couple interesting scenes during and right after the capture of U-571, but the rest of the movie is very cliche and riddled with sub-standard holywood acting. The historical inaccuracy didn't bother me at all, but the movie comes across as a cross between a poor-man's Das Boot (now *that* is one hell of a sub movie) and your typical action/war flick making a display of against-all-odds American heroism.

Otherwise, skip to the second paragraph.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue were SO bad throughout most of this film.  Bill Paxton is physically painful to watch.  I got to where I would pull my hat down over my eyes every time he came on screen.  In the scene where he ends up in the water it looks like he is standing on a platform.  The waves rise and fall around him.  On top of that he has to say the most ridiculous lines of the whole film.<br/><br/>Once the movie finally gets going, there is no real plot or suspense. There were several times that my friends and I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the stupid things characters were saying.  Even my 19 year old brother, who really only needs a couple cool explosions to think a film is amazing, kept chuckling and groaning at the dialogue.  Every WW II movie I've ever seen is better than this, and almost every ""intense"" submarine situation has been done before.

In comparing these two films, is it fair to argue that U-571 was really predictable during the initial viewing?

The XO passed over because of a lack of leadership, the Captain who just manages to push the XO through the personal development door, plus quite a few other co-incidences of the highest order.<br/><br/>Plus it's was also unrealistic and unrepresentative. The original version had a British Corvette, not an American Submarine pull off the mission. Torpedos of that era were point and shoot weapons. The idea submarines would use them against submarines is like two people trying to shoot each other with pistols at fifty meters with blindfolds on. Any of those near misses with depth charges would have sunk a real submarine. While Condor reconnaissance aircraft could travel long distances they certainly couldn't be used to escort a german Destroyer alone in the Atlantic. And there were no Destoyers in the Atlantic, the german surface navy was impotently confined to local waters or the Meditterenean for the duration of the war, their escape routes effectively blocked by the geography of Scandinavian/Danish water and the Royal Navy, and by the narrow confines of the Gibralter Strait to the south. And submarines certainly didn't have radar in 1942.<br/><br/>Those annoyances beside, if you can suspend disbelief, then the sound quality is excellent and it looks good and it dramatic enough.<br/><br/>Otherwise, stay at home and rent 'Das Boot'."

The sub avoids a full barrage of hundreds (or so it would seem at one point) of torpedoes and depth- charges - all of which miss by inches. Now, this is simply not possible. You can't have 20 or so depth-charges that come within inches of the hull. One of them HAS to hit. It's simple mathematics. Had it been one or two that just missed I could have tolerated it, but not the extremely high number in this film. That factor quite quickly killed the suspense for me and just irritated me. Therefor, I suggest you NOT look at this as a war-movie, but instead as a movie about one man that comes to grips with what it means to be an officer. Matthew McConaughey is a very good actor, no doubt about that, and his portrayal of the young lieutenant who is friends with the entire crew is solid. He also, very skillfully, captures his transformation into skipper with all that that entails - making critical decisions that mean life or death for the crew.<br/><br/>Other fortes in this movie is that you get a good sense of what life<br/><br/>must have been like inside the WWII beer-can-submarines.

For anyone interested, U110 (Commanded by LtCdr Lempe,  who sank the unarmed liner Athenia) attacked a convoy (OB318) which was outbound from Liverpool. She was blown to the surface by depthcharges from the Corvette HMS Aubretia. The crew, assuming she would sink, abandoned her. However, she did not sink at that time and a boarding party from the Destroyer HMS Bulldog, led by Sub Lt Balme recovered the Enigma cyper machine plus numerous accessories and code books.

"cinemel","Null","0","1","23 April 2000"," Rousing, exciting and loud WWII submarine adventure
","Matthew McConaughey stars in this rousing submarine adventure, `U-571'. Using state of the art special effects and multi-channel surround sound, Jonathan Mostow directs the viewer into the World War II claustrophobia of American and German underwater battleships. McConaughy portrays the first officer of a U.S. sub that has been given the mission of capturing the German coding machine named `Enigma'. In the process of accomplishing their mission, he and his cohorts are stranded on a wounded German U-boat and are under attack from above by a German battleship. Harvey Keitel is his second in command. This is an unusually heroic role for Keitel who usually plays in quirky independent films. Bill Paxton as the American sub skipper, Jon Bon Jovi, and Erik Palladino (of TV's `ER') also acquit themselves well.<br/><br/>Mostrow uses the wide Panavision screen to draw the audience into this scary world where depth charges are dropped from above exploding loudly all around them (and us). These Dolby Digital explosions are deftly contrasted to the deadly silences. These are punctuated by the periodic sonar `pings' and the creaking of the aged sub as she plummets the ocean to levels where the crushing weight of the water above threatens to squash the steel like a weak tin can.<br/><br/>
Like many World War II films of the past, `U-571' is a bit weak on characterization. However, that's not what this film is about. The action and adventure are the reason for this film, and here, the filmmakers have delivered!"

"krumski","Null","0","1","2 December 2000"," World War II Sub movie gets the facts wrong - but everything else right.
","Saw this movie in the theatres over the summer. Enjoyed it, but pretty much promptly forgot about it. I saw it again recently on video and, already knowing the story and the outcome, I was free to pay more attention to the technique. And my verdict is this: U-571 is one of the most finely crafted popcorn movies of the past several years. One of the things which has become most regrettable about the Big Hollywood Summer Movies is their relentless pace: everything is in your face, it's all whiz-banging by you a million miles a second, with the (increasingly hokey looking) CGI special effects hogging just about every frame of the screen. Hollywood action directors have lost touch with how to pace a film for maximum impact: that there must be peaks and valleys, moments of calm and white-knuckle tension in order for the explosions to pack the wallop they should. U-571 gets it just about all right. It is a very satisfying viewing experience; nothing to rewrite the book on film, certainly, and nothing you will carry with you for the rest of your days - but a solid, intelligent entertainment that won't leave you feeling like you've just been raped by Industrial Light and Magic.<br/><br/>The setup is solid and well thought out; it gets the film rolling at a good clip (I won't bore you with details of the plot here - you can read the IMDb summary for that). There's a no-nonsense quality to it all, right from the get-go: the filmmakers are not interested in any romantic subplots (there are no women in the movie), inter-crew rivalries or joshing, puffed- up backstories (no ""proving something to his father"" or ""avenging the death of his best friend"" type character profiles) and least of all no gratuitously overlong ""money shots"" showing off the hardware and special effects. To some tastes, this might make the movie a bit too dry and faceless, and I'll be the first to admit that I wouldn't want every movie to be done in this way. But it's appropriate to the subject at hand: in such a scenario, the task - the mission - is what is most important (not whether or not Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler - or Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane - are together at the end of the movie) and it's refreshing to see a big Hollywood actioner get that right. It reminded me of the classic war movies of the past, like Guns of Navarone, or Where Eagles Dare: Ok, we've got a job to do and we're going to do it - that's what we're here for (*all* we're here for) and that's what the audience really wants to see. So let's get to it!<br/><br/>Furthermore, making all (rather than just some) of the story take place on the submarine was very brave. It's the tightest, most claustrophobic place imaginable, and it does not allow for the type of cathartic, big action payoffs that other films can provide (aerial dogfights, car chases, kung-fu blowouts, etc.). There's a muted, constricted feeling to even the good guys' victories here that does not allow for a satisfying ""Hooray!"" from the audience - just a pattern of high tension, slight release, then back again, all leading to a surprisingly muted finale which, in its own way, is as clear-eyed about battle and as respectful of the men who fought it as was Saving Private Ryan (though, of course, much less pointed about it).<br/><br/>Some might question how I can actually use a word like ""respectful"" in relation to this movie, since - as has been widely noted - the exploits of the American crew here are wildly fictionalised, and that the true heroes in acquiring the Enigma machines from German subs were the British. Well, I'll agree: this is Hollywood revisionism at its worst. But you know what? It's a cracking good tale, done with care and respect (it even lists, at the end, all the different missions - British and American both - that were responsible for successfully confiscating Enigmas). The film's concern is not with presenting historical ""truth"" but with using the backdrop of history as an entryway onto a tautly constructed cinematic thrill ride. If such an endeavor strikes you as offensive and opportunistic - well, I can't really argue with you. But if you can get past it, and are only interested in a solid, well crafted, well thought out movie. . . gentlemen, I give you U-571."

"FlickJunkie-2","7","0","1","19 October 2000"," Rises above its flaws to deliver non-stop action
","A writer/director can take only so much artistic license before a story that is supposedly truth-based turns into a sham.  Jonathan Mostow runs dangerously close to that line.  The list of inaccuracies and improbabilities in this film is lengthy.  As has been noted numerous times, the British and not the Americans cracked the enigma code.  There were no blacks serving with whites on submarines, due to the segregation policy of the U.S. military before 1946.  The Germans were not evil, cold-blooded killers who strafed unarmed survivors.  The likelihood of a single torpedo hitting a ship showing only a bow profile is astronomically low, etc., etc., etc..  <br/><br/>If you put aside the fact that this was pure fantasy rather than fact-based fiction, this film was great entertainment.  The story was engrossing, the action was non-stop and the suspense was extremely well done.  Mostow uses every submarine film device ever invented and gives the crew a continual flow of crises to solve.  Yes, it smacked of U.S. nationalism to a fault and the music was so insipidly patriotic it became corny.  However, though this was a shamelessly derivative work, it was intense and twisty with great special effects, and that made it worth watching.<br/><br/>Many people have compared this film with `Das Boot', concluding that this film pales by comparison to that classic.  `Das Boot' is one of my all time favorite films, but I really don't think you can compare the two.  They were really telling completely different types of stories.  `Das Boot' was a highly realistic character study and `U-571' was a fantasy action/adventure flick.  The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they each took place inside a German submarine.  <br/><br/>The acting was nothing special, but in defense of the cast, the film wasn't really about the characters so they didn't have much to do except look tense.  The best performance was delivered by Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough, the old sea dog who held the crew together.  Matthew McConaughey was hollow and wooden.  This was not one of his better performances.<br/><br/>Despite a long list of grievances, this film still delivers high power entertainment and rises above its many flaws.  I rated it a 7/10.

To their credit, at the end credits the makers of this film honor those who were involved in the capture of the actual Enigma equipment and documentation. If you read carefully (my 17-year-old daughter did not) you will notice that it was a British destroyer in 1941 which captured the first Enigma machine, not an American submarine (most American subs operated in the Pacific theater, I believe). <br/><br/>
Also, the idea of using a regular submarine crew as a boarding party, rather than specially-trained troops (or even convential US Marines) was a real stretch, as was the speed at which they figured out how to operate the German U571.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of this genre, you may find some of the plot elements are a bit old hat (sitting out the depth charges, diving to a depth the sub supposedly cannot tolerate, etc.).<br/><br/>Altogether, though, I enjoyed the fast pacing, the special effects and direction, and especially the acting (although the normally-animated Bill Paxton was a bit wooden in his portayal).<br/><br/>Recommendation: see it, but don't believe it."

The U-505's code books and cipher machine were captured by the USS Guadalcanal during 1944.  Some tension ensued following this ""victory"" because the American and British high commands were afraid the Germans would learn of the capture and change the code.  Captain Gallery of the Guadalcanal, not being in the ULTRA ""loop"", was unaware that the Enigma code had already been broken and therefore didn't realize what damage this could do.

","When I first saw ads for this film, I thought ""Oh Great, a crappy war movie about explosions.""  But, for some reason I decided to pay $5 and give it a shot.  To my surprise, I didn't waste my money.  The film was action-packed with twists, turns, and a great ensemble of actors who were not only good-looking, but talented as well.  Matthew McConaughey gave a superb performance as Lt. Andrew Tyler.  Bill Paxton (Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren) and Harvey Keitel (Chief Klough) were excellent as well, but that was really no big shocker.  The huge surprise of the whole film had to have been Jon Bon Jovi as Lt. Pete Emmett.  Who knew that a rocker could actually act? Other standouts include Jake Weber (Lt. Hirsh), T.C. Carson (Eddie), Jack Noseworthy (Wentz), Erik Palladino (Mazzola), and Tom Guiry (Trigger). Dave Power (Tank) also proved to have quite an acting ability in his film debut.<br/><br/>
German soldier Wassner played by Thomas Kretshmann was one of the characters that proved how well this film was written.  Even though the audience is supposed to be against the Germans, these soldiers are not portrayed as evil beings with no humanity at all.  Wassner was portrayed as a brave soldier who fought for his country with all his might just like the American soldiers.  U-571 might have done a better job with that than Saving Private Ryan.  Don't write me if you disagree; it's just my opinion.<br/><br/>I must say that I didn't care much for the ending of the film.  There wasn't much of a resolution.  The movie just kind of ended after two hours.  But, the rising actions that sucked the audience in completely made up for this ending.  Another minor problem was how certain characters look alike.  If you haven't seen this film yet, there are two characters you must be warned about, Trigger and Rabbit.  These are two completely different characters who look exactly alike (in submarine light anyway).  So, if you think McConaughey just feels like calling Trigger by the name Rabbit, think again. It's a different guy.  I guess Tom Guiry and Will Estes just have that similar cute, boyish look (according to me, a 15 year old girl).<br/><br/>But, the movie is great and worth your five bucks so don't pass it up!

","With the success of ""Saving Private Ryan"" a couple of years ago, is it any wonder that a resurgence in World War II-themed adventures would result? One of the first to arrive is this very serviceable underwater yarn, an entertaining fictionalization of Allied submariners attempting to obtain a coveted decoding device from a disabled German submarine. Matthew McConaughey anchors an earnest cast through the rigors of a dangerous mission fraught with machine gunfire, torpedos and (lots and lots of) depth charges. ""U-571"" is loaded with all the technical innovations of modern Hollywood: utterly meticulous production design, convincingly claustrophobic cinematography and near-deafening 6-track sound effects. Thematically, though, it owes more than a tip of a hat to the flurry of exercises in American propaganda in the 1940s and 50s than the more multi-layered contemporary submarine blockbusters like ""Das Boot"", ""The Hunt For Red October"" and even ""Crimson Tide"". Which is not to say ""U-571"" isn't worthwhile on an escapist front. But for every bonafide thrill it has to offer, sacrifices are made in the 'minor' departments: subtext, character development, and any opportunity to examine the folly of war itself.

","Would U-571 be a better movie if it had British officers stopping the Enigma signal? Sure, and maybe for the sake of accuracy it should have. Perhaps there is a certain amount of American arrogance at work here, having these officers portrayed as American, but, at the risk of upsetting a lot of veterans, I don't think it matters in the long run who did what. I think what matters in the end is that it was done at all. <br/><br/>Say what you will, but anyone who has watched U-571 has to admit it's a balanced film. The German characters in the film are every bit as human, flawed and virtuous as the Americans. The film respects both sides of the conflict equally.<br/><br/> Speaking as a Canadian, I have to be honest about my feelings about our past war efforts. All Canadian students are taught about Canada's great victory at Vimy Ridge in World War I. It can not be denied that that was an important victory in the war and that incredible heroism was involved on the part of the soldiers. If Hollywood made a movie about the battle of Vimy Ridge and replaced the Canadian soldiers with Americans, I admit it would probably upset me, but only because I'm Canadian. My nationality would prevent me from looking at the situation objectively. Nowadays it seems odd trying to find trying to extract some source of national pride among the horrors of an old war.<br/><br/>If people think the United States is arrogant for portraying British officers as American, the arrogance displayed as the British remind everybody, ""Don't forget. We did that,"" also has to be acknowledged. The fact is, somebody had to do it. These men did it and they are heroes. Their nationality doesn't define their heroic act, and neither does it matter if they are portrayed by Matthew McConaughey or Ewan MacGregor. As time passes by, wars become more and more meaningless, and it's not as if they were loaded with meaning in the first place."

","In the wartime Battle of the Atlantic, a crucial element in the success of the U-boats was the Germans' Enigma encryption system. This film suggests that the turning point in the Allies' breaking of the code was the assault on U-571 by an American submarine crew led by Lt Andrew Tyler (played with some stoicism by Matthew McConaughey) in the Spring of 1942. In fact, the Enigma machine and code books were first captured from U-110 by a British boarding party from the Royal Navy's ship the `Bulldog' led by Lt David Balme and the incident occurred on 9 May 1941 - when the Americans were not even in the war.<br/><br/>`U-571' tries to compensate for this historical travesty by including in the final credits a dedication to the `Allied' effort on Enigma and dates of two British as well as one US capture of vital material. However, I'm one of the few people I know who sit through such credits and, by the end of the war, the British had actually captured 13 Enigmas to the Americans' one. Is it really necessary commercially for Hollywood to portray the Second World War as consisting of heroics exclusively by characters of its own nationality?<br/><br/>Historical fallacies aside, this is a superior action-adventure movie and director Jonathan Mostow has created a fine addition to the long submarine genre flowing all the way from `Run Silent, Run Deep' (1958) to `Das Boot' (1981). He may have paid more attention to the technical details than the characterisation, but there is sustained tension and continual action, assisted by excellent special effects and superb sound.

After a plot twist (anticipated from the simple fact that the film still has over an hour to run!!) the film becomes reminiscent of a sub-based 'Memphis Belle'.<br/><br/>The acting performances are unusually wooden, I was particularly disappointed with Bill Paxton, who is capable of much more. A notable exception being Harvey Keitel, who delivers a great performance as the chief. The effects were adequate, but not outstanding, the depth charge effects when the boat was visibly shaken were the most memorable. I did notice a few possible historical innaccuracies that I will have to check out (Did the German Navy have ASDIC in 1942??), but apart from those the film was generally watchable, although I would rather reccommend 'Das Boot' (1981)."

","It is well known that wonderful sound and film editing can save a movie that is lacking in other aspects such as credibility and good acting. Sadly, the opposite is also true, and U-571 demonstrates it clearly. Normally, people love theaters, as do I; their superior sound quality can make you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. This sort of advantage has made viewings of movies like THE MATRIX, THE PHANTOM MENACE, and THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH immensely pleasurable. However, U-571 makes a fatal mistake here; this is a loud movie, and I mean a REALLY loud movie. While the volume is just fine during scenes with plenty of dialouge and little action, it jumps beyond the breaking point during the action sequences. Here, what is intended to be suspenseful is just plain annoying.<br/><br/>     Even when ruling out the over-the-top pyrotechnics, U-571 is lacking in another key area too. The characters here are undeveloped; only one of them is shown to have a past, but everyone else is only here to serve the plot. Nevertheless, this movie isn't about personalities and character development; it's about engaging the viewer and taking him/her on what is intended to be an underwater roller-coaster ride of sorts. Even there, it doesn't work because the sound effects are so pumped up and the camera moves so frenetically that several supposedly nail-biting suspense scenes become irritating.<br/><br/>    There's really not much more I can say about this movie. The acting really isn't worth talking about-- everyone does a solid job-- but there isn't much here to make each character stand out. Really, this is one of those films where you refer to most people as ""this guy"" or ""that guy."" Even though all major characters' names are given, it was easy for me to forget them. But in the end it all comes back to the overbearing volume in this movie. Yes, I understand that depth charges, guns, bursting pipes, and explosions make loud noises, but when they overpower the viewing experience, it's all just too much.<br/><br/>    I suspect that U-571 will work better on video than in a theater. If you have a surround-sound system set up, you're in luck. You can set the volume at appropriate levels and be drawn in to the experience. The crazy camera won't be much of a problem either since a living room with a TV provides a more intimate medium than a theater with a screen stretching outward. U-571 should come equipped with a bright warning label that it is not viewer-friendly."

My favorite sub films are the old WW2 ones, like Destination Tokyo and Run Silent, Run Deep and this seemed to head in the vein of those.  The first 45 minutes is gripping and exciting action, with the stock sub characters overblown as usual.  But as the action moves to the German sub, the movie takes a nosedive and never ascends (haha).  How much of sitting underwater listening to depth charges is too much?  This much!  The truly interesting characters, Bill Paxton's and David Keith's, are killed off leaving us with personality-challenged Matthew Mconaughey and 'he's in this movie, too?!' Harvey Keitel and the other faceless actors populating the screen.  After Breakdown, I know Jonathan Mostow is capable of suspense on a extended level but he demonstrates very little of it here.

In brief: suspense, despair, historical reference, almost accurate reconstruction of the time period (servants on subs?

My biggest hang was with Bill Paxton and David Keith.  I have a thing against actors who I see on screen a whole lot (hence my aversion toward Will Smith and Sean Connery movies and my attraction to Blair Witch Project).<br/><br/>Bill Paxton's less than riveting performance in Mission To Mars had left a bad taste in my mouth that really rotted the eggs (bad U-571 reference).<br/><br/>Worse was David Keith.

While everyone else did a fine job of adopting the language and mannerisms of the time, Keith just couldn't get over his gruff, burly, crude manner.  Now, whether that was an exemplification of his position as a Marine amongst Navy men may be brought into consideration, but I felt he wasn't convincing.<br/><br/>Aside from the ""almost"" the ""good"" wins out.

"Miles-10","7","0","1","21 May 2000"," Excellent if formulaic war movie
","Writer/director Jonathan Mostow knows the formula for an exciting story and that is good for everyone looking for an entertaining adventure yarn. I can only recall one discontinuity. Matthew McConnaughy's character punches Erik Palladino, and in the next shot Palladino doesn't look as if he's been punched at all. But such glitches are rare. Another criticism: While it is refreshing that Mostow wants to convey that his characters are scared even when they do brave deeds, the director has McConnaughy spend more than half his screen time with his eyes wi-i-ide open. But I quibble. This story is fun for many of the same reasons that ""Star Wars"" (1977) is fun although ""U-571"" is much darker. You have the hero, Lt. Tyler, who wants to be a skipper, but he isn't ready because he doesn't know how to make risky decisions. (Trust in the force, Luke.) The hero has two mentors and one dies off early just as Obi Wan Kenobi died off surprisingly early. Nice touch, giving him two mentors, because then we don't have to believe the hero learns his lessons from the dead mentor only. Realistically, he needs more than one lesson, as anyone does. Whereas a fantasy like ""Star Wars"" can have Obi Wan come back as a ghost, a gritty combat film must have a living mentor to be credible. The hero's initiation into the adventure is made more tense when he is kept in the dark about the mission until the crew is out to sea. Adding a sinister element of mystery is Jack Weber as Lt. Hirsh, a secret operative who is forced on the crew whether they like it or not. (Is he from signal intelligence, a precursor of the NSA?) Hirsh along with David Keith's Marine intelligence officer, immediately suggest that there are secret forces at work--even among the crew. In an eerie, disorienting scene, Hirsh exposes the fact that the radio operator (Jack Noseworthy) speaks fluent German, something he has kept hidden from crewmembers for fear of being identified with the enemy. In other ways, the language difference between the Americans and their enemy is exploited for tension: What if your life suddenly were to depend on operating a vessel on which all the controls are labeled in a foreign language, and you have only two men capable of running around the ship, translating for your crew? The hero in ""U-571"" faces one edge-of-your-seat challenge after another as he learns to command ""on the job."" The tough situations become tougher and tougher until the climatic scene in which the hero not only gets to blow up something big (not quite the Death Star, but then Darth Vader isn't aboard, either), but he learns the final grim lesson of command in the process. The equally grim moral question that is implicit here goes unquestioned by film-maker Mostow, but then the hero's lesson is precisely that he does not have the right to hesitate about life-and-death decisions. Unless you avoid war movies like the plague, you won't want to miss this exciting film. By the way: Yes, the movie is fiction. The British, not the Americans, caught the first German Enigma machine on a U-boat. And they didn't have as difficult a time bringing this war-winning elixir back to their ""tribe"" as do the crew in ""U-571."" According to the legend on screen at the end, the first two or three Enigma's were found by British ships and then a US ship caught another one near the end of the war. I hate to quibble further (or do I?), but the part of Eddie (Terrence ""T.C."" Carter), the black cook who gets to play an equal role as the crew dwindles, bears on the film's rather unrealistic treatment of race relations. Except for an early comment about how he finds out important things because white officers heedlessly speak in front of him as if he were not there, no further reference is made to the servile role forced upon African-Americans in the US Navy during World War II. No one expresses a lick of prejudice toward Eddie. Even when the Germans are accused of being prejudiced (by Eddie), they are never given the chance to show it. I think the film-maker's defense is that all historical movies are really contemporary stories; ""U-571"" portrays race relations as they ought to have been rather than as they were. To complete the Star Wars analogy--for now at least-- Hitler is the ultimate Darth Vader but since this story is more realistic than Star Wars, it is about men fighting a small but significant piece of the war against Hitler, not the pitched battles we so often see in Star Wars where there is the possibility of taking out Darth. (Though, Darth is not really the head of the Evil Empire, is he? But lets not niggle.)"

This is allegedly an action movie with an emotional subtext, but it fails to deliver on both counts.  Despite the high-concept - ""US navy intercepts U-boat to steal Enigma code machine, and it all goes horribly wrong"" - nothing much really happens.  The commandeered U-boat is damaged and almost out of torpedoes, so the hapless American pirates spend the next hour limping around the ocean floor wondering how they're going to get out of this mess.  I expected so much more from this - more action, more tension, more story.  It feels like they shot the second draft of the screenplay - the one where the hero's character is only half-developed and some of the plot points still need to be worked out.  It looks hurriedly cobbled together, too, with special effects that are annoyingly second-rate and some pretty static camera work. This wasn't a mega-budget movie, so maybe they spent most of the money on the cast.  Yet this doesn't pay off, either, because the cast is wasted. They're given nothing to do.  Paxton and Keitel have about 20 lines between them, and McConaughey just broods.  Jon Bon Jovi disappears so early you're likely to forget he was ever in it. The ultimate problem, however, isn't the budget.  You don't need a huge budget to make a decent submarine movie.  You need a great story.  ""The Hunt For Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" both rely on great stories more than special effects.  ""U-571"" has a great story IDEA, but it's under-developed.  And it isn't helped by what has to be the most gratingly banal score since ""Eyes Wide Shut""."

","When I first heard about ""U-571"" I was very excited. A World War II film about U-boats and concentrating on naval battles from the writer/director of 1997's surprise thriller ""Breakdown"". But, oh yes there's a ""but"", the first trailer released billed it as a gung-ho action flick, which is what it really was.<br/><br/>NINE GUYS STUCK IN HOSTILE WATERS...IN AN ENEMY VESSEL...WITH BIG MACHINE GUNS AND A LOT OF LUCK! That is all Jonathan Mostow's thriller offers besides no thrills. Unfortunately, the big finale wasn't that big. There was no real climax to the film, nothing on the edge of your seat because you know what is going to happen.<br/><br/>THE PLOT. An American submarine is sent on a ""hush-hush"" Super secret mission to steal an enigma decoding machine from a stranded German U-boat which is floating in dismal waters waiting for a re-supply sub. The American sub is disguised as the re-supply sub to give them just enough time to take the U-boat by force. A small platoon of men is sent to overpower the sub. Well, unfortunately, the men onboard the U-boat lose their ride home and have to commandeer the vehicle for now. Well just follow this for a bit and don't include any excitement and that is what this dull action war thriller is all about.<br/><br/>I figured with a great director and an impressive cast including Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey, and, of course, Jon Bon Jovi, I expected a lot more than even the face value trailer had to offer.<br/><br/>All in all, an action/thriller that leaves the viewer cold and alone in the water.<br/><br/>6/10"

I can't remember the last ""serious"" movie that I have seen where the production staff has attempted to insert tension at the lack of believability.  There are also so many obvious set-ups, combined with the fact that this is a good guy vs bad guy movie that there was NO tension at all.

","I am admittedly a fan of submarine-warfare movies and books, and  will alos admit to overlooking some factual 'inaccuracies' as long as the plot gets furthered by them. As for 'U-571' - If you honestly want to see a submarine move, pick another ! This flick is far to clean shaven, scrubbed and streamlined to even remotely resemble real life and duty on a submarine, even under preent day conditions. Watch ""The Boat"" instead especially the director's cut, for an impression of 'life' on a submarine.<br/><br/>As for historical 'accuraccy' - It has been mentioned before that the Polish, French and English secret services originally 'accquired' the Enigma machine during the thirties - and by '41 were regularly reading the U-boat dispatches ( with corresponding massive effect on the naval war) - rendering the basic premise of the movie void from the start......<br/><br/>
As for the uninspired acting - actually nothing much was expected, so the disappointment was managable...... <br/><br/>Stil, it might be fun watching it as a total no-brainer zoned out with a cask of beer. Then again, there are more memorable movies ! Leave it be"

If Hollywood would ever just stop with all the crapola and tell a real story, people would love it.  Take a look at ""Apollo 13"" for example; almost all factual, and highly popular.   The sound was extremely intense, the action scenes were too phony.  I thought the dialogue was superficial, seemingly geared mostly to 14 year old boys. (IS this the target audience?)"

","As a fan of the sub-genre (pun intended), I was happy to see this addition. It's no Das Boot and it doesn't break much new ground, but I was entertained all the same.  The biggest problem I had with the film was that not enough attention was given to characterization (i.e., the characters are all pretty two-dimensional).  You won't care much when some of them die because you hardly had a chance to get to know them.<br/><br/>As for the debate about historical inaccuracies, I'm not sure why the film-makers chose to use an American crew rather than (an historically accurate) British crew but I feel this inaccuracy was addressed at the end of the film with the historical brief which clearly stated that it was the British who retrieved the first Enigma code machine (and a couple others as well).  And, as it turns out, an American sub did retrieve an enigma machine and codes later in the war."

Matthew McConaughey is a good young actor and I enjoyed him in this movie. There was one scene in the movie that I had a hard time believing.(It involved questioning a Captains order in the heat of battle) There are several old sub or war movie cliche scenes but I ignored them as the movie was watchable.  If you are interested in this movie, see it on the big screen. I rated this movie a 7."

","Yet another example of American Cultural Imperialism through popular culture.  It is all fair and good to be aware this film is not going to be historically accurate, but average cinema goers will leave thinking goody, America saves the day again without realising the fact that history is being rewritten to credit America.  It may well be only a movie, but think of the implications, it could mean that in the future all historical accomplishments will have movies made about them- only Americans were the heros rather then people from whatever nation that really should be credited.  I guess if you are American, this wouldn't be so bad since it's not like you have much of a history anyway- why don't create history by re-writing it.  If you are not American, we have much to worry about."

Okay, but they got the idea from a true story which is this: In 1941 a British warship engaged and sank a German U-boat which as was hit, came to the surface (literally blown to the surface) and everyone on board jumped into the sea. The secret Enigma codes onboard the sub which enabled the Germans to speak in code across radios were meant to be destroyed by a preselected sailor, but in this case the sailor was more bothered about getting out alive. A British search party got on the sub and found the code sheets which had not come into contact with water (which would have disintegrated the special paper). And voila, the code was (almost) broken."
"pslock","Null","0","1","28 April 2000"," Every sub movie cliche makes a cameo!!
","Ignoring for a moment the historcial revisions U571 makes (which, in and of themsevles are pretty offensive), U-571 is a dull, predictable thriller that tries it's hand at dazzling viewers with age-old submarine thriller cliches and excuses to use modern special effects technology for shallow scenes. Everything U-571 tries to be, Das Boot did better, with a far better storyline.  Of course, seeing as how Das Boot was about a German sub in WWII, in some way's it's been pushed aside in movie history since it's not plucky Americans doing brilliant things to save the red, white, and blue. While most people are praising the acting in U-571, great acting doesn't equate to a brilliant movie.  Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman were convincing dolts in Ishtar, but that doesn't make the movie a grand spectacle.  It all comes to down good writing...and this film has none. For a submarine thriller to be excellent, it needs to twist common elements of those films into something interesting.  Hunt FOr Red October succeeded because of this....Das Boot succeeded because it was a hyper-realistic and incredibly powerful, dramatic portrayal of Nazi-sub life.  U-571 is just actioneer stuff that recycles everything we've seen before in a glossy new package including a fake plot in which Americans do all these great things they never did.  Not making the characters British was not simply dramatic license...it's just plain silly.  GO rent the director's cut of Das Boot (preferably on DVD), tuck in for the evening and get blown away by a real thriller.  Not some ""look mommy, Hollywood can make period action movies!"" thing."

"_thalamus_","Null","0","1","28 April 2000"," A short take:
","U-571 is definitely not the best way to spend your movie money. The least of the problems are many inaccuracies to actual WWII history, naval tactics, and science, which makes you wonder who, if anyone, did the research for this movie. Even if no one did the research this movie still should not be so uneducated.<br/><br/>Even if you ignore that fact and see this as a sci-fi thriller it is still not a good one. First of all, the characters are extremely shallow and they have absolutely no personality what so ever. There are many great opportunities in the movie to move the audience emotionally but the director didn't take advantage of them. The fact makes the movie very emotionally flat. The actings are not bad but the actors' efforts are wasted by the poor directing and script.<br/><br/>Ok, so you say you are not here to watch an art movie and you don't care. Well, the actions aren't remarkable neither. The lightings are poorly done which make the actions very confusing. The action themselves are pretty brainless with repeated let-rush-blindly-into-the-danger-and-pray-we-somehow-survive tactics in every situation. The trailer is certainly misleading which want you to believe there's an ""entire German fleet chasing you down"" but the scale of the battle is actually very small. Don't expect an epic battle, there are only two boats chasing each other.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed at this movie and would urge you not to give your hard earned money to encourage the production of poorly researched, poorly executed mass-market-junk like U-571"
"mercury-26","7","0","2","29 April 2000"," Rock the boat
","As I sat and waited for this movie to begin, I had to sit through a number of really bad trailers for really bad movies-except one: Director Wolfgang Petersen (""In The Line of Fire,"" ""Air Force One"") has a new film coming out June 30th called ""The Perfect Storm."" Petersen's come a long way, but his masterpiece is still ""Das Boot,"" the epic German World War II submarine film that really set the standard for all underwater thrillers that followed.<br/><br/>As if the trailer weren't reminder enough of Boot's influence on it, ""U-571"" begins with none other than the crew of a German U-boat struggling against depth charges dropped by a British destroyer. Writer/director Jon Mostow is tipping his hat to Petersen here, given the way we're allowed to get to know these characters a little bit. These are not the inhuman, evil, cold-blooded Nazis depicted in American cinema, but simply a crew of men under orders, doing their duty, trying to survive. Of course, this is an American film and we're soon informed who we're supposed to be rooting for.<br/><br/>
Mostow wasn't trying to make a better film than its predecessors, just a Bigger, Faster, and Louder one. He knows his limits: He doesn't have Denzel or Hackman. Or Connery. Or Baldwin. ""U-571"" bravely charts its own course, happy to be something that neither ""Boot,"" nor ""Hunt For Red October,"" nor ""Crimson Tide"" were: an all-out action flick. Mostow's crew consists of names like McConaughey, Keitel, Paxton, Bon Jovi, Weber. None of these guys (well, except maybe Keitel) is going to demand the big speech, the scenery-chewing dialogue. Their job is to say the lines they're given and look mean or intense or afraid-whatever the scene calls for. The film's one developed character, Matthew McConaughey's Lieutenant Andrew Tyler, provides enough to keep the boat, and the film, afloat.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the details of the plot because it's really no better or worse than the plot of the other underwater thrill rides you've seen. I will say that it's set near the end of World War II, at which time Allied forces were trying to capture coding devices that made German naval communications undecipherable. Mostow's story has a few unexpected twists, with a script that often leads you astray of what will actually happen. It also seems designed, often at the expense of historical accuracy, to deliver as many opportunities for things to blow up as possible. In fact, it's been a while since I've seen or heard things blow up quite as well as they did in this film.<br/><br/>Do try to see ""U-571"" in a well-equipped theater, but make sure you take in its superior elder statesmen at some point.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

I don't see why they felt the need to make a joke about the British-Polish attempt and success of capturing an Enigma decoder from the crippled U-110.  I guess it is because they feel a movie depicting British heroes won't fare well in the US.  BUT AMERICANS AREN'T LIKE THAT!  The James Bond movies do better in America than in any other country!  Considering that in the post-Cold War ones that America was only mentioned several times, we can accept non-American heroes. Anyway, I couldn't care about this movie. We have some American guys who don't have any real names (Did They?) and no personality.  Since Britain is obviously so incompetent that they crippled under the blitzkrieg of London and let the Bismarck slip right through their butter fingers,Americans need to rescue the Brits.  In case you aren't aware of WWII, Churchill gave his ""We'll fight them in the streets and landing grounds to the last man"" speech during the heigh of London's firebombing. British Admiralty also coordinated the destruction of the super-battleship Bismarck, no help from us.   For Christ's sake, I half-expected to see Churchill about to be forced to walk the plank before Superman, errr, Uncle Sam lept to the rescue. Anyway, I didn't care anything about the characters, who either give new definition to ""paper cutout"" or strongly reinforce the existing one.  Eric Palladino, Dr. Dave from ER, exists only to get killed and look heroicly doing so.  The black guy was there only to appeal to minorities.  His most memorable line is ""Drop it you Nazi son of a b*tch!"".  Keitel did a good job, acting like another uninteresting person.  The only person I found interesting was Coonan, who suddenly disappears for no reason.  Oh yeah, that Wentz guy.  He could speak German, that's the only reason I remember him.  Oh yeah, and we have our favorite nudist playing the commander of this pathetic crew. The explosions (There are lots of them!) are first and so is sound. If you want to kill a few hours, I'd recommend this.  But for real heroism on the high seas, watch SINK THE BISMARCK or HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.

","If you've seen a submarine action/thriller before, whether it be ""Hunt for Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" or any one of the countless others, you know we're not exactly sailing in uncharted waters.  ""U-571"" begs, borrows and steals from the best of the rest, but there is enough suspense and a few surprises to make this boat worth the ride.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton and a host of newcomers take sail to overtake a German submarine during WWll in an attempt to steal a precious telegraph device (a.k.a. ""Enigma""), which allows the Germans to communicate in a code the US simply can't crack.  How the Americans tapped into the communications between the sub and the German command seems to defy the premise (i.e. ""Enigma""), but we'll let that slide for the moment.  And that the soldiers look as though they were handpicked out of GQ magazine instead of boot camp... we can let that slide I guess.  And the historical fact that it was actually the British that sought the Enigma... well, we'll just have to let that slide too.  It's a movie... not a documentary.<br/><br/>As with all the action pictures of this genre, explosions are a must... and ""U-571"" is no exception.  In fact, one must wonder if, after the umpteenth depth charge explosion, the film-makers were able to claim ""no fishes of any kind were injured in the making of this picture.""  At least we know what the cast ate for dinner.  Nevertheless, the special effects deliver... and with an 80 million plus budget, they had better.<br/><br/>The acting and writing are adequate, although Harvey Keitel, usually in top form, delivers his lines as though he has just read the script for the first time.  I simply can't believe he agreed to utter lines like, ""I'd sail with you any day of the week.""  The plot, loosely based on a true story, surfs along with as many predictable devices as it does surprises, but I guess it would have been a work of pure fiction otherwise.<br/><br/>But what I miss most from ""U-571"" is a strong emotional core. There are so many sailors running around that it's hard enough to remember all their names, never mind get to know who they are.  We know that they're handsome, skilled and afraid to die (yadda, yadda, yadda)... but who are they? ""U-571"" never submerges deep enough into the hearts and minds of it's occupants for us to find out.  And so, even though the action/suspense cup is more than half full, the emotional cup is more than half empty.<br/><br/>What keeps this ship from sinking is the tight direction of Jonathan Mostow, who also wrote the script.  Mostow directed Kurt Russell in the less successful ""Breakdown"".  Mostow keeps the action flowing at a hundred knots per hour.  Relentless at times.  But you never feel irritatingly bombarded, as in films like ""Armageddon"".  Mostow knows how to walk that delicate line between action and suspense... even if we are all too aware of the safety net below."

The torpedo blows a hole in the hull, so that water pours in and the boat sinks... and fire is just an occasional side-effect.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that torpedos can't be devastating -- one of the most memorable war clips I've ever seen showed a destroyer that was literally broken in half by a torpedo hit -- but simply that the overly-cinematic destroyer explosion at the end of the movie left me a bit dissatisfied.<br/><br/>History-wise, ""U-571"" seemed quite reasonable.  It was set in 1942, the year after the original Enigma machine was captured by the British... and there's no way that the crew being sent to retrieve the code machine would have previously known of Enigma.  Remember, it was a tightly guarded secret, on both sides of the war.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid, edge-of-your-seat war thriller.  My rating: 8/10."
"Ric-7","5","0","1","27 April 2000"," A sea yawn
","The film is basically unnecessary.  I doubt that anyone who has seen ""Das Boot"" will prefer this film.  The characters have personal conflicts which seem to have been devised by a computer.  Apparently the producers thought that stealing the Enigma machine and thereby saving the free world is not enough of a goal--the characters must also attain personal redemption. <br/><br/>The costuming and editing are confusing in the initial confrontation on the submarine, and it is hard to follow the action.  But this confusion is soon overshadowed by the increasingly unbelievable plot developments and the convenient durability of a certain U-boat.  <br/><br/>The most unforgivable transgression is that this film manages to make Matthew McConaughey and Jon Bon Jovi look unattractive."
"wryterjccc","6","0","1","27 April 2000"," Too many depth charge scenes.
","This was a great premise for a movie, but I felt that the characters weren't developed enough, and the plot was very light. All those depth charge scenes got very boring. Overall, a good evening's entertainment, but nothing to write home about."
"JohnnyKo","7","0","1","27 April 2000"," Male Perspective...
","Before I saw the movie, I asked a bunch of male co-workers if they thought the movie would be any good. One replied, ""Has there ever been a bad submarine movie?""<br/><br/>Good point, well argued!<br/><br/>The movie is far from being ""great,"" such as Das Boot, but it was NOT bad. I guess that answers my co-worker's question."
"Amy-49","Null","0","1","26 April 2000"," Great film...but
","I would rather have seen something a little closer to the actual events: specifically the fact that the British were the first to recover an Enigma machine.  Aside from this one minor flaw, which in their defence is clarified before the credits, it was an excellent film.  One I would willingly pay to see again."
"nina_de_gaulle","2","0","1","26 April 2000"," Like Sub-war:see Das Boot
","This is a particularly poor film given the fact that it completely falsifies history and that there are far better World War Two moves out. Especially if you're interested in submarine warfare. Das Boot is so superior as a film, it's almost painful to watch this. The British mush be going nuts too, as in the real world they got the first Enigma machine before the U.S. was even in the war."
"Sithlord-20","5","0","1","26 April 2000"," Brings Nothing New to the Genre
","First of all, I don't care that this film bends historical fact for dramatic license.  There is no ""based on a true story"" disclaimer at the beginning of the film, and at the end a postscript gives credit to the Brits who actually recovered the real Enigma device.<br/><br/>But as a movie, ""U-571"" is plain weak.  While the acting is passable, the characters are shallow and one-dimensional.  I didn't care if they lived, died, sacrificed themselves for their shipmates or whimpered like cowards. The main ""action"" of the film is a redundant, almost endless series of depth-chargings, each louder and more obnoxious than the last.  There are no surprises and the climax is an unrealistic mish-mash of bad special effects and sappy heroism.<br/><br/>Everyone should forget this flashy mess and go rent the minimalist yet riveting ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and marvel how great acting is always better than underwater explosions."

","Historical accuracy aside (the British took the Enigma first in 1941), U-571 makes for one hell of an entertaining movie.  Jonathan Mostow has crafted a wonderful film out of a story that combines several events from WWII.  The men from a US Navy Submarine are commanded to board a German U-Boat, capture the Enigma (the coding device used to scramble German messages), and bring it back to the US.  But, as expected, problems arise.<br/><br/>The film takes the atmosphere and tension from Das Boot and combines that with the action of terrific adventure films.  Most of the members of the cast give excellent performances, especially Harvey Keitel (as cool as ever).  The battle scenes are very well done and the special effects are magnificent.  The only thing this film lacks is a commanding score.  The music suits the film well in that it isn't obtrusive like the score from Mission to Mars. However, it doesn't leave you humming, which is what a good score should do.<br/><br/>Overall, U-571 is a very well made submarine thriller.  The acting is good, the story is good, and the effects are great.  A better score would have been nice, but with a movie this gripping, the music is the last thing on your mind."
"taylor-27","6","0","1","26 April 2000"," Too noisy
","It seems like that little boat gets hit with everything but never sinks. The depth charge sceens last too long.  The charicterization was good, except for Mathew who takes his part a bit overboard toward the end.<br/><br/>I think it had too many insurmountable circumstances.  But it was still enjoyable.  I'd suggest seeing it in non-dolby/digital because it is very loud.<br/><br/>Taylor"

","Park your historical books at home.  You won't need them.  Just grab some popcorn a soda and hang on.  Once the ball starts rolling, it never stops until the end.  And, just when things are already more than tense enough, the lieutenant is given one more big responsibility - you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>A good cast, an interesting premise, fine special effects and a lot of depth charges made for a heckuva couple of hours.  Matthew McConaughey leaves his cute looks behind and comes off as a very convincing man-in-charge under the most difficult of circumstances.  Harvey Keitel does a nice understated (for Harvey) job and the rest of the crew are good at looking frightened.<br/><br/>The Americans aren't ALL heroic and, thank goodness the Germans aren't all evil.  I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as enjoyable as I found it to be. I highly recommend it."
"codyflynn","Null","0","1","24 April 2000"," Jonathan Mostow, Master of Suspense
","Jonathan Mostow is quietly making a name for himself as one of the best ""suspense"" directors in contemporary film.  What could have easily been a contrived, loud action flick from the Hollywood machine, Mostow made into a genuine, edge of your seat cinematic good time.  Intelligently directed, he makes the tension and fear so real it's palpable.  So it was no surprise to find out that he directed another great Dino DeLaurentis action/suspense film called ""Breakdown"" starring Kurt Russell.<br/><br/>His films remind you of the pure joy of watching a movie."
"luigi-17","Null","0","1","24 April 2000"," Rewatch Das Boot
","Certain images and plot conventions recirculate within film genres, such as the war film and its subgenre(sorry about the pun), the submarine film. However, when a film reproduces identical shots from other sub films (see depth charge attack from Das Boot)it indicates a certain, shall we say, poverty of the imagination.<br/><br/>Unlike Das Boot, U-571 plumbs the depths of every bad sub cliche tacked onto a tired Oedipal plot: Young, soft, exec(the inexplicably popular Matthew M) has to step up and prove to surrogate daddy-captain (the wonderful Bill Paxton who dies much too soon) that he is REALLY A MAN. Which he proves by letting men under his command die for their country.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it is really loud.<br/><br/>So save your hard-earned money and get a good subtitled (not dubbed) copy of Das Boot, the Director's Cut for your weekend warrior viewing."

","What a nice idea for a film. In 1941, HMS Bulldog (from the British Navy) salvaged a German Enigma machine from a stranded German U-boat, and consequently altered the course of the war, thanks to the decoding activities from Station X based in the heart of the English countryside.<br/><br/>Needless to say, historical fact is being ignored somewhat for US heroism. Nothing wrong with that of course if it makes an entertaining film, but if it is successful a hell of a lot of people are going to take it at face value - which would be a big mistake. (America weren't even involved in the war in 1941) Watch the excellent Channel 4 documentary ""Station X"" instead, or wait for the film of Robert Harris' novel ""Enigma""."
