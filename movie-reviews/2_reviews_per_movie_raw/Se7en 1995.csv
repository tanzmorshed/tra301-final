"Insipid_Shell","10","633","728","25 March 2002"," ""Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's""
","The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clich√©s. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br/><br/>Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br/><br/>Score 10/10"
"RedRoadster","10","233","266","6 May 2009"," A dark and disturbing masterpiece.
","It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.<br/><br/>David Fincher's story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving. Somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. Mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. Before Somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and Mills are assigned to investigate. But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante's ""The divine comedy"".<br/><br/>To begin with, Se7en appears to be a standard ""cops on the trail of a killer"" story which shouldn't be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. But as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold.<br/><br/>The two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. The older Somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. Mills, who has no respect for Somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. The further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits.<br/><br/>This film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957). Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.<br/><br/>Se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. The killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point.<br/><br/>A previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching Se7en and i completely agree. Eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher didn't pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of Alien 3. Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. He stated: ""It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it"". For the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score.<br/><br/>The Most disturbing message that Se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a Pyrrhic victory. But regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. We have no other choice.<br/><br/>""The World is a fine place and worth fighting for."" I agree with the second part."
"jpevoto","Null","396","477","13 August 1999"," Somerset's World
","Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (""This isn't going to be a happy ending"") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).<br/><br/>Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.<br/><br/>This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)<br/><br/>Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.<br/><br/>This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first."
"chvylvr80","10","482","585","15 October 2003"," Probably the greatest murder story ever
","Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.<br/><br/>
The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. <br/><br/>John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","240","291","30 April 2004"," Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever.
","Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious clich√©'s. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10"

","Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.<br/><br/> David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.<br/><br/>You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.<br/><br/>David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.<br/><br/>We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes."

","This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film.  The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt's supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.<br/><br/>The movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting.  There is a ""Pseudo-Noir"" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.<br/><br/>Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.  As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.  In this respect, the film doesn't ""preach"" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.  This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.<br/><br/>Outstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****"

","Se7En Se7en is just one of those movies that burrows deep under your skin and festers. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker have created a bleak, desolate world where there are no real heroes, only sinners. An uncompromising story, filthy, grainy visuals and terrific performances make Se7en a modern classic. Det. William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen the human spirit at its worst throughout his 34 years of police service. He finally realises he has had enough of the horrors of the world and he becomes ready for retirement. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a brash, hot-headed rookie cop who believes his big break lies in the murky, seedy unnamed metropolis. Amidst some cynicism, Sommerset takes on Mills as a partner for his last days. When two murders occur within two days of each other the duo realize that a serial killer is murdering his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. What follows is a terrifying and disturbing story of the dark side of human nature. Fincher's Noir York with endless rain, rain that fails to wash (to quote Travis Bickle) the filth off the streets, is a harsh look into urban life where decency is a rarity. Along with his cinematographer Darius Khondji, paints the screen with dark greys, blacks and yellow to hint at the rotting core of this environment. Freeman gives the film its most complex performance and moral core. His detective has grown weary of apathy and he slightly suggests an understanding of the despicable killer. On that note, Kevin Spacey delivers a chilling portrayal, a killer with a blankly human face and disturbing conviction. Writer Walker has written a cop-genre film with impeccable substance. Rather than a whodunit or an action movie, he has given birth to a story that pokes and prods at our psychic. It forces us to confront ourselves and question the next time we eat too much, or take too much time gelling our hair or even lash out in road rage. He questions our day-by-day apathy and ignorance to the savagery of human existence in a time of war, poverty, cynicism and most importantly sin."

","A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer, ""Se7en"" (along with ""Silence of the Lambs""), is something of a milestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actors including the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murders representing the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however that lifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world wise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick, Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey does his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene with Freeman and Paltrow in a caf√© which shows the depth of performances here. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world wherein it always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tight direction and atmospheric photography."

","David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking you off the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.

","Seven is directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.<br/><br/>An unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.<br/><br/>Having been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.<br/><br/>""But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever""<br/><br/>Seven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!<br/><br/>Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10"
"billreynolds","10","52","67","7 June 2005"," The best thriller ever made
","Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing. Andrew Kevin Walker created one of the most original spec screenplays of all time, but it is the kind of story traditionally used more as a writing sample than actually made into a movie. But the creative team of director David Fincher believed in this extremely dark, uncompromising story, and made it just the way Walker wrote it.<br/><br/>The story revolves around two extremely well-drawn characters, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman). In one sense their relationship is the ultimate clich√© -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though Mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place). But the contrast between these two characters is played out not for laughs or cheap drama but as the real working out of a moral question. Somerset, the lonely, cynical older detective, cares about people but has seen too much of the dark side of life to have much hope for society. Mills is not as intelligent as Somerset (kudos to Pitt for being willing to play a character that frequently looks foolish), and he lives by a simplistic belief in the power of law enforcement to change the world.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the two characters struggle with this conflict -- is human society basically rotten, and can one person do anything to make a difference? Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is. Mills is the kind of person who has never truly questioned the simple ""values"" he was raised with. Somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails.<br/><br/>In the end, it is only John Doe, the serial killer, who can teach Mills (and by extension the audience) the truth -- that this world is very often shockingly vicious and senselessly cruel. Doe and Somerset actually have similar views of society and the world, up to a point. But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>This movie is about the investigation Mills and Somerset undertake of Doe's murders, his ""sermon"" to the world through serial killing. Ultimately, Mills and Somerset can only do so much to try to stop Doe; the killer always seems at least one step ahead of them, and stays that way until the very end of the movie. In a normal Hollywood film, Mills and Somerset would ""win"" in the end by catching Doe and setting the world right again. But Andy Walker had a quite different ending in mind, and Fincher and his team take the shocking conclusion all the way to the limit of tension and drama.<br/><br/>This movie, like Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" was controversial for being violent and gruesome. Certainly there are a number of gruesome and disturbing images of murder victims' bodies, and many aspects of the story are very troubling, to say the least. But only one person is shown being killed on screen, and by far the worst of what happens in this story happens in the viewer's imagination. Unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, Reservoir Dogs or Silence of the Lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen. In direct contrast with, say Quentin Tarantino, who uses extreme violence for shock effect and to gain notoriety, Fincher actually shows less violence on screen and raises far more probing moral questions in the viewer's mind. I cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment.<br/><br/>I cannot finish this review without a word about Mr. Fincher's extraordinary visual talents. This is a man who ranks with the top handful of directors of all time in his knowledge and grasp of film-making technique. Everything from set design to lighting, selection of film stock and processing techniques, camera movement, frame composition, and editing work together to create an entirely new level of visual brilliance. Fincher's use of technique brings to mind nothing more than the work of Steven Spielberg in the 1970s, the last time a director this extraordinary burst onto the Hollywood scene. A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties. Fincher uses every one of these tools to their utmost. The technical work and supporting actors are uniformly superb. This is a movie that works on every level. Andy Walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film. This movie will rock you to the core."

The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).<br/><br/>There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.<br/><br/>Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.<br/><br/>I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way."

","This is one of those dark movies, where it's constantly raining and wet and where the light always seems to be dim. Appropriately enough, this changes to bright and shimmering heat in the very end. As a kid, I hated dark movies. But perhaps it is appropriate in this case, because Seven attempts to be a statement about humanity: no one is without sin.<br/><br/>The seven deadly sins are gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Prime examples of people committing these are being punished one by one, brutally and efficiently, by a psychopathic killer. Detectives, and reluctant partners, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are assigned to track down the killer. Needless to say, the job gets accomplished. While some might argue it is done surprisingly, I'd argue otherwise.<br/><br/>For once, I wasn't impressed with Pitt's acting. I thought Freeman did a great job. As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, provides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much center stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs. In fact, the whole movie seems to hurry through without giving key characters enough time to build up their emotional worth, particularly Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br/><br/>In the end, Seven does manage to get its point across effectively. While watching the movie itself, I thought it a bit anti-climatic, but when mulling it over later, the images echo very strongly in my mind. One of the most disturbing films I've seen."

This film was trend setting with it's dark, gritty look and opening sequence. We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today. Everything is great about this film. I guess if anything, the weakest link in the film is Pitt, who is grossly overshadowed by Freeman. But let's not look for flaws when there really aren't any. The script is intelligent and uncompromising. The direction is innovative en daring. The production-design and cinematography are top-notch.<br/><br/>Fincher is one of the big boys in Tinseltown these days. Seven is the reason why."

","I love psychological thrillers and this is one of the best I've seen. Morgan Freeman was elegant and convincing as a burnt out cop who wanted to retire but found the fascination of the job tough to let go of. Brad Pitt made the transition from cocky new guy to serious cop vry convincingly. And what can I say about Kevin Spacey who is always excellent. (Except to wonder why his name doesn't appear in the opening credits - I looked three times.) And Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife was as fresh and charming as ever. I truly enjoyed the performances of all the main cast members.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is that even when the killer is caught the suspense isn't over. In fact - it may be just beginning."

","`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man.  With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him.  However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.<br/><br/>When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise.  Yes it wasn't a great film ¬ñ but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created.  Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!<br/><br/>Se7en was his major break through ¬ñ where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold.  The story doesn't sound like much ¬ñ mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless ¬ñ the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders¬Ö..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller.  But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable¬Ö.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out.  From the start we are entombed in mood ¬ñ the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc.  The we begin to find murders ¬ñ but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest ¬ñ Genius!<br/><br/>What you don't see is more gory than what you do.  Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets better¬Öright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen.  I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.<br/><br/>Freeman is excellent as Somerset ¬ñ so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans ¬ñ he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has ¬ñ but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.<br/><br/>However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.<br/><br/>At heart this is a cop thriller ¬ñ but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","10","37","55","10 March 2007"," One Of The Greatest Thrillers Of All-Time
","In 1995 David Fincher released a perfectly constructed modern masterpiece; Se7en. One of the most exhilarating experiences of all-time and a classic to come.<br/><br/>A cop; Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) has just moved into the city with his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) in hope of finally settling down. Mills will take over the job of Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) an old cop who has seven days until his retirement begins. Both are dedicated to the badge. They are put together on the case of an obesity murder, in which a man has been forced to 'eat till he bursts'. This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it. This is just the beginning of a mass murder masterpiece crafted by the insane John Doe, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>Whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow. Se7en is far from it. Many scenes study civilisation; present civilisation. And its evil. Our society isn't a pleasant one. The film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work. Of course, its Somerset, the one with the most experience who has the best way. He tries to find out why. Why some man is killing these people using a specific punishment. While Mills tries, unsuccessfully, to find out how; by studying the crime scene for clues. He ends up bored. With the help of the library, Somerset gets closer to the murderer. It may seem as though the role of Tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything. She is the one who brings the men to being more personal with each other. Notice how in the dinner scene she is the one to introduce them by name. All making the climax tense and difficult.<br/><br/>Mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch. He has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works. Somerset has never even fired his weapon. He sees the evil round him. And he wants to leave it. Though he is a cop so he has the permission to do something about it. But the problem is, he isn't doing anything about it. John Doe is. The reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin. There is now nothing stopping us. It has become a common factor of life. And there should be. That is why John Doe thinks his behaviour is OK. But the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there. This is the harsh reality we live in.<br/><br/>There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Pride. Lust. Envy. Wrath. And seven ways to die.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is amazing as John Doe, portraying insanity perfectly. One of the greatest supporting performances of all-time already. And he's only in it for half an hour. Brad Pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the Hollywood effect of the film though I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. Morgan Freeman played his role with the greatest concentration. Throughout he needed a look of woe on his face. And he did just that.<br/><br/>The writing is extraordinary. The genius, Andrew Kevin Walker took an interesting subject and created an instant classic. But most credit has to go to Fincher. Who took aspects you wouldn't even think of looking at and filming it. Together they project a deep film on our screens that no-one should miss. In one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate. A feast for the brain. One of the most imaginative scripts of the 90s. Fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film. Whether it be steady-cam for the slow and easy parts or the hand-held camera for the adrenalin pumping scenes.<br/><br/>The cinematography is what makes this an excellent movie. Everything is dark. The world out there is rough, raw, grim and gritty. It does just that. The effect it makes is astounding and truly works. The sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. As that's what the film tries to achieve. The opening credits are upon the greatest segment of film I have ever seen. The jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching. Every scene, due to the effort put in it, is masterful and is what makes the film a joy to watch and observe.<br/><br/>Se7en reveals the best glimpse we have seen of the disturbing underworld. One of my favourites and always will be.<br/><br/>10/10"

","First off, I KNOW that I'm gonna get grief and derision from most here because, I'm sorry, but I don't really think this film is the be all, end all that everyone thinks it is.<br/><br/>YES, it is well made, directed, and acted; and the lighting is sharp which fits the nihilistic 'Noir'ish mood. And, yes, it was indeed pretty much the first of it's kind which set a gritty, dark tone for crime films to come. Fine... I really have no specific negatives about the movie. HOWEVER... At the end of the day did I personally really find it THAT entertaining...? Not really... Yes, the unexpected ending is both shocking and dramatic, but does it honestly make sense...? ***SPOILERS Keven Spacey clearly and explicitly states the reasons why he has committed these murders: That people are doing all these very bad things everywhere all the time and people just don't care; so, he is setting 'the example' of what people should be doing to punish these 'sinners'. Okay... Now we are supposed to believe then that out of the blue he kills a COMPLETELY innocent woman (who is also pregnant) which to me the SOLE purpose is for an (admittedly extremely dramatic and shocking) plot device to set up Mills to kill him...??? Come on... I don't buy it. It is TOTALLY contrary to the very motivation of Kevin Spacey's character. But yeah, what an ending, sure... *** END SPOILERS<br/><br/>Anyway, the question is, what do we find truly entertaining about a film? Putting stylistic touches or technical competence aside (such as visual effects, special or moody lighting, excellent cinematography, sound design, etc.) to me it primarily is this: How engaging or absorbing is the plot or story? How does it carry us along as it develops? How involving and complex are the characters and how interesting is the interplay and relationships between them? Now, these are just basics for most films. I realize that there are special genres or styles that we enjoy individually simply because we like those types of films (1950's Sci Fi, Slasher Horror Films, Ultra-Cheeeeezy Kung Fu movies, etc.) But, with this film at the end of the day what do we have...? Sure, we have this ghoulish, creepy, dark story of a killer who is killing by way of the 7 Deadly Sins. Okay... Characters...? Well, yes, all the actors concerned do a fine job; no real complaints there. BUT...! How deep or complex are they? How fascinating are they really? How engaging and intriguing are their interactions? To me personally, I felt that both the plot and character development to be rather shallow and superficial. I mean, WHAT do we really know about them? How deeply are we drawn into their lives and relationships? I'm sorry, but to me I really don't see a whole hell of a lot going on here other than a bunch of neatly lit, dark and somewhat moody scenes with little or no real substance. And the overall 'message' we are left with? The quite trite, common, and ultimately boring 'No one cares because the evil that people do is so arbitrary and horrible, so what's the point?' Yeah, real depth there...<br/><br/>So, yeah, the film is well put together and there's nothing really 'BAD' about it per se; but, I do not feel myself that after all is said and done that you walk away from it with much of anything. There are darker and FAR more entertaining Horror films out there; and there are also dark, gritty, and INFINITELY more complex and engaging crime films out there. Films where afterward you actually feel like you have either been truly entertained by a story that makes you think and guess and wonder and also with characters who make you feel and care MUCH more about them because they are portrayed in a better, fuller, and more complex way.<br/><br/>So, do I like dark, ambiguous, moody films? YOU BET! Do I like the dark, even nihilistic overtones of period FILM NOIR? ABSOLUTELY! Do I even like films with little substance BUT have TONS of style and mood (a la David Lynch, say) YES SIREE!!! But to me, this film, although of good quality, honestly strikes me as a 'One-Note' simplistic film and I just do NOT quite buy into the ending at all; it is merely a completely nonsensical plot device to give us a slam-bang ending. <br/><br/>I mean, just a random example that comes to mind, I've seen Sandra Bullock's crime film 'MURDER BY NUMBERS' like 3 times and I've fully enjoyed it each time. You have a main character that is extremely complex and engaging; you have antagonists that are thoroughly riveting and with a layered relationship that is completely fascinating. And, you have a story that as it unreels truly draws you into the psyche, feelings, and motivations of the characters. And this is just an off the top, fairly above average example; nothing Earth shaking or anything, but just a simple example of what a movie is SUPPOSED to be. Entertaining...<br/><br/>But, I will say this though... It has to have probably THE best opening credit sequence and background song ever!!!<br/><br/>For this film though, I seriously doubt that I would ever really have the desire to sit down and watch it again...<br/><br/>*** EDIT (2015.02.14)<br/><br/>Heh, I'm actually thinking about giving this another chance and watching it again... :) I'm curious if my impressions will still be the same..."

","I went through these comments because I was trying to figure out why people like this movie so much. I wondered if I had missed or misinterpreted something, but now it just looks like these viewers are way too impressed by a few sophomoric ""themes"" and a bunch of cutesy ""twists.""<br/><br/>Direction/atmosphere: the atmosphere is the movie's greatest strength. It's certainly vivid, though it's so relentless and there is so little variety in the movie's mood that it becomes a drag. Anyway, stuff like rain and good lighting are nothing without a good script, so moving on . . .<br/><br/>Characters: come on, classic Hollywood ""mismatched buddies"" movie, only without the slapstick. The young, overeager cop and the ""jaded"" cop who slowly learns how to deal with him. Give me a break. There's nothing here that I haven't seen in 500 other cop movies. They just stuck this million-year-old and million-times-used Hollywood trope in the middle of a serial killer movie. Bravo. As for whether John Doe is a ""great villain"" (I can't believe people would compare him to Keyser Soze or Hannibal Lecter), more on that in the ""themes.""<br/><br/>Plot/twists: What exactly do people think is ""clever"" about haivng each murder correspond to one of the 7 deadly sins? The cleverest one is the first one--the killer makes the guy ""glutton himself to death"" by eating until his stomach bursts--and that isn't exactly mind-blowing, but once it's out of the way and you get the basic idea, all the others are 5x less elegant. It would be cooler if the killer had actually found a way to *truly* turn people's own faults against them--i.e., trapping the ""Greed"" guy by making him put himself in harm's way when tempted by the promise of money, or killing the ""Lust"" victim just by tempting them with an attractive but diseased person. Instead, all of these murders come down to the murderer holding a gun to the person and ordering them to act something out that in some (often convoluted) way has something to do with the sin. For lust, he kills a woman while she's having sex. This is supposed to be clever/creative? <br/><br/>And it gets weaker, not stronger, at the end. **Spoilers alert, I guess.** The ""envy"" victim doesn't die of envy--instead, he kills her and explains to the cop that he's guilty of envy. How elegant. The final twist--making the guy kill him out of wrath--is the cleverest, and is cute, but that's about all I can say about it. It certainly doesn't live up to the ridiculous buildup they give it during that car ride when they say this will be a ""masterpiece"" and ""remembered by everyone."" A killer killed 6 people in contrived ways that somehow had something to do with the 6 sins, and then for the 7th he got someone to kill him out of wrath. I mean . . . not bad, but certainly not great. Plus, that last scene doesn't even make sense. If I were Morgan Freeman, I would say ""Hey, put the gun down and just beat the guy up."" That would be infinitely more satisfying anyway, and it would be pretty freaking easy to claim it was in self-defense afterward . . . good thing for John Doe's little scheme that they didn't think of it. Anyway, the ending is cute, but not the kind of ""mind-blowing ending"" that would make up for an otherwise ho-hum movie.<br/><br/>Themes: OK, I have a major beef with anyone who calls this movie ""profound"" or the killer's philosophical view ""interesting."" We all know there are lots of people doing bad things in the world, but: (a) it seems to me that the ""seven deadly sins"" are entirely the wrong place to focus, as evidenced by John Doe's unconvincing ""You mean a guy didn't deserve to die for being so fat it was gross?"" Come on--things like gluttony and sloth are things that you should stay away from for your own sake, but in the scheme of things that people should be killed for, they should be all the way at the bottom. You're telling me that sloth is worse than deceptiveness? Or, say, racism? I don't even think there's anything wrong with lust. And wrath can be justified. (b) Granted that we know lots of people do bad things, what exactly does it accomplish OR illustrate OR express to pick out 7 people (one of whom wasn't even guilty of any of the 7 sins) and kill them in ways that graphically illustrate the 7 sins? Is this supposed to show how sinning will kill you? (Only if there's a serial killer holding a gun to your mouth making you act it out . . .) Or just reinforce the message ""Hey, sinning is bad?"" <br/><br/>They try to present John Doe as this mysterious, rational, calculating, intriguing man completing a masterpiece, but I end up seeing him as a nutcase whose ""project"" makes no sense and doesn't express anything meaningful. A truly chilling character is one who scares me not just by being violent, but through the idea that he has some sort of special wisdom or intelligence that threatens my view of myself as ""normal"" and ""right."" Keyser Soze (a true mastermind) has this. Hannibal Lecter does as well. Some idiot who kills 7 random people because he's off on a Bible-beating rant that's barely coherent? Later guys, I'm gonna go watch The Usual Suspects."

","Two cops - one young, one old - chase a serial killer that is leaving a paper trail.<br/><br/>This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain. <br/><br/>Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.<br/><br/>The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!<br/><br/>This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?<br/><br/>Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them. Why is this? Maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? When you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. Simple."

","After years of experiencing dull, formulaic, clich√®d so-called thrillers, it's always satisfying when a genuinely great movie comes along. I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher ¬ñ after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien¬≥' ¬ñ firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. Reserved and hardened Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. His replacement, impulsive Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). Both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, John Doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. As the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. Throughout the film, Brad Pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen.<br/><br/>David Fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. Despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. The graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany John Doe's horrific acts of murder. The rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. Even as 'Se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act ¬ñ shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines ¬ñ the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before.<br/><br/>Our villain is anonymously titled John Doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by Kevin Spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. Unlike your typical serial killer, John Doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. In one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. John Doe's entire life has been dedicated to Mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. John Doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. Spacey is very good in the role, though I can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had I not been familiar with much of his later film work.<br/><br/>The most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when John Doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find Detectives Somerset and Mills waiting patiently outside his door. However, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are John Doe himself (""Envy"") and David Mills (""Wrath""). In order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as Mills had suggested during the car-ride, Doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of Tracy, and so enticed Mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting Mills to commit the seventh sin. Some have argued that, since Mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of Doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?"

","`Se7en' is all about harsh style and gruesome substance ¬ñ while it's probably not a film for everyone (particularly the squeamish), it is one of the most moody, memorable films made in recent years.  A sense of absolute dread pervades each and every scene, either from the powerful words and deeds of the characters or from the dreary sets and atmosphere created by director David Fincher.  There's a quote from the film `The Crow' that goes, `It can't rain all the time' . . . well, in the world of `Se7en', it can ¬ñ and it does.<br/><br/>`Se7en' is the story of world-weary police detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a man who's probably seen more terror and sadness in his lifetime than any man should ever be forced to see.  Partnered with the young cop David Mills (Brad Pitt), Somerset is assigned to find the serial killer known only as John Doe.  The horrific crimes of Doe are patterned after the Seven Deadly Sins ¬ñ for Gluttony, one victim was literally forced to eat until his internal organs exploded; for another, Greed, the victim is forced to cut an actual pound of flesh away from his own body.  John Doe is a highly literate, intelligent killer; but so is Somerset, and an astounding game of cat-and-mouse filled with unexpected twists ensues as the hunt for Doe gets underway.<br/><br/>Andrew Kevin Walker's script for `Se7en' is absolutely dazzling.  It's smart and powerful, and doesn't pull any punches ¬ñ the bodies, maimed and tortured, inexorably begin to pile up in graphic fashion, and Somerset and Mills aren't allowed to minimize the horrors they're forced to find.  Each new corpse brings a true feeling of revulsion . . . and of dread, as the realization hits that another body will be forthcoming unless John Doe is found.  The story is filled with misdirection and red herrings; just as the audience starts to think that the unfolding events of the film are starting to become predictable, the film lurches further into the unknown darkness, keeping the edge of uneasiness that pervades `Se7en' fresh . . . and constant.  Kudos also to David Fincher's stylish direction ¬ñ this may be Fincher's best film to date.  The entire look of the film is dark and gloomy, almost a suicidal form of 1940s film noir, evoking a despairing atmosphere that never relents or shows a glimmer of optimism.  Combine that with Fincher's knack for turning even the most mundane scene into a nailbiter ¬ñ `Se7en' features a scene with Somerset and Mills standing together in an empty field, and yet the scene is still incredibly tense ¬ñ and `Se7en' becomes an exceptionally powerful, disturbing film that's difficult to turn away from.<br/><br/>The cast?  Also excellent.  Pitt is perfect as the cocky young detective Mills, mixing together the right amount of bravado and testosterone at the start of the film, and then later tempering that swagger with cynicism ¬ñ and fear ¬ñ as the movie progresses forward.  In a way, Mills is a surrogate for the audience; he starts out thinking that he knows exactly what's going to happen but as events slowly unfold before his horrified eyes, it starts to dawn on Mills that he is mentally unprepared he is for a maniac like John Doe.  Pitt handles the decline of Mills from overconfident to completely paranoid with great skill.  The killer John Doe (I won't reveal his name here; the actor's uncredited in the film, so I won't mention it either on the off chance that you haven't read it elsewhere) is simply great.  He's a quiet, intense figure who is Machiavellian with his calculated words and actions.  Many other actors might've just mimicked Hannibal Lecter to portray John Doe . . . but the awesome performance in `Se7en' of the uncredited actor is actually better ¬ñ and more unsettling ¬ñ than Lecter himself.  The best performance of the film, however, may belong to Morgan Freeman as Somerset.  Freeman is perhaps the only person capable to tracking down John Doe, simply because he has seen so much sadness and horror before. Nothing Doe does, no matter how vile,  is able to derail the detective's efforts.  As Somerset, Freeman imbues the character with a certain tired, weary attitude . . . but still lying somewhere beneath that attitude is hope, and that small glimmer of hope, along with the wisdom of experience, is what prevents `Se7en' from spiraling into complete despair.   Somerset's hope, small as it is, becomes the audience's hope as well.<br/><br/>With the possible exception of the very end of the film ¬ñ for all its daring audacity, Fincher chooses to play it a little too safe at the film's conclusion ¬ñ  `Se7en' proves to be an uncompromising tour de force of modern horror.  If you're not easily bothered by graphic horror and gore, then go watch this film.  You certainly won't be disappointed.  Grade: A"

I thought it would be a cool movie like other Pitt films, but it was so dark and has so much more than other films of this genre.<br/><br/>Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on his last week in duty and he's all set to retire when the case of a strange death is made his responsibility to solve. Though all others think that it was a psycho who was responsible for the death, Somerset has his doubts, he thinks that the murderer is simply a clever and disgusted man who is trying to rid the society of evil. In many ways, his and the killer's view about the degrading society is alike, except that Somerset wants to leave the city for the country life and the killer is taking action. Enter Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), the young and dynamic sleuth who has a positive view on the society, and he is made the partner to Somerset. Then onwards, there are more disgusting, shocking deaths with the seven sins as its identity. The seven sins are - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Pride, Lust and Wrath. While Mills believes the killer is an insane person, Somerset tells him that he is a very clever, normal man and nowhere near insane with his precise killings and no clues to be found anywhere. The killer is a John Doe (played brilliantly in a cameo role by Kevin Spacey) and it takes every last bit of Somerset's and Mills willpower to not get carried away by the magnitude of the brutal, methodical killings. Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wife of Mills and they are very much in love. Will the detectives be able to stop this killer who claims himself to be a servant of God and who will bear the brunt of this maniac's insanity eventually - The society or the detectives? <br/><br/>David Fincher is at the helm of this amazing film. This could have been a routine cop-killer story, but he does not even step into the tired and old Hollywood clich√©s and is not afraid to make this a dark, unique and depressing tale about the human life. Also, he does so in a very powerful and clever way. I was racking my brains to figure out who the killer was, as in films like these, they would show the killer beforehand. And in the end, it was true; the killer had come in contact with the detectives. Morgan plays the old and more worldly wise man, rather in contrast to Pitt's character who is a hot-head at times. No matter how insanely talented Pitt is, the press always seems to give more importance to his charming looks and relationship with Jolie (back then, it was Jennifer Aniston). Tracy is genuinely portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow. She played a major part in bringing Mills and Somerset together. I loved her scene where she introduces each other. Though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, I got over it as the ending was so emotional and I cried (I am a straight guy and I am not ashamed to say that I cried) when Pitt finds out what was in the box. I could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean I didn't get emotional at that point. I was hoping against hope that it wasn't what I was thinking. But, it was and I cried. Don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. But, the screenplay is one of the best I have seen in this genre. Also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. When John Doe tells Mills to become wrath, I got chills running up and down my spine.<br/><br/>I still consider Fight Club to be the best Pitt-Fincher movie, but I can't ignore this brilliantly made movie. Though not everyone will like this film (case-in-point, my Brad Pitt fan friend), because of the dark overtone, I loved it as it isn't flashy and predictable like most movies of this genre, and actually was very brilliant.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tjb103","9","16","25","21 February 2005"," An Eulogy of 'Seven': The modern Shakespearean tragedy
","When audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by William Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. It was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. The sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as Desdemona in 'Othello'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have Iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature ('Othello' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (Horatio perhaps in 'Hamlet', or maybe Father Laurence in 'Romeo and Juliet'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play's violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. I believe that Fincher's 'Seven' is the modern Shakespearean tragedy, the modern 'Titus Andronicus', if you will. The feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in Seven (which are damn good credits I might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great Shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why I think that films such as Seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. Not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as Dante's 'Inferno' and Geoffrey Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales' - so I would be inclined to try and influence more English professors to watch this film. <br/><br/>Now here's the part where I say 'Yeah Seven, woo, it's awesome! Yeah!'. I'm just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie. The script, for one, is great. Original, funny in places, exciting, sexy...the list is endless really. Well played Andrew Kevin Walker; the boy done good. Next we have the acting which, to put in a Romantic sense, is sublime: people may argue that Morgan Freeman can only play one character, but I think it's similar to the situation with Hugh Grant (his one persona may be a bumbling, lovable fool, but he is damn good at it) and it's the same for Morgan. Here he is at his fatherly, worldly-wise detective best, and the comic double act of Freeman and Pitt is essential to the film. Pitt's performance is probably just about overshadowed by his portrayal of Tyler Durden in Fincher's other chef d'oeuvre 'Fight Club', but in no way is this a demeaning statement to Pitt. He is, or was, one of my favourite 'younger' actors (that's the Ed Norton, Johnny Depp ring, as opposed to the Pacino/De Niro/Hoffman circle of expertise) until 2005 came about - Ocean's 12, to put it mildly, disappointed me greatly. However, let's think positively: with Seven and Fight Club and Snatch, I'm sure Brad has something in store for fans like me. Gwyneth Paltrow is probably the unsung hero, or heroine, of the film and ironically she's the one who gets it worst (or does she? Refer back to tragedy point about sympathy). The words 'never better' spring to mind when thinking about Paltrow's 'Tracey'. There's someone else I'm not mentioning here, despite the 'contains spoiler' tick, but let's just say he/she/it provides, in my eyes, the greatest twist OF ALL TIME. Last but not least, David Fincher is where it's at. His undoubtedly cool style is the reason why this film is so...cool, for want of a better word. Thanks to him, Morgan Freeman is cool, Gwyneth Paltrow is cool, the man who works in that horrible place where the 'Pride' crime takes place is cool, even the man/woman/thing with no name is cool (to a certain extent). <br/><br/>To conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself 'That has to be the best movie I've ever seen'. 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'L.A. Confidential' are prime examples. In my opinion, 'Seven' epitomises this type of film."
"prvteye-1","5","58","109","3 August 2004"," Didn't live up to the hype
","I won't bother with spoilers, as there are plenty of them in the other comments.<br/><br/>When all was said and done, my wife and I looked at each other and said ""This is the scariest movie ever?""<br/><br/>What I saw was a run-of-the-mill ""insane killer gets tracked down by the older, smart cop and the younger, gung-ho cop while manipulating everybody in the process"". Perhaps I've become jaded, but I found nothing here that was particularly scary or mind-bending. A clever nut-job leads the police on a mad chase, punishing people as ""sinners"". The only difference between this and a half-dozen other serial killer movies is the theme of the killings and the fact that the killer turns himself in 3/4's of the way into the story.<br/><br/>This leads to the ""twist"" ending that seems to remain with so many people. I didn't find the ""twist"" horrific, though. I simply found it jarring. It didn't fit and it didn't particularly surprise me either. Once the killer decided to let Mills live, you knew he was going to mess with him somehow. The only surprise is the degree of what he did. As far as I'm concerned, they could have dispensed with the whole ""wrath"" setup and ended with John Doe's words to Mills - ""You're only sitting here because I ALLOWED you to live and you'll know that every time you look in the mirror.""<br/><br/>Instead, they had to go for a ""shocker"" ending. This is the ""twist"" ending that supposedly makes the movie.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though - The ending doesn't fit the killer's MO. We're given every reason to believe that John Doe is clever, capable, and highly intelligent. He's on a mission. He believes in his mission. He punishes the guilty for their sins, not the innocent. Why, then, does he pick a completely innocent stranger and use her as a vehicle to brand himself as personification of Envy? If he really was envious of Mills (a fact that is highly doubtful), he was already deserving of punishment so why kill an innocent person to make the point? How does the manipulation of Mills into becoming Wrath actually punish Mills for having committed the sin of Wrath?<br/><br/>None of these things make any logical sense within the framework of the story. The ending is completely out of synch with everything we've learned about the killer, including his own statements. All you can do is shrug your shoulders and say ""Well, you can't expect an insane killer to be logical."" and that just doesn't sit right with me. Not after the buildup we were given concerning John Doe.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie. If you want to see a taut, disturbing film in this style (sans the insane serial killer) then rent ""8 Millimeter"" instead."
"area01","Null","3","3","28 February 2003"," John Doe - Right or Wrong?
","With so many reviews on this great movie, I thought I would take a singular track, and examine one character of the film - John Doe.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays John Doe - the serial killer chased by the two detectives. There is a neat twist in the way John Doe is captured, but the real character development comes when he is taken to where ""two bodies are buried"" at the end of the movie. He requests that only the two detectives accompany him, and they question him during the car ride. This is a fantastic scene, where we are given the opportunity to listen to the reasons why the serial killer murdered his victims.<br/><br/>The intriguing piece of this scene is that the film-makers make a sympathetic case for John Doe, and give Spacey the chance to show off his acting talent. To try and elicit a sympathetic audience response for Doe, after all the horror of the murders and the trawl through his dark alien world, is a tall order indeed. I feel that Spacey does a remarkably job of this, with understated acting and a spaced-out, slightly bored feel to the character - just right for a sociopath who feels he above the moral restrictions of the common man.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the argument is that Sin has become so common-place that we have become numb to it, and indifferent to the every-day horrors that surround us. Doe has taken a stance and his murders will shock us and change this situation - we will puzzle over his seven murders, and look again at Sloth, Greed, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Pride and Wrath. There is a religious under-current to the argument, but Doe accepts that he had carried out the murders, rather than hiding behind the explanation of a external dominant force. He also indicates that Mills (Brad Pitt's character) is very similar to himself, and might descend into murder if there were no rules or laws. Perhaps Mills is meant to represent ""everyman"", and that there is a tiny piece of Doe in all of us? In fact - this is the only time when Doe becomes animated - as if convincing Mills as to his logic is of importance and worth heated discussion.<br/><br/>Of course, the problem with the above is that Doe uses the ultimate sin, murder, to punish lesser sins. So the argument really makes no sense - but the pacing, camera-work, dialogue and acting of the scene makes for a first-class piece of cinema. I suppose only someone who has the same physiological make-up that Doe has would agree that he is right. There is no reason given as to what made Doe the way he is - he is an almost blank character, showing little emotion or remorse for his murders.<br/><br/>
This scene and character interaction is meant to make us consider the level of sin in our society - I think the prevalence of greed, envy, etc is out of control, but has become such a fabric of modern living that there is nothing we can do about it - apart from living your life to your own moral code."
"slightheadwound","10","8","11","28 December 2016"," Se7en
","I grew up watching suspense thrillers with my dad. He started me on Columbo and then on to the good stuff like Silence of the Lambs, Dog Day Afternoon and Manhunter. I always thought I could predict what was gonna happen in a movie until I saw Se7en, with Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, and Morgan Freeman. It follows a young rookie detective as he gets thrown headlong into a nasty career in homicide. Se7en is a nail-biting suspense thriller that made me think differently about detective flicks and how to watch them. As a younger movie goer, I remember thinking I'd never seen anything like it and it moved at a pace I'd learn to love in later movies. It definitely had a positive impact on my view of filmmaking. One of my favorites, for sure."
"youllneverbe","9","8","11","25 February 2009"," One of the best Serial Killer films ever made
","""Se7en"" (1995) Dir: David Fincher<br/><br/>There's no cinematic theme I can think of that has run the gamut from Trash to High Art (via Blockbuster) quite like the Serial Killer movie. Throughout the history of the medium, many of these films have failed to captivate large audiences the way that ""Se7en"" did and continues to do, usually because they were either shamelessly exploitative or far too deliberately psychological in their approach for most viewers. It's a tough balance for a filmmaker to strike, but with ""Se7en"" David Fincher made it look so simple. It is one of the best Serial Killer movies ever made.<br/><br/>Part of the reason film-goers consider Freeman, Pitt and Spacey so highly today is because of ""Se7en"". All three actors excel in their roles. Freeman's Detective Somerset is a week away from retirement when he becomes involved, alongside his own replacement Detective Mills (Pitt), in what is surely the most horrific multiple murder case of his long career. Mills is determined not to shy away from his first case in town, and is shown to be more impulsive than the erudite Somerset, who immediately connects the killings to several great literary works including ""The Divine Comedy"" and the writings of St Thomas Aquinas. They are always lagging behind the killer, walking solemnly through endless downpours to survey the crime scene of these increasingly sick murders, barely able to grasp the calculated depravity of the man they are chasing.<br/><br/>There are brief meditations on human apathy by both Freeman's character and the killer himself but aside from these, ""Se7en"" is essentially plot- and character-driven. This works to its great advantage - too much philosophy would have affected the momentum of the film, which is expertly weighted and allowed to accumulate at the right points. Nothing is clich√©d, and there are no simplistic 'red herrings' to stretch the action out. It is a thoroughly modern crime film that borrows the religious themes from Horror and parts of its aesthetic from Film Noir, successfully widening its appeal in the process.<br/><br/>I've learnt to slightly concede in my critical judgement over years of watching silent films, art films, propaganda films, slow-moving European epics, counterculture movies et cetera, and so part of the reason I enjoyed ""Se7en"" so much is that I didn't need to concede anything while watching it. Quite the opposite, I was never anything but totally gripped by it. This is the power of really decent American film-making when it successfully balances visual style, directorial control, individual performances and, above all, a great story (which I won't spoil for you any further by elaborating upon in this review!)"
"tripwires","Null","8","11","15 November 2001"," Oh, my god...
","(This review may contain spoilers)<br/><br/>I'll just go right ahead and say this: Kevin Spacey is phenomenal. His portrayal of a serial killer is perhaps the best I've seen. He was only on screen towards the end of the film, but for me personally, he stole the movie. John Doe's eerily slow way of speaking (unless agitated) and his blank, vacant stare will more or less linger in the audience's minds for a while. I've not seen much of Spacey, only in this and ""L.A. Confidential"", which got me interested in him, but John Doe has made me a fan. He is amazing, and easily surpasses the two leads, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is definitely one of the most intense, disgusting and intriguing thriller I've seen for a long time. Unlike recent thrillers (""The Bone Collector"" instantly springs to mind), it features a killer whose motive murder is believable and understandable, and not completely laughable like ""The Bone Collector"". He's a man who appears to be as ordinary as the next person, someone whom you wouldn't look at twice on the streets, but underneath that exterior lies a dark side. The film can be looked at an exploration of the darker side of the human mind (which is also what ""8MM"" did, and it should only make sense, as it is written by the same person), and John Doe is the right person to pick. Throughout history we have seen people like him, the most obvious being Jack the Ripper. For those who are interested, the character of John Doe is able to shed some light on the inner workings of some serial killers and their lines of thought. As twisted and sick as it may be, at least then one'd be able to understand.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman gave a good performance, but Brad Pitt annoyed me half the time. I liked him a whole lot better in ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Interview With the Vampire"". Gwyneth Paltrow...is not an actress I like. Hell, I'm being generous already calling her an actress. Since her character is crucial to the plot, I will just forget I've ever seen her in the movie.<br/><br/>Andrew Kevin Smith is extremely creative, pure and simple. The victims of envy and wrath was just brilliant. I admire him a lot for being able to think of that; it was totally unexpected, and when John Doe utters ""become wrath"", I felt this intense chill which can only be interpreted as admiration for the writer on my part. The setting, music, lighting, and basically the entire atmosphere of the film fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Some scenes in ""Se7en"" made me sick to my stomach (rotting and talking corpses, anyone?), but in a movie that deals with a theme like that, those scenes become necessary.<br/><br/>Definitely watch ""Se7en"", if it's only to witness Spacey's brilliant performance. An amazing thriller."

","i love this film, it is the ultimate thriller film, everything about se7en is brilliant. the cast are well picked and make the best contributions, the main characters Somerset and Mills are portrayed perfectly through Freeman and Pitt. in my opinion this is both Pitt and Freeman's best film, they still have not outshines there fantastic performances. Paltrow as mills wife was a good choice though there are a few other actresses that could have played this part, though i think that what paltrow brought to the role was the fragile emotional side of the character, so i am pleased that she played this part so well. the director is my favourite of all time, Mr David Fincher! he is a fantastic director, not just for this film but for his other films like fight club. he gets fantastic results from his cast and crew and makes the perfect film. and as i'm a budding editor myself i have to mention the fantastic edit on the film, by the editor Richard Francis-Bruce, i do love the edit on seven as he cut at hit points and generally did well.<br/><br/>if you haven't watched it watch it, if you've seen it seen it again! i certainly will."

","At first, I was a little hesitant about taking time out of my life to see Seven. I mean, I am a busy person... but this film was well worth my time... Perhaps the best Brad Pitt film that I have seen, this film involves two detectives (Pitt and Freeman) going after a delusional killer (Kevin Spacey) who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, lust, etc... Spacey takes pride in his killings and leaves clues for the police, similar to ""Son of Sam"" killer David Berkowitz when he murdered six women in New York City in the 1970's (""Summer of Sam""= another great film)... This was an intense thriller that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish...<br/><br/>Movies generally take a lot to keep me interested, and I am generally a fan of comedies and action flicks. But Seven was different.... it was a fantastic thriller that kept you thinking and waiting to see what happens as Pitt and Freeman chase down the barbaric killer who feels that he is doing ""God's deed""... This film is a must-see!! My only regret is that I had did not see it until 10 years after its theatrical release... Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments..."

","'He is preaching¬Ö.punishing'.<br/><br/>Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage. <br/><br/>It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.<br/><br/>Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shitty¬Öand we get used to them"".<br/><br/>This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.<br/><br/>There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.<br/><br/>This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen. <br/><br/>Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do¬Ö.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.<br/><br/>No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>What a great boon these DVDs are! -- where we get to view and review with comments from the creators.<br/><br/>Sometimes the creative artist is a poor authority for the depth of their own art. So it is with some interest that I check if what I have seen was what the director thought he put there. Often, I find them simply working on intuition. But the better performing artists are different. They must always intend -- if they do not intend a specific feel or effect then it simply is not there. That's why when a DVD commentary involves an actor it is of particular interest.<br/><br/>In this DVD, we hear Pitt, who really commits to delivering, who worries, who prepares, who sublimates self in order to create an image of himself in your mind. And we hear Freeman who is arrogant, demanding of you and not of him, offering a here-I-am take-it-or-leave-it style of acting, which he calls `intuitive.' This really explains a lot for me. It's why Freeman is a negative attractor for any film I consider, and Pitt the other way around.<br/><br/>Either way, Spacey is the only one that connects with his character, and he's given a relatively simple job. <br/><br/>I admit that this story moved well, engaging by shock and unexpected moves when I first saw it. But on repeated viewings, substantial sloppiness gets in the way. What remains is the very fine lighting. I think `Fight Club,' was much the superior film. This one hardly rates any celebration."

","I can't remember the last movie I saw that was this full of crap. How did they convince that cast this story would be anything other than the ""t-shirt""/""movie of the week"" Brad Pitt's character said it was going to be? The performances were fine (particularly Freeman's and Spacey's). The script, however, was a travesty.<br/><br/>First, the consistency of the killings is completely muddled. The first five murders were committed by Spacey's character (""John Doe""--how original) because of what he perceives to be the sins committed by those he's killed. OK so far. The 6th murder (of Paltrow's character) is also done by Doe, but not because of a sin she's committed, rather because of the sin Doe perceives HE has committed. Got that? And the 7th murder is done by Pitt's character to Doe because of the sin Mills (Pitt) carries with him (I guess?). But even if you link the ""Envy"" murder of Doe by Mills as one of the 7 sinners who ""deserved"" to be killed for their sin, why was Paltrow's character killed again? And along with that, why does Pitt's character get to live for the sin of Wrath? <br/><br/>Another plot point that I don't think can be overlooked... If Doe was the religious lunatic he was presented to be, the murder of Paltrow's character and her unborn child would surely have been the 6th AND 7th murders. Doe was aware she's pregnant. Of course, how do you link an unborn child with a deadly sin? I see the writer's problem. His solution was a train wreck.<br/><br/>I also didn't buy at all that Doe was actually envious of Pitt's character. It made for a quirky plot twist, but it seemed so inconsistent for that character. It also didn't make much sense from a plot perspective (see paragraph above).<br/><br/>Have I got to 7 things yet? Did I mention the silly 7 in the title? How about the constant allusions to Somerset's knife, the knife tossing, etc... which turns out to be needed most in the film to open a box? <br/><br/>I guess if you make the assumption that John Doe is insane, then this master plan might make sense to the audience: He's insane, his plan probably shouldn't make sense. But to think that his plan worked, succeeded, was effective or even consistent at all (as Somerset's character implies by telling Mills not to kill Doe and fulfill Doe's plan), is giving WAY to much credit to the writer, and almost no credit to the audience. <br/><br/>I recently saw and reviewed Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" which would fall into the same psychological/horror/thriller genre as ""Se7en"". And as much as I was affected by ""Funny Games"" and impressed by Haneke's vision and direction, I said that I couldn't responsibly recommend it. After seeing ""Se7en"", however, I finally found Haneke's target audience. If ""Se7en"" is on your recommended must-see list, then ""Funny Games"" is really the must-see movie for you."

","I finally saw this movie after seeing how highly regarded this was on IMDb. I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I thought the plot was interesting, but it quickly became see-through as the movie continued. This is certainly not as good as people believe it to be, and I found it to be dark and disturbing, and without any real ""mission"" to speak of. Usually, a great movie is the kind of movie you can view over and over again, and it consistently gets better with subsequent viewings. However, this movie can hardly stand with those. As I said before, it was fairly predictable from the start (I knew about 45 minutes early that his wife would be dying at the end) and it doesn't get any better every time you see it. For instance, check out 'Chinatown'; this is a legitimate film-noir thriller that does get better with age; it features outstanding performances and a dense plot, whereas this movie has a fairly methodical plot and some good but not great acting.

","This story takes you where it wants you to go. <br/><br/>The proof is that while there are some gruesome acts in this movie (you only see the aftermath, no action), the most disturbing crime in the movie is the least gruesome. <br/><br/>There are very few movies that pull-off a mix of repulsive crime and psychological involvement as well as this one.<br/><br/>The character development was done very well with while not distracting you by burying you in the personal life of each character<br/><br/>Initially, I felt the main detective character was a little unbelievable a bit too methodical. As the character developed though, you start to see that as a part of his personality, the element that levels the playing field between him and the criminal. In the end, I found him to be as diabolically analytical as the criminal.<br/><br/>The chess game between the main detective and the criminal was flawless. Had they got the criminal into custody any other way than they did.. it would have ruined the movie."

","I went to a friends house last night and rented movies. I picked Se7en to rent because I've always wanted to see it since I saw David Fincher's masterpiece, Fight Club and his well made thriller, Panic Room. People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A"
"moonwio","9","7","10","23 May 2005"," Who's right and who's wrong?
","This is an outstanding movie. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are pitch-perfect, and Brad Pitt is solid. Pitt actually had a lot to do with this movie's success outside of his acting. He forced the studio to keep the original ending, and he forced them to shell out the money to get Spacey. It is fortunate that he did, as those two elements are central to the movie's greatness. Spacey played the killer so chillingly that it makes his message seem all the more unnerving and, perhaps, correct. The uncompromising ending leaves the viewer shocked and reeling. This movie could not have worked without it. Outside of those obvious elements, another key to the film is Freeman's character. His outlook on life is and how it is affected by the murders and by his new partner is a key subplot the film. It brings more weight to the picture. Also, David Fincher's dark, dreary direction adds to the film, somewhat similar to the way Ridley Scott's dark vision adds to Blade Runner. The constant rain is a nice touch, especially when it ironically recedes after the killer shows up. I was never a Nine Inch Nails fan, but their dark brand of music fits this film well, as evidenced in the opening credits. Overall, I think this is one of the great films of all time. Watch it if you can handle grisly images and if you like unnerving endings."
"StarkedInMovies","8","8","12","26 December 2015"," Dour.
","David Fincher's ""Se7en"" is one such movie that blurs the line between a giallo horror and a psychological thriller. ""Se7en"" sets a mood which is chilling, dark and puzzling. A mood that is present all through the entire movie. The mood set is the excellent work of director David Fincher, who wanted to give dark and gloomy atmosphere to the movie just to expose a world which is rough, bleak and gritty. The effect it makes is astounding and is does so by good camera work and lighting, or the lack of it. The cameras used in this film was specially changed film stock to make the visuals look as dark as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score. The ominous music that is added keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. If it wasn't for disturbing message that ""Se7en"" puts across, and astonishing dark scenes, I would have not given the rating I gave.<br/><br/>The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, even though I loathed Brad Pitt's character. Brad Pitt's character was at times annoying and glorified. All he did was slow down the overall investigation process. His weak presence makes it seem that he was never the Lead or the Assistant detective in the investigations of the crime. All he said was excessive swear words and not something tangible and due to this reason, his interaction with Morgan Freeman's character was frail. At times I felt Morgan Freeman's character would have done a better job leading the investigation alone. The conversation in the police car was really insubstantial. I would have really despised this movie it wasn't for the phenomenal acting by 'actor who played the Killer'. It would've been so much better if Brad Pitt's character wasn't such a weak character and if he just stop talking at times and listened to the astute Morgan Freeman's character. Whilst watching the movie I wholeheartedly wanted to despise on Brad Pitt's character and to an extent Brad Pitt himself but having watched and loved Brad Pitt in David Fincher's Fight Club I often found myself forcibly liking Brad Pitt's character and justifying his decisions and his exchange of ideas but I failed. Morgan Freeman's was excellent in the role of a veteran detective and a wise mentor for Brad Pitt's character<br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>The biggest sin in this movie is perhaps not the character but the ending. I found the ending awfully predictable. I could have seen that one of our main characters would eventually be one of the 'victims'. Especially after getting to see the 'wife' and she revealing something crucial at a buildup stage just screamed that she was going to die. The buildup was for nothing if it wasn't for the predictable ending. I had a tiny hope for something magnificent and grimy, since the killer's talk about the sins and how his killings were justified but the killer too just disappointed me in the end. Also it made me dislike Brad Pitt's character that much more, because I was hoping he wouldn't shoot the killer, and that I might get a reason to respect him as a character. I don't care how if a certain movie has a happy or a sad ending, but this movie would've ended on a strong note if he hadn't killed the killer. The director could have found another way of exhibiting the last sin. Morgan Freeman's character could have and should have done something more in preventing the last 'execution'. After all he is the one who saw clearly what the killer's grand plan was. The ending scene was one big anticlimax and thus this movie could have been my second favorite David Fincher movie following Fight Club if not my second favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>8/10.<br/><br/>Note: I used 'actor who played the Killer' instead of revealing the actor's name is because David Fincher wanted the killer's identity to be a surprise and I shall oblige."
"Mosquito_Maps","10","8","12","7 January 2008"," The Greatest Crime Thriller Ever Told....With The Greatest Villain Of All Time
","This is by far the finest serial killer movie of all time. The script is beautifully paced and original with a fantastic twist at the end. The acting is superb, everyone is on the top of their game. Morgan Freeman shows his versatility and superb natural ability in the role of retiring detective Somerset, Brad Pitt gives the performance of his career as the young feisty Dectective Mills and Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic as his highly sympathetic and caring character of his wife Tracy. But of course it is Spacey who steals the show as the compelling chilling ""John Doe"".<br/><br/>His entrancingly calm and chilling performance lifts the picture above many others of its genre and his pure evil glint is just as chilling even more so than Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".<br/><br/>I believe that Se7en is far far superior to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and others of its kind. It was one of the greatest films of the 90's (for me second only to ""The Usual Suspects"") and i feel is constantly underrated by many. I am glad to see it at #36 although i feel it is worthy of the top 20.<br/><br/>This is David Fincher's finest hour as a director with his drab rainy surroundings adding a superb drab atmosphere to a drab city. Andrew Kevin Walker's script is however will be what remembered as an incredible story, perfectly crafted and acted out beautifully by Spacey, Freeman, Pitt and co.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE FILM FOR EVERY FAN OF GREAT 90's MOVIES, ONE OF THE DECADES GREATEST."
"Theo Robertson","8","11","18","24 March 2013"," Less Proves More
","I didn't really hold out much hope for SEVEN . It's a film that's almost 20 years old and one that I frequently miss usually on purpose when it's shown on television . I've always thought David Fincher was painfully over rated . "" Best director of his generation "" claim many people which is patently untrue if you've seen a film by Danny Boyle or Darren Aronfsky or Ang Lee . The premise itself doesn't inspire optimism being a couple of mismatched police partners trying to track down a serial killer who is motivated by the seven deadly sins . I almost believed I was going to be watching a reworking of the Vincent Price camp classic horror movie THEATRE OF BLOOD without the funny bits so I went in with very low expectations <br/><br/>What Fincher has done is construct a thriller that is dialogue driven with a sense of portent dread . It'd be very easy , perhaps too easy , to shock the audience with gore and startle moments . Instead the director resists this very easy temptation and put the audience in the shoes of detectives Somerset and Mills so this is a rare thriller where the audience join up the dots when the detectives do . The film is greatly helped by Morgan Freeman who was probably Hollywood's most effective character actor at this point but both amazingly Pitt and Spacey hold their own against this acting legend <br/><br/>In short this is a very good gloomy thriller with very dark cinematography and very dark subject matter . The fact that there's so much understatement to it is refreshing and nearly 20 years after it first hit the big screen it remains director David Fincher's best work"
"Fluke_Skywalker","9","4","5","20 January 2016"," So good it's a sin
","Bleak, gruesome, brilliant. These are a few of words that come to mind when I think of David Fincher's 'Se7en'. In lesser hands the concept (two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing stylized murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins) could've been nothing more than a gimmick, but here it's a deftly crafted game of cat and mouse that pulls you in, even as it makes you want to turn away. But that said, it's not what I'd call an exceptionally graphic film. More is implied than is shown, and we fill in the blank spots in our mind's eye. A far more effective technique than the cheap gross-out route.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, lead by the inimitable Morgan Freeman. I can't believe Freeman didn't get an Oscar nod. I would cite genre bias, but then I think of 'Silence Of The Lambs' getting everything but the kitchen sink just a few years before at the Academy Awards. Co-star Brad Pitt is no Freeman, but he more than holds his own with the veteran here and the two have an exceptional chemistry. The killer, whose identity I will not reveal lest I ruin the surprise for those who may not have seen it, is brilliant in his few brief scenes.<br/><br/>It's not a pleasant film, and at the risk of spoiling it, there is no happy ending, but it's a filmmaking and storytelling clinic, and one Hell of a good movie."
"harveybdickens","8","4","5","10 December 2015"," Bleak, suspenseful, yet intriguing
","This movie is regarded as the definition of a modern thriller. It is easy to see why, as it is easily one of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen. What added to this suspense, was the straightforward, yet grim storyline, that keeps the audience interested.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around two detectives, William Somerset, and David Mills, trying to solve the mystery of a serial killer. That killer, John Doe, leaves clues around for unknown reasons. Detective Somerset believes he (the killer) is following the seven deadly sins (hence the title Seven, or Se7en, and is leading them to something. What this is, is unclear, but they do eventually capture him, and he reveals that his final victim, is David's wife Tracy, thus showing he was playing a game with them all along.<br/><br/>There are few movies I have seen, before or since, that are suspenseful as this. It is also quite bleak, which did admittedly put me off at times. It is still a great film, definitely worth a watch, if you are old enough (remembering this movie is rated R), and whether or not you enjoy it, you will probably find it interesting. From me it gets 8/10"
"arussell23","9","4","5","8 July 2015"," 'Se7en' is a twisted, thrilling film that managed to give Fincher the start he deserved
","In the mid-90s, director David Fincher read the screenplay for Se7en, a mystery-thriller film and said that he found it to be a fascinating idea. Little did he know, that the script copy he had been sent had the original ending that New Line didn't want, so he had to fight to keep it in the film. Either way, the film was released in September of 1995 and instantly had rave reviews, and managed to make even Roger Ebert proclaim it as dark, twisted and a great movie. So, let's see if all of these critics are whackjobs, or if this film truly is as good as they say.<br/><br/>Se7en follows two detectives - one set to retire by the end of the week, and a rookie set to take over his position, as they slowly realize that several seemingly unconnected murders are actually the work of a serial killer basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>This film is one I had been fascinated by for a long time. Many people referred to it as a basis for the dark and twisted films to come, such as the Saw franchise, so I wanted to finally see why people were constantly comparing the two. So, what did I think? Well, let's get into it.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both do terrific jobs as the two detectives investigating this twisted case, and both really play off of each other very well. One of the best examples of this comes from the opening scene, where Pitt meets up with Freeman and they have a chat. Quite intriguing. Kevin Spacey... I feel like I shouldn't spoil who he is because of the plot, but believe me when I say, he'll send shivers down your spine. Gwyneth Paltrow does a stellar job as well as Pitt's wife, and manages to emote more than in any other performance. Ha, I'm only joking. And R. Lee Ermey does a good job as the police captain.<br/><br/>The music in this film, by Howard Shore, of all people, was stellar. One of the most effective scenes in the film, which is surprisingly the opening credits, had a remixed version of a Nine Inch Nails song paired with Shore's score, and it works very well. Hell, the score works very well throughout the entire film. The lighting and just overall tone of the film is very dark, which helps compliment the subject matter very well. I just love some of the shots, like when they first come upon the Gluttony crime scene and are using their flashlights all around, that scene looks so dark and mysterious, you can't help but be intrigued.<br/><br/>Of course, Fincher's direction is brilliant so we don't even need to have a long discussion about that. The screenplay, as a whole, works very well. It's very good at keeping us contained to these murders and the people surrounding them and being affected by them. I can see why Fincher really wanted to make this screenplay. The editing in this film is definitely something to note, as scenes such as the opening credits and the overlays of the days look very well done, and it's obviously that either Fincher or the editor had very good ideas on how that was supposed to work.<br/><br/>Overall, Se7en is a very solid flick. It boasts some talented performances, some great tone, music, direction and a solid screenplay and some very bold, but fantastic, editing choices. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and go see it because it's very dark, and the twist ending will leave you reeling, I'm sure.<br/><br/>10/10. Grade: A"

"The-Kissable-Writer","9","4","5","7 February 2009"," Ambiguous, shocking, brilliant.
","At one point in ""Seven"", Detective Somerset points out that if the serial killer turns out to be the devil, that might live up to their expectations. But who precisely is the man named John Doe? He might as well be called 'the man in black'. He's a dark angel on a shoulder, mine and yours, whispering truths we never care to learn. He's that little voice inside ourselves we smother by apathy. He's the anti-conscience unable to relativize the evil forces in this world. Or maybe relativizing is just a term often used to mask the fear of facing horrors we're unable to understand and overcome. So we don't even try at all. Se7en is as much a thrilling puzzle as an ambiguous morality piece. It present us with a vile world of unpunished sinners where even the biggest heroes lose the fighting courage (Somerset), and even the most driven good do-er minds are corrupted (Mills). Sound familiar? While Noir cinema clearly influences Fincher's work, ""Seven"" plays in present America, and by doing so becomes even more original and relevant.<br/><br/>""Seven"" at no point absolves the attrition (""When you regret your sins, but not because you love God."") philosophy preached, but the movie nevertheless sparks intrigue through it by making Kevin Spacey's John Doe incredibly smart and - sidestepping the clich√©- not ego-maniacal. He massacres not for fame or as an ill-aimed attempt to avenge his childhood traumas; he ends lives to prove a point. A point he's so determined to make he's willing to give up his own life in doing so. The point in question: sinners deserve to die. Do they? We all carry the guilt of at least one mortal sin. Let he who is without sin throw the first stone. I feel a little soiled quoting the bible, being an agnostic. Fincher is an artist. He doesn't just state his point of view or tries to indoctrinate viewers. In most movies, everything the killer says is the opposite of the movie's message. Here, this rule does not apply. Why? Well, because the center of all that is good and pure in this movie, the young idealistic detective, succumbs to the temptations of vengeance killing. So we basically have two horses pulling in opposite direction. Ambiguous! I am firmly against capital punishment personally, but the movie does very well in studying it's characters thoroughly so their motivations ring true, twisted as they may be, they're authentic. Besides the brilliant script, ""Seven"" has many other virtues.<br/><br/>A fault of many good movies, the fault that lowers their status from great to good, is the lack of visual attraction. Many serious drama's flaunt production values that barely rise above documentary level. If you're using an audiovisual medium, actually use it. ""Seven"" includes some terrific camera shots, Fincher follows the Noir school in making optimal use of shadows, among others in a scene where the killer's shadow looms in the rain puddle and subsequently threatens Detective Mills at gunpoint . Fincher gives a creative spin even to fairly standard thriller elements. The chase-sequence in the hallway for instance, where the camera finds itself very far from the action so we see the detective chasing a tiny silhouette. Instead of using up my thousand words listing awe-inducing audiovisual elements(which I could easily accomplish), I'll spend some attention on a curious element, namely Brad Pitt's performance.<br/><br/>A character actor like Morgan Freeman can be compared to a singer like Frank Sinatra, he can't hit a false note if his life depended on trying to do so. Even if the end result sometimes is less than impressive, which occurs considering the multitude of roles he takes, he always saves some of the grace. Brad Pitt on the other hand received more spotlight on his looks than on his acting chops in the early days of his career. The growth process of his acting ability curves bizarrely. He performed remarkably in some early work (""Kalifornia"", ""12 Monkeys""), yet intersperses those bright bursts of talent with hammy, flat turns in ""Seven Years in Tibet"", ""Legends of the Fall"", and (certainly in comparison with Tom Cruise's phenomenal turn) ""Interview With The Vampire"". My best guess? He needs a lot of direction. Why else would Fincher get such a great performance out of him in ""Seven"" and, let's not forget, ""Fight Club""? Freeman and Pitt are star-crossed by Spacey though, who - in a surprise, uncredited, appearance - steals the movie. He plays the villain with a familiar patient smart aleckyness, it's scary to think of how much of them could be living right next door. Who hasn't got a theory that they're dying to get proved right? How many of them will get the little push that they need? As Spacey himself remarked once, people don't recognize him in foreign countries because without his glasses he looks like an ordinary accountant. He's the ideal choice for John Doe, bar none.<br/><br/>Some critics have done injustice to ""Seven"" by naming it ""a by the book thriller"". A by the book thriller doesn't deserve to get this much recognition. A scintillating character study embedded into a thriller plot however, that's a whole different story. Speaking of stories, the greatest script writers have always understood the ending to be the single most important part of any story. From ""Psycho"" over ""The Silence of The Lambs"" to ""The Usual Suspects"", masterful conclusions have blown audiences away, flooding them with emotions albeit surprise or shock, anger or overwhelming sadness. This one is all of the above. And it ranks among the very best of the nineties, as does the whole film. It's not a stretch to call it the second most influential and second best thriller of the '90s0"
"BaronBl00d","9","4","5","2 March 2008"," Gritty, Disturbing Thriller - One of its Kind
","Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride."

Brad Pitt played a phenomenal part as the new detective, and Morgan Freeman as the old going to retire cop. they both had great chemistry between their characters and that really helps the film.

Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role.

","I'm surprised this film is even listed in the top 250 and that it got this much praise. It really wasn't that good a movie. I liked the concept and I love Morgan Freeman, but this movie just blew it.<br/><br/>I didn't like some characters - mainly Mills -, the interaction between characters and especially the script.<br/><br/>Mills was annoying and overrated, a worthless character and Pitt playing him only made it worse. During the movie I kept thinking that I might be OK with Mills if he had been played by anyone other/better than Pitt, but I'm guessing they wouldn't have wanted to play such a lame character. I can't take a crime movie seriously when it has an unprofessional moron as a detective. Bringing his wife in the scene made the movie made all the rest painfully obvious. Appears only one scene, what's the point of her role? Oh yes, she's going to die.<br/><br/>Freeman and Spacey were great. The script is a puddle of vomit, and they still managed to act it out brilliantly. I think I hated the script more than I hate Mills. Excessive swearing (I don't twist my pants at foul language, but there are so many scenes that could've done without it so the viewer would take the guys more seriously. Also, the words lose their impact when you say it a million freaking times.) and weak interaction. The ending was the worst of all. The conversation in the police car was so horribly dumb that it made me want to shake the writer. It would've been so much better if Mills wasn't such a weak character. If he had just shut his damn mouth. <br/><br/>The ending was predictable. You'd have to be really thick to not have seen that one of our main characters would eventually be one of the ""victims"". Especially after getting to see the wife. The build up was for nothing. I had a tiny hope for something grand and grimy, since Spacey convinced me with his ""what I've done is going to be puzzled over, studied and followed"" talk but he just disappointed me in the end. The ending scene was one big anticlimax.<br/><br/>And again, it made me dislike Mills' character that much more, because I was hoping he wouldn't shoot him. That I might get a reason to respect him as a character. I don't care if a movie ends good or not, but the movie would've ended on a strong note if he hadn't killed Doe. It's been nothing but a bit of gore and knowing what would happen next. A waste of time basically.<br/><br/>1/10 because I want to even out the balance a bit. I'd give a 5, but I really don't think this movie deserves the praise it got."
"Tiamat10","1","42","91","29 January 2000"," Sick, Depressing and Boring
","I can't understand what the critics saw in this film.  It's basically a standard serial killer film full of cliches (old cop on verge of retiring and young eager cop full of new ideas -yawn) but with two main differences - the ending, and the sheer grossness of the murders.<br/><br/>I've watched many horror and crime movies and I'm not squeamish but I found the murders so unpleasant that I became detached from the movie and started wondering.  .  The disgusting crimes combined with the general darkness and mumbled dialogue made the whole film depressing and hard to care about.<br/><br/>As for the ending, it only served to remove any suspense that had been building up.  I didn't find the last few scenes shocking or surprising - I realised what was coming and just wanted it to be over.<br/><br/>Well made - maybe.  Well acted - perhaps (if you could make out all the dialogue).  Innovative - yes, but not in a good way.  Imaginative - yes, but not the kind of imagination you want to dwell on.  Watch only if you actively enjoy being made to feel miserable."

"Screen_Blitz","10","5","7","20 November 2015"," Dark, grisly, and highly intelligent edge-of-your-seat thriller
","David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.<br/><br/>This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.<br/><br/>Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart."
"tomgillespie2002","10","5","7","1 March 2014"," Still manages to astound after 20 years of repeat viewings
","After his calamitous experience working on his d√©but film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.<br/><br/>Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.<br/><br/>When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"kechhh","Null","5","7","24 March 2013"," Great Twisted Movie
","There was tension throughout the entire movie and in significant doses and the mood was set just right. Great acting, too. The juxtaposition of personalities and life philosophies between Freeman and Pitt were great with Freeman showing a jaded, wise, and cynical character and Pitt showing a more rash dreamer.<br/><br/>Most significantly, I feel the tone and underlying themes were incredible. An insane killer turns out to be incredibly smart and manipulative and ironically the most rational one (in his twisted way) in the end, while Pitt allows himself to be manipulated into becoming Wrath.<br/><br/>I feel Spacey was great and logical in his twisted way. I feel he pretty much had the cunning and wit of Joker (Dark Knight) and the twisted modus operandi and philosophy of the killers in the Saw series.<br/><br/>At first, I felt the pacing in the beginning and sudden thrust into the action was too fast, but by the end, I felt that this was a good move, as it helped keep a swift and ugly pace and tension.<br/><br/>The ending was also ingenious. Clever on the part of the writer, I feel it wraps up nicely.<br/><br/>Finally, I will definitely remember the last lines of the movie: Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ""'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part."""

","I never understood why Seven was never given the credit it truly deserves. This movie has a total package. You get horror(in its purest form), suspense, drama and lots of action. I would rate Seven as one of my favorite horror flicks. The way the film concludes with all seven sins being committed and the way the last two unfold is magnificent writing. The sadistic style in which John Doe disposes of his victims highlights the suspense aspect perfectly. I don't know if there has been a better selected cast. Brad Pitt as the rookie, cocky detective. Morgan Freeman(one of my personal faves) as the veteran. Best of all Kevin Spacey as the macabre and very twisted John Doe. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it Tonnie."
"berggeit9","9","5","7","2 July 2005"," David Fincher does it again!.! ^__^
","Se7en is a reflection of our everyday life, we live in a world filled with media & information technology which makes people often live beside each other instead of with each other, even though the serial killer is portrayed as the devil in this movie i can empathize with his feelings/opinion about seeing sins on every corner of the streets. The intellectual, patient personality that's Sommerset & the young rebellious ""let's dance"" Mills really contrast each other, creating interesting character development.<br/><br/>We as the audience are confronted with biblical/religious statements throughout progress of the film concerning homocide cases, if Sommerset had to choose a playing card then he'd retire as soon as possible, he's been doing detective work for way to long, but however he does get motivated by the unusual case of 7 sins that are about to unfold including all the plot twists & turns.<br/><br/>Se7en has been directed with unusual grimmy & dark look, during the film it's constantly raining, as if time never seems to change the mood is captured with great directorial vision, the dark & wet apartments that seem to be abandonded for ages, a combination of brown & black colors recreating a new kind of innovative film noir, consciously leading us to unique cinematographic history.<br/><br/>Sommerset comes to terms with our serial killer John Doe & even though they might agree on certain points when it comes to the subject of everyday life, these 2 characters are worlds apart at the same time, in a sense that John Doe murders his victims using the 7 deadly sins.<br/><br/>Pacing of this movie is nice but if you're expecting a big action movie, perhaps you're better of watching a vin diesel (XXX) movie. We're invited by the director to be intellectually stimulated, while the story develops we must think along, asking ourselves new questions about every single horror murder committed as we go.<br/><br/>With that said the film is in my humble opinion highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the acting skills of Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman, it's got quality(not much though)action, dark mood, acting, story development, character development, mystery, among others. Even though not for the faint hearted, since some scenes of the committed murders are visually shocking to say the least (adult rated), Se7en is a great police drama by director David Fincher. * * * * * * * * * 9 OUT 0F 10 STARS !"

"Brad K.","Null","5","7","3 April 1999"," Tough thriller with an incredible climax.
","Seven is a very dark and tough thriller.  Most of the scenes are shot in dimly lit and wet places which add a lot to the dark mood of the film. Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm) wrote this somewhat brilliant screenplay in which Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Legends of the Fall) plays a young and cocky detective new at the precinct who gets help from the wise old veteran about to retire, played by Morgan Freeman (Hard Rain, The Shawshank Redemption). In their first few days together they discover a few bizzare and gory murder victims which seemed to be done in a certain and planned way.  Soon Freeman is convinced that someone is using the seven deadly sins to kill people and preach a sermon.  So Pitt and Freeman are off on a man-hunt trying to find this man.  Gwyneth Palthrow (Shakespeare in Love, Emma) plays Pitt's wife in the film.  This is a disturbing film with several graphic post-murder scenes, but still a very good film.  Freeman is great as he always is.  Pitt was disappointing, however, giving an average performance at best.  Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, L.A. Confidential) is magnificent in a small, but important role.  The film leads up to an incredible climax which is the best part of the film and makes watching it all very worthwhile.  Highly recommended."

"anupam-satyasheel","9","6","9","5 April 2007"," Dark, Chilly, Brilliant and¬Ö Disturbing
","David Fincher's best movie until date, Se7en is a dark portrayal of a genius psychopath killer, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. He is on camera for no more than last 30 minutes of the movie, but so dominant is his character that the entire movie seems to be cast around his uncanny-ness.<br/><br/>The hero of the movie though is neither he nor Brad Pitt nor Morgan Freeman ¬ñ the two detectives entrusted with the task of tacking him down. It is the plot and the script, extremely brilliant though very murky and enticingly morbid. You see gory murders that leave trace of heart-rending torture, but all that it makes you do is become more inquisitive about the killer. The killer is the sole obsession with the detectives too and the contrast between Brad Pitt's edginess and Morgan Freeman's poise is very well portrayed. It parallels the contrast between the killer's poise and the edginess of the action sequence.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie is startling, revealing and disturbing. It characterizes the essence of Se7en, a movie that stirs you and makes you sit up and take note of it. Calling Se7en a psychological thriller is understating its significance. It is a movie that goes well beyond that, making you aware of the morbid possibilities that exist in human mind. The movie is also remarkable for the fact the cinematic climax does not provide you any catharsis, it just sets your mind thinking ¬ñ not in the least about what it takes to craft a script as this and to make a movie as disturbingly poignant as Se7en."

","It was probably clever to make a film like this back in the 90s, but if this was released yesterday, nobody would rate it as high as they are. I saw this yesterday after hearing good things about it, and it did indeed live to my expectations, however I didn't think it was the greatest murder story nor the greatest film of the 90s.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was incredible. The second half of the movie was a bit of a let down. There wasn't much of a thought in the way they found the killer, it was rushed and a bit unrealistic. When the killer gave himself up later on, the movie was pretty much finished for me. I was expecting a good solution to a good crime, but no - a couple of hints left behind each murder scene didn't make this movie the greatest, as most people say.<br/><br/>The end was both predictable and unpredictable - nobody knew what was going to happen, but we all had the idea of what might happen - and it did happen.<br/><br/>Overall, a good watch - has its moments and I would definitely watch again because of how good the characters played their roles rather than the story."

","Wow. There are a lot of bad films out there, but even with the worst of the worst there is some redeeming quality, like that neato big wave in the Perfect Storm. But Se7en? The acting is flat (Brad Pitt's opening lines seem like they're coming from someone acting for the first time, his moaning at the end, when he gets his special gift, just seemed pathetic); the script is not at all inventive and unsuccessfully covered up by hyperbolic special effects and redundant gore. The ""twist"" at the end is hardly disturbing because the writer/ director have been shoving gimmicky horror effects down the our throats for the entire movie. <br/><br/>People who like this film- the dark, urban atmosphere, the pseudo-noir elements: please watch some David Lynch films and see how this should be created, i.e. not by using video game titles, not by relying heavily on special effects, make-up, and yet ANOTHER plot with biblical references, but instead by a careful selection of actors, beautiful cinematography, and incredibly original stories.<br/><br/>Stop funding this director so that he will go back to making TV commercials instead of two hour long theater commercials."

","I'm sorry I can't give this film a negative rating, but I can say that I wish most sincerely that I'd never seen it. If I could pay to have it expunged from my memory, I would do so eagerly. If it's not too late for you, I strongly recommend that you give it a wide berth.<br/><br/>(Spoiler ahead.)<br/><br/>Se7en (a pretentiously dyslexic title) is nasty, violent, unpleasant and, worst of all, utterly futile. While being regaled by sadistically repellent scenes of torture, you're stuck following a protagonist who hasn't the brains to figure out an utterly transparent trap, which a moron could see coming a mile down the avenue. This makes the experience of watching Se7en a nightmare, all right, but not the sort the director intended. Jonathan Miller once said that his own worst nightmare was ""being tortured for information I don't possess."" Se7en is like that. You pay for bad decisions you had no part in making. Except one: the foolish decision to watch this repulsive mess of a movie rather than, say, going to have your teeth drilled.<br/><br/>The ""twist ending"" is a dangerous form, and rarely has it been more abysmally, ham-fistedly mis-handled than in this film. Some people seem to think that dark, dismal, depressing... and don't forget futile... is the same as ""deep."" This film is as deep as a puddle of vomit.

"moonspinner55","6","12","22","3 October 2005"," It cuts and slices away, but still follows police-movie formula...
","Is Morgan Freeman our greatest living actor? He may in fact be, and his mere presence here (solid, noble, and pure) is reassuring, but even Freeman can't overcome the usual cat-&-mouse/killer-toying-with-detectives stew that ""Se7en"" serves up. There's a serial killer loose in rainy New York City, and as he mounts his seven grisly crime scenes--modeled after the Seven Deadly Sins--he quickly becomes aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and is enamored of their drive and determination. Most of this is left vague and unexplained; we learn precious little about the psychopath involved except that he's highly literate, educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. The film mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of deja vu (I thought mostly of ""The Silence of the Lambs""). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The grimy, lust-and-death soaked atmosphere is wallowed in (it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell), and certainly it is palpable and captured successfully, but completely off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like real-life crime scenes, and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker isn't clever enough to distract us or cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible--it's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger sick-making scale. The film is predictably gruesome, less predictably formula-bound. **1/2 from ****"

","I'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film.  It doesn't.<br/><br/>Let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem.<br/><br/>Let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- Freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and Brad Pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, I'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly.  Gwyneth Paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and Spacey's character is...well, he's not a character.  He's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment?  That he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car?<br/><br/>Let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them.<br/><br/>What kind of police department is this?  There is not ONE ATTEMPT to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)?  Where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)?  Why aren't the cops even TRYING to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints?  Most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, EVER, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. When Spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. Rot in jail, sicko.""<br/><br/>I suppose the success of ""Se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art.""

How hard was it for me to take a wild guess and say that the press guy attempting to take photos at the scene of the crime was in fact our serial killer ""John Doe""...... not very hard I must admit. The fact that the director had to bring to our attention that Mill's wife Tracy is pregnant and hiding it from Mills tells us that something gruesome is going to happen to her or the baby in the end... and all it's doing is creating a little more suspense.. but yet still easily predictable.. The only reason I finished the film was the slightest hope of something unpredictable happening.

When you imagine a film in which it always cloudy and overcast with rain pouring down 24/7 , you would think it going to depress you . Truth is , you don't actually notice the weather , but instead take huge interest on what happening in the homes of the city.<br/><br/>I'm not an huge fan of Brad Pitt but it seems that when he teams up with Fincher , he always puts on an good performance. Then there's Morgan Freeman, which is fairness, is playing Morgan Freeman. He fun to watch but you know what type of performance he going to act out. Both are very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in it for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable. His character is well made and maybe deserves a bit more screen time . The film is very well made and an joy to watch. It keeps you awake and leaves you to wonder about the next deadly sin. When watching it, you can clearly see that Seven was an influence towards Leigh Whannell and James Wan and there SAW film. Everything about SEVEN was great, the concept, the acting, the finale. I highly recommend this film."

","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.<br/><br/>Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.<br/><br/>If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting."
"Howlin Wolf","10","2","2","14 January 2008"," Se7en gruesome chapters of a killer's manifesto...
","""Se7en"" is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.<br/><br/>Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us? <br/><br/>Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be."

","This film has many indelible moments, an amazing cast: Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is impressive and real. The Charlie Parker soundtrack with the blues sung by Billie Holiday ""I Cover the Waterfront"" captures the dark mood and underlying violence which exists in the city. Being from New York, the street scenes at night are 100% accurate, executives, harried workers, hookers and dealers all intermingle in a pastiche of chaos.<br/><br/>We see the early scene where Freeman first meets novice detective David Mills (well portrayed by Brad Pitt) and he asks him what NYC homicide is like, and won't agent Somerset regret retiring? Freeman answers tiredly ...""I am moving....anyplace...far away from here""...<br/><br/>Sloth, Greed, Lust, Pride, Envy, Gluttony, the seven deadly sins as proclaimed since Medieval era. Each murder is precisely carried out. John Doe is creating his masterpiece, an artwork of perfect murder. Kevin Spacey is superb as John Doe. His presence and diction are cutting and menacing. I would love to see him in more of these roles. The quote from Morgan Freeman at the end of it all resounds true: it is the quote from Hemingway. The theme is ""ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee""....Everyone is affected by violence. Best thriller and suspense, other than Hitchcock.

"elshikh4","8","2","2","20 July 2007"," Love and Fear.. Who Killed Whom ?!!
","I know, all of the previous comments told you all. But I want to say something of my own.<br/><br/>This great thriller will live longer than its likes, for a lot of reasons. The one that I want to talk about is the strong focusing on the characterization firstly in this script. Because this is something really rare in any of the American thrillers nowadays.<br/><br/>Here, you have 2 point of views that come from 2 different generations, or simply 2 kinds of human beings.<br/><br/>The first is (David Mills), played by (Brad Pitt), who is so rash, tense, running mostly after his sensations, and always relies on the photos, the shape of things. But despite his true zeal, courage, and idealism he is so unwise, very impetuous, and can easily hurt or lose himself. He is too weak to wait justice, so he goes and gets it by his hand, because he is a slave for his excitability.. his emotionality.<br/><br/>The other one (William Somerset), played by (Morgan Freeman) is an earlier generation, who has all the goodness and rationality. He is discreet and cold proficient expert, who relies on the books. This one is not perfect either. He is too feeble to stand love, its pain, responsibilities, or loss. So there is no joyful thing about his life, nor lasting thing in it!<br/><br/>Both of them make together one perfect unit; so they succeed in pursuit the killer. But HEY, it's not (Lethal Weapon). So you'll have them both at variance, too contradictory, and the only clear medial between them is the first's wife. Therefore, when she died, and (Mills) killed the killer; the borderline already ended, and there was no medial anymore. So separation became the fate.<br/><br/>They are 2 very irreconcilable ways, persons, or feelings: the love which kills the fear; so (Mills) lost his life. And the love which is killed by fear; so (Somerset) is losing his own. And as for (John Doe), played by (Kevin Spacey), the limit went to extremes; so he had his fear, or his love, or maybe both, killed too long ago. He despised the extremism of the human lusts, because he wasn't a human himself. He lost his humanity completely. Hence, he became a killing machine, a loose madness, or the extremism itself.<br/><br/>Balance between your love and your fear or you'll be the killer and the victim. That's one premise which will make this film live for so many upcoming generations."
"film_riot","9","2","2","11 March 2007"," Se7en
","The serial killer movie is one of the (if not the one) concise genres of the 1990s. David Fincher started his feature film career in the 90s with ""Alien 3"", a good but not great sequel to the ""Alien""-series. But this film already revealed his sensitive instinct for threatening scenarios. With ""Se7en"" he made one of the best thrillers of all time, an archetypal film for the word 'genre-defining'. So many films copied the style of it in the following years until now, that this style ultimately became nerve-racking for me in every new film. This is the one problem I felt while re-watching it. New audiences may not even be able to really understand what made this movie so great when it first came out. But its qualities are still visible today. The character of John Doe is a masterpiece of evil man-characterization. Kevin Spacey owns the screen his whole screen time, but I also like the characterizations of young hopeful cop and old cop, who has lost his faith in the good of life. As I said: One of the best thrillers of all time."

An incredibly dark movie (for mainstream that is) about cruelty and human depravity that hooks it's fangs into the viewers spine like a bloodthirsty beast and won't let go even after the movie's over. This is both very wellplayed and wellcrafted. Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all do top-notch performances, the script is one of the strongest in years and the ending must be on of the best I've seen. It's strange that a movie that doesn't rely on shock effects can be this shocking. After I saw this I was amazed by the pure cleverness of it all and the way I felt. The depressing mood of it all is just perfect and it works wonderfully as a foundation on which this movie lies. Go see it now.<br/><br/>10/10"

I personally don't like some of the remarks that people make about the film. About the justice system, the police procedures and the behaviour of detectives. Apparently it ain't perfect. BUT what is?? This film has pretty much everything you could ask for in a crime/thriller genre movie. The suspense, gore, Reality, originality but most of all logic. The way that the film uncovers the puzzle piece by piece. It pretty much uncovers itself very slowly until Doe walks in. The logic and the everyday life issues that people encounter and don't even realize 'damn, where the hell do we live?!...' ...in a world of greed, sloth, wrath, pride, envy, gluttony and lust."

","Seven is by now more or less a modern classic. The movie is so dark that I almost felt depressed when I left the cinema. I disagree with another reviewer who calls it ""One of the most overrated ""thrillers"" of all time"". The only point this reviewer has is that the camerawork is great. Good acting, good story, great camerawork. Bottom line; If you are looking for suspense you will get it here. You might even get a depression, but that's for free.<br/><br/>One of David Fincher's (director) best films. Fincher is very talented but probably also very depressed considering the movies he has made.

"NEFARlOUS","1","26","57","29 February 2000"," Derivative, disgusting and downbeat
","Seven is the sort of film that takes several formulaic concepts,  dresses them up with something trendy (title screens beginning and end,  making me wonder if the guy from Homicide got paid), uses stock  characterisations, piles on the repulsiveness on the excuse of realism,  and then watches the money come in.  What we have here is the age-old veteran approaching retirement teamed  with a young, aggressive rookie. The parts played somewhat predictably  by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.  The killer in this movie plans to murder six people (seven dead in  total) according to the seven deadly sins, hence the title.  The ways in which this is accomplished in five of these seems to be  calculated to be incredibly disgusting, repulsive and downright  offensive. The scriptwriters here certainly are no fan of Hitchcock,  but rather King. The result of which was to basically make me feel  slightly ill and disinterested in the film as a whole.  Now if they had bothered to put as much effort into the  characterisation of messrs Freeman and Pitt, this would have been a far  better movie. As it stands, you care very little for either of them as  they just do not seem like real people at all. (I get to put a second  reference to Homicide:LOTS as a reference point as to how it should be  done)  Cinematographally speaking, the majority of the film seems intent on  portraying the city as a ""Bladerunner by day"", muting most things in  dull, washed out colours together with lots and lots of Rain. Gritty?  Yes. Depressing? Yes. Boring? Eventually.  Two good things about this film. 1) The titles are pretty groovy, like,  man. 2) Kevin Spacey finally gets a shot at making big movies, not  before time.  But that is it."
"musicallyrt","1","20","42","25 March 2013"," Trash
","I only ever take the trouble to review movies that I truly despise, and Se7en is one of them. The film is a trite, clich√© and asinine piece - whilst possessing some virtues, is composed primarily of sins. A quick note - other reviews seem to be criticising the ""excessive"" violence and gore in this film - what do you expect from a film about a serial killer? Firstly - the acting is good, for the most part. Freeman is good as the Dashiell Hammet/Raymond Chandler inspired cynical old cop. Brad Pitt overacts every time he is on screen, making his unbearable character even more unbearable. Kevin Spacey does a suitably creepy (albeit clich√©) job of portraying a sadistic, masochistic serial killer.<br/><br/>However, my main beefs with the film lies not in the acting, but in the plot. There are plot holes abound (I encourage you to read the review ""se7en problems with se7en"") but this isn't the only place where the film falls short. The entire story is predictable - as soon as we are introduced to Paltrow's character we know that she's going to be the subject of some nasty work. The final scene has to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes in film history...<br/><br/>The religious fundamentalist angle. Not that I'm overtly sensitive to negative portrayals of religion, but it's getting a bit trite, don't you think? John Doe (And yes, that's the name of the antagonist in this film...) killing so-and-so because the Big Man Upstairs told him so. I mean, why can't we have a serial killer inspired by Nietszche or Stephen Hawkings or Isaac Newton? Why does it always have to be religion? The ""tributes"" to film noir include the colour palette used (yup, you guessed it, if you were to compress the film into a single frame, then that frame would be mostly black and white), the fashion, the typewriter that Freeman's character uses, the taxis, the rain, the smog, the is-it-New-York-or-Chicago-nameless-city, the well-spoken and well-read central protagonist & antagonist, the endless references (atypical to noir and pulp) to literature such as ""Dante's Inferno"" But this doesn't come across as some new and profound take on it - as say Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) or the Coenn Brothers (The Big Lebowski, Fargo) managed to do at a similar time, but it just comes across as a constant rehash of lamentable pulp and noir tropes that we've all seen before. It doesn't come across as engaging, entertaining, though provoking or cool - it's boring.<br/><br/>Seek out films such as ""The Missing Person"" or ""Brick"" for a much more engaging take on neo-noir."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","15","30","11 November 2006"," The Good & Bad Of 'Se7en'
","I am shocked that I watch, much less own, this movie, and as often as I do. It's so dark, so uncomfortable to watch in many spots and so profane (although I use a TV Guardian) that it's not a very likable story and film.....but I find it fascinating. Let's continue on with the bad, and the good, of this film - at least from my vantage point.<br/><br/>THE BAD - As a Christian, I get tired of seeing the villains, the sickest of serial killers, portrayed as Christians. It's unbelievable Hollywood bias that would never be tolerated if minorities were the constant victim of this kind of prejudice. In case, you don't get the message they even pass by a brightly-lit neon cross in the guy's room! That, and another cheap shot about a Southern Baptist being the killer, and comments about the sicko ""preaching a sermon"" plus Kevin Spacey's talks about people's sins....all are designed to portray a sick killer as a religious nutcase. Also, for further Liberal slants, good-guy Morgan Freeman is talking to Gywneth Paltrow at a neighborhood diner and he relates having talked an old girlfriend into having an abortion which Freeman says, ""to this day, I am positive it was the right move."" Yet, he also says it was a mistake and he regrets it. Huh?? Other negatives include too many f-words and usages of the Lord's name in vain, mos of them said by Brad Pitt. There are also several really, really downright gross scenes in here. If you don't expect them, you can easily be shocked with these disturbing images: some very sick pictures of tortured and mutilated bodies.<br/><br/>THE GOOD - Despite all of the above, the story - as shocking and sordid as it is - is a fascinating one. It gets you so involved that it's almost impossible to put down, even with the unpleasant scenes. The finale is memorable, too. I also appreciated the wonderful cinematography in here. There are some strange colors in here but it all looks fantastic on the special-edition DVD. Spacey was relative unknown in his acting career at this time was riveting in that final 30 minutes when he had his speaking lines. All the actors in here are excellent. This is a film that is impossible to forget.<br/><br/>OVERALL - As a friend once told me, ""This movie is very disturbing."" It's also extremely interesting, but beware it's not easy to watch."

This is an example of the gratuitous use of violence. The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers. David Finscher is talented but I can just imagine him and Quentin masturbating to graphic violence. They need it to get off."

Like most crime films the writer/director feeds the view just enough information to avoid giving away the story even when such restrictions are illogical and unrealistic. <br/><br/>The film is utterly disconnected from the realities of a major criminal investigation. We're expected to believe that NYPD would assign only two homicide detectives to what is clearly a serial killer. <br/><br/>In the real world dozens of detectives would be assigned. The FBI bought in. Crime scenes would have their lights turned on (instead of the melodramatic and never ending use of torches), and instead of following like hansel and gretal the crumbs the killers has left them they would be following real leads.<br/><br/>Canvesing, obtaining the CCTV's surrounding each victims house for several blocks. Establishing a when the killer was there and working out where he came and went to.

Subjective things like tone, narrative and photography are well personal choice you either like em or you don't but they in themselves don't make the film good or bad. <br/><br/>A good intelligent film treats the viewer with respect. <br/><br/>Lastly the constant ripping on Silence of the Lambs (there are several comments in the film that refer to SOTL) when this film is far more of a marketing puff piece is an utter joke. <br/><br/>I've deleted this film, and refused to even watch the much vaunted ""twist"".

","I know there are many reasons to like or dislike any movie, and that most people who rate a movie 1 or 0 simply don't 'get it'. I feel a great sympathy for those who cannot find anything to praise in a film. Se7en is not an especially bad movie; it creates and maintains a particular atmosphere most of the way through; it is deliberately grungy, nasty, and brutal. The extreme lack of lighting serves a purpose - Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now seems bathed in floodlights by comparison - and the film achieves its ends efficiently enough.<br/><br/>I am relatively OK with gore and violence (either on-screen or implied.) Many plots have holes, many movies get very clunky at the end, many actors share features with cardboard, and Se7en is no exception. If this film were in any way critical of the human capacity for the sheer unbridled brutality which it portrays, I might forgive it. If it had any redeeming qualities whatever, I like to think I would be prepared to try to acknowledge them, however grudgingly. Many dark movies manage to evince a knowing smile at some point, or succeed through technical brilliance or gripping acting.<br/><br/>But I came out of this film wanting to throw myself under the nearest bus. It was as if everyone involved with the making of this film had spat (I think I spelled that correctly) in my seat. My experience of this film exactly matched that of another reviewer: it raped my soul. What worries me most is that there are quite so many positive reviews for this movie.

","A film designed to appeal to those who have a fascination with graphic cruelty and sadism. The film telegraphs it's ending from the moment in the middle of the film when Pitt, the detective, shouts after the killer: ""My name is Mills. That's spelled, M-I-L-L-S !"" It's a wonder he didn't add: ""And I live with my much loved wife at 18 Ceder Street, Apartment 3b"". (In how many of these films does the killer eventually wind up going after the hero's beloved wife or child as part of the movie's climax? It's so much of a cliche of the genre that it's become a standard closing plot element.) The most depressing part of this film experience is not that the good guys' lose and that the Jeffrey Dahlmer wannabe triumphs, it is that Hollywood will do anything for a buck - and that has to be another catagory of deadly sin not originally contemplated by Dante. I don't care how good the special effects are. If the movie sets out to use them to deliberately sicken the viewer; then it is an unimaginative misuse of the technology. A 1 out of 10, with 9 points lost for depravity and the cynical exploitation of the viewing public."

","Let me begin by saying that when I watched this movie I loved it. It had a stellar cast and an amazing concept. The plot was at just the right pace and never bored me. It had a dark theme although this theme worked perfectly for the way the movie ran. <br/><br/>The thing that ruined the movie for me was the ending. First of all the fact that it was Kevin Spacy that was John Doe was obvious. Did anyone have trouble discerning that the caller was Spacy? However, that only bothered me because the filmmakers though the audience was so stupid that they could not know Kevin Spacy would be in it from the beginning.<br/><br/>The real issue was the fate of the last two sins. I do not remember the order, however, Gluttony, Greed, Pride, Lust and Sloth were all murdered before John Doe turned himself in. Then he turns himself in and somehow convinces the detectives to bring him to the open field. Then the head in the box sparks Brad Pitt's Wrath into killing Spacy's Envy. The problem that I had with this ending was that Greed, Gluttony, Pride, Sloth, Lust, and Envy are murdered and Wrath goes to prison. The penalty for the other six sins are death, but, the penalty for Wrath is prison. The concept makes no sense whatsoever. They should either all go to prison or all die. Make up your mind.<br/><br/>If I could have changed the ending it would be something like this: -Instead of John Doe turning himself in he calls Brad Pitt and says that Pitt and Freeman must meet him in this open field. They must come alone. When they arrive Doe then draws a gun and makes Pitt and Freeman put theirs away. Freeman is sent back a few yards and Spacy gives Pitt the box with the head. Before Pitt opens the box Spacy puts away the gun. Pitt is then overcome with Wrath, draws his gun, and shoots Spacy. Only known to Spacy, a bomb is strapped to his chest with a dead mans switch. Thus the bomb explodes killing Pitt.<br/><br/>Therefore in my alternate ending Spacy dies from his Envy and Pitt's Wrath kills himself.<br/><br/>Just a thought."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","3","4","23 March 2018"," An unsettling, dark and hard hitting thriller that will stay with you long after its gut-wrenching end.
","Deeply unsettling and intensely dark, this hard hitting thriller relies on great performances and a fully developed script to create a relentlessly oppressive tone that builds a growing sense of unease throughout. 'Se7en (1995)' is an interesting and subversive detective drama that layers its gritty, grimy and gruesome aesthetic atop a competent and compelling mystery to toe-curling effect. Plus, that bleak ending and gut-wrenching twist really punctuate the piece - providing an apt, if horrific, release for all the tension built up before it. 8/10"
"CinematicInceptions","8","3","4","5 September 2017"," Look Closer.
","This is a movie that should be seen to the very end. Were it not for the hype and reputation that Se7en has gathered since its release 22 years ago, I might have been inclined to stop at a couple points, but I could tell it was leading *somewhere* and, without giving spoilers, the destination is worth the wait.<br/><br/>I won't dwell on the premise much because its been touched upon a lot by other people, and I don't find it to be one of the more intriguing aspects of the story. John Doe is interesting because of the odd humanity that he has. A lot of mentally disturbed characters like the Joker or Hannibal Lecter are portrayed as just totally out-there and nuts, and I guess you could argue that the same goes for John Doe. But there's something about him that makes him more relatable. He didn't feel like someone who you would automatically label as dangerous if you knew him from work or school. He seems to have infected himself with the evil around him, or something like that.<br/><br/>While I was watching the movie I wasn't that invested in the two detectives, but now looking back at it I can see that there is some good depth to both of them. Mills isn't that likable, which surprised me since Brad Pitt usually plays more easygoing and charming characters. But he is driven and wants to make a positive impact in his job as a cop, which I didn't see at first. Somerset's backstory is exposed a lot to show us that he's a tired man who has seen a lot and is on the verge of losing hope. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is the one at the bar shortly before John Doe turns himself in, because this is where all of the movie's main themes are brought forward. It's easy to lose sight of the themes amid all of the mystery and grisly murders, but the bar scene brings up two very important things. First is when Somerset says that John Doe is ""just a man"". No matter how nuts he might be, he is a human being, and however sinful the people he killed might have been, they were as human as you or me. Secondly, the two detectives discuss how dangerous apathy can be. The movie as a whole seems to be suggesting that people are apathetic because it is the easy way out, and this is why John Doe has to ""hit them with a sledge hammer"" to get their attention.<br/><br/>Having seen much of Fincher's later work, I was a bit let down by his visual tone and camera work here. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't his best, but it was also his first real movie (Alien 3 is not a true Fincher work). The script wasn't immediately impressive, but in retrospect, it was actually pretty good with creating the characters and crafting their dialogue. The pacing could have been a little better, but on the whole I must applaud Andrew Walker on his work here. The performances from our three main roles were also solid. Again, not flashy, but servicing the movie well and giving good life to the characters.<br/><br/>The ending was definitely dramatically satisfying. Not one of the more shocking twists that I've seen, but it turned the tables pretty nicely and fit perfectly with the theme. Which brings me back to my point from the beginning: that this movie should be seen all the way through. The only reason to turn it off is if you can't stomach the gruesome visuals and overall tone. I like dark movies, but I know not everyone does. So if you haven't seen Se7en and don't think you want to, just watch the bar scene. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."

","Se7en is one of my favorite movies. I guess that says a lot about me. I can't pass it by when flicking through my cable guide. Every time I watch it I see or hear something new. Morgan Freeman is superb as a tired and emotionally beaten down cop getting ready to retire. Brad Pitt is very convincing as a young new detective running his first serial killer investigation with all the nerves and ambitious recklessness you'd expect from having to partner with a veteran on his last case before retirement. The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins. The real stars of this movie are the writer, director and set designers for presenting incredibly intricate and graphic murder scenes and making all the characters likable. The writing is deep and you have to pay attention to every detail. As the bodies mount you find yourself counting down each deadly sin to the incredible climax and shocking but truly awesome ending. You can't go wrong with the cast assembled in Se7en. It's a great movie for whodunit fans that like a little more tension and voyeurism in their crime dramas. It will not disappoint."

""Seven"" is Exhibit A, and what I'd remembered about it over the last twenty-odd years was the mindscrew ending - as well as the omnipresent rain and dingy interiors, a world I don't want to stick around in.<br/><br/>But within that hopeless environment is a deeply unnerving thriller and even a good cop drama. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well-defined characters; theirs is an abrasive relationship but a good one to focus on as the world festers around them. The horrors in this movie run the gamut from shock to viewer's imagination; and as ghastly as those crime scenes are, they're handled with serious skill. And then there's the ending, a magic act that could've failed so easily, yet holds up amazingly well.<br/><br/>It's surprising that such an ugly, wet and claustrophobic movie was filmed in Southern California. And that wretched setting gets under my skin. Who knows when I'll sit down to watch this again, but it surprised me as an adult.<br/><br/>8/10"

Pitt was still on the upswing of his career, ""Gwyn"" was still not yet a household name (which was a good thing for this role), and of course Freeman was at the top of his game (see SHAWSHANK, UNFORGIVEN, OUTBREAK, etc.) once again playing the voice of reason to perfection. And throw in Spacey, who was still in the last stages of being a THAT GUY (albeit, one of the very best THAT GUYS-- he would pick up a Supporting Actor Oscar the next year for THE USUAL SUSPECTS), and you've got one helluva cast.<br/><br/>But it wouldn't have all mattered if the story wasn't any good, and this one, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is top notch. I guess my only real beef is that we wait too long until we actually get involved visually with Spacey's John Doe. But once he shows, the movie is even more riveting down the stretch. The chase scene and then finally the car ride scene are tremendous, as is the final showdown which I won't spoil here but I think every movie buff is familiar with by now.<br/><br/>WATCH IT AGAIN WHEN YOU CAN!"

Most of them are at a 6 average mark or below and quite short (not so many over 1h30 min). Se7en has, almost everything that a thriller needs: action, emotion, curiosity, a good screenplay, good actors, unpredictable end and it is not a short movie.

","Gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, envy: in other words, all known mortal sins.

Frankly, the first ten minutes it was. But further interest grew with every minute, and I realized that I more and more like film.<br/><br/>Action is slow, everything goes on as usual and there is not a single superfluous scene, which is not related to the plot. The viewer watches the protagonists completely trust them, and they, in turn, slowly trying to come to a logical conclusion and bring it to mind.<br/><br/>For the role of an experienced detective William Somerset and his young, ambitious team-mate David Mills took two real professionals in their field - Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. However, psychologically, if you can call it that, it is none other than a maniac John Doe (Kevin Spacey). Why are we in some degree can not blame him? The viewer realizes that the offender commits a brutal murder, but the victim is so disgusting in his sins, he does not seem to exhibit them regret.<br/><br/>In fact, if you speculate on the film, you realize that it bears a great life meaning. Especially it is necessary to pay tribute to the last episode, denouement: everything becomes clear, and that's when we really hurts to know that the man - the king of creation - so simply obey the devil.<br/><br/>With regard to the comparison of the film with the ""Silence of the Lambs"", or more accurately compare the two actors who played the role of a ruthless killer, let this and many will not agree, but Kevin Spacey did his job not worse than Anthony Hopkins, although the hero Spacey has been assigned so long as to the role of the lecturer.<br/><br/>In short, that's that, and definitely worth a movie cinema - worthy, offered to a competent, but still with good actors.<br/><br/>Bravo David Fincher and everyone who worked on the creation of this painting!"

"sandnair87","10","3","4","24 March 2015"," Se7en is a Sinfully Enthralling Thriller!
","Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.<br/><br/>Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence ‚Äì no spoilers here!) is a clich√© pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.<br/><br/>It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror. <br/><br/>Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!"

","Wow, here is the thing, most movies that have been out for a long time and I have been told that are great but have not got a chance to see yet, well, most of the time they never live up to the hype. That is not the case with Se7en. This is one amazing movie. The acting was stellar, directing was spot on and the use of the city and rain added so much atmosphere that it was almost another character in the film. I did see the end coming even though I was hoping that I was wrong.(I think I knew what was coming not because this movie was predictable, more so that after this movie lots of movies and TV shows have stolen from it, so it kind of easy to see where it was going, I am sure if I had seen this when it was first out I would have been surprised) This is a five star movie that I think will still be great 50 years from now. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review. http://youtu.be/WCVDBOziSrM"

","Se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another. <br/><br/>It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers. <br/><br/>There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti. <br/><br/>Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion. <br/><br/>I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. For those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of."

With this film Fincher ranked himself among the most wanted directors and gained a reputation of true heir of Hitchcock, which was confirmed by his later movies ""Play"" and ""Panic Room"". The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize Brad Pitt's acting (as in ""Fight Club"") which proved that he is not just a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but also showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a veteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of the killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the film is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders make it even more stressful. I was particularly impressed by the way murders were described, which are quite original and leave a big impression on the viewer.

The actual explanations of what john doe has done by the investigators (at any point in the film) or the written account of john doe's random thoughts in the book that detective sommerset read aloud were more disturbing than spaceys performance at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Morgan freeman plays a reasonably believable part - brad pitt is pretty clich√© but he isn't an absolutely pivotal character so it doesn't bring the movie down too far but spacy is a real disappointment his part was pivotal - the film is building him up the whole movie as you don't get to see him until near the end and if he would of pulled it off the rest of the movie which was a bit slow would of been worth it.<br/><br/>Yeah the whole idea of seven deadly sins was pretty much Hollywood schmaltz but again that wasn't massively jarring to the entertain value of the movie and could of been better overlooked if spacey made that idea his own. If he had seemed totally detached from reality and didn't explain half as much as he did to the mills character in the car; maybe even played the 'seven sins idea' as a bit of a wind up to see if people would swallow it - had he seemed more obscure and/or incoherent at times and mixed it up with some head games and cognitive exchanges it might of been more worthwhile.<br/><br/>Bottom line i didn't believe he did those murders he seemed too sane and plain.

It's always been a favourite even though for some inexplicable reason I have only seen it just the once.<br/><br/>So it was with some trepidation that I bought the 2-disc DVD on ebay recently and decided to watch it the night before last. I wondered if knowing the dramatic outcome already would spoil the viewing pleasure of what goes before.....It didn't.<br/><br/>I wasn't wrong as a 15 year old in my assumptions that it was the best thriller I'd ever seen and while I've seen some great films over the last 13 years I'm pleased to say that this one is right up there with the best of them. It's also weird how I seemed to remember every single detail from every scene, even with my notoriously dodgy memory.<br/><br/>I just can't fault this flawless film, Fincher was on top of his game here and it's definitely my favourite of his and I am a fan of Fight Club"
"emperor_bender","10","3","4","24 February 2008"," ""Well THAT was money well spent""
","It really was. I saw this movie in a Five Below store. There were about 10 copies of the normal version, and abut 2 of the special edition ones that look like notebooks. I went on a limb and bought the special edition for $5. I had no idea what this movie was like nor what it was about. But I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. This movie turned out to be a personal favorite. Morgan Freeman was excellent, not just because he's a great actor, but because in this movie he was different than the ""optimistic, nature-loving"" characters he usually plays. In this movie he plays the close-to-retirement Detective William Somerset, who dislikes the world and what it has become. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the loud-mouthed, over-jumpy Detective David Mills. Usually I don't like Brad Pitt and I think hes obnoxious and a lousy actor, but in this movie I'll make an exception. He was obnoxious in some ways in this movie, but it fit his character perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a decent performance as the stressed Tracy Mills. R. Lee Ermey was great as the Police Captain, I always enjoy his performances no matter what the circumstances. Even the bad guy (Will not give the actor's name to prevent spoilers) was Grade A in his part. The weather was rainy for most of the movie, and scenes were always lighted in small doses, meaning it was dark and gloomy for most of the film. THis really set the tone. I recommend this movie to fans of crime, thriller movies. 10/10"
"pretg","10","3","4","11 February 2008"," Still my favorite movie even after 13 years.
","This movie is such a 'blockbuster' that it is only movie I have ever purchased on DVD. I do not purchase movies because they are a waste of money to me, because I don't like to watch most movies more than once, and because it is so easy to download movies to ones PC from different websites for little money. But I purchased Se7en because this is the one movie I can watch over again. Me purchasing a movie is the highest assessment I can give. So watch Se7en for yourself; it is suspenseful, a thriller, has a great cast of actors who all perform outstandingly, and most important of all an ending no one could have guessed. I just wish that other writers, directors, etc., could produce more movies of this quality and genre."

","Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light ... (John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432) <br/><br/>""Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tag-line for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher: <br/><br/>~ Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.<br/><br/>As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain (R Lee Ermey) while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.<br/><br/>Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.<br/><br/>It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~ Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher (Zodiac) but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clich√©s found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.<br/><br/>Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp (Secret Window) was ultimately realised once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on. Se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, Se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all.<br/><br/>Co-stars John C McGinley as California (captain of SWAT team) <br/><br/>Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review."

","What is the most simple way to present the Human's dark side? The answer is by sins: Sins that from the Fifth Century announce Man's most awful deviations from God.<br/><br/>This movie isn't catholic yet, nor does it have an approach: it's impressively dark and violently grim. From the first start, the characters are presented surrounded by a whispering, sad rain. The mood is also set with dampened colors and grayish tones. Nobody ever smiles in the film, they laugh for few seconds when united in a dinner. But throughout the story, Detective Mills (Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Freeman) will set up on a case that is horrendous and enigmatic: a serial killer roams the city with the Capital Sins as basis to create his assassinations. He preaches, according to Somerset. Mills isn't accustomed to the following Odyssey, he is yet not aware of the fatal obscurity of the Human Mind. Somerset is about to retire, and he knows what he deals with his job, Morgan Freeman with his tired eyes show you everything the character has seen among his trail.<br/><br/>As the play is opened; the killer behind the murders shows to be analytical and intelligent and he isn't afraid of people chasing him: he just introduces him to his ultimate ""work"". He plays with them. He presents a puzzle for them to solve as he is in total control. Kevin Spacey will surprise everyone with his psychotic demeanor and his empty gestures, showing spiritual deprivation.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is likely not for everyone. It is intended to expose the Dark, Twisted side of mankind, engulfed by a series of morbidly well thought murders. Actings are stupendous, all variating from a negative panoply: depicting Sadness, Anger, Worry superbly. Nothing is cheerful, nothing is lightning and warming. The movie shows you perfectly what man is all about on their obscure range. It is shattering, it is demanding. But it is one of the most excellent experiences on nowadays cinema."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","3","4","12 November 2007"," The standard of excellence for the psychological thriller. A masterpiece and a classic.
","You really can't say enough about Se7en. It may have lacked critical acclaim (how this wasn't at least nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay is beyond me), but this film is easily in the top 10 films of the 1990's, and one could argue that it is the best. Andrew Walker pens a marvelous script that is brilliantly realized by David Fincher, along with the help of 3 of the greatest actors of their generations.<br/><br/>David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young up and coming detective who's just been transferred. His partner is William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who's on the verge of retirement. Different though they may be, they must track a serial killer who is choosing his victims according to the seven deadly sins (gluttony, sloth, greed, lust, pride, envy, and wrath).<br/><br/>What makes Se7en so excellent in my mind is how incredibly real it is. There's the gritty feel to the film, and Fincher uses great shots and locations to effectively pass on his intentions to us. The film is one of the most suspenseful I've ever seen, and that is also attributed to Fincher, not to mention a wonderful musical score. Andrew Walker's script is fantastic. Easily one of the best of all time. It's such a simple concept, but the creation of the characters and the depth and development of each one is one truly remarkable quality of the script. The best quality of course, is the unpredictable, unorthodox, and scary ending that will make your stomach sink like a weight. The cinematography and editing are brilliant as the film is fluid and seamless. Technically, this film is perfect.<br/><br/>The acting...well, anyone who's ever said Brad Pitt is for show obviously hasn't seen this or Fight Club. He's wonderful as the motivated, yet rash and sarcastic David Mills. It's a great character arc, and Pitt plays the complex character with heart and ease. Morgan Freeman...what can you say? He's Morgan Freeman, so he's excellent. Once again, a well written character that the actor takes and makes his own. Freeman is magnificent again.<br/><br/>Of course, our 2 detectives are great, but the true stand out of the film is the actor who plays the killer, whose inclusion in the film was kept secret until the day of release. Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything. He gives a magnificent, yet haunting and disturbing performance that will stick with you for day after day. It is one of the best villainous performances of all time. The final confrontation is spectacular because of him.<br/><br/>All in all, Se7en is a must see if you are a movie fan. It's one of the best films I've ever seen, and you'd be a fool to miss this classic. As terrifying as it is suspenseful, Se7en is a thriller that will stick with you, an experience you'll never forget. I cannot recommend this movie more.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

","This movie is a cross between Silence of the lambs and Bone collector. There are some very clever investigation scenes and clever writing and set creation.<br/><br/>This movie was a showcase for Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. This movie had one of Morgan Freeman's best roles where he plays a educated, intelligent and experienced detective. Brad Pitt has a role but is not as impressive.<br/><br/>This movie certainly had a new approach to police / horror movies. This movie and Silence of the lambs brought a whole new level of gore and horror to mystery movies. This is not a kid friendly movie and does not have a happy ending."
"Strider_1978","10","3","4","23 November 2006"," A dark, mature port, nothing to dilute this one.
","This picture takes some considerable constitution to watch, to endure.<br/><br/>Se7en is not a nice film.<br/><br/>The sets and locations are dark, gritty, grimy, nasty and bleak. There are no bright hues, nothing flashy or rosy to welcome the viewer.<br/><br/>What grabs us first(perhaps) are the very real homes of Det. Mills and Det. Sommerset. There are sound effects of the police sirens passing by. There are the muffled sounds of neighbours through the walls. There is the ticking of various clocks.<br/><br/>This looks a lot like 'real' life.<br/><br/>It's quite hard for me to put a lot of this into words. The investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes Mills and Sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins. It's important, I feel to view se7en from time to time, simply to make us feel better about our own life. The score and the sound effects fit the dirty, nasty unforgiving feel of the film. You arn't sure if it's John Doe that is the enemy or the world outside. I'm sure as I type in the safety of my own home somebody somewhere is committing an unspeakable crime. Maybe they will be caught. Maybe they won't.<br/><br/>The acting very good from the main characters, and solid from the lessors. The interesting part of me is looking at how Mills and Sommerset work as a team, being of an entirely different nature. Sommerset is calm, collected, intellectual, elloquent, subtle and wise. Sommerset is like a sniffer dog released from the pound after a long and tedious stay. Grumpy, intolerant, verbally unrefined, impatient, yet with a good heart.<br/><br/>All of the crimes shown strike cords within us. Some more horrific than others; all thought provoking and psychologically challenging. Just how *do* you continue to eat, completely full and unable to swallow another mouthfull . .only there is a gun to your head and the trigger will end your life it you stop .. <br/><br/>It's hard to recommend this one to anyone. Film fans i.e those who appreciate a well made movie will be on the edge or their seat come the building chase. Others will look on in partial disgust, partial intrigue as the camera shows the horrific detail of John Doe's methodical skills.<br/><br/>What un-nerves me, is to think that out there there is a John Doe out here. He's not count Dracula, he's not Jack the ripper. He is a normal man, perhaps enjoying a simple life. We might see him in the food market or the pharmacy. We might see him and acknowledge him, or we might not. That individual has a darker plan in his mind that you or I or any *good* people could conceive of, and we won't know until something happens. <br/><br/>There are no apologies and no compromises. This is a brilliant, bleak, horrific and psychologically damaging look at the darker side of human nature. Highly recommended for those of a mature mindset."

","After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.<br/><br/>The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". Good luck.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.<br/><br/>In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.<br/><br/>Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.<br/><br/>Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.<br/><br/>For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect."
"matty79m","7","3","4","22 January 2005"," Very good movie with shocking ending.
","Se7en is an undoubtful masterpiece concerning suspense, locations and camera. The actors are also brilliant and the story is one of the most thrilling and intelligent of our time. Really great: none of the killings are shown and are left to the mind of the viewer. So, why should someone like me who has just written so nicely about this movie rate it with just se7en stars? It is because of its ending. Surprisingly indeed, but... I think, a little too surprising. In the ending this movie seems to lack in logic. The characters Pitt and Freeman are playing make some progress in the story and they get to know each other better and better. Freeman's role is the one of a very intelligent cop who often has to calm down the hot-headed character Pitt is playing. But in the last minutes of the movie - I cannot imagine why - he doesn't calm him down and absolutely underestimates the danger. It seems to me that this movie just wanted to have a surprising, shocking ending (it really doesn't need to have!!!) and spoiled it a little bit to me. But anyway, this is a brilliant movie everyone should have watched. Once again, se7en out of ten!"

","This great thriller is about a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) and his Se7en victims who represent the Se7en deadly sins.

Se7en has one of the best but shocking and surprising endings of all time. The end is something nobody would expect, i kept rewinding over and over again to see them 3 short seconds where you see...

Kevin Spacey's role in this movie was a surprise for everyone, well except for the people who use IMDB, it said who the killer was played by.<br/><br/>The most shocking moment for me was when you see that body on the bed and everyone thinks that person is dead because of the state of the body, but its not, that scene shocked me alot, i never forgot it and never will.<br/><br/>Overall i gave Se7en 9/10, everyone that likes thrillers should go see this movie, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

Kevin Spacey played John Doe flawlessly! Gwyneth Paltrow was good. R. Lee Ermey was good as always! It was surprising to see Richard Roundtree in the movie. John C. McGinley had a small part which he did good for the limited time he got to perform and Richard Portnow was good. The music by Howard Shore was very good. David Fincher's directing was unique! The last part of the movie when John Doe turns himself, when he is in the car with Pitt and Freeman, and when they were on the desert and the helicopter scenes were through the binoculars, and when Pitt and Freeman were going back and forth, that entire scene is one of the greatest in cinematic history! This film is really horrifying and not for the squeamish but if you love gruesome murder mystery movies this is a great one to watch!"
"Lumpenprole","7","3","4","21 January 2002"," genre film with some style
","I thought this movie was a pretty remarkable exercise in style and an incredibly controlled performance by Morgan Freeman.  Most of it is kinda cliched ¬ñ the retiring cop breaks-in a rookie (by-the-book vs. the loose cannon working on a hunch), the clever serial killer, the soulless city, the standard noir ending where the searcher realizes that he is what he's been searching for and so on. The art direction is wonderful, with a real attention to detail. The movie makes for riveting viewing the first time around.  I find myself skipping chapters though when I try to watch it again.<br/><br/>To make the last act measure up to the first hour of the movie, I think the writing should have emphasized the idea that the wrath/envy set up was an example of John Doe improvising after the detectives found his apartment. The wrath/envy scene doesn't have nearly the convoluted menace of the Sloth or Gluttony scenes.  It's a noir thriller and Gwen is unaccounted for - the end seemed pretty obvious to me compared to the craziness of ""HELP ME"" in fingerprints."

","Morbidly intriguing, disgustingly fascinating.  I was deeply shaken by what I would call ""my favourite film"".<br/><br/>Forget Brad Pitt, I found Morgan Freeman's acting amazing.  He is calm cool and collected throughout the whole film.  A complete stoic.<br/><br/>Some good jazz tunes are part of the soundtrack and the film has style.<br/><br/>Watch carefully, the ""lust"" scene.  I didn't understand what had specifically happened, the first time that I saw it.<br/><br/>I would like to compare the film with the psychological personality inventory called the Enneagram.  ""Ennea"" is Armenian for 9ine and I guess gram means...chart?  It is based on 9ine different personalities which, according to some sources corresponds to the se7en deadly sins + 2wo more.<br/><br/>1ne = wrath<br/><br/>2wo = pride<br/><br/>thr3e = deceit<br/><br/>4our = envy<br/><br/>fi5e = greed<br/><br/>6ix = fear<br/><br/>se7en = gluttony<br/><br/>ei8ht = lust<br/><br/>9ine = sloth<br/><br/>There is a theory about the enneagram (which I don't agree with) that states that a person will transform from 1ne personality to another in a particular order to become more psychologically healthy as a ""whole"" person.  The order is this:<br/><br/>se7en: becomes fi5e<br/><br/>fi5e: becomes ei8ht<br/><br/>ei8ht: becomes 2wo<br/><br/>2wo: becomes 4our<br/><br/>4our: becomes 1ne who becomes se7en to complete the cycle<br/><br/>This is the same order that the ""sins"" are mentioned throughout the film. It's basically the same order as above.<br/><br/>se7en gluttony is mentioned first<br/><br/>fi5e greed is mentioned second<br/><br/>ei8ht lust is mentioned.  9ine sloth is mentioned, which is next door to ei8ht and breaks the cycle in half<br/><br/>2wo pride is mentioned<br/><br/>4our envy is mentioned<br/><br/>1ne wrath is mentioned.<br/><br/>In both cases The order is 7-5-8-2-4-1.  I was obsessed by this fact in 1995 when the film came out because I was studying the enneagram at the time.  Obviously, someone needed a life :)"

Once you immerse yourself deeply into the movie's plot, you would be confused about what makes you more uncomfortable, the murders or the atmosphere of the movie. The dialogues written for Morgan Freeman's character, Somerset were poetic and often brought calmness to the otherwise eerie movie. While I was not very convinced with the performance of Brad Pitt or the chemistry between him and Morgan Freeman in the beginning, I got the hang of it and appreciated Mill's character as the movie progressed and we were made a part of the deep conversations that Somerset and Mills shared during their investigations.

"heatsilver","10","4","6","21 September 2016"," Man vs. Society
","Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic na√Øve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film."

","David Fincher's great style of directing, a movie that's brilliantly dark and it's superbly acted. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are a pairing couple or opposite personalities and Kevin Spacey is the villain we all love and hate, such a great performance. Intelligent writing with no clich√©s and the imagery of the grotesque never descends into thoughts unnecessary gore or sensationalism. Brilliant cinematography with a bleak tone, the film has a sense of dread and some moments are climax. Se7en sticks with you in your and it's really unforgettable. The plot keeps you hooked until the most terrifying final moments you will ever see. It is scary because it uses your imagination against you in a deep, deeper level.

Realistic characters, an evil serial killer but not as much emphasis on gore more storyline.<br/><br/>David Fincher did a class job, acting from Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey was beyond outstanding.<br/><br/>Se7en follows detectives Somerset and Mill... Somerset is an older mature detective whos ready to retire whilst Mills is an energetic yet not as knowledgeable, we see more of Mill' private life with his wife Tracy.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off after the murder of an obese man... suspicious but no motive the cops are at a standstill. That is until a wealthy lawyer gets killed and in blood 'Greed' is written. Knowing there is a serial killer on the loose its down to the detectives to hunt a man with an obsession with the deadly sins killing innocent people.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie I like a lot, I wont give it away but it shows how sick and twisted minds of serial killers are.<br/><br/>Se7en will surely stick in your mind"

Another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling. The director, David Fincher, did an amazing job in crafting this movie, it's proved how talented he is and something noteworthy is in some particular scenes, how they were shot regarding the style, angles of the camera that make you feel like you're in the scene.<br/><br/>The cast, both leading and supporting, did a marvelous work in performing the characters. They're so consistent and believable, we really have the chance to know the identity of every single one in terms of dreams, emotions, regrets. Morgan Freeman plays an old detective, Somerset, who is fed up with his detective's life, because the city and the world as in general are too hateful, the apathy is present in people's everyday life and he can't take any longer this. He's methodic, pragmatic and due to his long career in the police, he's very meticulous in a crime scene. Detective Mills is played by Brad Pitt, different from Morgan Freeman's character is a young detective with a lot of stamina, enthusiasm but he's reckless and very emotional too. The contrast between the characters is pretty perceptible and is very well explored to show a man already marked by a tough and cruel world, Somerset, and other still untouched and a bit naive about the cruelty of the society.<br/><br/>The murder scenes are so realistic and disgusting, they really make you feel uncomfortable and revulsion witnessing them and passing how sick the serial killer is. The murderer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey. The tension drastically grows when he's speaking, his performance succeeds in portraying a person mentally disordered, a psychopath. No Doubt, John Doe after such a remarkable acting gained a sit among the most famous psychopaths of the cinema."

","Throughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse for murder. The director in ""Seven"" cleverly makes use the seven sins as Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin of them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the name of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their weaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets defending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The director David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch each brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman and Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the wiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer taunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are filled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want the killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more than that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and fills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also want him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him! The question to be asked, is the unborn child saved from been born in a world full of religious contradiction or should those who wrong us be punished without question?"

","""Se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like ""Chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""Se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.<br/><br/>This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.<br/><br/>Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of ""Se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.<br/><br/>But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed ¬Ö an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.<br/><br/>The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though ""Se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.<br/><br/>Again, ""Se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence."

","I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors.

","The so-called brilliant twist or surprise ending was not much of a twist or even a surprise in my opinion. (Spoiler warning) There is a moment towards the end of the film which refers to G.P.'s character . . . it slows down the scene that is happening at the time, it is horribly timed and out of place, and there is simply no reason for it . . . except for one thing : to hint that something is going to happen to G.P's character. Only, it is so out of place that it is not a hint, it is a misplaced scream, and considering everything that has already taken place and the sins that are left, you have a definite idea of what is going to happen. The movie would have been better by leaving this moment out. The only surprise for me (BIG Spoiler warning) was it seeming to be the head as opposed to the baby/fetus in the box. Personally, I think the idea of it being the baby is better than the head because it emphasizes both their deaths more so and it is sicker. And ""sick"" seems to be what they were going for for most of the film. Anyhow, overall, it's an okay movie. But the ending to me just doesn't come anywhere at all close to living up to the hype.

","I remember sitting down to watch se7en in a jam packed cinema on its release day, I eagerly anticipated the movie and left, some two hours later, in a rage that has not subsided to this day. I have just completed my second viewing, curious as to whether I would hold the same view numerous years later, the disappointment, nae utter astonishment, at how flawed the film is, has not subsided.<br/><br/>I struggle to comprehend how viewers can hail the performances as stellar, sure Spacey turns in a classic spaceyesque performance, however Freeman and Pitt are simply playing Freeman and Pitt, we have seen it all before and since. The less said about Paltrow the better, she is wooden, insipid and utterly void of any attributes to which one could ever associate envy.<br/><br/>This leads to the single biggest problem with the film, we are supposed to accept that a mastermind serial killer intent on making a biblical statement about sin and punishment, who has spent 12 months planning and carrying out his masterwork has built the entire years efforts around a finale which hinges, not only upon the investigating officer being married, but more importantly the investigating officer having a life that is worthy of envy.<br/><br/>I cannot suspend disbelief sufficiently to accept this suggestion. Take either strand and you cannot disprove the other, maybe Pitts life is not the subject of envy but merely a vehicle for the envious act, fair enough ... are we supposed to believe that Spacey had a back up plan if the investigating officer had been a bachelor with no discerning qualities at all.<br/><br/>I am afraid that se7en flatters to deceive, compared to Finchers recent works and in particular Zodiac, Se7en reeks of an ill conceived, poorly executed and fundamentally shallow work. I have no doubt that the average cinema goer thought the credits were stylish and ""cool"" and found the cluttered soundtrack interesting, I am sure that budding film students found the whole thing to be gritty and earthy, alas it fails to add up to anything other than a waste of 2 hours of your time.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour Don't Believe The Hype!"

Interspersed with this insipid dialogue are (1) some gross scenes which are meant to be shocking; and (2) random scenes featuring Gwyneth Paltrow which have absolutely nothing to do with what passes for a plot up to that point, making it pretty clear that either (a) something's gonna happen to her in the end; (b) the script was written by a moron; or (c) both of the above.

","**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br/><br/>
Perhaps it's the timing. Three weeks ago I might have reacted differently to this movie. But right now I just have little tolerance for the way it takes genuine horror and evil and creates a stylish, but ultimately empty, Hollywood package out of it. <br/><br/>This film is about a sadistic killer who is choosing his victims and methods of death based on the seven deadly sins (hence the title of the movie). On his trail are two detectives, a young hotshot named David Mills (Brad Pitt) and a senior Homicide Lieutenant, William Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) who has become cynical almost to the point of burnout. The murders are carried out with extreme cruelty, although the violence is not actually shown being committed, it is depicted quite graphically by what the two men discover at each crime scene, as well as in the various photos, coroner's reports, etc., that they examine. To be blunt, this is NOT for the squeamish, in fact, I'm surprised this film didn't get an NC-17 rating. <br/><br/>Anyway, the bodies pile up, and despite their best efforts (including a very close encounter by Mills), the killer, known only as `John Doe', remains at large. In fact, we don't even see him at all until halfway through the film, and we don't see him close up until near the end. Which is, basically, where this otherwise well crafted film falls apart. <br/><br/>At this point, five victims have already been discovered. In a strange plot twist, Mr. Doe turns himself in, them makes a bizarre offer. In return for a full confession, he requests the two detectives accompany him, alone and unarmed, so he can show them the final two victims. Obviously he has something really shocking planned as his grand finale, and, given his extremely high level of intelligence shown to date, only a fool would accept such a proposal at face value. Yet accepted it is, and all three men end up alone in the desert, the scene set for the final horror.   (Warning: BIG spoiler ahead)<br/><br/>On the drive out, Doe has been taunting Mills relentlessly, setting up the big showdown in which Somerset is handed a package containing the severed head of Mills' wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. At this point, Doe springs the trap. With a sneer, he informs Mills that the head represents the sin of envy, namely the killer's envy of Mills' heretofore charmed life. Of course, the sinner will pay for his sin, and in the process bring down the final victim, Mills himself, whose sin is wrath. Somerset, who understands the situation fully as soon as he opens the box, tries in vain to prevent what he knows is inevitable. Mills struggles to fight off his natural desire to kill Doe, knowing if he does, the killer wins his twisted game, but in the end he cannot help it. The film ends with Mills being driven off, presumably in handcuffs, in the back of a squad car. No matter what happens to him now, his life has been utterly destroyed. Much as with the suicide bombers of September 11th, we are left with the sense of the sneering triumph of evil over good, of a twisted life of hate given solely for the purpose of destruction.<br/><br/>So, what is the point of this film? There isn't one, as far as I can tell. There's no moral here, only psychosis and brutality artfully rendered. It's an appeal to cynicism, to shock value for its own sake. I suppose we are expected to react by noting that the ending was `cool' or at the very least, `original'. Yeah, right. And the really disgusting part is that this isn't some low budget slasher flick, but a top quality production with big name stars. A lot of thought, effort and talent went into making this film, but the end result is something that deserves to be flushed down a toilet."

Two detectives, the old experienced one who keeps calm everywhere and is near to retirement and the young impulsive one who does not like to be advised. It is time people in Hollywood start using their brains, because the audience is tired of the same trash. It is like Lethal Weapon with Glover/Gibson, but dark.<br/><br/>OK. This movie is good, it has thrilling moments and some good actors (not all), but to me it is just another detectives movie. I do not see any originality here. I have seen the same sadistic scenes including the famous ""blood writing"" in tons of films already.<br/><br/>---SPOILERS---<br/><br/>There are also some stupidity/plot holes in the movie:<br/><br/>1) Do you really need 20-30 swat men to break into the apartment of ONE criminal that is probably alone taking a bath?<br/><br/>2) The zombie thing. This really made me laugh. It is impossible that a man is still alive after being tied on a bed one year. It seemed taken from Night of The Living Dead!!! To be alive a person needs to eat food, drink water, go to the toilet, etc. They had cut one hand from him. An injury like that is infected quickly. The man can even die for a heart attack because of the contaminated blood or even the pain caused by the cut.<br/><br/>3) In the scene where both detectives are chasing after John Doe and finally the murderer does not shoot Mills and escapes is just plain ridiculous. In this case you would be expecting Mills screaming to his buddy ""I am OK, William, run and get the bastard!"" like you probably saw in other detectives movies but... No! Here they just missed the criminal.<br/><br/>4) In the high voltage towers field, when the box came, a good cop would have not opened the package because there was a high probability that the box contained a bomb. And by the way, the box contained a bleeding human part. NO SMELL??? Come on!<br/><br/>5) John Doe kills people who match deadly sins. Why does he kill Tracy? Just to have a reason to make Mills mad? Tracy is the most innocent person in the movie.<br/><br/>More things out of place:<br/><br/>1) Detective Somerset seems to be a respectable and correct person. Why is he such a dick with detective Mills for example when Mills has a kind gesture offering him coffee? OK. It is a detail and Mills is actually shallow, but why Somerset behaves like that with the boy?<br/><br/>2) Tracy Mills character does not have a clear place. Personally I think she is beautiful but her acting is so so. Her relationship with her husband, the young detective, is very cold and anybody could think she is flirting with Somerset, not looking for help.<br/><br/>3) After dinner in Mills apartment, there is a scene where Tracy woke up and saw that both men have gone. That scene did not really add anything.<br/><br/>4) John Doe character is not menacing. He actually looks and speaks like a gay.<br/><br/>So if you do not have these points in count you probably will think this film is great, otherwise you will think just like me that this is another detectives movies of the pile. And this movie is not disturbing, it is sadistic."

But in my opinion, Seven doesn't provide the genre of police thriller noting new than dim lighting and copious amount of rain.<br/><br/>Because Seven has much more in common with other films in this genre than most people realized. A couple of clich√©s are that there's a team of two cops who investigates the case consists of an old black man who is tired of his job and look forward to his retirement. The other one is his opposite; a young white man who wants up.<br/><br/>The murders that Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are investigating has been done with the seven deadly sins as source of inspiration. The killer also leaves short literature quotes. Mainly Dante, something that makes  Somerset (of course the intellectual of the two cops) take Mills (who only seems to read Guns and Ammo) to the library.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher - whose only feature film before this was Alien 3, but loads of music videos behind - reasoned ""I don't feel at home in libraries either... What music should I pick? It has to be something cultural. At least we take something that everybody recognizes - Air by Bach.<br/><br/>Seven doesn't have any other intentions than being the two hour thriller with some disgusting corpses, an odd police couple and a crazy killer it actually is. Then it should be regarded as such and nothing more."

Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and the mad genius who portrayed the serial killer(I won't spoil if you have, for some reason, not witnessed this masterpiece). The characters were so rich with detail and purpose that I cared about them from the offset and throughout. An absolutely genius story with a genius ending that should go down with the greats in cinema history. The villain is just plain genius and naming him John Doe just adds so much mystery and intrigue behind him that presents him as a faceless character with I think is perfect. Whoever conceived the idea of the seven deadly sins should be awarded an Oscar... then locked away for the rest of their lives in an asylum for coming up with the sick events in this movie. Then again if they weren't clearly sick, we wouldn't have this masterpiece here now, would we? The gritty and dark tone is just wondrous and the presentation of the city and gritty and grim just makes it too a faceless representation so it could be anywhere.

","Se7en (1995): Dir: David Fincher / Cast: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, John C. McGinley: Utterly terrifying yet intelligent thriller about the seven deadly sins, which are methods used by the killer. Morgan Freeman plays a detective on the verge of retirement and Brad Pitt plays a young cop transferred to the district. Throughout the film they are forced to deal with the sight of grisly murders involving gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, etc. Compelling, unsettling and powerful with directing by David Fincher who previously made Alien 3. He presents the gloom and rain that affects the mood. Freeman is flawless as a detective who delays his retirement out of curiosity and maintains a blatant disposition that his partner cannot endure. Pitt is effective as the younger yet skilled cop who learns fatal lessons by the film's conclusion. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife who confesses that she dislikes the transfer. It is her that will likely generate the most sympathy from viewers during sad realizations. Kevin Spacey is featured is a scene stealing cameo that dominates the moment he first appears. This is where the revelations surface and the deadly sins increase their meaning. Outside the principal actors, other roles are fairly standard issue. Disturbing and sometimes graphic film that reaches into the depths of our mind in a message of control and other sins that God will have us not commit. Score: 8 ¬Ω / 10"

"cleary-joshua","10","3","5","10 February 2015"," I think ""Se7en"" is my favourite David Fincher film...
","I think ""Se7en"" is my favourite David Fincher film, and given the body of work which the director has so far produced, that was not an easy decision to make. Much as I adore the intense character study of ""The Social Network"", the dark mind-games of ""Gone Girl"" and the rich storytelling in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", I feel that ""Se7en"" is Fincher showing off everything he does best. It's a brooding, jet black thriller which makes you look inwardly and consider so many aspects of human nature.<br/><br/>In the film, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play homicide detectives ‚Äì one recently transferred to a large city, the other getting ready for retirement. On paper, their relationship is a detective clich√©, but Pitt and Freeman's chemistry ensures that it transcends this. The pair start to discover a string of horrific murders, each one linked to one of the seven deadly sins, and attempt to track down the killer. They get closer and closer, and it becomes almost a game as the detectives try to prevent the next murder from occurring. There are twists and turns at every single corner up to the point where the murderer actually hands himself in, and even then you can tell that the game is barely over.<br/><br/>It's a film with a very clear process from the beginning, but this is not a bad thing. It takes you along so you feel like you know what's going to happen next, and then subverts your expectation right at the next step. The three lead performances are all brilliant, but the standout performance is that of Spacey, whose slow speech and constant calmness turn him into such a convincing psychopath. The greatest scene in the film is in set in a car, towards the end of the film, when Spacey explains his reasoning for committing the murders. The terrifying thing about the scene is that you can, in a way, completely understand the murderer's point, and this is cemented greatly by Spacey's performance.<br/><br/>As is to be expected from Fincher, the visuals in the film are incredible, and he doesn't waste a moment when he can shock. Each of the portrayals of the seven sins is as shocking as the next, and ""gluttony"" doesn't really kick things off that lightly. But again, Fincher's success is in disturbing his audience merely by suggestion rather than explicitly showing them anything. The murder based on ""lust"" isn't even described that graphically, but the very idea that it produces causes it to be one of the most difficult to watch scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>In ""Se7en"", Fincher has created a near-perfect thriller. There is not a bored moment in the entire film, and not even Gwyneth Paltrow's presence can spoil the atmosphere or enjoyment. Pitt, Freeman and Spacey complement each other perfectly, and help the film to achieve something that is actually relatively rare in movies of this genre ‚Äì it actually makes your heart race."
"Alemme01","10","3","5","14 March 2013"," A disturbing masterpiece
","This movie effected me emotionally more than any other movie I can think of. (Except maybe for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, for different reasons.) Basically, it's about a young cop and an old cop who's about to retire, who investigate a serial killer whose murders are based off of the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>What makes it so horrifying is that you see the aftermath. You hear the investigations, as they detail what happened. Match that with the images of the dead bodies, and you've got yourself a profoundly effective mental image. Good luck sleeping tonight! Aside from the disturbing elements, the movie is still a good movie. Pitt and Freeman give great performances as usual, and it helps that their characters are likable. Pitt's character is an arrogant ass. Or is he? As you find out by the way he acts outside the police station, he seems likes a fun guy to be around. And as the movie goes along, you see how his job and the disgusting murders that he has to get knee deep into affect him as a person. Freeman's character is pretty much the straight-up good guy, and you could argue that he's the typical ""retiring black cop"" that was made more common by Glover's character in the Lethal Weapon series.<br/><br/>The story is very engaging, as the investigations become more intense, and the more the protagonists get wrapped up in the case. So much so, that the climax (which begins with possibly the most heart-pounding chase scene I've ever seen) becomes one of the most jaw-dropping and engrossing pieces of film I've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>The dialogue is good, but with only a couple memorable lines (which I won't say, because they either possibly spoil the movie, or aren't that great unless you've actually seen the scene.) However, with that said, the dialogue is used as a tool for sending a graphic mental image to your head during the murder scenes. And that, is probably the best words can do in a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get over the shudder-inducing murder scenes that I've only brought up about a thousand times up to this point, definitely give this movie a go."
"lukejowsey2006","10","3","5","10 February 2013"," Fantastic!
","This movie is fantastically written and constructed. From the beginning we see a trend of murders develop in that of the seven sins. As the movie progress' you can sort of guess whats coming next, despite this the movie keeps you guessing, as there are a few curve balls along the way. When detective mills(Brad Pitt) and detective somerset(Morgan Freeman) finally track down the sadistic murderer known as John Doe(Kevin Spacey) the action and drama intensifies. <br/><br/>Se7en is greatly unique, i have watched many movies of this genre and none compare. This is supported by the fantastic ending. As John doe draws detective Mills into committing the final two of the seven deadly sins, it was hard to predict what would happen next and what would be in that mysterious package that was delivered.'The box'. Although we never actually see what it is, its pretty obvious by the reactions. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt both show their great acting, as they are both given a character that suits their stereotype. Kevin spacey also plays a brilliant part in that he is so plain and shows no real emotion which suits the movie correctly as nothing is to be given away. He also casually drops hints into what the outcome of his 'great work' will be. <br/><br/>Absolutely fantastic movie a must watch! <br/><br/>10/10"
"Andrew_81","Null","3","5","9 December 2004"," ""What's in the box"" - Still sends shivers down my spine!
","Although this film is 9 years old now it hasn't dated in the slightest and has more than likely been the influence for other serial killer films over the years; such as Taking Lives (2004) for that sheer twists value.<br/><br/>I was only 14 when this film came out so I didn't get to watch it straight away, however after being blown away by it's storyline the first time I saw it (in about 1997, I think), I've since watched it several more times over the years and have been impressed every time. Be it by it's fantastic score (e.g. the library scene), it's sharp witted humour (e.g. when the police captain answers the phone with ""this isn't even my desk!"" - a phrase I'd love to use at my own desk at work everyday), or brilliant acting in the form of Morgan Freeman as Det. Somerset.<br/><br/>The only part of this film I didn't enjoy was the ""SWAT"" team scenes. If David Fincher was aiming for OTT from the actors here, he certainly got it (especially from that bloke from Scrubs)<br/><br/>The most compelling part of this film for me, and what stands out the most, is the relationship between Det. Mills and Somerset. Two detectives both with completely different lives and agendas both thrown together to solve the most disturbing case either of them will ever face. It's not a case of good cop/bad cop in this movie; it's more like overeager cop/retiring cop and by the end shocked cop/shocked (no longer retiring) cop/shocked audience. <br/><br/>A truly great film, 9 out of 10 from me!"
"barnabyrudge","Null","3","5","5 December 2003"," Unique, horrifying thriller which leaves you desperate for a happy ending.
","A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.<br/><br/> Detective David Mills (Pitt) joins a new homicide squad in a particularly unappealing and unsafe (un-named) city. He is partnered with William Somerset (Freeman), an old, wise, experienced cop who is just a few days from retirement. The mismatched pair are sent to a crime scene where a fat man has been tied to his dinner table and forced to eat and eat and eat until his stomach bursts. Scrawled on the wall is the word ""Gluttony"", and when other bodies start turning up alongside messages like ""Greed"" and ""Sloth"", they soon realise they are dealing with a serial killer who gets his ""inspiration"" from the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/> However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. The ingenuity begins to show in a scene as powerful as it is unexpected, in which the killer gives himself up with two murders to go. For a moment, it seems that the film has made a terrible mis-step, but in actual fact we are being readied for one of the most fiendishly clever and shocking climaxes imaginable. The film ends on such a cruel note you'll come away from the film wanting to shout ""no - that can't be it... it can't end there!"" Oh, but it can! What's most disturbing is that when the killer explains his motives, he actually makes a totally valid and agreeable point about why he chose his victims. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). The best mainstream Hollywood film of the '90s."
"lwjoslin","7","3","5","16 May 2003"," Unlucky number
","""Se7en"" was the serial killer movie of the week at the time of its release. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt--apparently representing Reason and Passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. Kevin Spacey plays the killer as a Hannibal Lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-God complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the Seven Deadly Sins.  Not a new idea; Vincent Price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" in which the inspiration is the ten curses of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus; and ""Theater of Blood,"" in which Shakespeare's plays provide the motifs.  (""Se7en"" makes a nod in the direction of its predecessors by mentioning the ""pound of flesh"" associated with one of the murders.)  <br/><br/>The difference is that the Price movies were jet-black comedies, while ""Se7en"" is a straightforward suspense thriller, and a relentlessly grim, gray, dark, rain-soaked one at that.  It's technically well-made and unusually literate, drawing themes from Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, and medieval theology.  And there's a strong echo of Dostoevsky's ""Notes from the Underground"": when the killer's lair is located, it's found to contain 2000 handwritten notebook journals of 250 pages each.  (Quibbles: if he writes that much, when does he find time to do anything else... such as plan and execute fiendishly clever crimes?  Also, we're told that none of the journals or entries are dated.  As one who has kept a daily journal for ten years, I find that unlikely, especially since the killer is ultimately revealed to be even more, shall we say, detail-oriented than I am.)<br/><br/>The movie's ending (which I won't reveal here) is distressingly downbeat--and surprisingly so, as well.  It leaves a nasty aftertaste.  It could be argued that anything less would've been a cop-out, but it still was about as entertaining as a sucker punch.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" left us with Lecter on the loose, but at least there was salvation (the girl was rescued), redemption (the lambs were silenced), and retribution (the killer was dispatched without the incidental destruction of anyone else).  By contrast, ""Se7en,"" which offers none of the above, is easy to admire, but hard to enjoy."

I continuously wanted for something good,  something exciting and It was just words and a picture of a dead man with police wandering around.  The movie was sooo bad that it made my other rental film Urban Legend look like an exciting horror classic---and that was only an OK film. Seven is a horrible experience,   little gore,   little action,  mild absurdities,   basically a very gloomy unentertaining tone.  Even Gweneth Paltrow was stupid and frankly had--no interesting lines and they didn't even show the way she looked at the end--so upsetting.  Just like the Baby with Rosemary's baby,   the director denied a crucial element,  it is just that unlike Rosemary's Baby,  I didn't care an inch about the way Seven looked at that point. Thrillers like Fatal Attraction,  The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,  and The Tie That Binds are movies that at least have an entertaining and lighter deranged glow.  Seven is just dark,  boring,  and so uninvolving.  The actors good but the story stunk."
"MartinHafer","9","5","11","20 January 2015"," Very well made, but....
","I think the audience for ""Se7en"" is rather self-selecting. If you don't mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. If you are looking for something family-friendly or 'nice', then you wouldn't even consider watching this in the first place. While I don't think I'd put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it's natural I'd get to it sooner or later.<br/><br/>As for the film, I won't say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it's the sort of thing you'd normally watch, watch away and enjoy."

I can not help but think a more subtle approach would have helped this movie avoid the banality of the special effects, which seem more suited for a science fiction due to their over exaggeration.<br/><br/>The story is overly contrived. The director handles this movie in such a way that the narrative jerks from one scene to the next, yanking us to a punchling serving as a climax.

","This film is a total triumph for style over substance. Characters that you don't care about get caught up in a fairly ludicrous set of circumstances and the ending is telegraphed from early on. The icing on the cake is when a potentially more interesting detective movie/police procedural is suddenly ruined by the confession of one of the minor characters in the film that he is the killer. His drawn out speeches about his reasons for committing the crimes come across as unnatural and forced and the whole movie descends into farce with the courier company (nice product placement) delivery of the severed head of a character so underwritten that her input to the scene remains the same as when her head was still attached. Why so many people like this superficially dark but ultimately very mainstream thriller is beyond me. Sure, Morgan Freeman delivers another solid performance and Spacey is good even if his performance (much like Jack Nicholson's turn as the Joker in Batman) belongs in a different movie to the drab, underplayed, naturalistic tone that all the other actors seem to be opting for. Pitt is guilty of phoning in his performance to a large extent and Paltrow wrestles manfully with a sketchy part but can't make any serious impression. A puff piece."

","Seven (1995) 9 out of 10: David Fincher's premiere film as a feature film director after years of making music videos is a masterpiece. Meticulously detailed and layered to the point that multiple viewings give even greater pleasures and currently occupying a spot in the IMDB top 20 movies of all time. Hold on someone has their hand up in the back... what's that? Alien 3? ... there was no Alien 3. There were only two Alien movies: Alien and Aliens. If you recall, at the end of Aliens Ripley, Bishop, Newt and Hicks all escape and live happily ever after. So obviously Seven is David Fincher's first film. Understood.<br/><br/>The Good: this is truly finely crafted film and like an onion has many layers. To dissect the onion will simply destroy it and leave everyone crying so to preserve what I can of writer Andrew Kevin Walker mystery let me tell you my pet theory.<br/><br/>I think the movie takes place in purgatory. It is truly a dark dirty miserable place (even for the mid-nineties). Every location seems flawed in some way, never to be properly clean and lit. The characters are also flawed. Brad Pitt is quick to violence and quite the obnoxious hot head in some scenes. Morgan Freeman seems to be playing the same character he has been playing the last twenty -five years. But there is hidden depth in this one. Some regrets and some cold calculations. He is seven days from retirement but this being purgatory the real fear is not he will be killed like every single movie cop seven days from retirement in the entire history of movies. No, the real fear is he will never be able to retire at all and one day will simply blend into another.<br/><br/>Both leads do a bang-up job with characters that seem like they fit exactly in their wheelhouse but as I note above with Freeman have a little more depth than it appears at first glance (or even first viewing of the film.) Seven has a deliberate pace that can lull one without ever seeming boring. While the cycle of downtime and investigation seems fairly well set there are a couple of surprises that topple the apple cart and keep the audience on its toes. The calm deliberate pace, of course, make the surprises all that more effective.<br/><br/>Our bad guy like many of the surprises in the film are well known at this time. The movie does do a great job hiding him, however (Though his killing a drug dealer because he was also a pederast gets a second glance nowadays considering.) The big bads plan involving the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy for those keeping score at home) may seem overdone to modern audiences but it was fresh stuff when this movie came out. Movies like the Saw series crib heavily from Seven.<br/><br/>The Mediocre: There is nothing really bad in Seven. There are some things however that are mediocre. I like Gwyneth Paltrow but despite a significant amount of screen time she never makes an impression. She is just kind of there saying her lines. There is no emotional connection to the audience. In other words, she is Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca.<br/><br/>A couple of sins get short shrift in the movie. Pride, in particular, seems truncated and sloth's victim seems... well unslothful. (I mean the guy is both a scummy drug dealer and a pederast? He is multitasking over here. Why not get someone who marathons those judge shows on daytime television and then orders takeout.)<br/><br/>The Ugly: Having a number in the middle of your name was stupid in 1995, it is stupid in 2019 and there has never been a time outside of those dates where it wasn't stupid. As Weird Al Yankovic says in that Holiday classic Word Crimes.<br/><br/>You should never
Write words using numbers
Unless you're seven
Or your name is Prince<br/><br/>Hold on a second maybe he meant the movie Seven in those lyrics instead of the age seven as we all assumed all along... OMG, my mind is blown.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: If you have never seen it and especially if you have managed not to have it spoiled go check out Seven. In addition, you haven't seen it since the nineties I also recommend giving it another spin. It holds up really well and is better than you remember it."

","In 2004, the movie ""Saw"" vaulted to the top of many ""psychological thriller"" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind. Nearly ten years earlier, ""Se7en"" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Se7en"" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore. Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders. As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.<br/><br/>There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...<br/><br/>First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted. Director David Fincher has proved time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different. By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.<br/><br/>Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail. Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances. The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the ""eager rookie"", Freeman as the ""grizzled vet""), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.<br/><br/>The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)? To me, the real ""meat"" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey). Whereas in Saw, the ""Jigsaw"" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, ""Se7en"" only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film. Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""Se7en"" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like ""Saw"". It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground. Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!"

","What can one say that, I'm positive, hasn't already been said about this film? That taken into consideration, I will review this title regardless. <br/><br/>Seven, from start to finish, is a film that ""Will Be Puzzled Over, Studied, and Followed... Forever."" That is a quote used in the movie to describe the crimes that ensue(d), but I feel it works quite well as a tag-line for the film itself. The Film is set in semi-modern New York and revolves around two characters - Detective David Mills & Detective William Somerset. (David being a transfer/""rookie"" and Somerset, the hardened veteran) The plot consists of Mills and Somerset trailing a serial killer by way of varying but distinct clues left at each scene. I personally believe that Seven lacks in no definitive aspect or area; it is (in my opinion) perfect in every way and a true classic that should be enjoyed by everyone - and I would be more than willing to debate this statement any time, any day. Breakthrough roles, more than incredible cinematography, plot line and supporting roles with awe- striking scenes, twists and developments at every turn."

","I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i'll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!<br/><br/>Acting (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one killed it!<br/><br/>Action (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else do you want?<br/><br/>Story(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once(stab, you're welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!<br/><br/>Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange ""the magic"" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.<br/><br/>Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn't THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it for once!"
"jrarichards","9","2","3","24 October 2016"," Uncomfortably convention-defying psychological thriller
","This high-class thriller from David Fincher is well done, tense and rather gory; and achieves a great deal with its high-quality camera-work, primarily (though not quite solely) in hammering home the overriding message over a great chunk of the film that New York is the New Sodom and Gomorrah and possibly even Hell on Earth. It rains there and is grey all the time, plenty of sin is committed, and even formerly-good people are ground down by it, turned to evil or at best becoming apathetic as the only other possible defence. This kind of apathy is also at least to some extent afflicting our key character, William Somerset, a detective on the verge of retiring played by Morgan Freeman. Nevertheless, this character is not especially popular among fellow cops, given that he asks more questions than they do, is more thoughtful (and far better-read), and he still tries that bit harder.<br/><br/>Still less jaded and jaundiced is what will soon come to be Somerset's new partner, if only for a short period, the newly-arrived Detective Mills, as played by Brad Pitt, who has decided to bring with him from upstate a couple of dogs and a still-untainted wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. They are now living in an apartment they were conned into buying by being invited to view and visit between the times at which Subway trains go thundering by, shaking the dwelling to its very foundations.<br/><br/>Rather quickly, Somerset and Mills come up against a methodically cunning and well-read psychopathic killer bent on putting paid to NY's sinners, turning their sins against them in the grossest and most sadistic of ways, but also in a manner that he considers entirely right and appropriate. While 5 sins are demonstrated and avenged in the Big Apple, the last two shift out to a quite non-New York-looking out-of-town locality, in which the Sun is suddenly shining. This seems a somewhat surprising tactic, given what had gone before. What is more (and unlike in most films of this kind you have ever seen) the last part takes place with the killer in handcuffs in front of our eyes, and thus revealed to us as ""John Doe"" (yes, really), played in the slightly spaced-out way that only Kevin Spacey can quite manage. Furthermore, the detectives and forensic guys have already taken we the audience on a tour through Doe's roomy if cluttered and weirder-than-weird apartment, hence that traditional element of such films we already have well behind us.<br/><br/>While much or most of the story summed up as above may sound a bit fantastic, enigmatic, apocalyptic horror-like or even sci fi-ish in tone, the greater part of the film looks (pretty much or at least ostensibly) like a conventional enough cop movie-cum-crime shocker, which leaves the in-your-face ending more of a surprise. In fact, ""surprise"" is the wrong word, since we might indeed have anticipated what we get, but presumably just felt that no film maker is actually going to do this to us ... and then he does.<br/><br/>This defying of convention established for hundreds of movies of this kind over decades has an amazingly disarming effect, and one is left a little speechless. This is only delivered more strongly by (Freeman's exquisite acting of) Somerset's behaviour at this point. Suffice it to say that the usual circumstance of the villain realising ""it's all over"" is UTTERLY turned on its head here.<br/><br/>BUT...<br/><br/>while this approach may indeed seem shocking, innovative and even high art, the impact is so great that it does actually spoil the film a bit, at least for this very seasoned cinema-goer and film-watcher. A spring pulled beyond its ability to rebound ceases to function as a spring, and maybe here we have destroyed the cop-thriller genre by stretching it too far out of shape. Personally speaking, I found myself asking what the point of what had gone before had really been, especially where certain slightly-less-grim scenes had been concerned. Added to that is the uncomfortable idea - put into words by Doe himself - that he is somehow fighting back against omnipresent sin and evil (of course by doing still-greater evil himself). <br/><br/>While I am usually pretty merciless with spoilers, I have - as is pretty clear - eschewed giving too much away here, because those with a reasonably strong stomach are certainly advised to give this film a go, in the unlikely event that anybody interested out there has not already done so. But the piece ""only"" gets a 9 here from me, because maybe there are some things you just can't do with a film genre, at least without having to pay some price for doing so..."

","David Fincher reveals a masterpiece of a movie in his film Seven. The movie follows the process of two detectives, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) as they attempt to track down a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is choosing his methods and victims based off of the seven deadly sins. The film is high quality for two main reasons: its complex characters and its moral commentary. <br/><br/>The most intriguing character is easily John Doe, the killer. Rather than creating a stereotypical mindless killer, Fincher makes Doe a serious, soft-spoken man, whose power comes from his brain rather than his brawn. Doe is extremely logical and methodical in his approaches, as his killings require intense planning. His character poses as a striking contrast to Mills. Although he is the ""good guy""-the cop, the detective, the one trying to stop a killer- Mills is not likable. Unlike Doe, he raves and constantly shows frustration, and often reverts to physical violence to try to accomplish his mission. Although the watcher probably will still root for Mills, when Doe speaks, they will be more apt to listen. Somerset serves as the voice of reason, reeling in Mills when necessary and respecting Doe's genius as he tries to catch him. <br/><br/>These characters, especially John Doe, perfectly display the film's social commentary on the seven deadly sins within our culture. More importantly, they raise the moral question of what is evil, and what is good. There is a clear clash between good and evil within the film, but the reason it is so successful is that it makes the audience ask themselves questions. Are evil people able to be victims? Is society harming the killer or did the killer harm society? What is a just price to pay for evil doings? Therefore, I highly recommend Seven to anyone who is not too squeamish and who enjoys a perplexing film that will leave you thinking. I enthusiastically endorse this film with an ""A""."

","Ladies and Gentleman, Kevin Spacey does it again. 1995 must have been quite his year with the release of Usual Suspects and Sev7en just months apart. Not only does Spacey captivate his audience in both films with stellar performances (winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Role in Usual Suspects and the MTV movie award for Best Villain in Sev7en) but his characters starkly contrast themselves with their ""end game"" motivations. <br/><br/>David Fincher creates a masterpiece with Sev7en. Not only does he manage to captivate his audience, keeping them in the dark, on the hunt, with Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), but he manages to simultaneously repulse them with disturbing gore that they can't quite look away from. His scenes are dark, often limited to the use of a detectives' flashlight, reinforcing the feeling of powerlessness within the viewer. The audience only gets to see what the detectives reveal, and like the detectives, we are never given the full picture. Detective Miller (Brad Pitt) serves as the foil for Detective Somerset. Throughout the film Miller proves to be a hard character to understand. On one hand the audience dislikes him because of his abrasiveness and rudeness to Detective Somerset (the obvious protagonist). On the other hand, the audience favors Miller because of his role in serving justice (solving the case) and because of the man he is in his own home (playing with dogs, snuggling with his wife, etc.). Initially, the relationship between Somerset and Miller feels like a classic good vs. evil separation. Somerset embodies the notable qualities of wisdom, practicality, and patience while Miller is confrontational, rude, and power-hungry. Yet the two come together to work on the case, to serve as a greater good against the evil of the unknown murderer. Fincher plays with the audience's emotions by prompting them to root for a character that isn't exactly favorable by playing on the larger feeling of disgust with the evil nature of the crimes. <br/><br/>Overall the film is a classic. Its something I am glad I watched and would consider watching again. It's a timeless film that managed to hold my attention and surprise me despite being dated 20 years. I give it two thumbs up."

","Intensity of psychological attack is much higher then that of a physical attack.<br/><br/>This is what the whole movie is about. It is the story of a guy who is manipulated into insanity. Insanity is not only a psychological condition, it might be created out of circumstances or by the society.<br/><br/>This movie explores through the life of two people, one who is a murderer and thinks his destiny is to taken on the seven sinners and the other one is the guy who tries to catch the murderer and loses his sanity in doing so, again not psychologically but socially. It is his grief or strong emotions which direct him into doing this. On the other hand is his senior who is skeptical of his emotions, according to me he was frightened of the fact that when those emotions might takeover. It's his life's experience which have taught him to be aware of his feelings.<br/><br/>The movie is a mind game between two people trying to win over each other, the protagonist hardly knows of what is to come.<br/><br/>The director, David FIncher has done commendable work. The fact that every human is just one deed away from losing his/her sanity is presented perfectly. The movie is one of the best psychological thrillers of all times. The screenplay is great except for the shaky camera, I have cut one mark for that. There was not much scope for cinematography, though the creepy environment required for the movie is presented well. I guess Morgan Freeman keeps on getting with each of his movies. Yet again he has done some phenomenal acting as Detective Somerset. Well people accept the fact that Brad Pitt is not only famous for his good looks but his acting is great too. Pitt has done one of his best roles as Detective Mills. Gwyneth Paltrow's character was given some useless scenes (What was the point of whole pregnancy thing). The surprise package here is the amazingly acted villain John Doe. Kevin Spacey has has done the best work of his life in this movie. His acting takes the movie to another level.<br/><br/>The music is great, acting is great, The plot is perfect. But there is one negative point which takes down the whole analogy of the genre its ""the movie is pretty much guessable"" Thats why i have cut 1 the other mark in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a must watch. It explains the fact that ""Actions define a person's sanity or insanity"" perfectly."
"braddugg","10","2","3","8 September 2016"," Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.
","Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.<br/><br/>Engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. David Fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. His first film Alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. Then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well.<br/><br/>The dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. It's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. The action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. The culmination or finale is a shocker. To say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling.<br/><br/>The nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. In the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. Yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time I see this film thus, I call it as action-packed. I must say, I have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time I like it more. So this film just keeps growing on me.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. These two departments technically are supreme. Other departments did their job well too. Of all, it's the direction that mattered. Fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was ""The Fight Club"" which is a cult in itself.<br/><br/>It's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. I have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does."
"DVR_Brale","7","2","3","7 September 2016"," Philosophical inquiry about human nature packed as a criminalistic mystery thriller
","Why is Se7en so good? Well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than David Fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. Other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt and one I won't mention because Fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. How can you not like Freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to Pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)? <br/><br/>Do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? Of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. He thinks that the world is better without them. Theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from God. As a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. If one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask God for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. This serial killer is not merciful. He positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. Since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. He had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel.<br/><br/>After this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). As I mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. Together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. This is important when you consider the ending. Everybody knows Se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being Requiem For a Dream). Since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of Se7en. This movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. That's at least what I think.<br/><br/>So why did I give Se7en a symbolic seven? I don't have any particular reason. Se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. Apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. It's predictable as well, but it seems to me that Fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. We know what is going to happen and that gives us more ""space"" to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. Soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. Se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better.<br/><br/>So to conclude: Se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. Underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. Those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should I say seven."
"firefalcoln","7","2","3","18 August 2016"," Good, but not very good IMO
","First off let me say that the direction and acting is very good. I don't recall having any major complaints and can't recall many minor complaints. To me this film just didn't have a 10 out of 10 script which is why I give it 8 stars. For me, the story is the most important part of just about every film. This movie's story was very good for the most part. However I had 2 big complaints. 1: for the first murder, they mention receipts for the food he bought. They mention that there was food bought twice the same day. Why didn't the cops investigate the store on the receipt and see if there was any video footage from either/both purchases? 2: I was able to predict the end right before it happened, which really is less than ideal when it was clearly meant to be a shock. I might have ranked the film higher if I hadn't just watched: Witness for the Prosecution. And that film pulls off the surprise ending better and more dramatically than just about any other film. So I had a high bar of expectation prior to seeing the film and I had really high hopes for 7, seeing how it has an 8.6 ranking. I think following my viewing i won't leave as a fan or hater of the film. I managed to see a lot of impressive components in the piece, and it's still well worth a viewing if you can handle the disturbing content. And maybe I was a rare case in predicting the end."

"filipemanuelneto","9","2","3","11 July 2016"," A huge thriller, although visually disturbing to the faint hearted.
","In this film, two detectives have to work together in order to catch a psychopathic killer obsessed with the Seven Sins. Directed by David Fincher, with a script by Andrew Kevin Walker, this film has Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as protagonists.<br/><br/>This film approaches, several times, the grotesque. Its far from appealing to everyone but it will, almost certainly, please any fan of thrillers or police movies. The killer is a madman who seems obsessed with a naturally awkward topic: the Seven Deadly Sins, well known to anyone who has attended Sunday School. The film never speaks openly of religion, but we deduce that this crazy killer is probably Christian, which may displease the practitioners of that faith and even Catholics. In fact, religious fanaticism is quite implicit in the history, and the scenery. Like it or not, its an excellent idea for a movie and gave rise to a great plot, capable of holding the public until the end, despite several disgusting scenes, able to make any popcorn-eater throw in the bag. Yes, this is an alert for the teenagers and the faint hearted: this film is, indeed, visually shocking.<br/><br/>The way the main characters were developed is very reasonable. They are two detectives, very different personally and professionally, almost the antithesis of each other until they need to form a true partnership. Brad Pitt gives life to a young cop, active, impulsive, passionate, naturally clashing against the thoughtful and prudent manners of the character played by Morgan Freeman, who only want to do the job well done and go home at the end of the day... until he understands (and he does it quickly) that this killer will not stop easily and is different from anything they thought before. The work of the actors is good, especially Freeman, who incorporate his character easily. Pitt also shone, but his character it's hard to like up to half of the film.<br/><br/>The film is exceptionally heavy. The picture is dark, most of the scenes takes place in low light or at night (the most notable exception is the police station, plenty of bright and light colors). The crime scenes are usually dark and have black elements (in one of them is the furniture, for example). There are religious elements evident throughout the film also. The soundtrack is interesting, contributing decisively to densify the tension with the constant repetition of high and long chords.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is deep, psychologically challenging, shocking and promises to leave no one indifferent. A great story of suspense, from start to finish."

","The 7 Deadly Sins: Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy. Wrath. Pride. Lust.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is definitely a movie no one will forget after watching it. The story follows two detectives: Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) tracking down a serial killer who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. Seriously, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the first time watching it. I was too young to see the movie when it came out in 1995, but I managed to watch this on DVD just recently. This movie is told from the point of view from the detectives, trying to find the motives and reasons why the killer is taking out random victims. We see them in a frustrated situation (Brad Pitt's character is a fine example of this along with his F bomb dialogue). <br/><br/>The performances from the cast are superb. The majority of the film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's chemistry - how their relationship builds up as the two are desperately trying to solve the case. Gwyneth Paltrow is placed third in the top billing as Detective Mill's wife - a woman who loves her husband but has a dislike for living in the terrible city they live in. Her performance sells, but I feel she did not have enough screen time. <br/><br/>There is one other actor's performance I really want to talk about. But I can't. You'll have to see the movie for yourself and you'll know who I am referring to. <br/><br/>The movie never fails to lose your interest. You are invested in these characters solving a murder mystery that is (to them) not common, yet very disturbing. Each kill has been done off screen, and we are left to our imagination of how each murder went down. What we don't see is much more effective than if we do see...And I believe director David Fincher has done a great job at this. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout, and it's executed unexpectedly which works for this kind of film. <br/><br/>""Se7en"" was a movie ahead of its time. I can't imagine what would it be like had the film been made in let's say 1989-90. Definitely recommend this thriller if you're into surprises. Even on repeated viewings it's still a thrill to watch and look out for things you may have missed in the first time viewing."

","Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe (Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending. ""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film. One of the most haunting ironies I find in Walker's script well portrayed by Fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between John Doe, the antagonist and Somerset, the protagonist. If you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that Somerset agrees with Doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify Doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings. With Doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, Somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallel that exists between the two characters. Yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while Somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, Doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer. The film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller: mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

"Icarus_prime","8","2","3","20 May 2016"," A grisly, visceral hard-boiled thriller with a superb ending
","This is a perfect example where a movie is good and/or got better due to its ending. Three-quarters of the whole film is pretty much stock standard crime, mystery thriller and the ""senior-rookie"" relationship between the characters that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt portray is straightforward but not generic and narrow-minded since their chemistry is so natural. The reason for the latter is that the character, Mills while impulsive, his short-tempered and foul-mouth personality doesn't detract his presence and overall viewing experience of the movie. He's kept in check by William; the archetypal ""calm and collected veteran"" but during moments like these, they actually have interesting, contrasting discussions in how they see the world, the people and the crimes within a detective's perspective. The film sets up so they avoid Mills' emotional outcries as the focus of the scene which I appreciate. It makes Mills a more multi-dimensional character because we can clearly see him and William are presented as different people on the surface. But the film takes an effort to establish how they're different. <br/><br/>The actual methods and scenes of the murders are indeed quite graphic but the most effective and disturbing one takes place at the end. It's the classic case of not showing that makes it more frightening because it's when our endless imagination takes stage. Speaking of the ending, the reason I view it with high praise is because it's not phoned in and artificial. The film put in some key clues in earlier scenes to justify the killer's methods validly. Its impact is strengthen by the fact that the serial killer is shown quite early and the film uses the remaining sequences well to establish the character. Of course, the actor that plays the killer at the end puts on a a remarkable, chilling performance that only makes the last quarter of the movie better. Normally, the 'mystery' aspect to a film like this would be gone and thus detract our enjoyment (Julia's Eyes is an example that it did) but it didn't for me because we're clearly more interested by the end of WHY the killer kills. It's a natural, organic progression when we're all sucked in to the elaborate ways that the victims are killed at the start. While the actual killer's motivations is a little simple- minded and its all explained in one convenient scene, I just love how the VERY last sequence of the movie refused to venture on a black-and-white ""good guys beat bad guys"" type of ending and sticked to its guns on what the film is about by using the killer as the subtext. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this modern hard-boiled flick and the only problems I had with the movie is that its a little too reliant on the ending to be a deciding factor on whether or not you would enjoy this picture. Lastly, when I referred to the killer's intentions as slightly one-sided, I felt like it was a bit self-indulgent at times and wasn't all-encompassing enough when the film needed to foreshadow more on its underlying message during sections of the film before the killer was revealed. We only see a few glimpses from the interactions between Freeman and Pitt as well as the dark, grim setting (neo-noir) portrayed in the movie but I need more still. I thought if the film executed on the ""why"" part of the killings a bit better and not just ""how"" (which I already explained it's done admirably) then it would've easily pushed my rating from a 8.5/10 to a 9 or higher."

","Se7evn once again proves David Fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. Major credit also goes to Andrew Kevin Walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. The progression of Se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. The movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. The constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as Detectives Somerset and Mills. The progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. The introduction of Tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. Se7en's villain John Doe is what ultimately makes this movie. The brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. The scene where Mill and Somerset question Doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. Doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. The creep factor of Se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. It's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. However, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. Top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time."

"The-Social-Introvert","8","2","3","21 January 2016"," Quickie Review: Se7en
","Often cited as the quintessential detective murder mystery movie, Se7en (remember when putting numbers in your titles was cool?) is the movie that put Fincher on the map at a time where he was known as the guy who ruined the Alien franchise. <br/><br/>I must admit, I found the concept of a killer going around basing crimes off of the seven deadly sins to be better than it was actually executed in the film, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this smooth urban thriller remains one of the freakiest of its kind in Hollywood. The cinematography is immensely captivating, drawing you into this depressing and gloomy unnamed town in which our two cops Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman track down the unhinged killer Kevin Spacey. The acting from the main duo is serviceable whilst Spacey is, as he always was in the 90's, exceptional. <br/><br/>You have to give Fincher credit with his ballsy endings, even if it doesn't quite pay off all the way such as in Gone Girl and The Game. In this film, however, you're left thinking about the ending for quite some time, and it eventually dawns on you that, yes, the baddie won in this one. After a gripping climax out in a field in the middle of nowhere, the fiendish John Doe plays out all his cards after a half hour where we wonder just what the guy is up to when he gives himself up unexpectedly.<br/><br/>Best Scene: There's a number of memorable instances (that bloody jump scare with the dude in the bed!) but my favourite part was when Spacey walks straight into the police station and hands himself to the officers."

It's also David Fincher's breakout film that really made him stand out as a director. The cinematography, the visuals and the eerie atmospheric environment plays a key role when showing the plot unfold. Mainly because the grisly and nasty environment that gives off the aroma of sweat and decay really plays a key part in the story. It's one of the key elements that makes this film stand out. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman makes a excellent duo that actually compliment each other, not really verbally but it works throughout this film. One is the brash and hot blooded detective with the mouth, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the other is a wise and yet ignorant detective Somerset Played by Morgan Freeman. Brad Pitt was on his rising to super stardom stage and his role in this really helped him with the boost. The plot is about the duo detective going after and track down the serial killer that is on a pattern when it comes to the 7 deadly sins. This film is simply intriguing from start to finish, especially when this movie came out. Cause there wasn't a film like this before, as far as I know. And many films to come will copy or emulate certain elements from this film. Even video games like ""Silent Hill"" was probably inspired by this film, especially when it comes to the environment. This is a raw film that is detailed and focused. Just about every scene has a point and has connections when it comes to the core of the story one way or another.

The cinematography is planned out in detail, shot by shot, to create a piece of art. The lighting and sets reflect the nature of the city and the murders that take place.

","Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi"

There is also a weird design choice where every so often the frame rate decreases, I felt that this detracts from the film rather than helps it (it might just be my friend's DVD, who knows). Besides those two flaws, Se7en is a classic, and a must see for all fans of mystery and suspense. The first gun shot, in my view, was one of the scariest things I've seen in a movie besides the horror genre.

It is one of the most memorable movie endings by far.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is amazing also. In my opinion, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt both give one of their best performances yet. Morgan Freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>The acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. Fincher probably looked at previous works of Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off.<br/><br/>As much I want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which I felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. There weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though.

However, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. Since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially Fight Club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Se7en is a near perfect movie. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made.

","SEVEN- MOVIE REVIEW<br/><br/>Since the beginning of time, sins were acts that made us mortals, vulnerable. The demeaning act we performed in the name of lust, greed, incest, gluttony, is perhaps what defined the concept of heaven and hell on earth itself. Detective William Somerset has seen it all and is now giving up the hellish nightmare he lived his whole career when the last case lands on his lap. A case where he is partnered with the newly transferred David Mills, an arrogant cocksure guy. A case that would yet again shake his rational solidified exterior. A case that would made him question his basic knowledge about Right and Wrong. For here is a serial killer who is trying to be God. Who is killing sinners in the most horrifying manner! The sadistic killer meticulously plans his execution corresponding to the seven deadly sins of gluttony, greed , sloth, wrath ,pride, lust and envy. The sinner and the punisher unified. In the final pursuit of truth, the detectives themselves have to pay a prize none of them anticipated. The movie makes us wonder whether this world is in reality what it seems. A place to uphold the dignity of life? Or in the bowels of earth, unnoticed by all, does he whom we call devil walks in the holy garb teasing us about the Apocalypse?"
"preston_peace","9","2","3","11 May 2015"," If Lethal Wepon Was Realistic
","I think the greatest strength of Se7en is its opening twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes makes you think that you're in for a decent, gritty, detective movie. But nothing worth the 250. It's sort of what Summerset and Mills thinks they're getting into. They think that this is going to be a hard case, but not scarring. They keep their heads high and don't think much of it. But after those twenty minutes, it becomes a tale of self worth, moral ambiguity, guilt and everything that'd usually be fluff in any other movie, turned into a disturbing look into what we can and have become as a species.<br/><br/>The film is hard to write about because it does everything in a bad buddy cop movie and makes it realistic. How would Mel Gibson and Danny Glover function outside of the job? How would the world react to absurd James Bond like plans? How would a basically criminal master mind make his plans make sense? The film is like a satire that went all of the way. It makes everything that'd be nonsense in any other film, and I mean any other film, work. The dialogue works, the acting, the camera, the story, the plan, the makeup, everything works. And the best part is, you don't expect it to. By all means, this film should've been awful, and it's brilliant.<br/><br/>This the first time I'm truly recommending a movie. Unlike a lot of good movies, this one you want to suggest to others. It's hard to recommend something like The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or Citizen Kane because of one reason or another. It's too long, some things don't make sense, but Se7en is a film that's enjoyable and for reasons that can't be explained. It's a watchable movie.<br/><br/>The only problem is also the greatest strength. The first twenty minutes are a bit, well, ""slow"" because they're necessary and without it the film wouldn't work on an emotional or logical level. But, even then, it so much more watchable than a lot of other first twenty minutes. It's a ""good movie"" no matter what.<br/><br/>If nothing else, everything about this film WORKS. What that means, I still don't know. But it's a working movie and make of that what you will. Please, watch this movie."
"maxwell-364","8","2","3","15 April 2015"," Genius in concept and execution
","Se7en's concept is inherently interesting: a serial killer who bases his murders off of the seven deadly sins is notable enough (and certainly opens the door for social commentary), while the characters of Somerset and Mills are both clashing and easy to relate with in their respective passion and persnickety meticulousness. There was no doubt that following the two detectives hunt down John Does was going to be a treat. But what Fincher does so beautifully here is surpass the intrigue caused by the film's writing with pacing that escalates the film's events from noteworthy on a base level to thrilling. <br/><br/>It would have been so predictable and placid to simply follow each of the seven murders like a trail of breadcrumbs, allowing the final murder scene to be the murderer's reveal and the film's final confrontation, but instead we're introduced to John Doe as a character about halfway through the film. While Spacey himself doesn't get screen-time until he turns himself in in the third act, Doe is characterized through his ruthless pragmatism in immediately shooting at the detectives when they discover his apartment (rather than try to convince them that he's not their guy), which is later contrasted by his decision to spare Mills' life: Doe was hell-bent on carrying through with his plan, and the senseless killing of an officer would only cloud the message his murders were supposed to send. Not to mention the fact that Mills was destined to be his Wrath.<br/><br/>On that point of Mills as Wrath, there is a plot hole to discuss, or at the very least an incongruity. The fact that every other murder victim seemed to be the result of over a year of planning (especially Sloth, who was literally entrapped for over a year) does conflict with the decision to make Mills Wrath after only knowing that he exists for a few days. Doe is endlessly scheming and insanely careful (sanding off his own fingerprints in the off chance that he's discovered), so why would he put his plan into motion without hammering down a surefire candidate for his Wrath? While Doe could have simply decided that he was going to make whichever detective came after him his Wrath, it sort of undermines the perfect casting of the passionate and unfocused Mills as the man who would allow Doe to get the better of him. Looking back at the scene where Mills kicks down Doe's door, would just any detective have the gall to ignore the law so brusquely? <br/><br/>Perhaps Somerset was supposed to be the unique one, a bastion of purity and law-abiding good-nature (whose positivity has been hammered down over time by the city's unwavering cruelty into apathy) in the sea of brutish and violent officers like Mills and John C. McGinley's California. If this was intended to be Doe's true message, a commentary on the state of the police force, it seems a little weak. <br/><br/>Granted, this is all based off of what could have just been a simple oversight in order to deliver the most interesting twist ending possible, but it muddles the impact of the film's ending after moving past the surprise of it. In fact, this all really only came to me hours after the film was over and I had been entranced by the atypical nature of this thriller, so I see no reason to deduct serious marks because of it. Se7en is one of the best told murder mysteries out there, and worth a watch to fans of Fincher and detective thrillers alike."

"ryklinker","8","2","3","18 December 2014"," Two homicide detectives must track down a serial killer who uses the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" as his guideline for his killings
","Detective William Somerset's years as a homicide detective have come down to their last seven days. He has closed many a case, and we meet him as he encounters his last Young Detective David Mills has just transferred to the local police force as Somerset's replacement, and he shooting from his hip as soon as he walks into the first crime scene. Local police have found an extremely obese man dead in his house, and after a few minutes of investigating, the initially believed cause of death, brain hemorrhage, is soon replaced with murder. The two detectives conclude that the victim was forced to eat by his killer, and then kicked in the stomach. This is but our first taste (insensitive pun unintended) of the sick world that this story takes place in. Within 24 hours of this, a top-notch attorney is found dead in his office, and the word ""greed"" written into the carpet. On an inquiry of the first victim's apartment, Somerset finds the word ""gluttony"" carved into the wall behind the fridge. It does not take Somerset and Mills to realize that this unknown killer is systematically murdering his victims using the themes of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. With the identity of the killer, and 5 more victims helplessly unaware of what is to come, detectives Mills and Somerset must find their man, and navigate the dark world that surrounds them. <br/><br/>If the first murder wasn't an obvious clue, this is a dark movie. The ""gluttony"" victim, and all of the other victims for that matter, is brutally executed, and most of the grisly remains are what we see. Though we do not see the murders themselves, there is little left to the imagination. In this aspect, this luridly-themed film took me to my limit, and perhaps past it. I would like to think that I can handle just about anything that a camera can show, but this film proved me terrifyingly wrong. Putting the murders aside, this film was very well put together. Freeman does a great job of playing the ""old vet"" archetype, and Brad Pitt as the young rookie is a well-cast role. Kevin Spacey as our ""John Doe"" makes the antagonist utterly sickening, which is exactly what director David Fincher wanted. From a cinematography standpoint, the film was well-shot, and the editing (Oscar-nominated) was very well done. I will leave you with a few key points that I feel I must emphasize. As a devout Christian, I found the killer's system very appalling, and I dearly hope that the public does not associate this with any Christian value. In case you did not pick this up in my previous notes, this film is DARK. I myself had to watch through my fingers at times, and I have no doubt that any future viewer will as well. The language in itself is R-rated, and it just adds to the dreariness. In his review of this film, the late film critic Roger Ebert began by saying "" 'Seven,' a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see film-making of a high order.""<br/><br/>The thrills did thrill, and the horrors did horrify, but I found it too far exposed. Though Fincher is known for his dark portrayal of life (Fight Club, I'm talking about you), this film took it past my favorable level.<br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"

","Seven is an extremely good crime thriller. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are really good in this movie. The movie is really dark with many effective scenes in the movie. It is like the director is going out of his way to make the viewer queasy. All in all it is a good movie if a bit dark for my liking but the characters are good and the narrative is also worthy of respect. It is a blend of crime, horror and Thriller movies and shows and in some respects it is a foreshadow to the CSI series that now are all over TV.<br/><br/>Great performance from Brad Pitt in this movie. The gritty feel of the movie is also very realistic."

","If Fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. This is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. And this remains Fincher's best film.<br/><br/>Two cops in New York are hunting a serial killer. The presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through Kevin Spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm.<br/><br/>Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. Walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. Apparently he was quite depressed at the time. New Line Cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production Walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. It was released Sept 22, 1995. By using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killer's prerogative, the film's plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but Seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best Thrillers of all time because of Fincher's vision of a hellish New York. This world is poison and Fincher makes it seep. <br/><br/>The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this film's beauty is in the compilation. The sets and lighting are so complex that making Seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. It is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes Se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement.<br/><br/>More at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"

","As a 15 year old, I did not know what to expect from the movie. All I knew is that it was supposedly good and that the actors were the best there are. The storyline takes the viewer on a journey along with the characters. The viewer soon begins to empathise with Brad Pitt's seemingly over- confident character. This is similar for Morgan Freeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be significant towards the end of the movie. This movie is no murder mystery like any other, and perhaps not much of a murder mystery at all. This is due to the difficulty that the detectives have when attempting to solve the case. With any other actors, the movie may have been unbearable as it is often slow paced. However the acting was so real and, well, brilliant that you can't take your eyes off the screen for one second. All in all, the magnificent, unpredictable storyline combined with brilliant acting makes this movie a must- watch for all fans of film."
"bojleng_utomo","6","2","3","6 September 2012"," The Zeroth Sin
","Let's skip the outline (it's everywhere here). Instead, let's start with some quality points: (++), (+), (0), (-) and (--).<br/><br/>Excellent (++): Morgan Freeman (didn't surprise me; anyone?). Gwyneth Paltrow (the way she plays her relatively small role is anything but defective). And surely the dialog, practically all along, but particularly when Somerset (Freeman) and Tracy (Paltrow) talk heart to heart (trust me, at that moment, even the screen smokes).<br/><br/>Good (+): directing, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, camera work, editing, the way the movie depicts the police' daily life--along with the questionable approach they've sometimes got to take... (The good points are quite aplenty. But considering the space, we've just got to stop here).<br/><br/>So and so (0): screenplay (this is sort of a bargained price; we'll get back to this at the very end).<br/><br/>Bad/weak/silly (-): Somewhat aplenty. We pick one up, just so that you kind reader see my point of what magnitude a (-) might look like. The blood on the killer's shirt. Look again: chop, then ask some delivery guy to deliver the package (500 bucks), take a cab, and on to the police station (he need to BE there). All in THAT shirt. How discreet! The poor guy must be wondering why he didn't attract any attention at all along the way--even up inside the station's lobby (now I know why he's never got caught: he's invisible!). And profile-wise, he always messes up his victims, but never himself. A real turnoff.<br/><br/>Sinful (--): the element of danger.<br/><br/>It's mental. Without danger, there's no fear, suspense (and so forth). And when do we SENSE danger? When we feel that something/someone is THREATENING us--or anybody/anything we care about (our very existence, purpose, grounds, close ones, heroes, etc). In the movie, we never REALLY feel the fear, because no one ever FEELS threatened (not when it still matters, anyway). Yes, we did SEE 'threat' once, in the chase (UPON the culprit, with the fear of being caught). But we ONLY saw that--NOT felt, because somehow the one we felt at that moment was Mills (not the culprit). And our good cop is not being threatened, he threatens, and forgiven(!)--right when we're just about to feel his (or anybody's) fear in the whole movie (the chase itself is good, mind you; it's about the ever-elusive element of danger throughout the movie that I'm referring to all along). And yes, we do feel (strong) feeling once. That cafe talk, surely. But the talk (however good) is about worry, and the motif is love. So it doesn't fall into the fear-danger-threat sense we're talking about. What I'm saying is--whilst not fatally wounded, this middleweight not-a-whodunnit-noir-featured police story is, seriously injured.<br/><br/>There is a much simpler way to look at this issue. Try. WHERE? An unnamed city. OK, we go there--we're in (shake hands with some characters if that makes you feel better). WHAT? A sick crime. OK, focus on it. Now take a few steps back (don't turn around, and keep standing). The purpose of this antic is that now we've got a bigger frame--now we can see the whole city (people, alleys, rooms--everything). OK, now pinpoint someone (anyone) whom you WITNESS ever feels threatened by DANGER.<br/><br/>The funny thing about the city is that, despite the shocking nature of the crime, our two heroes seem to be the only souls who take it seriously. Others (be it someone in the Force or just common townspeople) are barely aware of it (if at all). We might even find the city peaceful (albeit gloomy). We don't really have a CHANCE to worry about anyone's safety because apart from a few segments (like the writing behind the fridge--which is a bit minor, and the tracking down of John Doe's ID--which is quite snappy), cards are laid down on the table as preliminaries (when the game hasn't really started yet) or as post-mortem analyses (when the session is over). We always miss the game. Now we can't really play along or feel the heat if we don't INVOLVE IN THE PROCESS, can we? Don't get me wrong. Seven does have many strong points, indeed (otherwise the blunder would've murdered the movie mercilessly). I'm only saying that it's not suspenseful, at least not in the way I think it's supposed to be (sometimes it's more like doing a character study or reading a homicide paperwork). And if any part of the movie did ever scare you in anyway, check again, maybe you had mixed up fear with other like entities (pity, empathy, sympathy, disgust, dislike, anger etc). Really, we're never been the eyewitness because no SCENE ever really poses a THREAT. And in a movie like this, it is a Sin. Cardinal. So while the screenplay does score (especially if we get down to technicalities), it commits the biggest sin of all--leaving out the very drive paramount in our existence: SURVIVAL."

It's a good crime/mystery story delivered by exceptionally good acting, very good directing and a flawless screenplay. While Morgan Freeman steals the show, Brad Pitt proves that he's a promising actor, and not just one of the most handsome men in Hollywood.

"dionnevdnat","8","2","3","12 June 2012"," Review on seven
","Are you afraid of the deathly sins? By Dionne van der Nat, Floris van Hoogdalem and Myrte Tjoa<br/><br/>This review is about the film 'Seven', directed by David Fincher. The film is set in 1995, the year in which the movie was released. In which city the film is set, is unclear and unmentioned in the film. The two main characters, detectives Mills and Somerset are played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. It is a thriller which is very well directed and acted.<br/><br/>The film se7en is about two detectives who try to solve a series of brute murders. Detective Summerset is retiring in seven days, the seven days relate to the title of the film and the seven murders committed. Mills, the young detective, is desperately willing to do a case on his own. Every murder committed relates to one of the deathly sins. When the two detectives discover after the second murder they are dealing with the seven deathly sins they know there are some more horrible murders about to happen. Summerset and Mills try and do their best to catch this guy, but are they able to stop him in time? We thought seven is a very good film and enjoyed watching it even more than once. The film is really catching and moving. While watching the film you have the feeling you are really in it and everything in the film is really happening around you, you can feel the terror and fear of the characters. Unlike other films you can relate seven to reality, without knowing everyone sometimes feels or acts like the deathly sins, what if you would be murdered if you did again...? <br/><br/>Firstly, what makes this movie brilliant is that the acting is very convincing in Se7en. The character of William Somerset is brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman. His facial expressions, the way he talks and even his body language makes us believe in the character of William Somerset and he develops throughout the film. The connection between him and Brad Pitt is great and also shows us what a great actor Brad Pitt actually is. David Mills is the young gun in the movie, he is eager to learn and Pitt sells this really well. The two completely different detectives develop their 'bromance' throughout the film and you develop a form of sympathy towards the two. Another great acting performance is from Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Mils' wife. The young actress has to make David Mills feel comfortable in his new surrounding and she tries to do that, although she herself is very insecure. Paltrow might be one of the most important characters in the whole story.<br/><br/>Secondly, the editing plays an important role in the movie. On the DVD version of the movie they show how and why they have sometimes edited the light and shots. When a scene with a negative mood is filmed, they edit the light in such a way that it is very dark at the set. When a scene with a positive atmosphere is filmed the set has been edited much lighter. The head-space of the actors has been chosen with care, e.g. in a serious scene they want to show the whole face of Morgan Freeman to show how serious he is and they also do this in the opposite way to create suspense. The use of the reverse shot is used quite often in this kind of movie, especially when there are interrogations. Se7en is not an exception, this technique also creates suspense, and you can clearly see the intentions of the one who talks. The average shot length in this movie is different per shot and this makes you think about it. The director has done this sometimes to create suspense, sometimes to make things clearer for the viewer. The use of parallel editing is not used that often in this movie, but when it is used, it is very effective and sometimes it shows a surprise.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the use of camera-work is from big importance in the movie. The director sometimes does not show things to manipulate us into thinking nothing is there. The use of reverse shot has been discussed in the paragraph above and this is vital in the movie to show the emotions from the characters during conversations. The way we see the corpses for the first time in this movie is also very well done. The camera is moving very slowly and you will see the grossest thing first. This creates a form of disgust and sometimes leave you breathless. The close-ups are mainly to show that the characters are worried and you can see the desperate look in their eyes. The movement of the camera when the detectives are chasing someone makes you feel part of the action and is therefore used effectively. The angle of the camera is sometimes used to make one of the characters look heroic (low angle) or to make a character look weak and vulnerable. The low angle technique is effectively used when the detectives chase the serial killer and it stocks your breath at that point.<br/><br/>We think this film was really well thought of and very well casted. Everything said in the film really makes you believe the serial killer could stand right behind you. The camera-work is very well done and the music well-chosen. The suspense keeps up throughout the entire film and at the end of the film we were breathless. We think this was a very good movie, and although is was made almost twenty years ago, the special effects are used effectively and the actors are believable. We really recommend watching this film!"

It is the type of movie that can never be remade or out done, a once in a lifetime film that will shock and thrill audience for decades to come.

"arthera09","9","2","3","4 June 2011"," Excellent entry into the genre of crime dramas
","This is a fantastic movie and I cannot really find anything wrong with it, but in the end it is just a crime drama. The one thing that sets it apart from the rest of the crime dramas is the excellent cast and one of the bleakest ending ever caught on film. Fincher really did do a fantastic job of putting together a well-paced and surprisingly thought provoking movie. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is the constant in the movie that never allows the viewer to lose hope that the situation is not hopeless, while keeping the viewer cynical enough to make the city that they live in a land of misguided hopeless souls. Freeman has such brevity that is really just amazing to watch him. Pitt on the other hand does a very respectful job of being the young cop with ambitions of saving the world and has places well across from the jaded Freeman. Spacey of course played his character spot on and when he gives himself on is probably the creepiest thing in the movie because at this point you have no idea what he is up to, but you know that is is in total control of the situation. <br/><br/>I love how Fincher choose to keep the city raining and lit most of the scenes to emphasize the dark. This matched the darkness nature of the film perfectly. The fact that the last scenes was in the bright day light just made it that more shocking. One can tell that a lot of care when into presenting the world to the viewer in a way that matched the themes perfectly.<br/><br/>I think that car ride provided a great forum for us to get to know John Doe even though we only spend a few minutes we seems to know him so well. One can see Mills going down hill and is losing his footing on the moral high ground. It is extremely well played and I love how Summerset comes off as being a match for him. In a way I see Summerset and Doe as being similar, with the main difference of Doe being crazy. <br/><br/>I think this is an extremely well done and smart entry of crime dramas that really flips some of the conventions in a way that can be surprising. The fact that they do not catch the killer, but the killer turns himself in and that fact that the cops lose. They do not save anyone's lives and they fall into the trap that Doe set up for them. I very much enjoyed this film and it was paced and put together in a very effective way."
"porazzim42","10","2","3","16 August 2009"," Questions Morality
","This movie was flat-out amazing. It was gripping, fascinating, and not only that but it makes you question your own morality. Brad Pitt plays David Mills, a young detective who thinks he knows it all. Morgan Freeman plays the seasoned detective who knows the way of the world. These two unalike people are thrust together when a series of murders, that are taking after the 7 sins, take place. What occurs next is a series of gruesome murders that people who have a weak stomach probably shouldn't see. I'll give one example...the ""eat till he burst guy"". Pretty revolting. <br/><br/>The two actors are amazing, as they usually are. But the real gem of the movie is Kevin Spacey, although he didn't show up until the end. Mills is convinced, as most normal people would be, that John Doe, the killer, is just ""crazy"". But as the movie progresses and then you finally hear from the killer at the end, he is more than that. He really isn't ""crazy"" per say. He knows what he's doing and he's quite good at it. He is evil and yet he thinks he's doing this world a favor by killing some of the scum of the face of this planet. As I watched the scene in which Spacey describes the people he killed, I had a fleeting moment in which I thought, well maybe he was. <br/><br/>And that's what this movie wanted you to think. But this guy was pure evil...the definition of a psychopath. The end of the movie is both shocking and angering. Now I'm not going to give away the ending to those who haven't seen it, but for those who have seen it, would you have done what Brad Pitt did? Thjis movie doesn't have a happy ending or leave you with all the answers. It leaves you something to discuss and think about. That's why this movie is amazing."

"George-Holmes","9","2","3","13 November 2007"," Morgan Freeman is the man!
","Freeman's performance in this is everything you could want from an actor, so little of which is present these days in Hollywood films. He displays patience, subtlety, and control. Without sacrificing authority, power or charisma. It is a textbook performance. In fact, I'm not so sure it's a performance as that it's something he can do on demand in just about any situation. His part is well written to be sure, but it the hands of someone else, it could have been much less than what it is here.<br/><br/>The movie itself, apart from his performance, is one of the best of this genre, if not the ideal. Gore is implied for the most part, as opposed to splashed onto the camera. The horror is very real, and is effective as to be unsettling in parts, in large part because it feels as though is could easily be possible. A glimpse into man at his worst.<br/><br/>Spacey's bad guy is someone whose motives are pure, so much so that even when the movie could have almost had us emphasizing with him on some of the choices of his victims (though definitely not this methods of punishment) he stays the course, and we realize that no one if safe from what he perceives as the only form of truth and justice, his own. There are people out there like him, thankfully the vast majority of them keep their thoughts on these matters from progressing to action.<br/><br/>If there is one scene that you wish could have been extended, it is the conversation between Freeman and Spacey in the car. And if I had a second choice it would be the scene at the bar between Freeman and Pitt.<br/><br/>Pitt's not bad in a role that doesn't have a lot of meat to it. Almost any of the developed parts are good, even smaller roles like Richard Roundtree's or the detective's boss.<br/><br/>Great film, not just because of Freeman's performance, but it is a showpiece, without being showy. Can't remember the last time I saw that in a Hollywood film."
"Kurt08","9","2","3","12 April 2007"," Woah, that hit me hard, OUTSTANDING
","I just watched Se7en, which stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey and I was gob smacked at how well crafted the storyline and ending are. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive. Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over. Very Highly recommended and I would give it 9/10."
"owen_twistfield","7","2","3","8 November 2006"," Why is it raining when the sun shines?(a story about contrived elements)
","Introduction Eleven years after it's release I finally got around to seeing se7en. The movie started of well. The characters are believable, the story is intriguing and thought provoking. But then I wonder. <br/><br/>Why is the FBI able to find that one killer amidst all the thousands upon thousands who borrow books in the library, even if the selection of books is rather exotic? Why does the killer not buy the books? He has money enough to spare and the books are easy to buy in any store? And thus he is better to erase his steps. And why does the killer name himself John Doe, which is an obvious fake name, but then is silly enough to also register his real address with the library with the obvious result that the police will find him?<br/><br/>The library records are actually a key element in the story. The police is able to track down the killer because the FBI is able to find the address of the killer in the library register. Indeed there isn't even a list: they get the address and go straight to the killers house.<br/><br/>There is more of this in the movie, but nothing is more far fetched than the end. The entire ending rest on the assumption that Mills does not once check upon his wife. During the many hours in which the process of justice grinds, not once does Mills call his wife. Maybe to say hello or to tell her he might be late. And thus at the end the delivery man at exact seven o'clock delivers the gruesome box in the middle of nowhere that causes Mills to shoot the killers and thus making it seven kills in all. There is no way the killer could have known the box had to be there at seven o'clock as he had no control over Mills being there. It is to much of a coincidence.<br/><br/>My conclusion It's a nice movie and might have been a good film if the story elements had been stronger. The movie is too much based on coincidences and contrived elements and this is a pity."

"smithcorey","8","2","3","26 February 2005"," Good Movie! worthy of #49? No.
","My opinion: This was a terrificly written and acted film. I especially liked the ending and how Pitt dealt with the contrasting emotions, especially when he first tried to shoot Doe, how his face cringed up. The lighting was good and the editing was tight. I was especially glad to see that the director didn't jump for the opportunity to show Brad Pitt as all sexy when he didn't' need to be. However, it just doesn't seem to me that Se7en should be the #49 movie of all time as ranked by movie goers. In the top 250? Yes, sure. But #49? I think that the star cast and good story overall are having a little too much influence in the votes. I can't really put my finger on it; part of it was that the last few deaths sped up really fast, like the beauty queen, and then the fact that they only drove one hour out of the city and they were in a desert took the sparkle of the film away from me. The plot's original, I'll give it that, but when you think about it, it seems a little clich√©. A guy kills people when they commit one of the 7 deadly sins. death 1....death 2....death 3.... death 4....death 5....now a little twist is death 6...then the finale is death 7...(I'm thinking of why it didn't' strike me as worthy as #49 as i go) And John Doe's 6th murder that will supposedly make people ponder it for years wasn't all that crazy...he killed someone close to Pitt's character. eh...good script. good cast. Better than stuff like ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Reservior Dogs"", ""Being John Malkovich""? I don't agree. Again, it's my opinion. Maybe others would like to agree and add to why I believe it's not #49, maybe others will defend what I've said, I'd like to hear both sides. It's a good movie, nonetheless."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","2","3","17 January 2005"," Grisly, Disturbing, and well created thriller
","Se7en is a film that is often compared to Silence Of The Lambs. Both films involve serial killers. In both films the serial killers have a method of choosing their next victim, and both films are dark and disturbing. In my opinion, they're both good and they're different types of films. <br/><br/>(Spoilers) Se7en starts out with detective David Mills(Brad Pitt) and Detective Lt. William Somerset(Morgan Freeman) investigating the murder of an obese man. He had been dead for a while and had the word gluttony written on the floor of his apartment. The next day there is another murder with the name of the second sin written on the floor. This is when the detectives figure out there is a serial killer on the loose, and he is picking his victims according to the seven sins. In the rest of the film Mills and Somerset are on a path ridden with danger and suspense in trying to track down the killer. I don't want to spoil anything else for you.<br/><br/>The killings that the detectives come across are grisly and disturbing. Se7en definitely has a long lasting effect on you for a long time after you see it. The film is well created as it sends you into the deepest darkest corners of the human mind and never goes soft. The climax is the best part as it keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat, and when you find out what happens you'll be in for a shock. I highly recommend se7en, but only if your stomach can handle it."

","***Spoilers Herein***<br/><br/>Seven (I'm not spelling it Se7en. That confuses me.) stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey. The movie focuses around two detectives trying to track down a killer who chooses his victims by the seven deadly sins. What are the seven deadly sins, you ask? Gluttony (Whatever that is.), Pride, Envy, Lust, Greed, Sloth (Uh....).<br/><br/>
Murder mystery killers always have to kill in weird ways. This movie really had me going. I was shocked when killer just walked into the police station and turned himself in. WTF? And the whole end with the head in the box didn't really make up for it. Morgan Freeman was wrong when he said: ""John Doe has control of the game"" or whatever it was that he said after he opened the box. All John Doe had was another life to add to the murder charges against him. <br/><br/>Then, there was another thing that confused me. John Doe murdered those people because of their sins? Isn't murder a sin? Someone should kill him... Oh wait, they did. OOPS! Also, where in the bible does it say that these are the seven deadly sins? Hmmm.... In my opinion, God forgives every sin except suicide. (If you want an answer to that, PM me.)<br/><br/>This movie was suspenseful, as far as mysteries go. I don't think it should be on the top 250 list. It wasn't that great. If for some stupid reason, they decide to make a sequel, I'll be the.... um... 27th person in line to get a ticket. My rating: 5/10"
"cryptomorphe","8","2","3","2 December 2002"," Grotesque/Beautiful
","This has to be, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful movies I have yet to see.<br/><br/>And I'm talking on it's artistic value. Not on it's less-than-delightful subject matter. Every detail that went into the making of it, from the photography, to the meticulous care with which the props were concocted is incredible. So many pieces, in such an intricate puzzle, that all come together to form a multi-faceted, and beautiful film.<br/><br/>The acting is well-done. While not amazing, I'd have to say each one of the characters were perfectly formed, and played off of each other in exact harmony.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is somewhat classic in its cop-thriller genre. But as you take a closer look, it has been magnified not only to account for the 90's audiences bloodlust, but to step past it, making it seem grotesque to ever want to witness such a thing.<br/><br/>It doesn't hold back in showing true ugliness. Which is something that Hollywood often neglects."
"Quinoa1984","10","2","3","17 October 2000"," Disturbingly effective, for two audiences
","A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.<br/><br/>It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later."

A bad movie is just bad. The acting, story, script, or directing are flawed, sometimes all of the above (see Plan 9 from Outerspace, or any Paulie Shore film.) When one watches a bad movie, one seldom goes ""Now that could have been good, if only..."" Se7en, like its ridiculous title, is not a bad movie. It is a very bad movie. It could so easily have been a good movie that its total failure is that much more appalling.

"zaferdc","9","1","1","2 April 2020"," ""A genius thriller that reflects the corrupt morality of society perfectly."" - My interpretation of the movie:
","If you are looking for a story-based movie, this will not be for you. If you are looking for something with a deeper message and lots of metaphors and reflections of wrong judgement, you will fall in love with this masterpiece. Here is my interpretation:<br/><br/>Joe, being drawn as the 'psycho serial killer' initially, is murdering his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins. After his first 5 crimes in which he 'punishes' the victims, he goes for detective Mills' (Brad Pitt) wife. That is his sixth crime. When Mills finds out about it, he kills Joe in his own violent way (in fact, he shoots a whole magazine of bullets), and Joe's series of crimes complete.<br/><br/>Here, the message is that when someone that is judging others because of their 'crazy, psychopathic behavior', they are underrating or not understanding how 'personal' that person has taken the sins that the victims have committed. If Joe had killed some other random, Mills would have never shot him. He kills him because it is about his wife. However, that is why Joe has been killing in the first place: he takes the sins of all those victims very personal; unlike Mills who is lacking the empathy that Joe has and only decides to kill when the victim is his own wife. Here, Joe proves that Mills is basically no different: he also kills when it comes to a sin that is bothering him so much that he cannot live if he does not do something about it. That is what society is about: we judge people easily on behalf of their acts, but most of the time, we are no different.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Joe's sixth victim, Mills' wife, is also not a pure good person. She was considering having an abortion without telling his husband Mills, who is the father of the baby, anything about it - which is also a sin. You can clearly see the smile on Joe's face when he learns about the fact that Mills did not know about the pregnancy.<br/><br/>I think that Somerset (Morgan Freeman) could be a metaphor to the 'good and right part of Mills'. I think the scene where Somerset sits on Mills' desk is really key to make me think so. Most of the time, Mills wants to ignore that good part inside him, but when Mills' wife calls him, she wants to speak to Somerset (the good side in Mills), invites him to dinner, and Mills' wife opens herself about the pregnancy to again Somerset, the good side in Mills. From time to time, Somerset has tried to convince Mills not to do the wrong thing (first at Joe's apartment he told him not to break the door, and in the end not to kill Joe), but ultimately he failed.<br/><br/>In short, I think this is an absolute masterpiece and I am sure there are still a lot of things that I have not noticed about the movie. The only reason I don't rate it as a 10 is because of the acting that was not the best knowing Freeman and Pitt's potential. Maybe it's because they did not have enough time in their scenes to 'take us in'. Overall, David Fincher is a genius."

Everyone is watching you but nobody is actually looking.
We, the audience, also don't realize that his life is a sad misery. We are treated to so many films where the protagonist is flawed and unhappy.

","Se7en epitomises the work of David Fincher - graphic, introspective works with clever colour palettes, wonderful cinematography, word-perfect writing and equally intelligent use of music. And this one ranks amongst Fight Club and Gone Girl as his all-time best.<br/><br/>However, this is also a film characterised by its iconic performances. In a similar vein to The Silence of the Lambs, it is the antagonistic performance that lasts barely an act that steals the show from top-class performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. Kevin Spacey's performance as John Doe is chilling to the bone, masterful and truly iconic as one of the greatest cinematic murderers in history.<br/><br/>The work on screen of Freeman, Pitt and Spacey, as well as Gwyneth Paltrow, is highlighted by Fincher's mastery behind the camera. This is a murder mystery that is not afraid to be chilling, disturbing and disgusting. It delves into the depths of human nature and emerges bloody and deranged.<br/><br/>Finding its basis in the Seven Deadly Sins, Se7en weaves an intricate mystery that grips the audience from the beginning and is a true revelation when it comes full-circle. The infamous ending of the film is emotional, raw and mind-boggling in every sense of all three words. The chemistry of the performances are best seen in those final minutes, from the grieving Pitt to the psychopathic Spacey.<br/><br/>Se7en ticks every box that I look for in a film.

","Se7en is a morbid, unrelenting thriller. It doesn't merely stare into the abyss, it jumps in. Two detectives, one rookie and one veteran, come across the worst murders they've ever seen, but such that are intricately designed, they know the killer is trying to prove a point. Freeman's character connects the dots to the Seven Deadly Sins as inspiration for the killings. Once they catch him, they come to find that he's as crazy as you'd expect, but more self-righteous than they would ever believe, and all along, the religious backdrop of these murders were intentional.<br/><br/>David Fincher is a master of the macabre and has become a household name for bleak films 23 years later. You can credit him for how deeply appalling the bloody crime scenes unfold for us. The little stories behind them, the production design.. Then we come to Kevin Spacey as the killer. Looking back now, it's a bit rich to see him play a man righteously outraged by a decaying American society and delivering his sick sense of street justice on sinners. Arguably, Spacey himself would have been among his victims. But perhaps even Spacey knows that, just as his character does here as well. Truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's horrifying."

","A veteran detective counting his days to retirement and a rookie officer hungry for success and glory team up to hunt down a serial killer who refers to seven deadly sins in his gruesome murders. There's not a specific setting for the city where the drama unfolds except that it's a metropol area. The movie is perfect in directing, editing, acting and cinematography. Dark indoor scenes and narrow gloomy alleys shot under overcast and rainy skies fit very well with the brooding theme of the movie. Despite some intensive chase scenes and violence, Seven is not an action packed movie. Although it's technically classified as a crime thriller the psychological aspects of the main characters are emphasized. Some reviewers describe it as a slow paced movie but it is not. The scenes involving character development are as captivating as those with gun fights and rooftop chases. The tempo is successfully balanced in subplots but the tension is never lost and the movie never gets boring. While horrid murder scenes aren't for fainthearted they can't be compared to cartoonish blood and gore extravaganza in Tarantino's movie caricatures. Like all other scenes, the director D. Fincher uses them in moderation to instill terror in the audience. Some reviewers' comparison of the serial killer John Doe to Hannibal Lecture is ridiculous. With his unrealistic superhuman physical strength, H. Lecture's silly cartoon character looks more funny than frightening in scenes where he bites off ears and noses in a straight jacket and finds his way out from a locked iron cage. John Doe, on the other hand, is an average person who can be easily taken down in a fistfight but his psychopathic ramblings give him a much more real and menacing look."

But this film is not really about a serial killer on a killing spree and the protagonists trying to catch them, it's about how this ""city"" is affecting the characters in this film. This is one great example of exploiting the settings to affect the characters. There are small moments in this film that shows that they are in fact humans and not just some random film character. Speaking of characters, all actors/actresses in this film is great especially by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. This is still one of my most favorite film ever."

","I love psycho/detective/action movies then I chose this for Saturday morning.
The ideas, puzzling mysteries and gun action makes the movie great until the last scene of the movie comes.
If you watch this in the morning and after that you have no appointment to meet someone, DON'T see this movie or the last scene. 
The ending is the darkest one I have ever known. 
If you do want emotionally challenge yourself, go for it, and you'll be regretful.
Still the movie is super interesting. Just the ending..."

","Fincher finds a way to pace his movies so methodically and naturally, even in their ""slow"" moments, they stay completely captivating. Like a highbrow ""Saw"", this is a brutal and gross 90s crime thriller that plays beautifully on the very-real terror of ethical but evil people like the Unabomber, which was dominating national news and everyday American fear. And that final scene in the empty field is unbelievably great."
"rbkavg","10","1","1","2 July 2017"," Shockingly good...
","There are very few films which are truly shocking, brilliant and moving all at once, Se7en is one such rare case. In my brief movie invested life, Se7en is only one of two films I would consider a masterpiece. David Fincher is my favourite director, and Brad Pitt my favourite actor, and this film is the reason I had begun to take note of the two. Fincher's direction is immaculate and Andrew Kevin Walker's script is unbelievably good.<br/><br/>Characters: William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a retiring detective, and he embodies so perfectly - silent intelligence, as opposed to the boyish aggression of his partner, the rookie David Mills (Brad Pitt) despite his claims of experience. Both attempt to uncover a truly mesmerising case in which the killer carries out murders based on the seven deadly sins. Somerset is deeply reluctant of his surrounding, whereas Mills seems to feed off of it, and their partnership brings across the subtle and brash attempt of uncovering a mystery respectively. Walker's script expertly devotes time through dialogue and minor actions to bring across the complexities of the two different characters and their different mindsets, whether it's their differing opinion on the killer, environment, or even how 50 bucks is spent.<br/><br/>Story & Direction: As far as murder mysteries go, there are no better than Se7en, its script so clever, horrifying and unique. It brings a sense of realism through the characters who live in such a wore down and dismal setting. Each murder is horrific, yet as they pass, the audience become further eager to discover the killer as well as becoming further unsettled. And it is without any hesitation that I can say that Se7en has the greatest ending of all time, the plot builds up sensationally, with a dark and sinister tone and the finish is so unbelievably satisfying. Upon rewatches, the film only gets better. Fincher's unique style only adds to the tension and disturbing nature of scenes.<br/><br/>Acting: Morgan Freeman as ever, gives a nuanced performance. His portrayal of Somerset as having come to terms with the ugliness of reality is impeccable. Brad Pitt similarly does a great job of acting as the inexperienced, arrogant and angry rookie, trying to make do of his environment. The acting is top notch throughout, as murders unravel, the shock of it all is brought across expertly through the sheer quality of acting, and Fincher relies on this, as opposed to clich√©d flashbacks. <br/><br/>Verdict: i've seen many mystery films, and none come close to Fincher's masterpiece. It's dark, gripping and undeniably shocking. It's one of two films I have given the perfect 10/10. It's a must see."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","1","4 October 2009"," A murder mystery that offers more for the mind than mere thrills
","Murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity. They generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' But ""Se7en"" is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil. <br/><br/>As gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, ""Se7en"" is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in David Fincher who perfectly understands them.<br/><br/>More than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, ""Se7en"" wants to be something bigger. It wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. The contemplative script by Andrew Kevin Walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring Lt. Somerset (Freeman) and Det. Mills (Pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at Mills' apartment. It's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes.<br/><br/>None of that would be communicated well, however, without Fincher (""Alien 3""). ""Se7en"" takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows Fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. The murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. Constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. It's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision.<br/><br/>The characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. Freeman comes fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. We take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. On the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view.<br/><br/>Even Pitt's Mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. Pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all.<br/><br/>That's sort of the way ""Se7en"" works on the whole. Before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. Few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

","This movie is not for those offended by strong language and chilling violence. But it most definitely is for fans of fine acting. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwynneth Paltrow are superb, as is the surprise appearance of the serial killer in the story -- I won't name him and spoil anything for he is not identified until the final credits even though you will recognize him immediately once you finally see him towards the end of the film. The cinematography is excellent, heightening the suspense all through the film. The musical score again fits perfectly, my only complaint being sometimes it's loud enough to muffle dialog you really want to hear clearly. Other than that, a fine -- if blood-curdling -- film."

","Watched a movie after a long time and what a choice for a comeback . Se7en is a shocking, disturbing, cold, sinful thriller which takes hold of the audience for the entire length of the movie. The story is about two police cops, one about to retire and one a very young new entry played by Freeman and Pitt respectively. Just before Detective Somerset (Freeman) is about to retire, a strange case of murder comes into picture which introduces the police department to a cold-blooded, patient and deranged serial killer who kills people one after the other on the basis of seven deadly sins mentioned by religion which are subjected to death of the sinner. Thus the serial killer aims at killing 7 people, one for each sin respectively. Detectives Somerset and Mills (Pitt) are given this case and they both try their different methods to uncover this mystery and catch the killer. A very unique plot, this movie is made even more thrilling by the classic direction of Fincher. This movie can be called a milestone in the suspense genre.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as the young, restless cop Mills has done his job pretty well . But there are some scenes where we feel that he is overacting a bit. Morgan Freeman on the other hand makes us feel that this particular role of Detective Somerset was written just for him. Kevin Spacey in a small role as the deranged killer is impressive and makes us feel that he is truly a cold blooded psychopath . Overall, a must watch movie Rating : 8.5/10"

","My brother and I were still under 18 when ""Showgirls"" was released, so after being denied access on opening night by a ticket boy who thought he was the Terminator we slipped into David Fincher's ""Se7en,"" having no idea what it was or what to expect.<br/><br/>Surely the best serial killer story of all-time, this was bleak upon dark upon black upon evil. The rain is constantly falling in the crumbling, apocalyptic city, and as sick and brutal as John Doe's grisly murders may be, he's only holding a mirror up to our own guilt and depravity. No one is innocent anymore.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that Fincher has no fear of the dark, and that he boldly, bravely lets the movie end unhappily because... because maybe life ends unhappily. I can't speak for you but my life is much closer to chaos than an upbeat TV crime wrap-up: ""The killer confessed and was sentenced to life and Mrs. Mantovanni got her puppies back."" Hang on while I vomit.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect film by any means... Fincher was still mastering the craft of storytelling: Paltrow's secret luncheon late in the film raises red flags all over creation, but the crisp cinematography and filthy visuals are a wonder to behold. Pitt and Freeman do everything possible to avoid just another black/white, old/young buddy-cop partnership and its a testament to their abilities that they surely succeed. John Doe shows us serial killing as not just preaching but high art... and he and Fincher get every detail just right: the psychosis of the notebooks, the insanity of the fingerprints, the stained bloody shirt and calculated surrender. Even the Nine Inch Nails track in the titles spoke to the mood of violence and industrial rage that at the time was not only hip but palpable.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet get good for a downer, abandon all hope and kiss your loved ones goodbye. Don't worry- you can trust in Fincher, Freeman and Pitt to take you through the best bad dream you'll ever have. Now I gotta go that's UPS at the door.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

At the end when brad pitt becomes wrath, morgan freeman doesn't really try to talk him out of it like in all the other films where the good guy doesn't kill the bad guy. Just the line ""if u kill him he will win"" that line is great because its true. It is what john doe planned all along and to foil his plans would devistate him. When i was young i always thought i would kill him for sure and i guess i still would but i think it would destroy john doe if pitt didn't go through with it.

","This movie was by far the most powerful psychological thriller ever made to date. Three of the best actors in one film giving an air of electricity could hardly be achieved by any other than The Usual Suspects. A film where two cops try to unravel the mysteries about a series of homicides, stemming from the seven deadly sins. Each character seeping a film of evil from themselves even though they are dead made the public think what if a serial murderer is right. That each death was necessary as he saw fit, making sure that the deadly sins was carried out to such a degree that the outcry from this maniac was heard by the public. And in turn having each person reconsider their lives and why we are here. David fincher did a brilliant job directing this film, giving us a glimpse into the horrific underworld of the deadly sins, in the cracks of the streets or sidewalks and where the stragglers walk the alley ways, and even capturing the stink of the scene where the public cringes their noses watching. Brad Pitt, Morgan freeman, and Kevin spacey was magnificent together. Making the end scene the most powerful ever created, and along with the end scene the music that gave the film its most impactive climax to date. Wonderful movie."

","This generally is a superb movie. I didn't really expect much of this movie, but i adore mystery/thriller movies and well this is epic. I'm not going to bore you with the plot because you probably read it above but i will tell you why it is absolutely a great deserving much higher on the IMDb top 250 list than a measly 34/35.<br/><br/>It is a very eary thriller which is always sending a shiver down your spine because of the constant atrocious weather and dark, empty rooms. Every part of the killers sadistic nature is captured exquisitely during the investigations and i'm glad that lots of clues are found that link to the killers identity whereas in some movies they just get one clue and they know where to go next which bores me. This had so much more depth and each clue and piece of evidence links perfectly into what the killer is going to do next.<br/><br/>I thought Brad Pitt was going to be terrible and i would get to slate down his emotionless acting, yet he was terrific. A great loving sense for his wife and kids and also becomes more likable as his character (Detective Mills) and Morgan Freeman's character (Detective Somerset) become more like partners rather than just cops. Obviously Morgan Freeman played the part amazingly and you always feel he has a great sense of knowledge and wisdom which is what i expected.<br/><br/>Each scene is well thought out and works well with the story so credit to the writer and some terrific music helped emphasise the tension of each scene.<br/><br/>So all in all a spectacular movie which case shall remain off my shelf and in my player for time to come. 10/10"

","The most absurd objection against Seven that I have ever read is the one claiming that Spacey's too nice guy persona was not credible as a fierce murderer.Well,this may be so for someone whose first Spacey movies were K-PAX or Pay It Forward or The Shipping News ;but I first saw Spacey in the astonishing noir pastiche L.A. Confidential and then in the drama The Big Kahuna .We are talking about the actor from L.A. Confidential (1997), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), The Usual Suspects (1995),etc.,that is,an endless gallery of villains.And not only a competent bad guy,but an authentic tough guy also¬óa violent tough guy.The opposite of a dolt or a sissy;very tough,very strong,one of the toughest guys on screen.His only convincing and interesting role as a good-natured character is the one in K-Pax.<br/><br/>In my opinion,Spacey's best roles known to me are those from American Beauty, L.A.

","I love ""Se7en"". It's captivating, horrifically repulsive, thought provoking, and violently thrilling. Fincher's style creates a foreboding and appealing atmosphere that makes you HAVE to look, even if mounting tension and repulsion would compel you to do otherwise. Fincher shows you some very disturbing, bloody things in this film, but he pulls back and uses implication rather than illustration at the perfect times. The climax is incredible in its ability to effect you, forcing you to be introspective about what you would do in the character at center stage's position. Few films have engaged me emotionally and mentally in such a way."

Second off, even at points of the film when things happen and you think that you might know how this movie will end, you are completely blown off your feet. I was so shocked about how this thriller ended, I couldn't help but spoil the ending to many off my friends. Even the acting in this film was terrific, specially by Brad Pitt.

","I thought this movie was very suspenseful. It's about two detectives, Freeman and Pitt,who are trying to solve serial mysteries. The victims were innocent people who were being killed because the crazy ""john Doe"" condemned to death because they had committed a sin. The title to the movie se7en are for the seven deadly sins; gluttony, pride, wrath, envy,greed, sloth, and lust. ""John Doe"" whom the detectives can't find any type of finger prints to kills each person and leaves clues for the next killing. Freeman portrays a great detective in this movie, it was like he was meant to be a detective, like in Along Came a Spider. I was very intrigued when he stated ""there are seven deadly sins etc......."" At first i was like wow!! How does he know this ? Then he teaches Pitt what he should be looking forward to.Pitt goes and gets books and cliff notes on the stories.<br/><br/>The movie is set in New York, some of the places the detectives visit is dark and gloomy. The are some scenes where you see the inexperience detective Pitt, almost gags and/or cover his nose, which Freeman an experienced Detective don't.The movie has a twisted ending which is a mouth dropper. I would advise anyone to see this movie, especially if you love a suspenseful, crime, gory movie."

","When I first saw Se7en, I thought it was reasonable. Then, reading the endless comments on IMDb that held it up as some sort of masterpiece, I became frustrated with people thinking that just because it is a well put together serial killer film, it is a masterpiece. Yet of late, I have realised, that Se7en is not a serial killer film. Not just that, anyway.<br/><br/>Se7en is an idea, a statement (if you're as pessimistic as that) about the world we live in. There is not a single moment in this film that does not scream ""The world is a horrible place."" Personally I don't agree that that is true, but that doesn't make the notion of the film any less masterful. So, it is since I have realised that Se7en is not about a killer, but a horrible notion, that yes, it is a masterpiece. Whether you enjoy it or not, is a different story. But if you have not yet seen it, whilst you're watching it - consider Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) point of view, and consider how the film expresses it.<br/><br/>There are some brilliant dark films out there - but I consider Se7en to be the darkest (and one of the best) of them all - hence the title of this review, The Prince of Darkness."
"gm311-1","Null","1","1","9 June 2004"," Poignant social comment via the medium of film
","Overall, Seven is an excellent film. It is highly enjoyable in the sublime sense, in that despite being a film of great darkness combined with graphic depictions of murder, there is in fact a very poignant social comment at the end that arises from it all. The central underlying theme of the film is how society seems to turn a blind eye to the seven deadly sins it commits on a daily basis, and how a highly intelligent serial killer commits a series of brutal murders to expose this and voice his discontent with this matter.<br/><br/>Initially, it starts with a seemingly standard murder mystery type plot, though the brutal ways in which the victims are murdered is quite unprecedented in a film of this genre, and the production design also gives the film a certain historic/period atmosphere which aids in setting itself apart from the norm.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, each murder appears to get more gruesome and horrible than the one before. At times during the first one and half hours of the film then the pace gets a little slow, although this in fact can be seen as a build up towards what becomes one of the greatest endings in film history.<br/><br/>The most poignant part of the film occurs when Jon Doe is explaining the rationale behind his murder 'masterpiece' to the two detectives whilst in the car near the end. He explains that he was chosen to commit this crime (even though Somerset replies that this would fly in the face of martyrdom). He says that he cannot tolerate the fact that deadly sins are committed 'on every street corner' and people just tolerate it and go on living their normal lives. He therefore uses murder as a means of exposing the fact that we live in a society which in fact is sinister, sinful, and 'shitty' as Doe puts it. Here, the dialogue is exquisite, and every word that Doe utters seems to have been carefully thought out by him (the character). He is, as he says, 'knocking society in the face with a sledge hammer' to try and make people aware just how much they are in fact going against the lord and the bible. Doe can therefore be seen as man who wishes to initiate new values in society. He illustrates each of the sins by murdering sinners of each sin e.g.the lawyer who lied to keep rapists and murderers on the street to make lots of money (that's not hugely sympathetic to the law profession, i.e.all lawyers are sinful!!)is an illustration of greed. <br/><br/>The film is therefore a very clever social comment on quite a controversial and difficult matter. As society has become increasingly secularized, to commit a deadly sin is not such a meaningful or 'sinful' thing as it used to be, although in the extreme sense that Doe illustrates it as(e.g. lust's disease spreading whore) such sins (but not necessarily in the biblical sense) are still massively relevant to contemporary society.<br/><br/>Overall, therefore, it has an extremely cleverly thought out plot, superb acting from all the cast, and makes for a very thought-provoking piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10"

","Se7en is your run of the mill detective thriller with a razor sharp and bloody edge, though it is not only the gore that sets this movie apart. With an incredible cast (Morgan Freeman, Brad Pit, Kevin Spacey, Gweneth Paltrow, and R. Lee Emery), a sometimes overly slick but competent director (David Fincher of Fight Club fame), and a smart script by Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm) this movie was a much needed shot in the arm for the genre.<br/><br/>We open on Dectective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) at the scene of a violent crime, this pretty much sets the tone.  Dectective Mills (Brad Pitt) enters and we learn that Somerset is retiring and Mills is his replacement.  This is there ""transition"" period and Mills last week on the job.<br/><br/>
These first few short scences are followed by one of the best opening credit sequeces ever made.<br/><br/>At the scene of another horribly gruesome crime we come across a man who has aparently eaten to death.  When another, equally heinous, crime is linked to the first we realize that there maybe a serial killer on the prowl.  The Race is on.  Can John Doe (Kevin Spacey), our friendly nieghborhood psychopath, be stopped before he kills one person for every deadly sin (of which there are 'Se7en'), will Somerset get is man before he is out to pasture, and is there something more to these killings than at first glance.<br/><br/>I strongly recomend this movie, but only to the not so sqeamish.  With a dark gritty atmosphere and filthy city as the backdrop to the unconscionable actions of mad man, you should not be let down.  This is a highly entertianing film with more than one layer.

","POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS This is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen, though it is not beauty in the traditional sense. It is a dark, bleak portrait of suffering and pain, in a dank, depressing city. Every frame is filled with either despair, or twisted horror. There's a strong Gothic element to the storyline, (which involves the deliciously nasty punishments of several sinners), that you will either embrace wholeheartedly, or reject outright. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both turn in convincing, powerful performances, with the former proving that he's much more than just a pretty face. This film sucks you into it's uniquely dirty world, only relinquishing it's tight hold in a finale that you'll never, ever forget...no matter how much you might want to.

","This is perhaps Fincher's best work to date. The story is flawless mainly because of the realism present in it. The writing is primarily what holds the story together. It goes within the killer's mind to the point where the viewer almost agrees or at least cannot deny, the validity of his arguments. Fincher also does an excellent job to convey the unpleasantness and claustrophobia of a crime scene to the point where the viewer can almost smell the acrid bodies. It takes the suspense genre and redefines the cinematic serial killer with outstanding performances by the whole cast. It is a film that can withstand time and can pertain to any future generation.

","A hard-hitting, noirish movie,, ""Seven"" is a detective horror thriller that contains a pair of typically mis-matched cops as they try to hunt down an elusive serial killer, whose modus operandi is the Seven Deadly Sins......<br/><br/>In an unnamed, rain-drenched hellhole of a city, world-weary Detective Somerset(Morgan Freeman) is about to retire.  But he must spend his last week on the force with a hot-headed rookie, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), as they uncover the killer behind a series of unusual and grisly murders.<br/><br/>Their first case is a grotesquely obese man who has been forced to eat until his stomach bursts.  Their next case is a lawyer who's been forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh.  Somerset deduces the killer is murdering people according to the Seven Deadly Sins.  Little by little, as one murder follows another, the detectives themselves become entrapped in the killer's diabolical plan.<br/><br/>A taut, solid script delivers a fair share of shocks, suspense and a certain amount of gore.  Andrew Kevin Walker also allows his characters to muse on the purpose of life, as well as adding some dark and deeply cynical views on everyday reality.<br/><br/>The film is very well shot, with light and colour being used in particular to accentuate the plot and themes of the film.  A note left behind by the killer at the first murder scene reads: ""Long is the road, and hard, that out of Hell leads up into light.""  This is reflected in the way the murder scenes are set, the first murder being committed in gloomy darkness and the last, and the most shocking, being committed in blinding sunlight.  The cinematography further gives a very bleak view of city life, the streets shown to be grotty, grimy and miserable.<br/><br/>The film's fine technical qualities are supported by some excellent performances.  Brad Pitt is on fine form is the cocksure copper whose impulsiveness becomes his undoing.  By contrast, Morgan Freeman is very restrained, giving a quietly confident performance as the intellectual Somerset.  Kevin Spacey nearly steals the entire film as the killer John Doe.

","Seven is far superior to serial-killer cliches such as Silence of The Lambs. Seven's graphic morbidness only helps exemplify the realities of the situation.

","I remember watching ""Alien 3"" and not being too fond of it.  I was impressed with the overall look of the movie and the darkness of it but it just didn't seem to fit in with the previous two movies.  I remembered the director's name and found myself looking out for more of his work.  I was extremely excited in 1995 when I found out he had directed ""Seven"" since I thought his career had been destroyed by ""Alien 3"".  I was clearly wrong.  I saw ""Seven"" and walked out of the theater not knowing how I felt about the movie.  It stayed with me for a week so I went to see it again.  Brilliant!  Morgan Freeman is so amazing it's painful.  He takes a cop movie cliche (the soon to be retired, embittered cop) and takes it to amazing heights. He allows you to understand his character completely.  A beautiful performance.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically.  Somehow cinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the middle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak.  The dark look of the movie adds to the overall feel of despair.<br/><br/>""Seven"" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning (introducing Freeman's character and Brad Pitt. . .who is really good) and then throws you a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and puts you in the proper frame of mind.<br/><br/>The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing.  If you manage to make it through the scene where the body is discovered (I swear, you can almost smell that apartment!) and the autopsy scene you've already sat through the goriest parts.  This doesn't mean that you can relax, though.<br/><br/>A good job by all involved. We can only hope that David Fincher keeps making movies this disturbing and interesting.  It seems as if he's definitely on to something."

","My favorite thing in film is atmosphere. Once a film has set a tone for its story, I am completely hooked. Seven is a very disturbing film, for some too disturbing. Anyone who has seen Seven though doesn't deny it's ability to leave you with a strange feeling or leave you thinking about it for days afterwards. David Fincher is a very talented director. I thought his Alien 3 film was much more powerful than other people I know and here Fincher shows he has talent. The mood is set from the very beginning, especially the credit sequence. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt become their characters and the film pulls you into its universe. It makes you feel scared, it makes you think. How many films will you see that will make you talk and think in your lifetime. The cinematography by Darius Khondji is amazing and the set design is beautiful. David Fincher has made a very memorable film, one you will never forget."

","Seven is not your standard serial killer on the loose film.  It is a dark, grimy, visceral thriller that chills you to the bone days, months and years after you've seen it.  The crimes that John Doe perpetrates in this film grow more and more atrocious as the film progresses, and we can't help but watch.  It's a glimpse into ourselves.  We find these events horrible, but at the same time we wonder what could push someone to acts such as these? That's where Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman come in.  They provide the questions that we as an audience are afraid to ask.  They doggedly pursue the killer in an attempt to stop him.  The film ratchets up the tension and only in the final act of the film do we meet John Doe.  Kevin Spacey is absolutely chilling.  So calm, so cold and so damn intelligent.  The ending knocked me out."

"therickster-2","10","1","1","29 March 2001"," Fincher's finest hour
","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>""These days you can't just tap people on the shoulder. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer. That way you can be sure you have their complete attention.""<br/><br/>This quote essentially defines an incredible movie. From the outset, David Fincher ensures the audience knows this is not going to be an easy film to watch. The relentless torrents of rain, bleak and depressing locations and the consistent use of funeral-style attire maintain the very visual sense of foreboding and dread throughout.<br/><br/>First, a basic outlay. The film centres on two stereotypical police officers. One, a young rookie by the name of Mills (Brad Pitt), has been transferred (at his request) to the dark, unnamed city in which the story takes place. The other is veteran detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a veteran cop is due to retire in seven days (obviously an attempt at either continuity within the film or a 'red herring' as to it's real content). For his last week, Somerset is partnered with Mills, and it's not before long that they stumble upon a gruesome murder, wherein an obese man appears to have eaten until he physically burst. Initially Somerset wants nothing to do with the case, but certain clues convert his theory to believe that this murder is not as 'cut and dry' as it seems to be, leaving him a final case to solve before he puts his career to rest. After a breakthrough via somewhat illegitimate methods, the two detectives push closer to their potential killer. More murders ensue until the film nears its climax with a simply unforgettable collision of events.<br/><br/>The acting is clearly worthy of note. Before watching the film this reviewer was perfectly aware of Brad Pitt's 'pretty boy' image. Well all I can say is that Pitt was perfectly cast (in the role that may well have pushed his career into the ¬ëA' list) as David Mills. His good looks and somewhat cocky attitude did him huge favours when portraying a character in need of every one of these assets. Mills' arrogance as a character lights up his inexperience as a cop like a neon beam in the city's own dark alleyways.<br/><br/>Freeman is superb as always, confirming the theory that great actors don't need words to act. An example I have seen frequently used is the scene where Mills and Somerset discover the first victim. Mills, full of enthusiasm for his first case proudly declares ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide."" At this point Somerset turns to face his partner and raises his eyebrows a millimetre. It's not much, but this simple gesture says more than most actors can from a page of dialogue. Some people question the validity of his continuously calm attitude in even the films most horrible of situations. My answer to that is simply this - he has been doing this job for so long that nothing has the power to shock him any more. It is like his senses have been numbed to the horror around him simply because he has been dealing with these atrocities for so long. Even so, the case does affect him in ways, most clearly in the films 'final showdown' but throughout as well. For example there is a scene where Somerset cannot sleep for noises of displeasure outside his window. Symbolically these noises also represent the effects of the outside world on Somerset's mentality - sometimes he cannot sleep as a result of it.<br/><br/>Finally Kevin Spacey must be credited (though he isn't in the title sequence) for turning in a truly electrifying performance. Surely if Morgan Freeman is one of today's best actors, then Spacey is one of tomorrow's. His portrayal of 'John Doe' is the most brutally honest and terrifying portrayal of a serial killer ever (yes, including Hannibal Lecter).. There are many comparisons. Both are clearly intelligent men, both have an exterior which suggests a physical inferiority and both are seriously disturbed. The reason I find Spacey's 'Doe' more threatening however, is due to the seemingly relentless pursuit of his beliefs. Whereas Lecter had other interests, 'John Doe' seems hell-bent on performing the mission he has set out to achieve, and his determination makes him that much more terrifying.<br/><br/>In my opinion David Fincher's 'Se7en' is one of the best films I have ever had the privilege of viewing. It's script (By Andrew Kevin Walker) and direction perfectly complement the film¬πs dark and dreary tones, while the score ensures every moment of music is a subtle layer on the movies overall effect. If you watch 'Se7en' and hate it, watch it again. Many people I know watched it and thought it too depressing, too terrifying and generally ¬ëtoo much¬π. I plead to these people, watch the movie again. Perhaps it is because you are more prepared for the events that occur the second time round, though I guarantee the film will shock you just as much, no matter how many times you see it.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","""There are seven deadly sins captain, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust and envy. Seven.""<br/><br/>A killer is on the loose in the Unnamed City and they are using the seven deadly sins as their MO. Two cops are assigned to investigate, Sommerset a world weary cop, soon to retire, and Mills an experienced investigator, but new to this city and its ways. Its an old combo, but Fincher makes it work, and work well.<br/><br/>Pitt in my opinion is at his best here. He portrays a very believable cop (at least in my experience) dedicated and not too cultured. Freeman, while playing the intellectual-about-to-retire cop Sommerset, brings forth great presence to the movie, the calm ying to Mills raging yang (or is it the other way round?)<br/><br/>Some of the most disturbing aspects of this movie, are not those which we see, but those which we are left to think about. The killer's reasoning behind the murders almost makes it justified, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of all.<br/><br/>The action sequences are all realistic and believable(well, as good as it gets in Hollywood anyway). The constant rain, the dilapidated sets, unique camera angles, innovative film processing and a oppressive soundtrack make Se7en a complete indulgence of the senses.<br/><br/>As for the ending, it has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>This movie will scar, but then, isn't that what good thrillers do?"
"Rammstein-2","10","1","1","10 January 2000"," Wonderful darkness
","Dark, evil tale of a killer using the 7 deadly sins as grounds. The cops on his tail are always one step behind and get to witness the unbelievable cruelty that the murderer has inflicted upon his victims. No compromise: this is the most evocative film to appear in recent years, and I bet the ending had Andrew Kevin Walker bouncing up and down shouting: ""I'm the king of the world"" too. Fantastic."
"Andrew-162","7","1","1","16 November 1999"," Wonderful movie, just one notch short of a classic.
","Se7en is a very excellent movie. The cinematography is outstanding, and combined with the production design it creates an extremely dark and bleak village (I don't believe they identified it). The screenplay is intelligently written, the direction is well done also. Though Brad Pitt, who to this date I have seen him act well only once (12 Monkeys), is not very convincing as detective David Mills, it doesn't really matter. Morgan Freeman is incredible as always, playing his calm, cool and wise character he has mastered in every way. Kevin Spacey is breathtaking in his small but pivotal role. He does his best supporting work ever here, he was only better in The Usual Suspects, and possibly L.A. Confidential.<br/><br/>       The film starts out on a crime scene, where we are introduced to detective Mills (Pitt) and Somerset (Freeman). They talk, and we learn that Mills is new in the force, and that Somerset is a veteran that is retiring within the week. They don't get along well, and when they find a mysterious murder (an overweight man was forced to eat spaghetti until he burst, and the word gluttony is found written in grease on the wall) Somerset suggests he be moved to a different case as well as Mills. This is denied, of course. The 2 find a couple other murders with words written bizzarely on the walls or the floor, and they deduce that the murders are linked to a serial killer who kills according to the seven deadly sins.        Though I saw the censored version on ABC and probably didn't get the full effect of the movie, I still think I have a pretty good idea of the movie's quality. It's brilliant.        So then why is this movie only a 3 out of 4? There are missing links to the story, and sometimes there is too much relying on suspension of belief. However, you must see this movie, if not just for the last 20 minutes where we finally meet John Doe, the man behind the killings who to the amazement of Mills and Somerset hands himself in and volunteers to give a full signed confession to all of the crimes. The catch? To take Mills and Somerset, alone, to the scenes of the last 2 ""killings""......."

"Duey","Null","1","1","13 July 1999"," A disturbing and brilliant film
","Few films genuinely shock me nowadays, but this did. It is horrible yet fascinating, it fulfills the morbid curiosity which is in us all whether we want to admit it or not. There have been other films about serial killers but none as desperate or dark as this masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is the unrelenting mental will of Spacey's character that chilled me the most. His utter insanity was matched only by his ingenuity and discipline. His character is one of the most truly evil in film history, forget hannibal lecter !<br/><br/>The whole film is brilliantly made, the performances are great, even from Brad Pitt, and the atmosphere is wonderfully set, but there are two particular things which, for me, set this movie apart.<br/><br/>The first is the way in which the city setting they are in is every bit as all consuming and intimdating as Spacey's character. People are swallowed up and spat out in this world, no one counts. It reminded me very much of an Alan Moore graphic novel called 'Watchmen' in which a character called Rorschach becomes a vigilante to clean the streets of the 'scum'. Spacey's character is somewhat like this striving to show people the evil that surrounds them. The irony is that his methods are wholely more evil than anything he wishes to illustrate.<br/><br/>The second is the ending. Never has there been an ending like it to my knowledge. It is hard to describe how it makes you feel. There is no way he can lose, you feel cheated whilst still appreciating the cleverness of the manufactured situation. It leaves you with nothing exactly reflecting how Brad Pitt's charcter must feel at this moment. The film leaves you bewildered and mentally fatigued.<br/><br/>However the perfectly handled ,and completely unique,  ending completes an awesome film.It is very downbeat and critical of humanity, Morgan freeman's character re inforces this in his final line, but there was a place for a film such as this and Se7en filled it."
"Perini","7","1","1","28 June 1999"," Successful for genre, but then again...
","My approach to Seven was one of low expectations.  Based on the stylistic opening credits, I was expecting to be assaulted with low-angle extreme closeup murky cinematography designed to capitalize on human reflex. American film has been thwarted with bad technique in the suspense/mystery genre.  Instead of style and creativity, many directors have opted for the ole standby of loud unexpected noises/music followed by the alerting appearance of the villain.  Snore...However, such is not the case with David Fincher's Seven.  The style of Seven is fairly straightforward for the first seventy minutes of the film:  What you see is what you get. Unapologetically grotesque images from the crime scenes of a serial murder and a flood of rain in a dingy, dirty-textured metropolitan city.  The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it was plenty enough to keep you interested in learning about the murderer.  However, the main characters could not have been more contrived.  Morgan Freeman's character, Detective Summerset, was catatonic to the point of being convincingly dull.  The writer went for the starkest contrast with the character Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) by giving him the playground mentality of hockey player turned homicide detective.  The results were destructive to the film's effect. In the end, Mills and Summerset do their best to ruin the audience's interest in their involvement.  Gwynneth Paltrow would receive mention if her character weren't a mere fixture within a plot.  The characters just didn't help this film at all.  It was one of those all too often cases where the actors look the part but the part is badly written =(  However, much to the credit of the production designer and cinematographer, the mood of this film was still very effective.  There was however one other regrettable inconsistency:  For the first seventy minutes or so of the film, the audience forcably endures the foul, wet and lonely darkness of the city environment only to have the rug pulled out in the closing moments when the setting changes to a sun-bleached desert scape.  Hmmm...7 out of 10?"

His bloated, decaying corpse has been there for awhile, with roaches and other vermin crawling all over the place. If this grosses you out, don't expect things to get much better, for this flick is nothing if not a first class gross-out. While there are a few elements of some interest, such as the sequence where annoying and mouthy Detective Mills (Pitt) attempts to run down the serial killer, or veteran actor Morgan Freeman's downbeat interpretation of the jaded detective, the movie is otherwise sadly lacking in redeeming value.

She was obviously just like one of those ""Red Shirts"" that occasionally show up in Star Trek: Destined to bite the dust. As one other reviewer put it, GP was a mere ""plot point"". It was painful to watch, frankly.

Many other movies which feature such a terrifying antagonist are often really hard to watch, but here the film works as a blockbuster still. David Fincher's direction is flawless, the cinematography is amazing and the city in which the film takes place is a truly disturbing environment. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are outstanding (Even Gwyneth Paltrow is quite good here) and their characters feel like humans, not just like actors. This is first and foremost a study of evil, but it doesn't shove its themes down our throats.

","Those who try to punish Sinners are not Saints either of course. The movie who was showing people things that are going wrong with our society, is a showcase of Brad Pitt.

But it's the mystery surrounding the who is behind it all.<br/><br/>The journey we take, with a conclusion that will leave you devastated (even those who knew or were able to see where it was going) to say the least. Fincher is showing he knows how to direct, edit and set the mood for a film. This is as assured as it gets and one of the best thrillers the 90s produced for the movie business.

"The Grand Master","10","2","4","18 March 2015"," One of the best thrillers of all time with a shocking ending that will smack you in the face.
","Se7en (also known as Seven) is one of the best thrillers that everyone still talks about. It's certainly not a clich√©d movie nor does it use a recycled plot. It is well written with an original plot and the cast is brilliant. The entire movie is suspenseful and dark with its shock value added to keep audiences engaged. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley and Kevin Spacey are excellent.<br/><br/>Set in an unnamed city which rains for most of the movie, Se7en is about a serial killer who's M.O. is based around the seven deadly sins. The seven deadly sins are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Morgan Freeman is Detective Lieutenant William Somerset, a worn out homicide detective on the verge on retirement. Somerset is partnered with newly transferred Detective David Mills played by Brad Pitt, an idealistic yet brash and hot headed police detective. Somerset and Mills are tasked with the investigation as the gruesome murders pile up one at a time. The serial killer who calls himself John Doe, played by Kevin Spacey, leaves inconspicuous clues on the next victim as well as his identity. Meanwhile David Mills' wife Tracy is unhappy with the move to the city and confides to Somerset that she is miserable here. Somerset and Mills must race against time to find John Doe as well as any further victims.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt shows that he is a versatile actor and not just a pretty face as the brash Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is tailor made as the world weary Detective Lieutenant William Somerset who wants to solve this case before his retirement. Gwyneth Paltrow makes her mark as David's wife Tracy, who reluctantly agrees to transfer to the city with her husband. Kevin Spacey is chilling as the calculating John Doe. Kevin Spacey's John Doe earns a spot as one of the best villains of all time. R. Lee Ermey, famous for his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, does a good job as the unnamed Police Captain. John C. McGinley also does a good job as the hard charging SWAT Team Leader California.<br/><br/>Se7en is notable for putting director David Fincher on the map, making critics and audiences stand up and take notice that he is a force to be reckoned with. After his disastrous debut with Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher does a brilliant job with Se7en. David Fincher would later go on and direct further movies that would cement his reputation as a brilliant director with movies such as The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and Gone Girl (2014). David Fincher, along with writer Andrew Kevin Walker and cinematographer Darius Khondji should be commended on a job well done for bringing to the screen a dark, gratuitous and grim thriller. The entire movie does not let up for one moment, and the shocking ending just smacks you in the face. The best part is that the ending is unexpected and NOBODY could tell you that they saw it coming. If anyone says that they could see it coming, they are full of it. The shocking ending in Se7en is one that will stay with you for days, and it certainly did when I first saw it many years ago.<br/><br/>Although Se7en is a grisly and gory movie that is certainly not for the faint hearted, it rightfully earns its spot as one of the best thrillers of all time, and definitely one of the most popular movies of the 1990's.<br/><br/>10/10."

The film itself led me on to become a fan of the Saw films, and any other films with the kind of twisted sordid story lines in which Se7en started, it really did start a massive trend in that kind of genre. Excellent cast and was hooked from the minute i started watching it. The story gets me every time, which allows me to re watch again and again, thats rare with a film. Was surprised they never did a sequel, shame as there was so much this story could grow in to.

I myself am a fan of the gritty cop type movies as well as the suspenseful serial killer movies. this movie gives a nice look into the seven deadly sins and their viewpoint onto how everyone should look into their own lives and see where they fall in amongst the big 7. towards the end you start to see the mindset of Pitt when all the wants to do is catch this killer in his now damn the laws damn the rules thought process and just wanting this person caught. the end is messed up but the ideology and Pitt and the killer having a sort of symbiotic relationship makes it an interesting movie."

","Watched in film studies; loved the plot, liked the characters apart from the barely there wife. I mean, come on, they gave everyone else a personality... Morgan freeman was absolutely wonderful, and this film makes his current typecasting painful; with the depth and range of his performance. Brad Pitt did a good, but not remarkable job as well. The villain, John Doe, of course stole the show; and every single death was an exhibitionist delight to watch, gripping the part of you that likes to be disturbed by the throat, refusing to let go. The visuals were lavishly disturbing and the soundtrack worked wonderfully - however, the last death(s) was bloody obvious, and this was hell to watch for someone who thinks of herself as squeamish. I managed to man up and watch every death scene apart from the last one; in which the film turned into a radio programme instead and I was intensely fascinated with the minutiae of the floor."

","I had Just watched Se7ven recently, and it honestly was one of the most fascinating films i have watched in a while. Se7ven was on my Netflix watch list for quite a while and i kept holding it off for the appropriate time. When it comes to choosing a movie for me I like to get a sense if the movie is a unique/special film. Well let me be the first to say this film was special, during the movie you get a sense human nature and interaction. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey all play very fitting characters for each of their acting styles. Brad Pitt plays a rookie police detective new to a crime written city who's personality is very cavalier and inpatient. Where on the other hand Morgan Freemen plays a veteran detective that has worked in the city for years and whom is rational. Both detectives together take on a reoccurring homicide cases in which is m/o is discovered to be the Seven Deadly Sins. They come close to finding the killer after the first five deadly sins and run into the believed murderer, which turns into a chase-down/shootout. After the incident, while still trying to catch the murderer with no luck a twist of fate happens. Kevin Spacey/the murderer turns himself into the prescient confessing to the murders. Kevin Spacey plays a extremely intellectual and mysterious person. After questioning him, the detectives believe their is a reason why he turned himself in. After a brief conversation, the killer/John Doe agrees to confess to all murders and to lead the police to where the last victims are. But the killer has a stipulation which is that only the two detectives shall go with him directly to find the victims. After agreeing the detectives proceed, with a long integrating conversation on the ride there between the detectives and the killer. After arriving the killer keeps saying how it will arrive soon and asks for the time. Eventually a package comes sent by a delivery person with a box intended for Brad Pit's character, in the box is the detectives wife severed head whom was also pregnant. The killer does this to peruse the seven deadly sins, which in his cases would be envy because he is jealous of Brad Pitts life. After Brad Pit's character realizes this he is overwhelmed with emotion has an ultimatum to face, either kill the murderer and be committed of the last deadly sin which is wrath and jeopardize his life and career or let the murderer live and be dealt with thorough the Justice system. As Morgan Freeman,s character basically puts it ""if you kill him he will win the game and succeed in his mission"". Brad Pitt ignores this and unloads the pistol, killing the murderer."
"JeromeGrosen","Null","2","4","15 November 2014"," What the heck?
","This movie is filled with ridiculous references to Catholicism. I remember watching it as a teenager and I completely did not notice it at the time. This is a sick movie (on so many levels) and I am not just talking about the gore.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow's character wants to abort her unborn baby. She doesn't like the violent city (New York) she and her husband have moved to; and is worried about raising their child in that city. What a good reason to have an abortion! Morgan Freeman's character talks her out of it. Apparently, Morgan's character convinced his wife to have an abortion and ""later regretted it"".<br/><br/>The decision by Paltrow's character ends up being a mistake, because she (and her baby) are gruesomely murdered at the end of the movie. But this is only the beginning of the Catholic-related absurdity...<br/><br/>The killer in this movie is a crazed Catholic, who decides to gruesomely kill and torture seven people after reading a book by St. Thomas Aquinas; one of the most gentle and brilliant men who ever lived. This includes - ironically - the unborn baby mentioned previously.<br/><br/>This is a sick movie made by a director who - for some reason - felt the need to insult the Catholic Church. He must have been schooled by Scorsese."

","""Se7en"" ... do I really need to go over the plot? Seven deadly sins: each murder victim a perpetrator of one of the sins.<br/><br/>I guess this is a clever plot device but really ... why not go after pedophiles and rapists? Let's murder someone for being a little lazy but go forth and be free evil pedo. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt; detectives picking over each crime scene and chasing the serial killer (Kevin Spacey). Gwyneth Paltrow is the meek and dependent wife of Brad Pitt's character unhappy with the move to the city she and her husband have made.<br/><br/>I remember this back in 1995; setting new standards for on-screen goriness but to me it crossed a line into being gratuitous. The Gwyneth Paltrow character in my opinion was so obvious she may as well have been wearing a target the whole time. I remember thinking this early on as I saw it in the cinema back in '95.<br/><br/>Okay so enough has been said about this one over the years. I'll get to my point.<br/><br/>Six of the victims were gruesomely murdered by the serial killer based on a sin he saw them perpetrate. Greedy guy is made to eat to death, slothful guy is rendered immobile, etcetera, etcetera.<br/><br/>*SPOILER*<br/><br/>So the killer rigs things up so that he is killed for the sin of envy, having harassed and killed the obvious target (Paltrow). So target lady's husband kills the murderer (envy ticked off the list).<br/><br/>However at the same time in shooting the serial killer Pitt's character becomes wrath. Just a simple observation but every other sin was punishable by death except this one?<br/><br/>And isn't ""wrath"" more of a seething anger spanning a great amount of time? Here it was an instant knee-jerk reaction. It was instant retribution, not ""wrath"" as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>He probably should have shot him in the balls or something to foil the plot. Instead the serial killer is given satisfaction.<br/><br/>And Target - sorry - Paltrow was murdered ... what was her sin? See, major plot holes. It doesn't stand up.<br/><br/>It is okay, just illogical and dreary and overrated."

"danamadeus","Null","2","4","4 July 2013"," Haunting and visually poetic
","I'm a little late to the party with Se7en, as I first watched it just this year. One of those things where it's been in the queue forever and I'm slowly working my way through. Anyhow as a result of my procrastination, my ""experience"" of the film was slightly desecrated, but my appreciation was not. I realized just before I reached the massive twist of the film that I saw what was coming. I don't even remember who spoiled it for me...but oh well.<br/><br/>The only reason I address this is the final scene of the film is by far the most talked-about aspect of the film...by FAR. And I didn't think it was greatest final act shake-up I've seen, but the movie itself is incredible. <br/><br/>My favorite part of Se7en is it's stylishness. David Fincher delivers a beautifully noir aesthetic to the piece that colors the entire story. And my other favorite thing about Seven is the surreality of the nameless, ever-raining, Gotham-like, hellhole city where our mystery unfolds. I cannot overstate how much I love that story-telling choice. It gives the film an immeasurable sense of dread and intrigue. Aesthetically, simply a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Se7en's other major strength it its leads. The script doesn't over-talk anything; it's economical and concise, but provides just enough chemistry for it's protagonists to make this ""buddy cop"" film stand out. Pitt and Freeman turn in some of their most thoughtful work and play excellently off one another. It's a character piece that succeeds without dwelling too long on exposition or any forced ""bonding"". Their relationship develops naturally, and in the face of abject psychological chaos, calm moments are brief and rare. <br/><br/>I suppose it would be unfair to not mention Seven's creatively macabre components as well. I realize I didn't include a synopsis, but if you haven't already heard it 100 times from cinephiles and review sites, I'm sure it's somewhere on this page. The killer in Seven patterns takes inspiration for his murderous work of art from the seven deadly sins, and dispatches his victims in accordance with said sins. But the bizarre and disturbing, (albeit not explicit) murders are still a means to an end. The film's really about the tone, characters, and noir feel. 8.1/10"
"donuthaters12","10","2","4","1 July 2013"," Dark but a thrilling ride
","Major spoilers below.....<br/><br/>Have we all gotten so used to it that we have become naive? Se7en is David Fincher's second film, after his under appreciated take on the Alien franchise. This is a film I have watched when I was around 14 and I thought it was excellent, does it hold up now that I am more mature and I have a better understanding of how things work? Definitely.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay was written by Andrew Kevin Walker and honestly I have no idea what other films he has done aside from 8MM, and I haven't even seen that film yet. So I came into this thinking whether I would still be excited and thrilled in my second viewing. I was not as surprised or excited this time as I knew the major twist and the events leading up towards it. Back then, I only really viewed the surface of the film and in subsequent viewing, I discovered the depth of this film and this depth is the reason I remained hooked until the end. The story is an up and coming detective who got transferred to this city where crime is apparent and is hoping to be involved in bigger and more serious cases. He is then paired with a soon to be retired detective to solve a case of murders relating to the seven deadly sins. The screenplay really speaks the abundance and triviality of sin that litters the streets. It gives us these two characters that clearly represents the sins and virtues in Catholicism. David Mills' character clearly represents a person who is among the people who falls within sin and yet we root for the guy. The character Mills throughout the film has fallen within the seven sins that John Doe is trying to show, either done subtly or obviously. William Somerset on the other hand represents the virtues that counter acts sin. I see this film as a character driven film, you follow both these two detectives to a definitive ending that will not only entertain the audience but also get them thinking. Thematically deep but also a surprising thriller.<br/><br/>This was my first David Fincher, and in my first viewing I found the film to be unsettling due to the themes and tone, granted I was also 14 who loved light and heart-warming films, but as I have gotten older and mature I have become a little more stoic and have gained an interest in cinema. With this interest, I have started to explore different films and such, then I got to a point where I watched a few under Fincher's direction and started to enjoy them, especially Fight Club and Alien 3, so I decided to watch Se7en again and started to understand his ability as a filmmaker. Se7en is definitely a dark film but this was coming off the heels of Alien 3, which was also a depressing turn to the Alien saga, so it wasn't much of a big change but his direction in this feature was much more controlled and understood. He definitely knew what he wanted to do with this film and knew what he wanted to convey to the audience. Fincher's confidence here is not something that is found in his later acclaimed films but he did enough to convince me in his sophomore attempt.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the other films that Darius Khondji have worked in but his photography here is definitely moody. It's appropriate and unsettling. The tone is the major thing I picked up on his photography and it was definitely supported with dominating shadows, icy cold colors, and the overpouring rain. This tone and darkness is something I don't find in a Fincher film until The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>Pulsing drums and deep horns fill the score by Howard Shore. It aided, especially in the third act, in creating that thrilling atmosphere with the rising tension that constantly grasps the audience. I am familiar with Shore's work, notably The Lord of the Rings, The Aviator and Hugo, so I had a bit of expectation for his take on this film. It was great and can't think of anything that would improve it.<br/><br/>The film moves in such a pace that doesn't feel rushed. It takes its time with its character development and tension building. The third act is definitely the Coup de Grace as it fantastically grips us as it leads to the conclusion that will have you shocked and amazed.<br/><br/>As this film, to me, was character driven, it had to have actors who can give great performances. Both Pitt and Freeman give their all and have successfully stamped and defined their characters. Pitt, though, is the one I have to give more props to as he played a role that was sympathised but also unlikable. The supporting cast is underplayed to dominate the presence of these two leads but their performances were great.<br/><br/>The film has some dark themes and is very unsettling at times but should not be dismissed as it is also an entertaining piece of work and definitely a notable effort in Fincher's catalog."
"AMar_rom","Null","2","4","29 June 2013"," Style wins over substance but that's OK. This is a great film.
","Se7en has a lot of things going for it: A talented director and two among the best American actors of the past 20 years (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, the second at the start of his career). Furthermore, the plot is interesting enough: two detectives (Somerset and Mills) the first just before retirement with his much younger colleague try to resolve a number of murders perpetrated by a serial killer somewhere in a north American city (looks like Philadelphia but could be Chicago, it does not matter).<br/><br/>I think the strength of the movie lies with the interaction of these two characters who are so different from each other and see their job from very different perspective. Both are very good professionals but Mills is more ambitious and sees the murders as a puzzle to be solved and does not spend much time trying to understand the killer's motivations and mindset. Whereas Somerset is more resigned and perhaps pessimistic about the efficiency of the police force to fight and contain the evil of the serial killer and the crime in a big metropolitan city like the one the action takes place.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought that the movie tried to impose a visual style, e.g. the way of showing detailed images of crimes and human depravity and torture that made me feel uncomfortable at times. If the director's message is that crime is bad because it looks 'bad' visually then I have some reservations."
"AbhiMathews","10","2","4","23 June 2013"," A Different Story
","It is seldom that a movie with such an eerie mood can continue with a continuously building story line and characters who are so dynamic. Modernism and beliefs lie at the heart of the movie, and Se7en does an exceptional job in executing a great plot with even better acting.<br/><br/>Most actors would not be capable of filling the roles of two detectives in such a morbid case. The stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt act wonderfully in their respective roles, and manage to remain in character and evolve throughout the film. Being initially introduced to the two men, both at different stages of life, viewers begin this exhausting journey which neither characters are prepared for. <br/><br/>With superb performances, underlying themes and a carefully manipulated script, Se7en truly does succeed in encompassing the qualities every great movie should. The numerous connections to religious and social affiliations offer a different view of the world, and share the side of things most do not see. Although the acts displayed are corrupt, which is a purely subjective topic, insights into the mind of a killer offer this movie a trait most lack - perspective. <br/><br/>The brilliantly written script, including fabrications many people would never even contemplate, puts Se7en on a new pedestal. This thought-provoking thriller is one for the ages, and is one that I highly recommend."
"charlikempson","10","2","4","12 June 2013"," The perfect film
","Se7en is, for me, not only the best crime thriller I have ever seen, but the best film I have ever seen as well. The acting is first class, with Will Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt), providing perfect foils for each other, whilst still maintaining a believable relationship. Kevin Spacey is spectacular as John Doe. The city, constantly drenched in rain, is mysterious and gloomy, providing the perfect setting. The idea of a killer using the 7 deadly sins as his MO is original and harrowing, and it all falls into place perfectly. <br/><br/>I'm a big advocate of films that don't have happy endings, and Se7en fulfills that part of me marvelously, as, whilst Doe is killed, that is what he wanted to happen the whole time, causing Mills to complete Doe's puzzle, as he became wrath. <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey deserves a mention entirely separate from the rest of the review, as he depiction of John Doe is the best of a psychopathic killer that I have ever seen anywhere. Despite the fact that he only appears towards the end of the film, we are constantly shown the results of his handiwork and this creates a huge amount of tension for the moment we finally meet him.<br/><br/>All in all, the acting, plot, setting and payoff in this film is spectacular. My favourite film of all time."

","SEVEN was one of that rare handful of movies that didn't punk out in the end- it followed through, all the way to its bitter end, and was rightfully hailed as a modern masterpiece for having done so. From top to bottom, SEVEN delivered. I happened to be working at a video store (which, for lack of a more appropriate name, I'll call Lackluster) and I heartily recommended SEVEN to those browsing for a weekend's diversion. Alongside me at Lackluster worked a beautiful young blonde who eventually came to like me (naturally). She asked me one evening what I wanted for my upcoming birthday. Being a bit of a wise-ass, I replied that what I really wanted, more than anything, was a human skull to display on my mantle (which I didn't even have). The next thing I knew, she brought a battered cardboard box into Lackluster and laid it before me. ""Happy birthday,"" she said, and walked away. I looked at the box, which was fairly heavy (I hefted it), and I noticed that there were dead WEEDS sticking out of it. I stuck my courage to the sticking place and opened the box. Inside was a human skull. A hole in the top of the skull revealed an empty brain cavity; the INSIDE of the brain cavity was lined with criss-crossing red and blue veins. I politely thanked the girl for such a thoughtful gift and declined it. She left with the box that night and I never saw it again- but, the very next day, a news item caught my attention: a local graveyard had been ""vandalized"" the night before and ""one of the graves had been desecrated."" There were no details, but I'd wager that the desecration involved the removal of a corpse's head. Just goes to show you: be careful what you ask for..."

","Ever seen hell on earth? Probably not. David Fincher shows the closest thing you shall ever see with his depiction of a story of a serial killer meting out punishments to the people committing the seven deadly sins within an anonymous American city with its perpetual silvery rain, the scantiness of light and the constant depressing atmosphere that lurks over your shoulder all the time with an air of melancholy all around. This movie makes for a gory, gloomy and an uncomfortable watch but mind you the mystery is ever so riveting that it keeps you glued to the edge of your seats till the very end. David Fincher, Andrew Walker and Darius Khondji have created such a masterpiece that this movie can rightly be called as the worthy successor to the ""Silence of the lambs"" in regards to the serial killer genre. The movie has a neo noir feel due to the scant usage of light and the constant rains in this unnamed anonymous city. The storyline goes into a realm of its own, where a serial killer is on a carefully planned elaborate spree that dwells into an analysis of a mad man's mind who is convinced that he has been sent on this earth to bring to the attention to the common people that all they have been doing on this earth is sins , and the way he chooses to catch the attention of the commoners is by punishing the sinners in ways he feels fit. Morgan Freeman plays William Somerset a veteran soon-to-retire detective with his partner David Mills being the idealistic but rash rookie played by Brad Pitt. They meet up on a site of a murder scene, a pictorial description of which may force many of us to throw up, and then from there on unfolds a saga consisting of crime unimaginable and so gory that to say it is savagery would be an understatement. The detectives get embroiled in the case and each day brings to them crimes of such barbarity that makes you think of the killer as an equivalent to Satan himself. First comes Gluttony with an obese man forced to feed until he bursts. Second is greed with a lawyer forced to exact a pound of flesh from his own body. Third is Sloth with a drug addict tied to his bed for over a year. Fourth in line is Lust with a hooker brutally murdered while being involved in the act. Fifth in the cycle is Pride with what seems to be an actress who has been horribly disfigured and is given a choice to call for help and live a life with the mutilation or to commit suicide thus saving grace. And the last two sins Envy and Wrath make up for the most exciting ending to a story I have seen in my life. The brutality of the punishments captured on screen, (dare I say) in my opinion could have only been done by Fincher and Tarantino, which each murder scene being exponentially more brutal than the previous. The background score is so perfect in maintaining the horrific atmosphere that it's a compliment to the work Howard Shore himself has done over the years , the diversity of work he has done made him the perfect choice for the composer of such a film. The acting by the leads Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey only consolidates the class in which they stand, amongst the greatest of our times. All in all, this movie is classic modern horror with a twist/finale to die for. The movie, from the sensory assaulting title sequence to the nerve wracking finale goes for your gut and makes you feed on it all the while constantly gnawing on your brain until you give up and starting believing that the place you live in is truly an infernal cesspool. This movie leaves you reeling, emotionally and mentally and you have a feeling of having been robbed of mental peace. I leave you with this advice - Try not to expect it to be a comfortable viewing."

","Sin: 1-transgression of divine law; <br/><br/>2-any act Regarded to such a transgression, especially the willful or deliberate violation of some religious or moral principle; <br/><br/>3-to commit a sinful act. The Sins began the film and led to the end,but it was no sin making this film.<br/><br/>""Se7en"", as you can see, it is about the seven deadly sins: Gluttony; Greed; Sloth; Lust; Pride or Vanity; Envy; Wrath. It all starts when the veteran Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the rookie detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are both faced with a line of murders, and every death there is a message written with one of the deadly sins. They begin to notice that the killer, who later discover is called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) uses all sins for a different kind of murder. Soon both detectives begin a long study and research behind the insane psychopath who will later lead them to an unexpected end.<br/><br/>With ""Se7en"" David Fincher showed the fantastic director that he can be. He went from hated (thanks to ""Alien 3"") to a true filmmaker giving a spectacular direction. Each scene is shot accurately making the film more tense and the investigation more thrilling. But it also gives credits to Andrew Kevin Walker (screenplay) with a superb writing delivering dialogs very well written and developed, and an insane study in each of the sins, but even with the gloomy environment, the movie manages to have humor that pretty much serves to calm the frantic pace.<br/><br/>The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman superb as always; Brad Pitt once again great; but who stands out is Kevin Spacey, after his appearance everything in the film seems to have a relapse, the suspense increases, the atmosphere darkens, all thanks to its whimsical and cultured expression of ""serial killer"".<br/><br/>An electrifying thriller, well directed and written, loaded with stunning performances, leading to an unexpected ending. ""Se7en"" is the film that brought David Fincher to filmmaking life and to the world his fantastic films."
"lagudafuad","7","2","4","14 May 2013"," A wonderful thriller
","There is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way Se7en did. Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, were also onboard in this thriller.<br/><br/>Seven features the newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the soon to retire William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.<br/><br/>The movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by Se7en and it is a most see in many levels. The thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. Seven became the first of 3 films that director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were The Fight Club (1999) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).<br/><br/>The movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. Andrew Kevin Walker received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing. Seven won the MTV movie award as the best film in its year.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down Kevin Spacey, then make time to see this movie again.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"rebeccahamel_usa","9","2","4","24 March 2013"," A classic that every fan of the genre MUST see
","This movie is one of the best thrillers ever made, in my opinion. It is my favorite together with Silence of the Lambs. The actors are great. I kind of guessed the ending before it actually took place, but it was very fitting to the whole movie. The idea to base the murders on the 7 deadly sins is very interesting. The whole plot makes sense and is well-done. I read that some viewers found it disturbing, which is true, it is NOT a movie for kids. But I wouldn't call this movie particularly graphic or scary. It is right in the middle, suspense and action but no bloody gore or ""shock just to shock"" mentality. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes good thrillers!!"
"The-Sarkologist","9","2","4","16 November 2012"," For the wages of sin is death ...
","'For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord' Romans 6:23.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie before and I knew that this was a good movie but I did not realise how good it was until I watched it again recently, and it is not just the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey, that make this movie brilliant. In fact, just because you load up a movie with talented actors does not mean that the movie itself will be any good, but rather the it is essence and soul of the movie that will inevitability make it stand out from the many other offerings that we are bombarded with on an almost weekly basis.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a city, and it could be any city. Some people have tried to determine what it is but it is clear that the location of the film is not important, but rather the content of what the film is about. The city is where people congregate and it is the place where all of the filth of society ends up. Whenever we squeeze fallen humanity into a place that is so crowded we are always going to end up seeing the worst of it. I now live in a city, and the one thing that I can say about the city is that it sprawls, both outward and upward, and in this city people do not stand out. It does not matter whether you are a freak or a different, because you are in the city and people in the city simply do not care.<br/><br/>This movie is also about sin and not only about how sin destroys, but how people do not care about sin, and even if you were to do something about it, the effect upon the city as a whole would be so minute that it would hardly change anything. In fact I suspect very few people walked out of this movie thinking, 'hey, sin is serious, I better stop doing it'. I don't think that this was the film's purpose of it though, but rather to open our eyes to the idea of what it around, but to also confront ourselves with the powerlessness to do anything about it.<br/><br/>Take for instance what Freeman says about the job of a police officer. It is not to catch bad guys, in fact that very rarely happens. Instead, it is to collect evidence and to store it away in the hope that maybe one day it will be used to convict somebody. Then we consider the discussion in the car near the end of the film, where Brad Pitt confronts Kevin Spacey with the meaninglessness of what he is doing. He asks him whether he is sent by somebody, and what he intends to do by killing innocent people, and while it may be a media sensation for a couple of weeks, people will end up forgetting about it and will end up going about their own business.<br/><br/>Let us now consider the murders and how they relate to the sins that these people commit. We have the glutton who gorges himself on food to the point that he becomes so obese that he cannot even leave his house. He was going to die anyway, however Spacey simply sped it up by forcing him to eat himself to dead. Simply somebody who was that fat was doomed to live a short life anyway.<br/><br/>As for the lawyer and the model, they were already dead on the inside, as Spacey indicates. While she went about continually making herself beautiful in an outward sense, inside she was rotting away and dying. The lawyer may have lived a wealthy and comfortable life, but it was through keeping murders out of gaol and on the street. He had no heart and no soul, he simply did not care about what he was doing, only the money that he was making doing it. While I would disagree with that to an extent, that is not the purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the idea about the lust, in that it was not just the prostitute who died, but the man purchasing the services that died to. He was forced, at gun point, to kill this woman, and this is going to be with him for the rest of his life. The woman sells her body, and he succumbs to his lust by buying the services, and neither of them see to far ahead to realise that it will destroy them, if not physically, but mentally as well. However, the real crook, seemed to be the pimp, that simply did not care about who came into his establishment 'lot's of people come in with backpacks, it could be anyone'.<br/><br/>Does this movie make you think? Probably not, but I suspect that the whole point of the movie is that it sits in the back of our mind, and it is the type of movie that we will come back to again and again. Maybe it shows us that there is no hope in the world, no way of making a difference, but in the end, this world is a world without a God, and in that sense, is as far from reality as we could get."

","Now I have seen this movie over 100 times and I have never gotten tired of it. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the role of their lives in this movie. David Fincher's ability to make a gritty police film such as this is amazing. Brad Pitt plays a rookie detective called David Mills. He is assigned a job with William Somerset(Morgan Freeman). Here they go through a series of killings by a person known only as John Doe who uses the 7 deadly sins as his MO. After watching this film over 100 times shows that great films like this are dying. Se7en shows that a great film can leave a footprint on cinema history. This is why i am giving Se7en 9 out of 10"
"cuaamir","10","2","4","22 September 2012"," An Epic on Crime & Detection
","Se7ven is a classical movie on crime and detection. The film moves around two detectives; one seasoned and one novice. They are on a mutual assignment to investigate and arrest a heinous serial killer involved in torturing and murdering people. The story is excellently written by Andrew Kevin Walker; depicts great home work on plot, might involve review after review by him before finalization, in depth psyche of all characters and order of happening of events in an ascending order of gravity. The psyche of the killer was greatly conceived. There are a number of films on torturing and serial killing but it was a unique idea that what paradoxical impact one can perceive from great writings of Dante! It's a genuine thinking of writer and super cinematography by the director. Acting of Morgan Freeman is splendid. He has the god given talent of absorbing into characters created for him. His dressing however resembles to ""Columbo"" somehow. Brad Pitt was great except in last scene when he was double minded; his hesitance was understandable but acing was not that great as it was in whole film. Viewers' interest, suspense and mystery of the film lasts until the last scene as nobody was suspecting what actually happened; again full marks to writer and director. This movie is up to the level of Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock and we have David Fincher; an Alfred Hitchcock in pipeline. This is the movie of the Director David Fincher. He is the captain of the ship and knows how to set sail, where to speed up, where to show emotions..... all is excellent. The choices of sets and locations are great. The direction is simply magnificent. Special effects and Sound is impressive. The music by Howard Shore is inspiring, striking and exciting. The music plays a very important role in the epic."

","Se7en is about 2 detectives who are trying to catch a sadistic murderer who uses the seven deadly sins as his method of operation.

Se7en also has a magnificent twist ending just to top it all off.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Simply a spine chilling masterpiece.<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"raulfaust","6","2","4","2 April 2011"," So so
","Well, I expect more for this film. Some people have compared it to ""Silence of the Lambs"". Okay, there are some similarities, but Hannibal film had a muuch creepier atmosphere and was frightening. Se7en is just a regular police/investigation movie where the serial killer is smarter than the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman sadly just repeats his characters over and over. He's always the wise man, with wise phrases and very cult. That's so easy to act; no need to train for the new character, just play himself.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's acting is average and the same as any American actor.<br/><br/>But at least Se7en has some originality and seemed to be an inspiration for nowadays' films like ""Saw""."

"james_norman1981","10","2","4","13 February 2006"," Better than Fight Club...!
","Now don't get me wrong, I love Fight Club and will write a very positive review of that movie sometime soon. However, to me, Se7en will forever be the superior film.<br/><br/>The plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. One is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of Los Angeles (I think), a place he regards as Hell on Earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. Of course, like every cop on his way out (in Hollywood at least) Somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. Instead it's the property of a young buck, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. Of course, where director David Fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered.<br/><br/>Further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. This movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (Kevin Spacey's 'John Doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. The fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to Fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. Pitt isn't pretty, Somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Mills' wife Tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of LA has become a living nightmare inside of it.<br/><br/>The cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. At no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. Fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. This technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. A corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. One tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! And when Fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint.<br/><br/>In this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on DVD. Any criticisms I have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in Se7en, something I think Fight Club also suffers from. The minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. Instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. But that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all Fincher's work.<br/><br/>All in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from Hollywood (and since I'm writing this the day before Valentine's day I feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). Every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an Oscar' pitches that I often feel when I see a modern, 'worthy' film. On top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. The director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (Somerset and Mills). This understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while Fight Club may be cooler, Se7en is superior.<br/><br/>Therefore my recommendation is: if you haven't seen Se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!"
"rmax304823","7","2","4","22 January 2006"," Literate, Engaging Genre Piece
","Nicely plotted and well-written script, suitably ominous score, good performances all around.<br/><br/>I think the seven deadly sins were codified in the sixth century by Pope Gregory I. Keven Spacey, as the serial killer (there seems to be no end of them), takes them seriously enough to track down good examples of each and execute them according to their cardinal traits. For instance, he ties an obese man into a chair and force feeds him until he is the size of the puking man in ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life,"" and then kicks him until he explodes. The older I get and the more the flesh sags, the less amusing I find this concept.<br/><br/>The murders, by the way, are pretty disgusting, what with the darkness lighted by tiny candles, the flies buzzing around, the mutilated and decomposing corpses, the severed body parts, and all that.<br/><br/>Particularly horrifying are the last two of the seven killings. One involves an excess of envy and the other of anger. I don't want to give much more away, but they involve Spacey himself and one of the two detectives (Freeman and Pitt). The incident is a most unexpected twist, and a plausible one. That's what I meant in describing this as well written. As an unintended bonus there is an exchange between the detectives, in 1995. Freeman has just bribed an FBI man for a list of library records. Certain books are flagged and when someone checks them out, the users records are fed into the Bureau's data base. Pitt: ""Wait a minute now. How is this legal?"" Freeman: ""Legal, illegal, these terms don't apply here.""<br/><br/>Freeman and Pitt are the usual mismatched cops at the beginning, but this is not a mismatched buddy movie by any means. Half-way through and their few differences are resolved in a reasonable manner.<br/><br/>Pitt doesn't do a bad job, and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as usual. What a fine actor he is. Ordinarily he's rock solid but then watch him as a murderous pimp in ""Street Smart"" to get an idea of his range. And the movie simply would not be all that it is without Gwyneth Paltrow. She is a gangly blond with features so delicate that a viewer gets the impression that the slightest kiss on her cheek might leave a memorial bruise. That's important, for reasons I won't go into. The scene in the cafe in which she helplessly asks a helpless Freeman for advice about her secret pregnancy could have been either cloying or unnecessary if it had been written clumsily, but it was not. We can feel the actors meshing like gear wheels during the conversation.<br/><br/>If I had a problem it was with the lights. I wish someone had bothered to turn them on. Okay, a murder scene in a shabby apartment could be dark. But why is the PRECINCT STATION as gloomy as a Bohemian bar? I realize this underlighting is fashionable -- damn ""The X Files"" -- but it's getting tiresome to see people running around during action scenes carrying flashlights. While I'm complaining I might as well mention that the score, though brooding, is loud, obtrusive, and generic. Under the opening credits it passes through the obtrusive barrier into irritating, as are the credits themselves, which are shaky and resemble the deliberate but sloppy scrawl of a kindergardener. Every scene is underlined by edgy music except one in which Freeman pokes around in the library, when the composer uses the rapturous Air on a G String, the most accessible piece Bach ever wrote. The very well done library scene reminded me of college one hundred years ago when students had ideals. During exam week the student radio station would play nothing but suitable classical music. You could walk across the quad and hear Bach coming from two dozen open windows, a 24.0 sound system.<br/><br/>That's a minor carp though. The is a genuinely good example of the genre. Another thriller about a serial murderer, but a good example still."
"master_tananh","10","2","4","9 September 2005"," After 10 years, the story still seems fresh. Best thriller ever.
","Se7en is an amazing thriller that still seems fresh even after ten years. The story revolves around two cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. Freeman and Pitt work great together and I was pleased to see Brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. It's a nice change and I'd like to see him do more characters like that. Freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. Although the new cop/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow Freeman and Pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. The two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie.<br/><br/>Of course, the real focus of the movie is not about our protagonists. A serial killer (Kevin Spacey) has started a killing spree and chooses his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins, which are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, and Wrath. He chooses very creative fates in which he fights fire with fire so to speak as he turns their Sins against them. This is where the movie gets very graphic. The ""Sinner's"" fates are both cruel and unusual. If you're sqeamish, stay away, but it really isn't too bad compared to other movies. You never actually see the murders take place, just the corpses and aftermath. (Which is bad enough) This provides a nice balance that helps you focus on the detectives and their search for the elusive culprit behind all this as opposed to the story just being an excuse to show you grisly murders like the Saw series. Most of the movie revolves around the cops finding the various victims and trying to make sense of the antagonist's tantalizing hints and clues. The villain is very mysterious, and is definitely an interesting head case. He remains an enigma right up to the end, but luckily you do get to see how his mind works near the end. Spacey does a spectacular job portraying this mysterious figure when he's on screen, but sadly he's only really in it during the final part of the movie. But this isn't really a complaint. It's an interesting step out of the norm to not fill the screen time with the villain calling the heroes every five minutes to let him know that he hates them and they'll never prevail against his evil plan. The entire movie has a very dark and gloomy feel to it. Just about every inside scene is dark and outside it's usually always raining or cloudy.<br/><br/>Se7en is a great thriller that should appeal to everyone except for those who think that all movies should be fairy tales and should end perfectly. The plot runs along at a good pace and has one of the greatest (not happiest) surprise endings I've ever seen. I never saw it coming even as it was happening. Perhaps what I like the most about Se7en is that it is not just a gore fest. It has a feel of intelligence and even makes statements about the evils in our society and our tolerance of them. Pretty daring for a thriller. With it's dark mood, creative characters, and spectacular plot, Se7en comes highly recommended. A 10 out of 10."

I was disappointed (I know it was all for effect, but aside from everything else this movie gives a whole new dimension to the concept of rain and was distracting more than anything for me). It was like I was watching two different movies unfold-brilliance from Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, as you would expect, and yawning mediocrity from Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow, as you would also expect (the notion that she somehow captured the same statute for her asleep-at-the-wheel performance in ""Shakespeare in Love"" as Meryl Streep did for ""Sophie's Choice"" still torments me at night!) The ending was original and probably the reason most people seem to think it was a better flick than it was. Too much gore, too much rain, and too much Pitt-need I say more?"

","After watching Seven, I wish that I had the quiet peace of reading about Jack the Ripper or the Zodiac killer.  In short, Seven is a grotesque dumping ground of sadism that is packaged brilliantly, thanks to some solid writing and an all star cast.  If Morgan Freeman weren't onhand, this movie would have been forgotten long ago as it's perversion is too mentally ill and mind numbing to contemplate.  His performance adds a slim philosophy of hope to the movie and his presence domiantes even though he is supposed to be in the ""mentor"" role.  The rest looks like it was shot through the bottom of a urine specimen.  The death of the gluttony victim repulses the audience and the death of ""Victor"" molests the audience.  Brad Pitt is a dynamic dude (pro wrestling lifers will read into that one) and his charisma crackles. Gwentyth Paltrow has nothing to do other then be a plot point.  Kevin Spacey looks more then comfortable (as usual) playing the lunatic and his introduction in the police station is an all-time great.  Seven's problem is that it's message is pathetic.  The world sucks.  OOOOHHH!!  Haven't heard (or seen) that one before.  The acting is great, the dialogue works (until Morgan Freeman starts talking about aliens flying out of John Doe's head) and some of the visuals are tremendous.

","Seven, also known as SE7EN, is a 1995 American crime thriller directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Seven tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset (Freeman) to track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif in his murders. Seven grossed $327.3 million and currently holds a certified fresh score of 81% on Rotten Tomato's and 8.6/10 on IMDb. However, audiences enjoyed the film a lot more than critics with a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomato's, I am definitely one of those people that love this film as it engaged and intrigued me.<br/><br/>Its hard to think of many directors that have been as consistently good as David Fincher has been over the years, with the exception of Alien 3, he's had hits such as Zodiac, The Social Network, Fight Club and Gone Girl which have all proven to be incredibly successful and beautiful to watch. Seven was David Finchers first great successes that, like his other movies, has continued to gain popularity throughout the years. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are brilliantly casted as the new up and coming detective and older detective nearing the end of his time respectively and have great chemistry together, the supporting cast is no less impressive as they all work greatly in contributing to the story. Having directed both Seven and Zodiac, David Finchers is the man to go to if you want intelligent and shocking crime thrillers.<br/><br/>The theme of the seven deadly sins aspect of the film is a unique and interesting original approach, as it brings grim and unsettling murder scenes that interest and draws in the audience as well as repulses them with the brutal imagery and techniques that are used for each murder. With each murder also comes interesting investigating scenes that leave your heart racing at it brings itself to that ultimate heart-wrenching conclusion. Kevin Spacey's John Doe is a daunting and intimidating screen presence every time he's on screen which makes for interesting and unsettling viewing for the audience.<br/><br/>Se7en is a psychological fabrication of thematic scope and suspenseful sequences that payed off in the mid 90s and is still revered as one of Fincher's best to this day. The dark atmosphere and unforgettable sense of mystery makes Seven a film that is still loved by the masses today."

","This movie is very dark, both in its image and story. The classic story of the serial killer is associated with biblical texts to make a entertaining and new kind of movie.

","Se7en holds a place for being the gruesomest yet greatest crime masterpiece to hit the big screen. From the disturbing opening credits that laid turf for what this movie endorsed to the mind blowing finale that left audience members craving more, the David Fincher touch drooled off every beautifully composed composed shot and in combination with his immersively stunning set pieces, magnificently naturally lit scenes and an unnervingly gloomy colour palette; the atmosphere was consistently intimidating and unnerving yet angelic to even an untrained eye. Without doubt, Pitt and Freeman nailed their performances and thoroughly succeeded in portraying the clash between an exhausted soon to be ex-cop vs a fresh, energetic young detective as well as two men on the same path of different journeys. In addition, dialogue was clumsy which brought a naturalism that many movies fail to convey in that people don't talk perfectly. The scripting, direction and pacing were astonishing in that as the detectives uncovered evidence, building the case by every murder, the pacing grew faster as though the tunnel of apprehension was closing until the conclusion where everything simmered down. However, one small gripe was Paltrow's character; although her death shocking, it wasn't ultimately sorrowful due to her minimal appearances and one on one's with Pitt's character. Moreover, whilst only revealed towards the resolution, Kevin Spacey's character is one of the best murderer portrayals. Not only is he frightening to watch and threatening to listen to at every sentence, but the amazingly written car discussion revealed his actions weren't totally that of a lunatics and although immoral, his reasons were rational. Sadly, I found the soundtrack horrible and hard to grasp. Granted it resurfaced that 90's crime nostalgia and added tension, however it took more than it gave and possibly with a better equip composer, scenes could of shined rather than just have glowed."

The movie also is acclaimed because it takes us for many possible emotions from some smiles to the frightening, the astonishing and more than anything to the reflexi√≥n about what it's wrong and what it's well, according the viewpoint and what it implies the consequences of a lot of the human behaviors.<br/><br/>The film could be leave nuisance, because isn't the casual end of a crime movie where always the good guy wins and the bad guy lost or where the good guy is who leave the reflexi√≥n. Also, the movie is too chritic and we make us think in the true repentance for the wrong done or just an contrition act, where the regret is not for loving god but it's for what the person can lost. Another part about the movie is about the murderer, a methodic and specially patiance man, who has most the planned things and he knows that even in the end of their lifes, the humans ever ends falling into the life's perversions.

","Maybe it took me way too long to get to this movie but at least I was well prepared for what was about to come, not fully though. Se7en is a story of two detectives, played stupendously by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, who lead the investigation of serial murders based on seven deadly sins. For me personally there were never any certain things that are unlawful or forbidden - it is a matter of personal beliefs and values that each individual defines for himself - but this movie has made me look at those from a different point of view. In any case a murder, no matter what its nature and motive are, should not be tolerated and Se7en gives you plenty of grains of wisdom to think about while you try and figure out the murderer's nature and motive. Although at times very depressive and hard to comprehend the movie showcases a vast variety of emotions the main characters are going through - I'd like to especially point out Brad Pitt's character who you vouch for and empathize the most - at times it also shows signs of predictability and lazy writing but despite all that Se7en is no doubt one of the greatest movies of all times in its genre."

"ivanmessimilos","10","0","0","21 April 2020"," One of my favorites and one od the greatest od all time
","Seven is a movie that made Fincher break into the Hollywood elite and become a top director. But it was not easy to come by.
Before that, he only recorded music videos and then got the dream opportunity, to shoot Alien 3, continuing the great franchise and succeeding two legendary directors: Ridley Scott and James Cameron. However, he did not get his hands free for the movie, his studio got too involved in his work and failed to make the movie as he had imagined it.
Fortunately for him, but also for us movie lovers, the movie Seven shot the way he envisioned it and as a result we got one of the best thrillers of the 90s.
In this film, we see the director's clear signature, and he uses it in almost every subsequent movie, which is an atmosphere and an unexpected twist.
The shop takes place in a nameless city, the atmosphere is gloomy, pessimistic, dark, the rain is constantly falling and the sun is not visible at all. The city is a complete replica of this kind of weather, this is a city where a woman is taught to shout a fire not help, where a robber stabs a victim in both eyes after a robbery, as we learn from the conversation of the protagonist. The lead roles are interpreted by the brilliant duo Freeman and Pitt as two detectives who are complete opposites. The first is an experienced elderly detective with no family, just before he retires and wants to leave this city. The other is a younger detective, married, confident and just moving out of a smaller town. What is one last case before retirement, the other is the first case in a new city. This is a very difficult, complicated and brutal case. We have a serial killer who tortures and kills a new victim every day who is associated with one of the 7 deadly sins. The killings are extremely bloody and brutal, in addition to the visual imagery, also later when describing their torture.
The only breath of positive or optimism in the entire film is in the character of a younger detective's wife.
Fincher does one brilliant thing, there is no actor in the opening credits who plays the main villain, and we only get to know him after a good hour and a half of film time.
In my humble and subjective opinion, all three actors have achieved one of the best roles in their film oeuvre, and given that all three top actors say so much.<br/><br/>When this movie just came out it didn't quite get the top reviews, the reason lies in the violence in the movie and the bizarre murders. Obviously, it took a certain number of years for this film to sit down and today this film deservedly bears the cult adjective.
I also have to pay tribute to director Fincher who completed the hattrick, making three perfect films in a row that only a few directors can boast. Two years after this movie, The Game, his most underrated film, is released, and then two years after that Fight Club, his perhaps best known movie, is released.<br/><br/>Seven is one of my favorite and best movies in general, not just a thriller and of course it gets a clean ten from me."

Even if you do n't understand the religious part, you can interpret JohnDoe 's disappointment and anger at the evil of human nature. In the movie, the city should be in the rapid development of industry. People continue to pursue material satisfaction while losing a lot of spiritual wealth. JohnDoe He thinks that he is entitled to punishment based on religious belief, but in fact no one has this power. On the one hand, the film shows the disappointment of the depravity of human nature, on the other hand, it also shows the powerlessness of saving the spiritual world. When the last shot by police officer Mills, declared the failure of perfect justice.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt 's performance in the film is excellent, and the old drama of Morgan Freeman has maintained a high level of performance as always. Of course, the most amazing performance is from Kevin Spacey. I was most impressed. David Finch's way of telling stories is also very good. During the movie watching, I felt creepy more than once."

","This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain.<br/><br/>Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.<br/><br/>The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!<br/><br/>This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?<br/><br/>Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them. Why is this? Maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? When you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. Simple."

","I ask myself why Se7en is so great? The answer to that question is rather simple because it was directed by David Fincher, who is known for being a perfectionist. Se7en is one of a kind. With its unrelenting dark and gritty visuals, David Fincher beautifully employs the use of rain, the twisted legal system and gore to create something which was both thrilling and well written. This film has a fantastic cast. From Freeman's controlled performance playing Somerset who loves books to Pitt's angry follows his gut who loves a chase. Yes, their partnership is pretty cliched, but it's forgivable because both Pitt and Freeman do such a remarkable job playing these characters. Not to mention that ending which will play in my mind for days after watching-something I adore in a film."

","John Doe left a vast space for thought, as ruthless as he was a butcher, he was also a paranoid individual about an idealistic society. In his eyes, the rule of his conduct was to punish evil and make good, and because the murderer had committed seven crimes, he acted in god's behalf. Of good and evil border upon du John is no longer so clear, this is an extremely complex inner character, David fincher through such a character, completely obscures the world clear judgment of good and evil, a desire to purdue beings, encouraging people to people ended up using the means of extreme intolerance,traditional morality under the lens of David fincher gradually lost the criterion."

","A lot has been said/written in these reviews about this movie. There is not much more that I can add. I have seen this movie about 3 times (spaced out) and each time I get that feeling...where is this leading me? I understand about the 7 deadly sins but is it that cut and dry? The movie is not complex and actually walks you through so it feels predictable but in a strange and very rare way it is not. My advice is to relax, put the kids to bed and watch as this movie takes you on a little journey. In the end, if you have sat through this with minimal disruption, you will be left shaking your head in total disbelief... I'll watch it again in about 3 years.

","I first saw Seven when my Finnish teacher showed it to our class. I was perhaps 14 at the time. And it left a lasting impact. This crime thriller, this gothic neo-noir masterpiece where people are brutally murdered according to the Seven Deathly Sins as recognized by the Catholic Church. Down the line it led me to Hellblazer, Neil Gaiman, the whole Vertigo Universe, film noir, Gotham, Edgar Allan Poe, et cetera. But I think it all started with this film.<br/><br/>Se7en is one of those films you can only see once for the first time. If that makes any sense to you. I've seen it multiple times throughout the years, but none of those viewings can compare with the first time, when everything is new, each murder scene is more gruesome than the last, and you have no idea what the serial killer is up to. And in a way it's sad. If i could, I would erase this movie from my memory, just so I could experience watching it for the first time all over again. Its twists and turns are that good. But I can't. And that makes me a bit mad. Which makes it a great film.<br/><br/>I've always struggled with reviewing this film. Usually my friends have at least heard about the film and how great it is, so I only have to warn them about how stomach churning it is. But what do you say about it to someone who has never heard of it, without spoiling something essential about it?<br/><br/>I honestly don't have a clue. Suffice to say, it's one of my favourite films of all time. It's violent, it's bloody, it's absolutely macabre. But it's also the best film Morgan Freeman has ever made. It's the best film Brad Pitt has ever made. It's the best film David Fincher has ever made. It's the best film (redacted) has ever made. Not for the easily spooked, but if you're willing to gaze into the abyss, this abyss will gladly gaze into you."

","This movie does nearly everything well but for some reason it doesn't captivate me as much as many other crime thrillers.

With that being said, the story is very interesting and original, and the ending is absolutely fenomenal in how it wraps up the mystery in a very shocking and emotional way.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's and Morgan Freeman's characters are very well written and dynamic. They both have compelling and intriguing character arcs that evolves them in logical ways. This is delivered wonderfully through their fantastic acting. Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Palthrow are also good in this film but they're not the stars of the show.<br/><br/>Other good things about the movie is the score and the set design. The score isn't particularly prominent but it delivers the few times it's in focus.

"larsen-08296","10","0","0","31 December 2019"," Dark and suspenseful buddy cop thriller with twists and turns.
","Influential director David Fincher launched an impressive mainstream career with Se7en. Countless films and tv-series have been inspired or downright copied the opening sequence. Other films like 8mm and ect have tried to hit the same nerve, themes and mood as Se7en but nothing beats the original.
There is nothing feel-good about this dark film. It is set in a rainy metropol challenged by brutality and violence. The themes of the film revolves around the worst aspects of humanity and whether it is worth keeping on fighting the good fight or we should just give up because of the meaninglessness of it all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are portraying the two main characters William Somerset and David Mills. They are one of the best unlikely buddy cop pairs ever seen on the big screen. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect portraying the sympathetic and worried wife of Mills. Kevin Spacey is menacing as the everyday man John Doe with fanatic plans for society.

","I had really liked this movie before I watched it beacuse of its forceful cast. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who are the most famous actors in the world are taking part together. Therefore, in my opinion, there shouldn't be any prejudice about movie in your mind.<br/><br/>It was a masterpiece of ancient movie fictions owing to its well-written, gripping, disturbing and intresting scenario. The movie is about metaphorically seven sins, two detective and a serial killer. The seven sins are explained as people's common behaviors such as being greedy and being arrogant .
In the scenerio, The murder kills people and leaves traces behind himself about those ''seven sins'' before he leaves from each homicide areas. Then detectives start to follow the case.<br/><br/>From my perspective, the director of this movie confronts us with our own common behaviours and enforces us to think which kind of ''sin'' we generally have. Therefore, movie's main theme was processed well and ideas were completely understandable. Other than, It had extraordinary crime scenes and fascinating dialogues between two detectives so nothing was boring."
"rachelgallit","8","0","0","7 December 2019"," Shocking
","This movie is guilty of several of the seven deadly sins that the main antagonist seems to revere so greatly. Detectives Somerset and Mills are the classic idealistic rookie and grizzled veteran pairing and work together to try and catch a serial killer loose on the city. The killer, never identified, and so-called John Doe, kills those he feels represent the spirit of each of the deadly sins, starting with gluttony, and working his way down the list. The murders are brutal and grotesque, and the detectives scramble to catch up to Doe before he claims another life. The dark gritty style and content are well conveyed with the deep shadows, isolated colors, and deeply angled face shots. The dialogue was nothing special or emotionally potent, but what portions were full of emotion worked well within the ambiance of the grim, gritty, horror-filled nature of reality. I felt that the religious themes, while not revolutionary, helped establish the zealotry of John Doe."

","Fincher delivers what is quite possibly the twistiest of all mystery thrillers in true David Fincher fashion. The story is about as perfect as any detective mystery can be as each twist and turn brings the audience closer in to the story. Each new clue hits harder than the last one to the point where it all builds up to what is likely one of the most suspenseful finales of all time. The dark tone also serves to up the tension as only a David Fincher film could. The personal more quiet moments also get one to feel for the characters so that the finale just hits even harder. Pitt and Freeman work magic together on screen and Spacey delivers one of his most impactful performances despite VERY limited screen time. Ultimately this all leads to a finale that is actually quite philosophical and leaves one thinking about the natural condition of man and where we may stand before God on our own power."

","What to say about this movie? It's a masterpiece. Period.<br/><br/>Se7en is very well crafted, skillfully written (Andrew Kevin Walker) and directed (David Fincher), starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow. This movie is about two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives. The creation of suspense and terror in this movie is amazing, it keeps you with the same information that the detectives have and you keep up the investigation.<br/><br/>A film about two homicide detectives' (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world's ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic ""John Doe"" sermonizes to Detectives Somerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...<br/><br/>It amazingly well constructed with great dialogue between characters and the acting of the ""John Doe"" is amazing. The dark construction and design is perfection. The soundtrack also is very good.<br/><br/>This movie enters in my top 50 movies of all time for sure. Its worth every second. Bravo"

","On his last case before retirement- in seven days, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is joined by his replacement, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Said case turns out to be the most challenging, bizarre, and potentially dangerous of Somerset's entire career. Someone is murdering people in gruesome yet significant ways. The detectives run down every clue while more killings take place, and a terrifying pattern emerges. This all leads to the devastating conclusion. One of the darkest, creepiest, most intricate thrillers ever made, SE7EN is also a magnificent, highly influential police procedural. Freeman plays Somerset as a cop who's seen it all and had enough. Even so, he cannot resist being drawn in to the bleak circumstances unfolding before him. Mills is young, impetuous, and a bit overconfident, not really looking for the subtleties and nuances that Somerset perceives. Together, they become involved in something beyond their most morbid expectations. Director, David Fincher proves his mastery of gloom, establishing himself as one of the modern greats. Gwyneth Paltrow makes the best of her small but important role as Mills' wife, Tracy. A truly disturbing film, and not easily forgotten..."

","""Seven"" features a psychopath who is at least as convinced of his moral superiority and his mission to combat moral decay as Travis Bickle is in ""Taxi driver"" (1976, Martin Scorsese). On top of that he structures his murders along the Biblical lines of the seven sins from the Apocalyps. In doing that he is not entirely consistent. In some cases the sinner is his victim (gluttony), in other cases he forces the sinner to be the murderer (lust).<br/><br/>In search of the psychopath is a couple of detectives. This couple consists of, as in so many films before, an ambitious rookie and an old hand just before his retirement.

"david-meldrum","8","0","0","9 April 2019"," Still dark and shocking, and inviting us to choose between despair and hope.
","Jaws - a film that is often credited with launching what we now know as the summer blockbuster phenomenon - is justly famous for many things. It's a masterpiece of slowly building fear, in part because the shark itself is unseen by the viewer for a long, long time. David Fincher's 1994 serial killer thriller takes inspiration from Spielberg's game-changer in that respect; we don't see the face of the killer until 30 minutes before the film's end, at a moment of revelation of his own choosing. Neither do we see the murders take place; in the film's memorable rain-sodden foot chase we only see his back; his face remains out of focus even when he's pointing a gun in Brad Pitt's face, deciding his fate. David Fincher knows what most good horror films and thrillers have made apparent over the years: the unseen is more threatening and frightening than the known.<br/><br/>Rewatching this film for the first time in years in 2019, I'm struck especially by how normal the abnormal events it portrays are made to seem. A serial killer who bases his work on the seven deadly sins of Christian tradition is nothing especially original; religious references are a familiar serial killer trope. Fincher places this killing spree in the hands of an apparently ordinary figure - one who goes by the name of John Doe (the name given by American police to an unidentified deceased male). As John Doe himself says, as the film's unforgettable ending hoves into view: ""I'm not special; I've never been exceptional ... it's more comfortable for you to label me insane"".<br/><br/>It's dangerous to quote the words of a killer as if they contain some kind of truthfulness, but this is the heart of the film: that evil is ubiquitous; it's in all of us. In each of the serial killer's victims, in the police chasing him, in the killer himself. In an age where the mass shootings that still stalk America are so routinely passed off as committed by someone with 'mental health problems', personal responsibility is avoided. The truth is we're all to blame; Se7en holds a mirror up to us, and it's not a pleasant sight. To summarise what John Doe says near the conclusion, we tolerate sin in ourselves and others because it's normal. It's this, it seems, that as the credits roll and those involved are left to live with the terrible consequences of their actions, that drives Morgan Freeman to utter the film's final words in voice over: ""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part."" It's a brutal way to leave the story, and one which the makers of the film fought the studio to keep in, and no less powerful for it; though now, having seen many more films than I had on seeing Se7en in the cinema, it seemed a tad too much of tell as opposed to show.<br/><br/>This seems bleak - and it is, if we conclude that the fight of which Hemingway is speaking is fruitless. For those who believe following Jesus is worthwhile and eternally meaningful, it's a profoundly hopeful place to be; the world may not be as fine a place, as was intended; but there is a better way; and that better way will, eventually, be seen by all.<br/><br/>It is a battle, though, and in the meantime many suffer. As long as any of us - like John Doe in this film - take matters in to our hands, take the judging as something for us to execute, then there will be casualties. Not least ourselves, but also those unfortunate enough to be in our orbit.<br/><br/>All of which leads us to the Kevin Spacey question. With the revelations about his alleged sexual harassments and assaults, the question remains: should we watch his films? I have no easy answer here. I have been bullied to the point of suicide by someone who used to speak on big conference stages; I know how painful it was to see that person lauded by thousands when I knew different; I have forgiven the person, but still my stomach lurches with nausea and I'm wracked with anxiety if I see his name alluded to in a social media feed. I was sexually and physically abused as an adult by an adult; if I were to see her in a public role, it would be very hard to take. So I argue that Spacey's victims must be given much consideration here; I would want the same for myself. With that in mind, I rewatched Se7en for the first time since these allegations came out. As I reflected on the film's themes of the ubiquity of evil I found myself asking uncomfortable questions. If Spacey's past work is not to be considered any more; if my bully's speaking is no longer to be listened to; if my abuser is never to have a relationship ... then what of me? I have not done any of these things - but if I believe sin and evil are ubiquitous (and I do), then that means I'm as guilty of sin as anyone else. I hope I own my sins and seek forgiveness, in large part through the regular discipline of confession; but I also know I am prone to err. Let he who is without sin ...<br/><br/>I do not have an answer, at least not yet. Certainly it seems to me that Spacey, and those like him, should not be widely spoken of or employed in the public eye - at the very least until fault has been admitted, responsibility taken and justice served. Fittingly for this film, for now I remain with this tension unresolved.<br/><br/>What remains true is that it's still a beautifully constructed, chilling and gripping thriller that haunts and shocks even after all these years; even when I know the point to which the story is heading. More culturally significant films still lay ahead of Fincher, not least Fight Club; many would cite Zodiac (2006) as his best film; The Social Network (2010) tells at least part of the story of one of the era's dominant themes. Of course, we don't know what more is to come from him. Se7en sets the template for his best work: morally complex, darkly thrilling, and directed with a flair that fits the story and the theme. If not quite as dynamic as I remember, it's still a film to be reckoned with, that ultimately asks us to choose between despair and hope."

"jte6451","10","0","0","11 March 2019"," Se7en Review
","I can't believe that I hadn't seen one before, and I'm glad that I did managed to see it. Se7en is often considered to be one of the finest examples of modern crime thrillers and has established David Fincher as one of the finest directors in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Set within the course of seven days, it follows two homicide detectives who are on the hunt for a serial killer that based his crimes on the seven deadly sins. As the plot unfolds, a friction arises between the two detectives and how they go about their work as they both race against time to prevent the killer from succeeding his sadistic work.<br/><br/>Easily Fincher's darkest film to date, this movie is dripping with an unsettling atmosphere. Right from the opening scene, it lets you know exactly what kind of world we're entering; the lighting, the bleak shadows, the deterioration of the crime-ridden city, the constant rainfall that happens during exterior shots; all of these make the setting feel unsettling and gives the viewers a sense of dread that builds up all the way to the end. The story and the screenplay is masterfully crafted and the slightest details all play a part in the overall narrative.<br/><br/>The cast delivers a great performance; Morgan Freeman is very likable as Somerset, an aging detective who has been through hell and is ready to retire and live a peaceful life, but finds that he keeps getting drawn into all the chaos that's happening. Brad Pitt is also good as Mills, a young detective who, while determined to find the killer, he's overly ambitious and is completely naive to the whole situation. Their chemistry is what also makes them great; Mills is cocky and impulsive, while Somerset is calm and self-controlled, and both men try to work off each other.<br/><br/>However, the character who steals the show is the serial killer ""John Doe"" himself. As soon as he reveals himself to the audience, you can tell he's dripping with dread and evil accompanying him and how he manages to orchestrate his evil plans, all in which builds up to one hell of an intense finale that I refuse to spoil here, but I will say it will make your skin crawl long after you see it.<br/><br/>Overall, Se7en still remains as one of the definitive examples of the exploration of the mind of a serial killer and how he manages to do it instead of why he did it, made possible by Fincher's gritty vision that doesn't sugarcoat it. This dark, relentless, and original tale still remains effective now as it was in 1995. One of Fincher's best works; highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness."
"mjones-17407","10","0","0","7 March 2019"," An amazing mystery film that will keep you entralled and disturbed to the very end.
","A major issue with watching lots of horror and dark mystery films is that disturbing imagery tends to lose its effect on you. All the blood and gore just stops being disturbing because you've learned how to look at it and see nothing more than CGI or some cheesy effects. What's amazing about Se7en though is its ability to get around that.<br/><br/>This movie is disturbing. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but what I can say is that is shows just enough of the antagonist's murders that you're able to understand the horror of each death. And while what you see is uncomfortable and disgusting, it's nothing compared to what you don't see. The parts of the corpses the movie either jumps-cuts around, or just flat out doesn't show, are the most brutal sections. And since you never see them in great detail, all you're left with is whatever your mind creates to fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>The grizzly murders aren't what make the movie though, as acting is a big part of it too. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make for an amazing pair, pulling off their contrasting character brilliantly. While the ""genius detective who wants to leave the force"" and the ""guided by his emotions"" characters aren't anything new, they're pulled off so well you'll fall in love with them both very quickly.<br/><br/>And then we have the plot of the film. The story follows detective Mills and Somerset as they track down a killer who is replicating the Seven Deadly Sins through their murders. While most of the run time is the characters talking about how horrific the case is, shouting about how they'll catch the killer, or standing in the rain; the grizzly atmosphere of the mystery is portrayed perfectly in each scene. It never once feels like the movie diverted away from the intriguing plot line, even in the scenes that have nothing to do with the case are overshadowed by the brutal killings. And of course we have the famous final scene. I won't go into any detail, but the end of the film is a jaw dropping experience, and creates a memorable end to the story.<br/><br/>One big criticism I do have with the film is there are quite a bit of plot holes throughout. Thinking about the killer's plan for more than a few seconds will lead to many questions about it that don't seem to make sense. But in the end, the genius directing and acting make up for these faults. Truly an amazing experience."

"bradleycarreiro","10","0","0","28 February 2019"," A Pure Masterpiece
","Se7en is a crime thriller directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. The film is about these two detectives who end up working together on a case of these unrelated murders happening in this unknown city in which they live in that all connect with the seven deadly sins (lust, pride, greed, sloth, envy, gluttony, wrath.)<br/><br/>Se7en can be described in three words: a violent masterpiece. The film takes on the idea of the seven deadly sins as their forefront for the crimes taken place in a creative, interesting and exciting way. The best part about this film is not showing the actual murders taking place. All the audience and the main characters see is the brutal and bloody aftermath of the crime. It fills the audience with a darker and violent imagination of what happened during the murders.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is top notch with some of the best performances I have ever seen with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Their chemistry in the film is perfect and seamless. As the film goes along, I totally forgot they were Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman anymore as they became their respective characters. This helps with the amazing writer that allowed the acting and chemistry to blossom and be so memorizing.<br/><br/>The story is the best aspect of this film as Fincher smartly makes the audience question what will happen next? We see this in most critically acclaimed thrillers, but this film doesn't let you know where this movie can potentially go because Fincher builds small clues and foreshadows as the moment of time happens in the film. Every scene in the film is important to the overall plot which makes the film feel so long by the end because you never feel like you wasted any time watching it. The climax of the film is one of the most exciting, edge of your seat climaxes I have ever seen. It has high blood pumping energy with great excitement that the film has built throughout its runtime that pays off so well.<br/><br/>The directing is so fantastic that I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for best directing at the 68th annual Academy Awards. Fincher uses great wide shots to capture all what's happening in the frame that keeps the audience in the moment. He carefully uses detailed close ups with his characters in deep emotional scenes that add an extra layer to the film.<br/><br/>The score, composed by Howard Shore, is an amazing score that adds so much to those intense scenes that gives the extra boost it needs to keep you on the edge of your seat. Whether its his dark and suspenseful music as the characters are investigating each crime scene or it's the intense energetic moving music in the action scenes, the score is used appropriately and effectively.
As for the tech specs, the film has amazing cinematography done by Darius Khondji who uses a dark colored palate that is used perfectly with the gritty and dreadful tone of the film the use of light during many dark scenes was used perfectly as it didn't over bear the darkness of the setting. When the film used color, it used dark reds, yellows, etc. that gave a little tiny burst of life it needed to not look so dull and boring. Many filmmakers try to use this dark colored pallet and look for their movie because of the tone of the movie they are making, but it doesn't always work out because they don't know what they are looking to see.<br/><br/>The editing is practically seamless in which scene transition flowed so smoothly that it felt like the movie was shot all in one day chronologically. The action scenes also had incredible editing that it all looked real and presented well.<br/><br/>My only issues with the film are small but need to be addressed. During some of the action scenes, mainly in the middle where Mills is chasing down a potential suspect, there is a lot of ""shaky cam"" involved where it can be a tad bit distracting watching it, but not bad enough that it ruins the whole scene.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is one of the best films of all time due to its cast and production team. It has an engaging story that is always interesting and feels like something new is about to happen. The film is exciting, gritty, and dark in the best David Fincher way possible. The acting is superb, and the writing makes the film so enthralling throughout. I can recommend to anyone who wants to watch an pure masterpiece in the thriller genre. I give this a 10/10"

"ethantoy","7","0","0","16 February 2019"," A Great Criminal Horror yet a Horrid Ending
","Seven follows two detectives who are set on a case of a crazed, psychotic extremist who believes in the seven deadly sins- that's it. That's the whole movie. Essentially, it's about this duo (which the chemistry is awesome) and how they try and find the answers as to why this is happening which of course, is later explained by Kevin Spacey who plays as the killer, John Doe. I honestly had a very amazing experience watching this movie and viewed it like a Horror film which came off really close to that genre in my opinion, but the film's ending was so gut-wretchingly bad, that I was shook up on my perspective for this movie. I HATED the way it ended, and how it led down. This movie to me, had much more potential. But the thing is, it's a nitpick and I do understand the ending as to why it happened but... was that something really necessary? I don't believe so. I thought it was a cheap, bought-out ending that was made for shock and to me, it definitely got the shock value of it. However, the moral ambiguities that this film implies was just, depressing. To see your heroes lose like this, was just as bad as Avengers Infinity War, but that worked for that film. This one, I don't think so. It's a great criminal thriller/horror to watch but the ending will disappoint you, and if you're not interested in seeing your heroes lose a case- you'll want to pass on this one."

","David Fincher's film is absolutely amazing - it's plot is perfect and the writing is simply excellent.
Morgan freeman gave multiple amazing performances in the 90's and this is no exception. Brad Pitt pulled his character off near perfectly with some small flaws at the start of the movie (just slightly clich√© dialogue).
But by far the best performance (though short) was Kevin Spacey as John Doe, who I would say is even comparable to Hannibal Lecter himself acting wise. He perfectly mastered the act of menace and intimidation in every one of his scenes, I was pulled in whenever he was on screen.
The biggest flaw in the film is some predictable writing during the 2nd act, but that is well compensated for with the 3rd act twist. I would recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys 90's classics and has 2 hours to spare."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Seven premiered in 1995 and, is directed by David Fincher. The movie is written by Andrew Kevin Walker and stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. The movie is about a pair of police detectives that are tracking down a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as a modus operandi.<br/><br/>Seven is an incredibly engaging movie. The movie's 127 minutes of running time moves at an incredible pace as it is bolstered by the tight directing by David Fincher. This movie is absolutely well-directed. David Fincher arranges every scene well and executes it well. The direction aids in the delivery of how each of the seven deadly sins are shown. Nothing as held back with the display of the deadly sins. David Fincher is able to show the audience the utter disgust represented by the sins. The investigator perspective is also clear and understood well.<br/><br/>Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives in the police named David Mills and William Somerset respectively. Both of these actors portray their characters well. Morgan Freeman as William Somerset is a soon to retire detective that is jaded by his experiences. David Mills is idealistic but and naive to the horrors in his job. These two characters play off of each other well and serve to take the audience along with them to solve the mystery. It is a pleasure trying to follow along with the detectives.<br/><br/>The villain John Doe steals the show. Kevin Spacey plays the serial killer and it was awesome. The entire time from when he is introduced to the mystery being solved serves as the movie's climax. It is here that Kevin Spacey portrays the creepy serial killer and delivers chilling dialogue to the audience. The villain is helped greatly by the writing and serves to make the reveal of John Doe even more frightening. The movie does not introduce him until some of the other victims are already shown. This helps with the reveal as it finally shows this normal looking man as being truly psychotic.<br/><br/>I would recommend Se7en. The movie is a solid crime thriller and is a great early David Fincher movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Two homicide detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) are investigating the case of a serial killer, as one of them is about to retire (Morgan Freeman), whilst the other has just transferred to the precinct and is only starting out (Brad Pitt). This neo-noir, set in the gritty, grey-looking New York, begins with the character of Brad Pitt entering a crime scene to introduce himself to his new partner, Morgan Freeman, however their first interaction proves to be quite cold, as the 'old dog' does not warm up to the newbie. Furthermore, they are assigned a mysterious homicide case, in which the killings are linked to the Seven Deadly sins.
The film starts off with a series of Fincheresque shots, establishing the morning routine of the detective, then transitioning into a unique introduction title sequence of the film, which focuses our attention on minor details of the shots. It throws us into the action, the music straight away portrays the films as a tense crime thriller, in which the murder scenes send shivers down your spine and make you tense up, expecting a jump scare after every musical build up, keeping the viewer on edge during all times, grabbing our attention and not letting go throughout.
However, even though Fincher's masterpiece retains the status of a must-watch, the film is more of a stylistic piece, showing off the director's way of seeing things, it might have been better with more content and ironically 'suffers from the sin of self-consciousness' (Malcolm D.; The Guardian, Seven, 04/01/1996). By my opinion it is also one of Morgan Freeman's best performances in a film."

","""Seven"" is an incredible, yet horrifying film. It has many shocking moments as it digs deep into the heart of evil and shows just how bad we humans can be.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Works- *Writing/Directing: This is one of the most well written films in the history of cinema. The narrative flows beautifully. The presence of the villain is felt all throughout the film even though he is only seen towards the end of the film. David Fincher completely commands the attention and nerves of the audience with this incredibly dark and twisted mystery/thriller. One can't help but hold their breath through most of the film. *Editing/Cinematography: The selection of shots are absolutely perfect. The information given to us on screen is handled with such care and is timed perfectly. The editing is completely invisible in this film, as it should be. Cinematographer Darius Khondji brings forth a sinister and dark tone to the film. There seem to be a lack of life in the film, as if the villain has taken all of the joy out of the world, even the color. *Dialogue/Acting: Once again, this film is incredibly well written. The dialogue is gripping all throughout. The attention of the audience is held all throughout the film. Every line of dialogue has a purpose. The performances of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are without blemish. They have an incredible chemistry. Gwyneth Paltrow brings a lovely quality to the film, as if to calm us after we become overwhelmed with the darkness. Kevin Spacey delivers one of the greatest performances of his life. He commands complete attention whenever he is on screen. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is undeniably haunting. Every measure of music puts the viewer on edge. There is no room to take a deep calming breath. Tension is high all throughout the film. The sound design is completely immersive. The viewer can't help but feel that they are on this journey with David Mills and Detective Somerset. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set design and locations are perfect for the aesthetic of these gritty thriller/drama. The final scene is one that cannot be forgotten. The special effects are strong throughout most of the film, but occasionally become a bit weak.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Seven"" is a must-see that cannot be ignored. It is completely gripping from start to finish."

","Silence of the Lambs. What comes to mind when you hear that title? A deranged genius vs a good guy. This film is similar in many ways, although not quite as polished.

The story is told in excellent suspense technique, and the dark, rainy atmosphere provides the emotional setting that is a proper visual for the screenplay. This film about the dark side of humanity is well-made and a winner. But, that being said; there really doesn't seem to be a lot of socially redeeming value to the content of the film. Is this the purpose of our cinema? To produce depressing, abnormally psychotic films that fascinate audiences. I guess so; it made a lot of money.

","""Se7en"" (1995) is a dramatic crime mystery about two detectives, rookie detective David Mills played by Brad Pitt and veteran detective William Somerset played by Morgan Freeman, as they hunt for a serial killer murdering people according to the seven deadly sins. I have viewed this film several times since 1995 and every time I am pleasantly surprised by new information I missed the previous time. For example, when Morgan Freeman makes his own personal revelations, I would attribute it to a man set in his ways exiting the force and making things odd and difficult for other people involved. However, upon further review and paying close attention, all his anecdotes made perfect sense to the cases he was working, particularly the seven sins killer. This is an outstanding film.<br/><br/>David Fincher is an extremely incredible director and his affiliation with Brad Pitt adds to his ability to produce high quality products. This film is extremely dark and just in its color grading. The storyline is dark, the characters are dark, and the film reflects that. Fincher does a remarkable job getting the best acting performances out of all his actors which equates to the acting being superb. This film was not originally on my favorites list. It was a film that provided me with a high level of intrigue, but I have effectively shifted it to my top ten list. I really enjoy this fil and recommend it to any and everyone that enjoys a good movie with religious undertones."

","Se7en's uniqueness delivers in an unimaginable variety of ways. It is perhaps the best thriller film of the entire 1990s. The tone is immediately set and maintains a dark, chilling a mood that stays relevant throughout the entire movie. While Se7en is slow-paced and lengthy, this only gives more development to the characters without crashing into common cliches. While an unlikely pair, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deliver as very sturdy characters. And oh, Kevin Spacey! Truly the most chilling character he has ever played. His brief role towards the finale of the film portrays perhaps some of the best acting I have ever seen of him. Truly a must-see."

"one-nine-eighty","9","0","0","17 August 2018"," A cult classic that didn't get the acclaim it deserved
","Voluntarily transferring in to a crime hotspot in an unnamed city of America, Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a rookie detective on the rise. He's teamed up with Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who's not far away from retirement. They end up on a case investigating murders that follow a pattern and are inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins from Dante's ""The Devine Comedy"". Somerset is an expert in hunting down criminals and does things the old-fashioned way through years of working hard, due to looming retirement and a desire to stay alive he doesn't want to get involved too heavily - his years and the weariness they have brought him suggest that there is more going on than just another killer on the loose. Mills on the other hand wants to make a name for himself and pushes the case and his involvement. They fall out a little, it takes a meeting with Tracy Mill (Gwyneth Paltrow - Pitt's film wife) to convince Somerset that he has to be involved, if nothing else than to guide and protect Mills. Thus they pursue the murder, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) who has planned a shock for the detectives. <br/><br/>Directed by David Fincher and wonderfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this is a fantastic intelligent and gripping film, a real cult classic and one of the iconic films of the 90's. It's dark and dirty with a fantastic atmosphere. The unnamed American city is a real hive of filth and degradation, it's always raining, and even when you are away from the rain the colour palette is muted, dark and dirty. The acting is top class all the way across the board. While having a new rogue cop and one close to retirement isn't a new set-up it works particularly well in this and Pitt and Freeman end up bouncing off each other beautifully. The score to the movie is great and really helps to build up the atmosphere and bring in a level of tension that chills. Editing techniques used are both new and existing, some a direct homage to absolute greats of horror movies, in particularly the hidden cell insertion (a-la ""The Exorcist"" for example) - a frame or picture hidden in the visual reel and only displayed for a fraction of a moment. The look and feel of the film harp back to noir classics or even graphic novel comic books the way it's all dark and gloomy, and while it's set as an action/suspense/thriller there are nods to horror too, both psychologically and physically, with the manner of killings which take place adding a grizzly and raw element. Well-paced and almost metronomal, this film will keep you entertained throughout - in fact the most peaceful time the film allows is when the detectives themselves are having a break from action. This is a feature of the film, it stays on track and focussed throughout and unlike conventional Hollywood films it never strays from it plot and purpose. The audience plays a part in the film as the third detective, in that they are kept in the dark throughout and only really learn things as the detectives learn, which allows for an intense ride and lifts the finale onto a pedestal. Not your typical cops and robbers' film this will take you out of your comfort zone and take you into a brutal world, and who knows, you might end up questioning your morality and empathising or sympathising with the killer's motives. <br/><br/>This film didn't win half as many awards as it should have done - but thankfully its cult status and fan recognition have kept it alive in film history consciousness. 9 out of 10 from me."
"elicopperman","9","0","0","17 August 2018"," A Brutal Albeit Endlessly Intriguing Crime Thriller
","Although Alien 3 was filmmaker David Fincher's directorial debut, I think he'd prefer to call this film his real debut any day of the week. Released in 1995, Seven (or Se7en) went on to gain critical acclaim, huge box-office revenue, and helped kickstart new beginnings for the director. To this very day, it remains by many as a highly graphic and disturbing neo-noir flick with a highly engaging premise and finale. After seeing the film in its entirety myself, I could not agree more.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of two New York detectives named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) who track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins in his murders. What really holds the movie together are the two leads, as Pitt and Freeman display excellent chemistry with each other. Both of their characters have their own desires in life, with Somerset on the brink of retirement and Mills just starting at his position. Their performances are so sharp and realistic that it's hard to see the actors rather than the actual characters. Considering how disgusting their murder case is, it's only fitting that they do the necessary reacting and analyzing.<br/><br/>In addition to strong leads, some of the supporting cast are quite memorable in their own regard. Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), faces certain struggles upon moving to a new city and certain complications about her personal life. Whenever she's with Somerset, you can just feel her devastation, making her arguably the most sympathetic character in the whole feature. However, the serial killer himself, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), is one who could really send shivers down anyone's spine. Alongside all of his murders being horrific yet well thought out, he's actually smarter than one might assume, and he practically wrote the third act he's so clever albeit evil (no spoilers).<br/><br/>I'm not too familiar with David Fincher's directing style, but this film really displays New York in a graphic setting. Even when it's a calm rainy day or even sunny, there's always a sense of danger lurking about. The editing is also very well paced, especially during a particularly suspenseful chase scene of Mills and John Doe through an apartment complex which must've went through lots of trial and error to get right. The grim tone helps give the viewers a glimpse of the horrors in the world, so when we know more about John Doe, you'd only wish you could never meet someone like that again.<br/><br/>Isn't it great how a filmmaker's career can really get off the ground when they make an original film of their liking as opposed to some lame Hollywoodized sequel? After 23 years, Seven stills holds up as a modern classic that dares to tackle life's harsh realities, the depiction of two detectives investigation solving a horrific case, and the darkest realms that the human soul offers. If you're in to very gothic, psychological thrillers that talk about themes like the aforementioned, definitely give this a watch when you can. Fincher has since gone on to make more worthwhile films that still inspire many to this day, so it looks like I've got quite a gold mine ahead of me."
"imseeg","10","0","0","14 August 2018"," ""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part""
","For all those out there that have never seen ""Seven"" there is only one advice: watch it and shiver. For anyone who is a movie lover of thrillers and detectives this is an absolute must see. You must be crazy if one would disregard this movie. I would only advice those people NOT to go see it if they are faint of heart, because this classic has some pretty gruesome killings in it. Although most of those killings arent shown, only the victims are shown, but they are shown in such a horrifying way that I still have to look away at some scenes.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the ultimate freak thriller slasher movie of the nineties. But mind you, it is NOT that there is much killings to be seen, no the suspense that another victim is gonna be killed rises to levels never before seen on the silver screen. It is what some call a mindf*k thriller and oh man does your mind get twisted with the sick but intelligent plot.<br/><br/>Starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who all perform at the peak of their talents. Oscars and dozens of awards worldwide were given to this unique piece of suspense horror. One of the most popular thrillers ever released in american movie history. This is something that just mesmirizes and shocks me again and again and I must have seen it over 20 times by now.<br/><br/>The story is about Brad Pitt, playing a young detective married to Gwyneth Paltrow. Brad Pitt has to work with another detective Morgan Freeman to solve a serial killer case. The story sounds simple but the execution of it is mindboggling nervewrecking. I think to this day it is one of the most twisted sick thrillers I have ever seen, but it is directed so brilliantly that is a joy to watch from beginning to end. <br/><br/>If you have never seen this movie you are in a very fortunate position, because the suspense is greatest when you dont know HOW this story will turn out. Enjoy and shiver!"

"piercem-66810","10","0","0","11 May 2018"," A masterpiece from David Fincher
","*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>
The movie se7en, directed by David Fincher and released in 1995 stars Brad Pitt 
and Morgan Freeman. Pitt, is a young detective taking place of Freeman, who is an old, grizzled, detective who thinks he has seen it all, that is until this case. 
The goal of our heroes is to catch a new serial killer on the loose. This new serial killer, because of the unknown identity of the killer is referred to as John Doe. After investigating the first of Doe's crime scenes it is unknown as to why these killings were committed. But, after the second crime scene detectives noticed the word ""GREED"" written behind a painting. It becomes apparent that John Doe is committing murders based off of the seven deadly sins written by Dante Alighieri. Soon the other killings follow: Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Pride. After the murder of pride is committed the detectives have hit a dead end. This apparent defeat is short lived when the killer, still known only as John Doe turns himself in. Through negotiations John Doe exchanges a written confession for the detectives to take him out to a field. It is there when a box is delivered to the field with Brad Pitt's wife's head in the box. Before Pitt is made known of it John Doe tells Pitt how much he envies him, thus committing the sixth sin. Pitt, obviously outraged and furious shoots John Doe in the head committing the seventh and final sin: Wrath. The movies with Brad Pitt being carried off to jail and a distraught Morgan Freeman who goes on to retire. 
se7en has strong Christian undertones and themes. The strongest and most prevalent of these themes are Good v Evil, with evil coming out on top by the end of the movie. Now the problem with evil coming out on top is that it paints Christianity in a bad light. John Doe is a devout Christian and that is why he commits these killings. This battle between good and evil is illustrated by Doe committing killings, with Pitt and Freeman being at least three steps behind. And sadly, the ""resolution"" of our hero, Brad Pitt is not really present. But, the ending of the movie does give a message that coincides with biblical truth and that's shoving Christianity down people's throats. Doe states in the movie that in order for the love of God to be spread, he must first display to the world what is wrong with it. I'm no expert but that is not the kindest way of letting people know about the love of God. As stated before Christianity is of main prevalence in the movie. Christianity is not portrayed in a positive light with the main villain being a radical Christian committing multiple murders in order to spread the gospel. 
On the subject of evil being celebrated in the film, one could argue both points. One side would argue that the fact that evil wins is celebrating it. But, the other side would argue that the film depicts not only evil, but the effects it has on people's surroundings and it paints it in a bad light. And lastly, you can only recommend this movie to people with strong stomachs and people that can handle a film taking their religion hostile. 
All in all, se7en is a masterpiece of David Fincher. It's constant suspense and stomach turning visuals will keep a viewer glued to their seat for the entire runtime."

","Se7en is a mid 90's film with that more rustic picture that we all know very familiarly. The scenes are mostly shot in a darker shade and the transitions are meant to consistently perpetuate a certain ambiance. <br/><br/>What starts out as a classic thriller with detectives being assigned together, despite each others wishes, turns into a gargantuan thriller as well as a life lesson. The life lesson of course is the wisdom to also listen to those with experience, but those with experience also sometimes need to make sure they do not trap themselves inside a specific mindset that otherwise puts blinders on them. The tale is one of cat an mouse, but one that can make you almost agreeable to the killer, to some extent. You're constantly rooting for the good guys while still wondering who we are even chasing. <br/><br/>Through great casting, with remarkable talent, married with an outstanding director vision and on point soundtrack, this film is a product of outstanding entertainment. It's a film that can be watched again and again and you'll always be engaged and fully pulled in.

","After the glorious Silence of the lambs,Hollywood came up with another hypnotic psychological thriller,seven.This time by Traumitized director David Fincher who struggled with the mess that Alien 3 resulted from the guts 20th century fox.
What we witnessed through 128 minutes were some of the most disgusting images never shown but thought in our heads. A nihilistic and innescapable nightmare which represent what every crime thriller should be.
It¬¥s almost mindboggling how good this movie is. such effort was put on the editing room managing a scareful atmosphere with a correct use of a poor palette color. Brad Pitt gives the best moment in his carreer and almost makes you think he will never accomplish what he showed here.
The movie ain¬¥t perfect. It has an inconsistent pacing ,but it¬¥s worthy due to perhaps the best Plot twist since Hitchcock¬¥s Psycho in 1960."
"boozerira","7","0","0","20 March 2018"," One of The Best Crime Dramas. Ever.
","Wow, this is a really messed up film. It is arguably the most famous crime drama ever produced, and I can see why.<br/><br/>The two main characters, Somerset and Mills, played respectively by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, are interesting, no doubt about it. On the flip side, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey , controversy aside, is also a very well played role. His speech near the end of the film is a pinnacle of screenwriting, and easily bumps the entire movie up a few points in my book. Looking around, it seems I'm not the only one who shares this opinion.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, but I didn't like Brad Pitts acting as Mills. It wasn't horrible and I don't like the film any less for it, but it could've been done better. It almost seems at times like the character that Mills actually is and the character that Brad Pitt tries to portray are not the same person. Mills wife talks about him being the funniest person she'd ever met and knowing on the first date that she'd marry him but Pitt's acting makes him seem like a wife beater during some scenes. I seem to be alone in this opinion, but on the down low: Anyone who tells me the, ""WHAT'S IN THE BOX!"" Scene is perfect acting is lying through their own teeth. That's supposed to be the climax of the film, too. <br/><br/>Obviously, the film is very dark and someone might even call it gory. The crimes that are committed to the theme of the deadly seven sins, they're all so nightmarish in their own right. I watched the movie a while back, and I still think about Sloth and Lust sometimes. The job does a good job of making it all feel real. <br/><br/>So, obviously, be prepared to see some stuff you won't forget. But if you somehow haven't seen Se7en yet, I'd recommend it. It's a masterpiece."

Acting,cinematography,direction,background score, editing in Se7en are brilliant except the climax.Film is convincing till 5th murder but goes haywire in climax. Last two sins Envy and Wrath are not convincing.

Starts off as an intriguing, clever detective drama, showing how police go about investigating crimes, developing the characters and meticulously developing the plot. Highly engaging and enthralling. From a point it becomes more than a crime drama, developing some deeper undertones and ending as a dark psychological drama.<br/><br/>Superb ending with a very unpredictable twist. Ties the whole story together perfectly.<br/><br/>Solid performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. The standout performance, however, goes to Kevin Spacey who is chillingly good in his role. Reminded me a lot of his performance in The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Great work by David Fincher, directing only his second feature film (the first was Aliens 3). This movie made his career and created his signature of clever psychological dramas with a twist. Four years, and two movies, later he would surpass even the brilliance of Se7en with one of the greatest movies of all time - Fight Club."

","Very good movie. But could have been better. The killings took place too quickly one after another. The director could have gone for more suspense between the murders. However, the final 2 murders were just awesome (!) in the sense that it really made suspense. The ending was brilliant. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were great. And Kevin Spacey did justice to his cameo role as a real cold blooded murderer. Overall a good modern noir movie. I like the movie and rate it 8 on 10.

","Seven is, in my opinion, one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made and is one of the most significant ones ever made too. The film is essentially a study on evil told on a human level which is the scariest part about the film (despite it not being a horror film). The film provides plenty of shocking scenes, however those scenes aren't its abundance and instead it incorporates many aspects of human nature into the film as well as mythology which is one of the reasons it has remained significant to me.<br/><br/>To begin with, as with all other Fincher films, the film is excellently directed and every second is absorbing and engaging.<br/><br/>Something the film is well-known for is its grisly deaths which we only see the aftermaths or have it just described rather than see the murder take place, however this proves to be equally as (if not more) disturbing than the latter as it leaves our imaginations to conjure up the most messed up things possible. As a matter of fact, there is no violence visible whatsoever in the entire film which proves to be highly effective for the reason that much of it is left to the viewer's imagination and creates an unpleasant atmosphere. The setting of the film also adds plenty of effect; the name of the city that it takes place in is never mentioned, however it is shown frequently raining and always gloomy which straight away sets the scene.<br/><br/>Another thing that is haunting about the film is how the killer has a motivation behind all of his horrifying actions, and a possibly plausible one too. Usually I would find a sadistic killer who enjoys murdering others more disturbing than anything, but the fact that somebody has a reason to go to this length to commit these awful actions is even more frightening.¬† One of the most important elements of the film which helps for the impact is how much depth is given to the two lead characters and how they are incorporated with the story; the characters of Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are essentially a spin on the ""buddy cop scenario"" (for example Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from Lethal Weapon) however their human lives really do help play in with the story. Somerset is a cop who is close to retirement and can't wait to leave the area, whereas Mills in contrast is a young eager cop with a good life and the rest of it ahead of him; the two make a perfect combination as while one is more experienced than the other, they both learn things from each other and also learn things neither of them would ever expect and in the end they're both only human. One of the scenes that displays this best is a scene where the two have dinner with Mills' wife and have a regular conversation about their lives and settling in whilst bringing humour to the situation too which gives them a scene where they're all on the same level as each other.<br/><br/>Mythology plays a key part in the film too; of course in the film the killer uses the Seven Deadly Sins as a motive and these ancient beliefs fuel many of the themes of the film. A character in the film mentions how these events will be long forgotten, however once the cycle is complete a convincing picture of evil has been painted and has left a long-lasting presence to the audience which shows how masterfully each element of this film has been put together in order to create the finishing result.<br/><br/>Overall, Seven is easily one of the greatest crime films ever made and one of the most significant due to its themes, brilliant direction and great characters. A must-watch film in my opinion.<br/><br/>8.7/10""'"

"Robert_duder","10","0","0","24 September 2017"," One of the greatest films ever made period
","Se7en defines a cult classic. It is a film that was created intrinsically to haunt you for years after you've seen it. I've seen it a handful of times and in watching it again just now I realized how brilliantly it was built. It might be one of the finest handcrafted films ever made. It was like each and every shot and moment and scene was made to let you see something different each and every time or unpack the film for years to come. If you look at fan theories and things you think is true that have nothing to do with the actual film you'll understand how deep the movie goes. It is definitely a cinephile's dream in that you can find so much about the film to explore. But even at a base level, the tension is unbelievable. With each character and moment you can't help but feel like the next moment will be someone's last. The dark, brooding city they create (unnamed and always raining) is haunting. The film holds this true film noire feel and the style of the characters and the office is something from a 1940's Detective film and yet the film clearly is modern times. Each time I watch it I want to know more about the world they exist in and yet we never will but watching each time gives you something new.<br/><br/>Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman should have been given Oscars. It might be one of the best Detective teamings in film history. Freeman is the epitome of world weary, ready to retire but haunted by the past cop. Brad Pitt is the idealistic young Detective with the beautiful family just building his life and world and sinking his passion into his work. Both men believe they understand the person they're chasing and yet both underestimate the killer greatly. You're watching this mystery unfold through both men's eyes in different ways and then in the end they both end up on the receiving end of a wicked sense of justice. The killer (I literally refuse to say who it is in case someone hasn't seen this nor knows the twists) is brilliantly played by a well known Hollywood actor. He also should have been given an Oscar. They keep his name from the opening credits and it makes it all the more impactful when he is revealed. He is hands down one of the best ""villains"" or killers in Hollywood history in my opinion. The final scene with the three of them in the field is easily a classic moment. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small but impactful and well played role as Pitt's young wife. Her and Freeman forge an unlikely friendship that works very well. <br/><br/>I never liked Fight Club...it's true...judge me. BUT David Fincher is still an American Hollywood icon. Some of his other films just literally hit 10's for me easily, probably more than any other director other than maybe Spielberg. But Fincher's style is dark and cuts right through to our very core of what makes us human. Call it horror or noire or thriller but somehow he gets these scripts and creates twists and turns you can barely handle and then gets actors to absolutely knock it out of the park. Gone Girl, Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Se7en, The Game, The Social Network, these are films that are stylistic and character driven and in every case puts you in the middle of the action and makes you feel everything. Se7en is the definitely of a modern day classic and if you love crime films this will be your mother ship calling you home. This will forever by one of my favourite films for a myriad of reasons and I think anyone could sit around and talk about it for years to come. 10/10"

I love his demeanor as contrasted against Morgan freeman's character. <br/><br/>I recommend this film for any young actor who wants to see how working together closely with another actor builds BOTH actors' skill-sets.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt had a tendency to ""over-act"" early in his career, but not here.

","The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clich√©s. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays."

For a while I had this one on my sight but I was dodging it and avoiding it because of its age. And I am glad I have finally broke that chain of excuses because Seven is an amazing crime, mystery that is going to my kids ""must watch list"". It is thrilling, scary, twisted, old fashioned and yet modern, realistic, morbid, psychologically well designed and so much more. It is a total theft of attention and a movie that actually requires you to pay attention if you want to know a bit of plot at the end.<br/><br/>It is funny at some occasions, heartwarming and cute sometimes but also heartbreaking and truly sad. I think that wide range of emotions and pretty well mixed mixture of so many feeling is what makes Seven so special.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like was a lunatic that is just barely insane.

","This movie is good solid character development & story telling. It is just short of being a great film. The reason that is too me is that the ending is way too predictable. The clues to the ending are revealed in the middle of the film and I was able to predict it.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as the thinking man Detective. Any thinking man character fits Freeman though even though there is some action in this one, Freeman is the 34 year vet who has never fired his gun. That's good because he doesn't fit the classic thinking & action Detective that Humphrey Bogart did so well.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as the young emotional out of control Detective Mills who gets Freeman teamed with him on the trail of the seven deadly sins killer. He is the young guy who marries his school sweetheart, and that is why it is so predictable. As soon as you realize that Love is one of the sins, you know his wife is in danger.<br/><br/>The film works well as a drama but not as a mystery at the end. Earlier on it works as being unpredictable as the other victims are revealed. Kevin Spacey is very effective in the last reals as the murderer. The thing is, other than driving Detective Mills crazy at the end, his character works out to be much less than your led to believe by the story.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very solid film, but falls just short of being a great film. I think if a real suspense Director like Sir Alfred Hitchcock had gotten a hold of it, the ending would have been done even better. This is the best film this Director has on his resume so far."

","This review contains minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I heard about Se7en from the DVD cover of Saw in which The Guardian compared the two movies, claiming Saw to go ""up to EI8GHT"". Naturally, I expected a movie quite similar to Saw in terms of violence and gore. I didn't get it. The stories of both movies and are relatively similar, but Se7en is more of a crime thriller in which a serial killer murders his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins, claiming the people he killed deserved it. That's where the similarities end.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry on-screen. They are genuinely believable in their roles, the tried and tested 'retiring cop' and 'new cop' formula. The crime scenes they visit aren't shown in great detail, leaving much to the imagination. For instance, the crime scene in which a woman has had her nose cut off ""to spite her face"" (in an effort to teach her that inner beauty is more important than outer) simply shows shots of the body at a medium long shot and shows no close- ups of the woman's actual face.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it's a brilliantly constructed movie that deals out the suspense and tends to keep the viewer guessing. Arguably the highlight is the climax in which all the questions you're asking yourself throughout are answered, not to mention the nasty shock Brad Pitt's character gets. I'm pretty sure that the ending is widely known even with people who haven't seen the movie, as I myself knew the ending prior to watching it.

Andrew Walker is a genius, a fact proved by Seven and consolidated by 8MM. Never mind the acting. Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow and Spacey are multiple Oscar winners and nominees, so we're not talking about them. It goes without saying. As for David Fincher, the movie is obviously his masterpiece (along with Fight Club, of course). The movie is ... just mind blowing. The atmosphere is raw, and unstudied, and it all happens very fast, flowing towards the ending. And as John Doe grins at the end, knowing that he TRULY is the victor, the tension rises every time, and the musical score just makes you breathe on the edge of the seat, that's when the truth is revealed ... to be one of the greatest movies ever made.

","Seven is brilliant across all Academy Award categories with a few minor flaws such as why, at the end, the antagonist needed to be taken far from the claustrophobic city to a spacious, if poignant setting under rural power lines, in order to make his point? Are we supposed to conclude subconsciously that the urban breakdown of ethical behavior is due to, um, the unalterable march of electric civilization? And I'm not certain that the final two victims fit into the seven deadly sins categories without a pry bar. My main criticism of the film is the unrecognized clich√© premise that evil possesses genius, particularly serial psycho killer evil, which, since the Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", seems to have become an attitudinal paradigm. Hey, people, serial killers are brain damaged schlemiels who don't get caught right away, not due to any innate off the charts Hannibal Lector intelligence, but because law enforcement can be klutzy too. I don't like the social programming that is inherent in this thematic stereotype. Evil is stupid, get over it."

I like him so much because, most often, he talks rarely, but still manages to transmit a huge amount of information through para-verbal ways of expressing message : face, eyes, mimic, gestures, head position. etc, just like in ""Seven"". His interpretation was absolutely marvelous, he suggested to me that specific madness, a serial killer has. The duo Pitt-Freeman was good to, not as good as Spacey' performance as the antagonist, but close enough. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, she always had consistent, key roles with great influence on the plot: ""The talented Mr Ripley"", ""A perfect Murder"", ""Shakeaspeare in Love"", not the case here, and you will see why (those of you who didn't see it yet).<br/><br/>I didn't really like the ending, as a human being, it was sick, crazy, horrible. However judging from a distant angle, besides the repulsion , I think it was spectacular, I really appreciated it, because it launched one big message: that a human being can hold on being lucid, only when balanced, when he knows that the persons he loves most are safe. If not, he is driven by emotion and impulse.<br/><br/>This title doesn't focus on the police investigation as on the killer psychology, that is what makes it so special. No shootings, just a twisted sick puzzle, with an extraordinary depressing ending.<br/><br/>As an end, I liked this thriller-drama, because it was a realistic, psychological, crime experience, which showed all of us the human condition, the unimaginable, disgusting thinks a man can do.

","Two cops are after a killer who is choosing his victims based on each of the seven deadly sins. This pretty much sums up the plot. I highly doubt that director David Fincher is an amoral misanthropic person, but he does want his audience to be disturbed. <br/><br/>Se7en, is a good example of the right way to construct a thriller. It is potent and eerie, superbly crafted, nicely paced, even scary at times. The climax feels a little overly contrived as so many do, but I didn't feel cheated too badly. The movie ends on a bit of a funny note and when you stop to think about it, it leaves some things unexplained. <br/><br/>As far a cop buddies go, I can't say that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freemon make a great pair. A film like Se7en requires two lead actors of equal talent, and Pitt is no match for Freemon, although that is just my opinion.<br/><br/>Se7en is a movie that sinks its teeth in deep, and it provides enough fascination to keep a good viewer in his seat for the duration of two hours, but it is not a film for the religious, the squeamish or the weak of mind."

The narrative moves efficiently along providing the necessary shock moments and the work of everyone involved shows a happy center, but it is Fincher's directorial touch that gives the film its sensational and memorable aspects. I cannot fail to point out, however, that the film has been strangely overrated over the years, even being compared to that other excursion into the schizo realms, ""Silence Of The Lambs"". It is not ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it can surely be appreciated for what it is: A graphic Lovecraft-like tale set in a gritty world."

","I watched this disc with the isolated score track, so that's why I wrote a summary out of left field. I'm a David Fincher nut and if he directed the Yellow Pages, I'd be there waiting to see it. (In an amusing analogy, Samuel L. Jackson was on a talk show over a decade ago, I think it was ""Vibe"", and he read out loud from those pages and it was great!)<br/><br/>So when Fincher, who's one of the few to earn the right to be called visionary, makes a movie, it's an event. ""SE7EN"" is full of vile images, depraved people and an outright hideous aura of urban hell. The desire to help, if you could call what homicide detectives work at help, is at the core of this sin in seven parts picture. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is such a commanding actor, you'd believe him in just about any part. Here he is, tired, ready to exit the blood soaked carpet of police work, even if his soul will never truly let him walk away from it. He'd be in his den, looking at crime scene photos from some long ago unsolved mystery and put in triple overtime in the unpaid retired police department.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's character can stand to learn a lot from his senior partner, but he can't settle down or wait unless he absolutely has to. His impetuousness almost gets them in over their heads and John Doe (played by you know who) enjoys the sick game he unfurls like some epic serialized saga from the bowels of hell. Pitt and the mystery man are on a collision course and something has got to give.<br/><br/>This film is so rich visually and it's bizarre to call a tour of the evil human soul yanked out for all to witness ""rich"". Try to forget any shot you've ever seen from a Fincher picture and it's pretty much impossible. The man's style is like the old masters painting on celluloid.<br/><br/>""SE7EN"" is best appreciated after a while without having watched it, at least that's how I approach the repeated views. Andrew Walker gave us a script which pretty much is the best fictional interpreting of a madman's mind. I doubt anyone will come up with anything more devilishly clever."

FBI-Agents are greasy and being paid off, as are junkies so that the police can hide their illegal methods. Somerset is one who is able to recognize the paradox of this world, but as he sympathizes with apathy he does not react, maybe because he doesn't know how. John Doe eventually starts wicked measures. He seems to combine Somerset's cognition and Mills' zest for action. David Fincher found impressing images for this complex plot and composed them together in a ingenious way. He achieves to tickle the best of the craftsmanship out of Pitt and Freeman. In it's whole appearance the film illustrates how it has been a landmark for the thriller genre, besides ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", being it's main reference."
"DQGladstone","Null","0","0","6 October 2009"," In the beginning, there was darkness...
","Without conflict, there is no drama. You have to give this film credit, there's no lack of conflict.<br/><br/>The first dialogue we hear is when the less competent detective tells the extra-competent detective (Freeman) that his question is stupid and he's glad he's leaving the force. That's ""envy"" speaking, by the way, between members of the same caste, ""The Detectives"".<br/><br/>Somerset and Mills don't get along; Tracy and David, the Lovers, greet each other at the door with ""Hi, loser"" and ""Hi, idiot"". Love, exciting and new...<br/><br/>""sWAT comes before dicks"". Every individual branch of ""The Force"" has a problem of caste with every other branch- the uniforms and dicks have little respect for each other, the dicks and sWAT are battling for precedence, like nerds and jocks, with the jocks calling for the nerds when they find themselves in over their ""brawn, no brain"" heads. Conflict.<br/><br/>I've seen this film before and I've always been a fan of the comedy moments. I like when Mills takes his tie off the hanger already knotted, when he brings Somerset a full glass of wine (with Somerset's reaction) and when Mills wakes up and finds himself leaning on Somerset. These are the moments when you wonder, was that in the script or did they add it while shooting? Mills gets CLIFFNOTES of the classics with a shout of ""Good work, officer!"" juxtaposed with ""Poetry writing faggot"", the multitude of air-fresheners in the ""Sloth"" crime scene. Can you write that stuff? <br/><br/>The rain and darkness of the cinematography were perfect.<br/><br/>Weaknesses (only 2): Yes, the scene between Paltrow and Freeman was there only to set up the ending. It isn't realistic to tell your husband's partner that you're pregnant before you tell your husband. As real as that may be in a shitworld, it's artificial and plot-serving.<br/><br/>Mills is being set up as some sort of out-of-town wunderkind without any explanation, justification or background. Though Pitt is brilliant, Mills is not and I wonder, how did he ever solve a case back home?<br/><br/>End of weaknesses. Enough with the weaknessess. But did Jonathan Doe kill the dogs, too? Those rambunctious Dobermans?<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is excellent as the strings-pulling dark messiah; his ""Dark Genius"" is superior to the ""Light Genius"" of Freeman which is it's own statement with Jonathan Doe sacrificing his life in the name of Dark Truth. ""Light"" delays ""Darkness"" but can't stop it.<br/><br/>The sWAT team was presented as a bunch of faux-macho idiots with all their ""stupid authority"" posturing and intimidation yelling/swearing which is fine but why weren't they wearing helmets? Was this some vanity on the part of the sWAT actors? ""Listen, Mr. Fincher, me and the guys were talking and my girlfriend may not be able to see my face when I yell ""Get up, you sack of crap!"" if I have a sWAT helmet on. And it's raining, too, and it might be uncomfortable and I gave myself a CREWcut and you won't be able to even TELL, if I have the helmet on, see."""

","Although I agree with the majority of the critics that ""Se7en"" (1995) is one of the outstanding horror movies of our time, I still have to warn to overrate it. It is definitely not a masterpiece like, e.g., Murnau's ""Nosferatu"", where you will remember the first appearance of Max Schreck in the gate with a far remote camera until your last day.<br/><br/>First, I do not understand why it was considered necessary to put a subsidiary story into the main story. ""Se7en"" has a default dramaturgy, due to the 7 sins, as, e.g. ""The Lodger"" (2007) has a default structure, due to the killings of Jack the Ripper, not to mention the ""Zodiac"" killer movies, etc. Why was it necessary to put the character of Brad Pitt besides the character of Morgan Freeman? Both are in the rank of detectives - the older is a highlight, the younger a zero - the older stands above marriage, the younger is unable to be a good husband and future father and meanwhile enjoys his three of four dogs. But not enough with that: The writer of ""Se7en"" considered it also important to build in a cross-relation, when Paltrow's character contacts Freeman without letting know Pitt. This one scene as well as their common gathering for a dinner are without any sense for the story, it is painful for Freeman's character - and for the real audience.<br/><br/>Second, after having watched this movie a second time, it has lost all of its initial effects. This has nothing to do with the fact that the highlights of the killings as well as the killer are known now. Movies like ""Se7en"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"", in opposition to, e.g., ""The Ring"", have simply not enough glue to stick so in your head so that you can watch enjoy ""Nosferatu"", ""It's a wonderful life"", ""My cousin Vinnie"", ""As good as it gets"", only to mention so few. What is it that makes a film stick in your head? What is this semiotic glue that makes the film go on in your head when you leave the cinema or take out the DVD from the player? If someone would find the mechanism, it would be easy to construct ideal movies that would guaranteed be block-buster hits."

Brad Pitt plays a detective new on the force, and Morgan Freeman plays his partner and mentor. These two men are clearly from opposite ends of the spectrum, which makes the plot even more interesting. Together, the detectives slowly enter the mind of a killer who patterns his crimes after the Seven Deadly Sins. Kevin Spacey plays the insanely psychotic killer who has a surprise twist for the detectives. The climax of Seven is unlike any movie or book out there. It will leave you begging for more.

These are the three characters you would probably see if the film was made fifty years ago or in fifty years from now. All three play their parts very well and the whole experience is an enjoyable tale. The film is only just over two hours but it seemed longer to me and although once you have seen the film you will know the ending it doesn't mean that you cant watch it again. If the film is quality like this one you can just enjoy it because it is that good. It holds your attention and anybody watching should just let it envelop them.

""Seven"" is still a good film, containing many moments of genuine suspense, and it's always engaging.<br/><br/>In murder mysteries, the protagonists are usually stock characters, leaving the only real acting to the villain. Not so here. Mills and Somerset are clearly different, and Pitt and Freeman are up to the task of making them seem different. Somerset is quiet, reflective and patient. Mills is the exact opposite: arrogant, hyper and quick to action. He only wants the answers, but not the context to understand the kind of person he's pursuing. Gwyneth Paltrow is largely wasted, but she makes full use of what she's given.<br/><br/>Many thrillers have unexpected plot twists, and ""Seven"" is no different.

","""If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil, I mean if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations, but he's not the devil. He's just a man."" ‚Äì Detective Somerset<br/><br/>Seven days. Seven deadly sins. Seven murders. Someone has a message and wants to be heard loud and clear. It's up to seasoned detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and cocky newcomer David Mills (Brad Pitt) to track down the killer, who in the end, proves to be anything but ordinary and routine.<br/><br/>Directed by David Fincher (""Fight Club"") and drawn from a script by Andrew Kevin Walker (""8mm""), ""Se7en"" is perhaps one of the most unsettling, most gruesome and most unforgettable thrillers to come from the 90's. Giving even ""The Silence of the Lambs"" a run for its money, Fincher's film is chock full of moody atmosphere and gloomy set-pieces. Rarely do the two detectives stumble into a brightly lit room, and the rain that plagues their non-descript, crime-filled city refuses to let up until the killer is revealed. Coming off of the troubled production that was ""Alien 3,"" Fincher was given a second shot, and with this film, defines a style all his own that had been plagiarized to death by the turn of the century. The cinematography and ambient direction are fresh for its time and hold up today ‚Äì at fourteen years old, the film still looks stunning ‚Äì and serves up a truly unique experience. The world created in this film may be too much to stomach for some, as it shows humanity at its worst with a serial killer who considers himself a hero, a savior even. Occasionally the film breaks for some slight situational humor that only serves to further humanize our two main leads, but for the most part, it's a wholly disturbing and gut-wrenching experience, right down to the final reveal of the killer and the inescapable ending.<br/><br/>In a way, ""Se7en"" could be seen as the anti-""Lethal Weapon"" -- A buddy-cop comedy without the comedy or the buddies. Instead, our well-worn pro, just six days from retirement, has been beaten down and drained by the world he lives in and is only leaving the job to salvage what humanity is left inside of himself. The arrogant new guy is fueled by past successes and a hunger for action that perhaps his older counterpart once had but tragically lost. The shocking ending only serves to juxtapose the two characters. Morgan Freeman is solid as always, while Brad Pitt overacts the part just a hair. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife sweet and as human as possible, while Kevin Spacey has a role in this film that can only be described as iconic. With a great cast under the brilliant direction of a budding, young and talented director, ""Se7en"" is as close to perfection as the horror/thriller genre gets."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","22 June 2009"," A clever and stylish thriller
","David Fincher's ""Seven"" has become something of a modern classic since its release nearly 15 years ago. The film focuses on a pair of detectives tracking a serial killer who has drawn his inspiration from the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride & lust.<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one. Morgan Freeman is excellent in the role of a burnt-out cop on his way out the door as soon as he trains in his replacement (Brad Pitt). Pitt does a good job as a brash young detective itching for a shot at a big-time case. Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pitt's wife, delivers a solid performance and the rest of the cast is about average. It should also be noted that the (Oscar-winning) actor who plays the killer isn't listed in the opening credits, so that's a bit of a surprise for the audience.<br/><br/>The screenplay is quite clever but that cleverness almost seems at odds with the film's gritty realism. The killer's intricate plans are the sort of thing that you only encounter in the movies. The characters are somewhat clich√©d and Freeman is handed a few well-worn lines that I think only he could have pulled off. Given this shortcoming, the ending succeeds more through shock value than in creating a response based on our attachment to the characters.<br/><br/>Fincher's direction is well-handled throughout and merges with the cinematography and editing to create a unique, atmospheric look. While there may be a bit of an emphasis on style over substance the director manages to keep from going overboard. The soundtrack also contributes greatly to the atmosphere, mixing contemporary music and an effective score from Howard Shore.<br/><br/>""Seven"" is indeed a quality thriller but I would hesitate to rank it alongside the likes of ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Thus, I think that the current IMDb ranking (#32) is unreasonably high but I do recommend the film."
"deathscythe_42","10","0","0","11 June 2009"," One of the greatest murder mysteries ever filmed
","Director David Fincher entered the world of directing on the heels of one of the most classic American Sci-Fi franchises of all time, the Alien series. He followed James Cameron's classic ""Aliens"" with the not quite as critically acclaimed Alien 3. However, he has since shown us that he can indeed compete with the likes of Cameron and other A-list directors. He is most widely known for the immense cult classic ""Fight Club"" and Oscar monster ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", but his first stand-alone film after Alien 3 was the brilliant and classy crime thriller ""Seven."" This film proves that right from the start Fincher was a force to be reckoned with. This of course isn't to underplay the excellence of the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, or the intense and spine-tingling score by Howard Shore, or the excellent performances by all actors, including the actor who plays the killer (as the actor was kept under wraps during the marketing for this film, and isn't in the credits until the very end, i won't reveal who it is but it's one of my person favorites). This movie is a prime example of all elements of great film-making coming together to make something that is simply beautiful.<br/><br/>Probably the strongest element of this film is the way it unfolds. ""Seven"" is a master class in story-telling. The plot is handled with care and expertise. Fincher knows just the right times to be subtle, and make you really pay attention to catch everything, and then when to throw something directly in your face. While the film tells the story of probably one of the most sadistic and disturbing serial killers of all time, none of the killings are actually shown on screen. Instead, the film crew used other means of conveying the gruesome details, things like dialogue and pictures. It gives the characters a much better chance to drive the story forward, and it forces you to use your imagination which makes the more disturbing points all the more haunting.<br/><br/>While this film really is not an action movie, the small bit of action there is in the film is very exciting, and the dark, haunting nature of the film will leave a lasting impact on you for sure. This is helped along by Howard Shore's subtle yet fantastic score.<br/><br/>Seven is without a doubt one of the greatest murder mysteries ever filmed. It is a lesson in suspense and plot-development and a triumph for all involved in its making. Make no mistake, this is not a happy film, but it's a must-see for all true fans of good cinema."

","You have to start with the key thing. This movie has one of the most stupendous endings you're ever going to see. Thrilling, revolting, excruciating. You can put yourself in the place of any of Pitt, Freeman or Spacey and it just has to play out this way. The unbelievable tension is created in a seemingly static situation. Spacey and Freeman watch Pitt. Pitt knows he's being gamed, knows what he must not do, for everyone's sake, and yet, the provocation! Who could not respond to that provocation? When I feel myself doing the stupid, irrational thing, I often think of this movie. Maybe this is the layman's example of temporary insanity, when a totally understandable emotional force overwhelms one's intellect.<br/><br/>Wonderfully acted of course by Freeman and Spacey and Pitt. In my opinion, pretty much the only Brad Pitt movie I would say that about, maybe save Thelma and Louise. Spacey's psychotic intellect suggests the more famous Dr. Lecter, though Spacey doesn't have as much time or cards to play in his end-of-movie role."

However, this film is as far from an uninteresting romp as can be.<br/><br/>I am willing to bet that there is no one who can walk away from this film and have it not stay with them for a life time. Not only is it shocking and almost hypnotic in its gripping direction, it will also make the viewer question the world and how society really works within it.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays an old Policeman who has seen far to much of the darkness in the world, so much so, that he is starting to believe that darkness is all that remains in it. This draws him to a decision to retire and leave police work behind, bringing along his replacement Detective Brad Pitt. They do not immediately get along (but don't worry he doesn't jump off a roof with a suicide jumper to gain respect from his ageing partner) but due to their joint discovery of a body, they are forced into each others company.<br/><br/>They soon come to the conclusion that a serial killer is on the loose, and find that for one thing, they share enthusiasm for the job if nothing else. Freeman's character is fascinated with the Killer, and his ideas and beliefs realising that the conclusion the killer has come to in his study of the world is similar to his own, but dealt with in different ways. Pitt shares no compassion for the killer who is later discovered to be played by Kevin Spacey in a scene which is very member able to say the least.<br/><br/>The killings are sick and shocking and create a certain amount of unease while watching. You will dismiss the that no human being in their right mind could do such a thing, and anyone to commit such acts would be insane, but i guarantee by the end of the film you will question this.<br/><br/>If you want something interesting as well as fresh to fill your mind from the world of film i recommend you try this.<br/><br/>This film proves that David Fincher films are often fantastic, but only once sat through to the very end. I do feel with Mr Fincher that the raw substance that each of his films provide is untasted until a good hour into his films.<br/><br/>This is really a thought provoking, and a fantastic and yet horrifying masterpiece, but misses out on it's final two stars due to the general lazing about of the first hour."

","I have always believed that a great movie only comes as a result of not only good performances plus good script plus entertainment plus novelty plus technical prowess. All this has to be complemented by what the movie is trying to say, and on that respect, Se7en is a winner all the way. I see this movie as a complete portrayal of maturation for Morgan Freeman's character. Somerset from the initial frames of this movie constantly mentions the notion of 'I've had enough of this city'. All these culminates to the scene in the bar between Freeman and Pitt where Freeman's Somerset talk about apathy and justifies his views of a trodden world. But the turning point arrives when Mills tells him that Somerset wants to believe in it so that it justifies his decision to retire. After that, we see a constant culmination of the dilemma that Freeman's character undergoes up till the final point, where he remains calm and doesn't lose his grip on the things that happen around him. It is a movie about self-realization as to how Freeman realizes for himself than he is capable to handle even the worst of situations, no matter how much they hurt him. Morgan Freeman easily delivers a performance of a lifetime, and David Fincher shows his touches of brilliance, even though its pretty apparent that a stellar star cast of Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and Gwyneth easily eluded his direction. The film would have been a normal fare had any other director taken this project, because the ending might not have been altered if not for Fincher. The alteration is beautiful to say the least, this new ending certainly separates this film from being just another well-made crime thriller to a meaningful fare with themes regarding humanity and strength."

","The seven deadly sins are the subject of David Fincher's enormously popular and cult hit Se7en. On a side note, I'm not sure how a 7 looks like the letter V but we digress, I suppose. Moving on, this film is both terrifying and tragic, and offers a wonderful detective story with two great performances. Morgan Freeman plays Detective William Somerset, a patient and by-the-book officer, who makes decisions with care but is not afraid to act instinctively. Brad Pitt plays Detective David Mills, the antithesis to Freeman's deductive Somerset. Mills is rash and often acts impulsively. The interaction between these two characters develops along with the twisting plot of the film, centering upon murders based upon the seven cardinal sins.<br/><br/>The film is at its core a detective story with two very different men trying to work with each other to find a serial killer. Like a Silence of the Lambs, this film uses its characters to develop the plot since it is the inherent weaknesses of each victim that the murderer bases his kills upon. Like the detectives, we similarly uncover each murder and sin, each becoming more grisly than the former. The film does force us to think a little and make heads and tails of the whole situation. Do we feel sympathy for these victims who are extreme embodiments of each respective sin? It's questions like these that make Se7en such a thought provoker. It is disturbing and relentless, barely giving a breather to the viewer. Either the two are discovering a murder or they are fervently trying to connect the dots. The suspense is great and helps the film nicely overall.<br/><br/>The performances turned in by the cast are for the most part, well done. Freeman plays a little too close to the chest but even so, he does a good job portraying an intelligent and conservative detective. Pitt does an outstanding job and gets stronger and stronger as the film progresses. He really is an officer that I loved to hate so bravo on a job well done. On the other hand, Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Mills' wife, Tracy, is boring and heavy-handed. Both a symptom of the writing and Paltrow's mediocre acting, Tracy ends up being a character hard to sympathize with or even feel good for. This does ultimately end up hurting the film towards the end and it's a shame too. There are some surprises and twists here so I won't spoil them but do be wary.<br/><br/>While the screen writing and characters are fairly strong, the cinematography is all over the place. The murder scenes are haunting and baleful, and add a great layer to the film without being gratuitously grotesque. However, in other parts, the camera work is not up to par and the film suffers. The whole ending sequence is mishandled by the camera crew and ends up ruining the whole mystique. The score is powerful when it needs to be and subtle when it needs to be. In any case, it is not tremendously memorable but it does give atmosphere to certain scenes. Some of the dialogue is memorable especially the closing lines of the film, which help the film finish well.<br/><br/>Overall, Se7en, (still don't get the 7 in the middle) is a good strong film that will disturb and is likely not for the faint of heart. There are strong performances, unsettling sequences and an overall moody score that does bolster the visuals. However, a sloppy ending, some unfulfilled promise from an all-star cast, and some suspect camera work at times, keep this film from truly being great. Definitely a film worth checking out though and one that tells a good story with good characters."

The open question as the movie came to its end was how the murders depicting envy and wrath were going to be committed. That's done in a quite shocking and horrific way. I can't say it was a surprise - I guessed what was in the box addressed to Mills as soon as the box was introduced - but still it was a grand finale (if one can call it that) to a pretty decent movie.<br/><br/>The performances from Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset and Kevin Spacey as ""John Doe"" were especially effective - which they should have been, since both were pretty standard characters for the actors. Somerset was the experienced, street-wise detective who dispensed advice freely, and Spacey was the - well - kind of spacey, quirky character that he pulls off so well in so many movies. Brad Pitt was less effective as the young Detective Mills - Somerset's partner. He wasn't bad, but somehow neither his performance nor the character connected with me. Gwyneth Paltrow was underused as an actress, although her character (if not Paltrow herself) plays a central role in the end.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to have a bit of a ""Silence of the Lambs"" feel to it, with the serial killer angle and the mind games being played with the police, and the real attention getter through most of the movie was to find out how the deadly sins were going to be represented by the murders that were being committed. I was a little concerned that this had the potential to turn into little more than a gore-fest, but that didn't happen. There are some gruesome shots of the victims, but for the most part the focus was on the psychological dimensions of the story. All in all I thought this was a very good movie; ""Seven"" gets a 7 from me."
"Det_McNulty","8","0","0","12 April 2007"," ""Se7en"" Takes The Viewer Inside A World Relentlessly Threatened By Danger. An Indisputable Example Of A Modern Masterpiece
","Back in '95 David Fincher released a film named Se7en, following his cruelly underrated '93 box-office-disaster Alien3 (view the director's cut and you might understand what I mean). In the sense of the American film industry, Se7en was the film which established Fincher's talent and from there on in he had more freedom on the films he wanted to create.<br/><br/>Se7en is a dark tale of morality, depicting two cops who both find themselves stuck inside a deadly game. One of the cops is Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), a man planning to retire from the job and the environment of which he deems unfit and too bleak to live in, a place where he believes ""apathy"" is welcomed. The other cop, Mills (Brad Pitt) has recently required his detective badge and has moved to the city of Chicago to help bring ""light"" to the city, while building a ""hero"" reputation. Both detectives have different views on the squalid world they are surrounded by and both use different methods when performing a task. The detectives soon find themselves obsessed with capturing a vicious criminal who is terrifying the area with bizarre ""deadly sins"" killings and leaving puzzling and mostly unusable evidence at the scene of the crimes.<br/><br/>The narrative which Se7en follows is one that is structured with such precision that you become apart of the film. The viewer becomes grasped by the story's compelling nature and the manipulative unanswered questions. Yet, here lies one of the few faults with Se7en, this being the film's tendency to lose the connectivity of scenes. At times this can detract the viewer, while also making subplots feel cut-off and halted abruptly. Although, this is not too significantly noticeable, it is still there and something which stops the film deserving a definitive ""masterpiece"" status.<br/><br/>The film still surges with its constant excitement and attention to detail, making it a film of such finesse that it remarkably works as a delicate counter-piece to the horrific story being told. I consider the pivotal scene in Se7en to be the chase scene, the scene whereby the viewer captures their first glimpse of John Doe (with the exclusion of the infamous opening-credits). It is a scene where my adrenaline started pumping, a scene so expertly thought out with such visceral realism, taking the characters to their most primitive of instincts. This is where the set-pieces come in; the set-pieces in Se7en are built with glaring authenticity and unsettling detail, retaining the disturbing exuberance the film follows.<br/><br/>Se7en is a film that goes leaps and bounds for the modern ""cops vs. criminals"" genre; it provides a level of rarely matched excitement and adrenaline-pumping emotion. It is a film so genuine that by the end of the film you will have built up a bond with the two protagonists. It is remarkable just how exact and precise the film is in its style, atmospherically edited (with the exception of the connectivity) and wonderfully layered offering much analysis for the viewer. One of the film's optimum features are the multi-dimensional characters, the characters of Se7en are ones who you care for and are characters who have robust personality to study. It is impossible not to adore the film's appetite for its characters, such as the clashing viewpoints, offering the viewer to make their own personal judgement and also the character's reactions to the repulsive behaviour which has engulfed the city. All this is due to how astonishingly rigorous and convincing the performances are, the actors all develop their own persona and you have to take note of the smaller details to gain a true understanding of the characters.<br/><br/>Se7en is a film providing sour, surfaced-toned noir to enable the merging of absorbing grittiness and ""lucid"" fantasy, etched with painful realism. The film details every dark corner, capturing a feel of vulnerability and the general taste of fear through highly alluring, yet horribly detached environments, ultimately providing a cold and painfully evocative atmosphere. The cinematography is rigorous, while still being very open in its wonderfully ""edgy"" style. The camera is fixated on the tiniest detail, capturing the emotion on the lens through the exposed characters in wide, yet horribly tight environments. The make-up is just another example of the laborious amount of time and pre-development which was spent on creating the film's ""gothic fairytale"" manner. Even with all the technical brilliance, it is still the acting which remains the film's finest feature.<br/><br/>More importantly than anything Se7en remains one of the finest films in its genre, providing a relief from your typically simplistic Hollywood film. Instead the film offers a depressing morality tale which motivates the viewer into thinking about what will occur next and giving you taste of the horrific crimes detectives become obsessed with solving. Ultimately, few films can succeed in gripping you as much as the inexplicable brilliance of Se7en."
"The_Double-Thinker","10","0","0","5 February 2007"," Brilliant take on a worn out concept
","This movie is easily one of my all time favorites. The movie revolves around two detectives who are trying to solve a series of murders. The murders all, some way or another, revolve around the seven deadly sins. In summarizing the plot I am reminded of countless B-movie slasher movies i have seen. The Killers in those movie always choose their victims based on some sort of imperfection (Sluts, Rick Kids, Jerks, etc.), as does the killer in this movie. But this is where this movie becomes great and what sets it apart from other horror movies. The way the killer eliminates his victims is both clever and haunting, and the directer shows very little violence on screen. He leaves the viewer with blurry and far away pictures depicting what happened at the scene of the crime, leaving the viewer to conjure up their own gory images. This is an especially effective technique in this day and age, where people are often desensitized to violence and can no longer be shocked by what they see on screen. This movie is truly a modern masterpiece,with one of the best, most shocking and disturbing endings i have ever seen."

","A fascinating movie. My best friend said that it's disturbing because it could happen. That may sound simple, but that is why it is so terrifying, disturbing, brilliant, and great. The characters are certainly believable. Not only is there a search for a killer, but a search for a way to work together (i.e. a fantastic battle of ego that could destroy their chance to achieve their common goal). It's an appropriately dark movie with light moments that manifest the humanity that is being attacked. Will ""good"" be overcome? Will evil prevail? Will good destroy itself allowing evil to continue? While these questions apply to Se7en, they do make for intense discussions outside of the realm of the movie. Many situations in Se7en will make the viewer think ""what would I have done, how would I react?"". This is an example of the film's power. When a film starts to make you examine your own life, morals, and actions, it has become a catalyst within society, and not just a piece of celluloid that entertains."
"freaky_dave","9","0","0","16 October 2006"," Depressing yet shockingly real
","A depressing yet effective thriller with a completely shocking and disturbing ending that will have you thinking about it for a long time. Yes that is the simplest way to explain David Fincher's Seven.<br/><br/>Seven is a thinking film that will have one questioning society and life in general. Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, a serial killer, and he is perfect in the role. He chooses each one of the victims because they are guilty of each one of the seven deadly sins which include gluttony, sloth, pride, greed, lust, envy, and wrath. What he does to these people is downright horrible and utterly disgusting, but he believes that he is doing God's work by using passages out of books like Dante's Inferno and others. We as the viewers are disgusted by what he does, but during his long monoloque near the end we can't help but wonder that what he's doing seems justifiable in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>The detectives on the case are Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Detective Mills (Brad Pitt). Both are also great in their roles. They are hot on John Doe's trail. One, Mills, the new kid on the block, does his job because he wants to improve things to make the world a safer place. The other, Somerset, is much older and has a very cynical outlook on life. Somerset's opinion is that he just wants to retire and escape from all the madness because he feels nothing will ever get better. Both of their personalities collide, but they continue to work together to solve the case.<br/><br/>Gwneth Paltrow plays Tracy Mills. She is Mill's wife and hates that they have moved to the city. Her part in the movie is a small one and a minor role, but it becomes much more important then anybody could've ever suspected.<br/><br/>This movie, splendidly directed by David Fincher, is dreary, dark, and depressing, but it is a very well made film which has some very strong points that it wants to make. It is well paced and filled with subtle moments that will lead to a very strong impact at the end. I didn't care to much for Fincher's Alien 3 because of how depressing it was, but that was a franchise that had already been started and was never really expected, in my opinion anyway, to take the darker turn that it does. With Seven we are not making a sequel, so it is a whole new ball game, and this time Fincher's skill shines through.<br/><br/>The ending, as I said above is completely appalling, but it is never completely unexpected, and that is because of the smaller subtleties during the movie's running time which helps prepare us for what happens. I was never caught off guard by what finally happens, and that is why this film doesn't quite get a perfect rating. However, if anybody was to ask me if they should see this movie I would say hell yes. I would also tell them to be prepared for some very nasty scenes which will make your blood run cold."

","I can't recall watching a film as cruel, hard and impressive as ""Seven"". But I think that in this case if the movie had been ""softer"" it would have lost impact and intensity.<br/><br/>Definitely a thriller, ""Seven"" is about the chasing of a serial killer who brutally murders his victims in a sort of punishment for each one's different capital sin. The film is very well conducted by director David Fincher and it is ""catching"" right from the start. Good sort of pale color that helps the atmosphere, well handled action sequences and terrible crime scenes (though they help here to understand how completely out of his mind the killer is).<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both good as the policemen in charge of the case, and Gwynneth Paltrow is a good support with a more important role than it seems.<br/><br/>If you like suspense films and can stand some real hard scenes and a devastating finale, don't miss this one.

","I loved Se7en. Engrossing, mysterious plot that you can read about in other reviews. It's been said enough how excellent this movie is, but I don't remember reading anything about Brad Pitt's performance being overrated so I figured I'd share my thoughts. Having seen Fight Club before watching any earlier Pitt movies, I was mostly disappointed with Brad's performances (except for a few). His casual conversations and such in Se7en seemed unique to Pitt (a couple of head scratches, looking around a lot, very confident dialogue, etc.), but the emotionally intense scenes (especially the final scene), which are extremely important, seemed very awkward and unrealistic given the circumstances of the plot's brutal context. My opinion of Brad Pitt's less than desirable performance in Se7en didn't ruin the movie for me, but without the awkwardness delivered in those crucial emotional scenes, this movie would be a flawless film."

The characters were very well developed, and perfectly foiled-Somerset being very particular about everything and Mills keeping his ties tied after he takes them off, to name one. All actors are dead on and couldn't be better. The best part of all is that even though I guessed the ending as soon as Doe reveled his plea and plan with Mills and Somerset, I could still not loose interest. Yes, I knew what was going to happen, but the film is just so good that I stayed with it.<br/><br/>The only thing that really keeps this movie down is that Mills knew he was going into a very high risk situation for the final scene, but did not even try to see his wife before he left. The character was developed to show that he loved her, and she didn't even have a job to be busy! There is no reason for him not to have seen her before he left. Because of this gigantic plot hole, I cannot rate this above an 8. If he was developed to not show his love for her, and the ending was the same, I think it would have been better (Plot and Emotion)."

","I take a very middle-of-the-road stance on this movie, despite the high rating. To me, those who call it genius, unprecedented, etc. are misunderstanding it just as much as those who think of it as lowbrow horror and violence (which makes no sense by the way, as there is almost no violence shown the entire movie, part of what makes it more effective). The goal as I see it was to take the detective genre and turn it inside-out. Use every convention they could and somehow make it original while mixing in the pessimism and cynicism Fincher is deservedly famous for. Thus, by definition it can't be ""unprecedented."" But to me, doing one simple thing nearly perfect is a great deal more satisfying than trying to do something genius badly. One of the best films since its release by far, and I'm sorry but Fight Club just can't match it. To see the work of the most talented directors of our generation, look no further."

","Movies, like music, often help to define the decade in which they originate from. I am 32, so I happen to love a lot of movies from the 80's. Movies like Top Gun, Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire, Die-hard and Lethal Weapon very much define the 80's for me.<br/><br/>In my opinion the three most defining movies of the 90's are Pulp Fiction, Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en. Those three movies best capture the mood of the 90's. Smart, dark, cool, gritty and witty. Everything, after all, that the 80's were not (young, dumb and full of cum).<br/><br/>I can best describe the movie Se7en as a combination of Taxi Driver and Silence Of The Lambs. It is a close look at the ugly underbelly of society. The people and things we look away from when we pass them by on the streets. More than that, it is a disturbingly close look at the ugliness that we all possess on some level.<br/><br/>The plot and screenplay in Se7en are superb. The best there is. The story is simple yet that of genius. A veteran cop (Somerset/Freeman) serving his final 7 days of duty is paired up with a younger cop (Mills/Pitt) who is ready to kick the world in the ass and they are both after a maniacal serial killer who is completing his masterpiece offing 7 victims for 7 deadly sins. Somerset is jaded and cold while Mills is eager and hopefull. A perfect match. Somerset is black and Mills is white. Absolute genius.<br/><br/>I can remember being in absolute awe when I first viewed this movie in the theatre. Nothing I'd seen since Taxi driver compared. It's unabashed view of society is unparalleled. Even our two ""heros"" aren't terribly admirable. I am actually embarrassed to admit that I understood the serial killers disgust with society during his explanation of his masterpiece to Somerset and Mills. That's not to say I justified his actions. And the casting of the serial killer? Again, absolute genius. Especially because the actor asked that his name not appear in the movie's advertisements or billing.<br/><br/>Se7en is not for the faint of heart, but it IS thoroughly enjoyable for fans of cinema. It satisfies on every level."

The actors themselves are some of the best in the business. Kevin Spacey plays a phenomenal role, and can be seen in even better form in The Usual Suspects. Brad Pitt plays an outstanding role, which was characteristic for him in the mid and late 90's. Mogan Freeman plays an excellent cop, which juxtaposes him against his portrayal of Red in the Shawshank Redemption, also a notable viewing.<br/><br/>This movie's all-star cast is a great treat, but it does lack in some development early on in the film.

","I brought this film from virgin mega-stores not to long ago, for ¬£3.99... I had heard that it was a classic horror/thriller of the 90's so i brought it. I went home and watched it that night to find one of the best movies I have ever seen. you should go out and buy it for a lot more than that,(but don't because you know that the second you do you'll turn around and see it for cheaper and then hate yourself for being impatient.)<br/><br/>I had also heard that it was gratuitously gory and violent, upon watching the film i was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion violence can be used to great effect, and also ,in my experience, films that have been certified '18' because of their violence are often over the top and unnecessary. For example 'Kill Bill' although I found it entertaining (to a point) you start to think that no character in the films life is important because they are being disembowelled left, right and centre, and as soon as you take that away, you take away the reality of it, because in real life every life matters and you cannot just chop through 88 people with a samurai sword. So i thought that this may perhaps be the case for Seven. I was, however, wrong. at points David Fincher used extreme violence but it works well and makes the audience root even more for Mills(Pitt) and Somerset(Freeman) because you want them to solve the crime and be done with this disgusting world (Morgan Freeman is retiring after the case, and Brad Pitt's wife wants to go back to the city they recently moved from).<br/><br/>Another great thing about Seven is that not only does it thrill and disturb but it also makes you question the world that we live in. The film is set in the modern day, but in no particular place. It is a dark and grim city filled with crime and corruption, and it makes the audience really think about crime, helped along by Morgan Freemen who often talks about whether or not crime will stop, or will it go on for ever and why.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant, the contrast between Mills and Somerset, Somerset being the old, experienced cop on the verge of retirement and Mills, the hot-headed rookie. One of my favourite parts is when Morgan Freeman tells Pitt he should read up on the crimes, and gives him a list of books to get. Later we see a policeman handing the revision notes versions of the books (including 'Dante's Inferno') to Pitt. Kevin Spacy plays 'the bad guy' fantastically, a calm slimy, religious fanatic, who's voice makes you want to turn the TV off and stop watching. The end sequence is very emotional and the tension is increased by a ten minute long car journey with the two heroes in front and Kevin Spacy in the back cleverly named John Doe, the police slang for an unidentified body.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film, scary, tense thought provoking and even funny at times, definitely a classic, and if you have ¬£3.99 i know what i'd spend it on..."

Brad Pitt is the other lead and does a fair job but the reason to watch this movie is because of Freeman and his typically sterling performance. Here they play two detectives on the trail of a gruesome murderer. This is one of those rare movies that was hyped and it lived up to the hype. The publicity surrounding this movie with it's two leads and the theme of the film was immense and the movie was as good as hyped. The mystery kept you guessing, the, thrills kept you a little tense throughout, and the ending was a shocker.<br/><br/>The key to this movie was that the script told an intense and somewhat complicated story in a simple manner. The cinematography, the score, and the overall atmosphere of this movie provided an excellent atmosphere to such a dark and gritty movie. The plot is fairly old, two detectives on the trail of a murderer, but the actors and the direction manage to make this variation on the formula very enjoyable, and seem original, when it really isn't.<br/><br/>But as I said before the key to this movie was Morgan Freeman and his performance. Everybody in this movie feeds off of his demeanor and his presence. He does so good he even makes Brad Pitt seem like a god actor. There is a nice supporting cast in this movie, R. Lee Ermey, Richard Roundtree, and even, well, okay, Gwyneth Paltrow, who really can't act. But the most surprising supporting cast member is Kevin Spcaey just a few months before he became famous.<br/><br/>But the movie also asks a number of moral questions, in examining American society and our many vices, it examines our drive, our motivations, and ultimately our failings, and how our vices can be maximized to hurt ourselves. When I got out of this movie I was very shocked, this was quite a surprising movie, I did't expect anything like it and I was surprised at it. This is a rarity because in modern day a movie like this would be dissected by the studio, and wouldn't be allowed to have the same kind of theme and intensity it does now, it would be way to fluffy, by Hollywood standards anyway. With that said watch this movie if you want a to a nice gory little gem."

","7 gruesome murders. Each gruesome for any number of reasons.<br/><br/>One of the darkest and most disturbing thrillers ever, David Fincher's Se7en set a benchmark when released that has rarely if at all been matched since. In only his second ever film, Fincher takes us on a roller-coaster ride of religious fanaticism that shocks, intrigues and horrifies the audience. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is a week away from retirement. Brad Pitt is a week away from replacing him. The pair form an unlikely pair during the curious case of a morbidly obese man who appears to have been forced to eat himself to death. Somerset (Freeman) believes that it is the beginning. Mills (Pitt) thinks that it is simple ironic torture. However, a second man is found bled to death, with greed written on the crime scene floor. A second trip to the first location reveals the word gluttony behind a fridge. Soon the unlikely duo find themselves hunting a killer who appears to be using the seven deadly sins as both his template and as a murder weapon.<br/><br/>Fincher's piece of cinematic brilliance is a roller-coaster ride of exhilaration, shock, revulsion and curiosity, and shows a flair of direction that Fincher would later show in Fight Club. His use of directorial techniques, such as his eradication of colour and light from his dark, wet and gloomy sets creates a near nightmare like brooding universe which simply adds to the sinister nature of the investigation. Unsurprisingly, the murders are horrific to say the least, although much is actually left to the audience's imagination. The unconventional partnership of Freeman and Pitt is entertaining, with Pitt resenting Freeman's almost patronising wisdom, with Freeman hating Pitt's gung ho, unsubtle attitude. Both excel in their roles, as does Gwyneth Paltrow as Mills' frustrated wife. R. Lee Ermey and John C. McGinley, are, much like the rest of the supporting cast, well judged and make good work of their small roles. However, the most eye catching performance is by the unexpected Kevin Spacey as the killer. Although he doesn't have much screen time, he is terrifying as the righteous and almost serene John Doe, convinced that he is doing God's work, and carrying it out with cold cunning and confirmed enthusiasm. It's this planning that paves way for the stunning conclusion, that is both shocking and brilliantly set up.<br/><br/>The big star, though, is Fincher. The director redeems himself brilliantly following the much slated Alien 3, using unconventional techniques ,the creation of a sinister atmosphere, his control of events as well as the pacing that help make the film so memorable. <br/><br/>That and the seven gruesome murders, of course."

","Writing a review for this movie seems to be almost as difficult as the exercise of watching it. No, please do not take it in the negative sense. But the adjectives that come to the mind when thinking about the movie are very mixed, ""Brilliant"", ""Grotesque"", ""Depressing"", ""Brutal"", ""Unique"". The story is that of a psychotic killer, whose each kill is a 'modern day' representation of the original Seven sins from the ancient texts. The sins are Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the two homicide detectives that have been assigned this case. In fact, it is Morgan's last case, as he is due to retire soon. The case becomes more and more intriguing as each murder unfolds. Each murder is more gruesome and more gory than the previous one. (I must say at this point that it has been one of the most difficult movies to watch. Watching it alone at night ,as I did, is definitely not recommended.) By this time audience is certain that the killer is brilliant but a very twisted guy. A very clever technique employed by the director here is that he has not shown any crime being done in action, all are just the post murder shots of the dead. Just the level of detailing shown in the movie makes an amazing treat. Morgan Freeman is as usual very good. But it is Brad Pitt that really shows amazing acting abilities especially during the last part of the movie, the final confrontation scene between Brad, Morgan and the killer. Having said that movie belongs to the killer, who is the eventual winner (you will have to see the movie to find that out). Kevin Spacey as the killer has only around 15-20 minutes of the role during the end. But by Jove, he does carry it off amazingly well. While watching the movie, I was really wondering how would the director show the viciousness of the killer, which he has shown earlier during the murders. But Spacey carries it out with ease. He is a rare breed of an actor. A class apart. One had to just look in to his eyes and the expressions on his face, to become convinced that he is same person that performed all those murders. Also worth mentioning is how well the movie ends. The last sequence, the last two murders ( or should I say the Sins) are a treat to watch. What an ending. In the end, I would like to quote the brilliant director himself, Mr David Fincher, to understand why the movie is so dark, stark and gruesome. <br/><br/>""I don't know how much movies should entertain. To me I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about JAWS is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again."""

","Seven, or ""Se7en"" if you like your movies to have numbers sprinkled randomly in their titles, has Morgan Freeman in it.<br/><br/>Need I say more?<br/><br/>Okay, it does also have Brad Pitt, who is doing his usual early Brad Pitt schtick of acting a bit like a spastic heroin-addicted monkey.<br/><br/>Anyway, Morgan Freeman. Also, Morgan Freeman and Morgan Freeman's brilliant portrayal of Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>To be fair, the Morgan Freeman is not just about Morgan Freeman. It's also got a lot of sweet, inventive death in it of the most awesome, disturbing kind. Apparently, it has something to deal with Keyser Soze, but I wasn't paying that much attention to the plot when I watched it. I was more just gawking at the awesome production design, (Satan wishes Hell looked this awesome) and the awesomeness of the disturbingness, and the awesomeness of the Morgan Freeman. <br/><br/>That Fight Club guy directed this, so it looks like the most depressing Sprite commercial ever. There's a lot of rain, which is sort of cool, and it also has Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in it, which is really cool. Although he should have gouged out John Doe's eyes and done that skull thing to him. That would have made it cooler. Or Brad Pitt's eyes. Either way it's equally cool.<br/><br/>But mostly this Morgan Freeman is pretty Morgan Freeman."

"Bogmeister","10","0","0","5 February 2006"," A Pound of Flesh - and much more not less
","This picture wants a piece of all of us and it gets it. It's relentless in what it depicts and I think it's one of those cases when the overall result somehow surpasses the original intent of the filmmakers, however great that intent was. It's an unflattering depiction of our society, a picture of the world which happens to be the point of view of a serial killer. His world is dark, but made so by the so-called human beings infesting it - all the banality, the apathy, the self-interest of our species is on full display here. The city in this film is in a state of perpetual decay; all we seem to see are rotting walls and buildings on the verge of crumbling. But this is just a surface corrosion, a reflection of what really ails all of us, which is the corruption of our souls. The serial killer is just a natural extension of society here. It comes as no surprise that he exists. We've made our hell on Earth and the killer is just one of the elements existing to fall neatly into place in the center of it all.<br/><br/>Under the guise of a police procedural, director Fincher and the screenwriter unveil this grim world for us. This was not a reworked draft which fell into the common pitfalls of a standard chase at the end or a last minute rescue. No, none of that same old Hollywood stuff here. The nasty foreboding probably surfaces around the time we get to know a little about young detective Mills (Pitt) and his pretty wife (Paltrow), through the eyes of hardened veteran detective Somerset (Freeman). It's hinted that the young couple have recently moved into the big city from a more rural area, into the typical squalid apartment lifestyle prevalent in this grimy city. Maybe some alarm bells go off in the back of the audience's mind by this point: we don't think this couple should be in this city. What in the blazes are they really doing in this hellhole? Why didn't they stay where they belonged, close by that high school where they met? Pitt is pretty good as the less experienced cop, not too intelligent but struggling anxiously to be in the big leagues. He does OK, but the film belongs to Freeman, who cannot strike a wrong note as the older weary policeman. This becomes the essential Freeman role, that of a man who perhaps has seen too much in his lifetime, but his keen intelligence cannot allow him to simply give up and throw in the towel, no matter how close he gets to that point. Freeman manages to convey a poetic disposition towards decency and civilization, as with most of his roles, but it's never more effective than here, when the entire world assails him with barbarism and anarchy.<br/><br/>It's little surprise that much of the style of this film was copied over the next few years, including even the unusual credits sequence. The bulk of the film details the serial killer's masterpiece of murder, a pattern following the seven deadly sins. While interesting in itself and grisly in the depiction of murder as an artistic creation, we realize by the climax that it was all simply a preparation for the truly horrific crowning achievement of killer John Doe's final act. It's a shock at the end which still sends shivers down my spine no matter how many times I watch it. Perhaps meant for repeat viewings after the initial shock, the film serves to remind us we live (or just exist) in that chaotic charnel house we usually try not to think about. When all the surface gloss is peeled away and we gaze with unfiltered eyes at the unpleasant truth laid bare before us, we see John Doe smirking at us, holding a box."

","About a year ago I got hooked on a movie called ""Saw."". It's a excellent movie and this movie has been compared to it (or vis versa). I watch this movie and my shocked at it. This movie is so amazing! At first I thought it was just another ""slash um and kill um"" movie with no point what so ever, but it had a message. The bad guy, John doe (kevin spacey) kills someone for each sin (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath).<br/><br/>For gluttony, he forces an obese man to keep eating until he dies. He gives him a barf bucket when for when he throws up. He dies eating spaghetti.<br/><br/>For greed, he makes a defense attorney Eli Gould cut off a pound of flesh. Eli takes it from his love handles but he cuts to deep and cuts open his stomach.<br/><br/>For sloth, he ties a gay (uncomfermed but its implied) drug dealer to his bed for a year and hardly feeds his to the point where he eats his own tongue for food. He is found in his own apartment, thought to be dead, but is actually alive (not by much). It is later confirmed that he is brain dead.<br/><br/>For lust, he gets this belt strap-on thing and puts in on same poor smuck and makes him have sex with the lust victim (a prostitute). Did I mention that there is a knife where the dildo should be? For pride, he gets a very vain model and cuts up her face and cuts of her nose. He then tells her that she has a choice: call 911 and look disfigured for the rest of your life or take a bunch of sleeping pills and end it now. She takes the pills.<br/><br/>Dectective Somerset (morgan freeman) and Dectective Mills (brad Pitt) have to find the killer and stop him before he kills all seven sins.<br/><br/>A class A movie and an easy watch for people who like gore. It's great for older, strong stomached people. So don't take your 12 year old to see it."

We all are bad, we all have a little evil into our brains or behind our ear that says constantly: Kill that guy, you got to kill it, kill it!!! David Fincher learned a lesson after direct (and almost terminated) the third movie of the Alien franchise, so he waited to have a good finished screenplay to work with. His next job is now one of the best 50 movies of all time (if Saw doesn't take the place sooner or later). The idea of the screenplay is simple, not very twisted (with the plot) but enough interesting at visual level to make it dark, moving, brainy and scary. Using the seven sins as a way to kill (and exorcise our fears) is as intelligent as use internet to write a review on IMDb (but not so scary :P) Bradd Pitt is eaten (at performance level) by the great Morgan Freeman (he deserved an Oscar for this movie too) because his William Somerset is more human and deep and near than the detective David Mills (a little bit mean and angry, as you can see at the end).

It is also a plus that film stars Morgan Freeman, who in my opinion could be the greatest actor of all time, as one of the detectives attempting to catch him.

"thornswrath","Null","0","0","10 November 2004"," Se7en: Revisited
","Well I finally saw Se7en for the first real time last night. Don't get me wrong - of course I saw the seminal serial-killer flick when it originally came out in '95, albeit when it first hit videostores. At that time, for some reason unknown to me today, I simply didn't care for it. It didn't hook my attention, and something about the directorial style jarred me rather than impressed. Well that all changed - dramatically - last night when I sat home alone and watched it very carefully on DVD. Some of you already know that David Fincher is one of my very favorite directors, mainly because of FIGHT CLUB, but also for his other mindtrick movies such as THE GAME, and even ALIENS III to an extent - a movie I feel deserves more appeal than it seems to receive. PANIC ROOM was a bit of a disappointment to me arriving on the heels of the senses-shattering Fight Club, but there was no mistaking the genius that went into its craftmanship. Now back to Se7en, and its stunning, brutal beauty. There is no room in my mind left for doubt that ""Jonathan Doe"" wins the blue ribbon prize for most brilliant serial killer ever captured in a movie, and the now familiar actor who portrays him delivers what I feel must remain as his most chilling screen role to date. Whatever it was I ""didn't get"" about Se7en nine years ago, I can only try and imagine; but I needn't bother now that I've fully digested this tightly focused morality tale about the sins of modern man which we all take for granted throughout our daily lives. Morgan Freeman delivers such a solid and outstanding performance as Detective William Somerset, that he helps rise this film above the normal gamut of such typical police procedural fare, and into the realm of art. His character provides the much needed humanity that is the focus of the movie's themes. Brad Pitt portrays the cocky Detective Mills in his usual easy going, fluent style that makes him such a box office success. The movie is an outstanding depiction of all the baroque details that make up a squalid life in a rundown section of New York city, itself symbolic as the diseased heart of a country passing into sociological ruin and decay. To not recognize Se7en as a true masterpiece of film-making is to have committed one of the deadly sins of movie-going: not paying enough attention. Because that is what I was guilty of - not once, but twice did I see this movie on video during the past decade, and I was obviously not engaged to the point of committing myself to the inherent dynamics going on in the film. All I can say today after having this stark and disturbing psychological thriller drilled into my mind for the third time, is that I have learned what not paying close attention to the works of David Fincher can result in: simply missing out on what could be considered one of the most talented and brilliant film auters of our generation. They say hindsight is 20-20, and in this case that certainly turned out to be true, as I now consider Se7en to rival Fight Club as contendor for not only Fincher's best movie thus far, but most certainly exceeding Silence Of The Lambs (in my mind) to claim the prize as the #1 Best serial-killer movie ever lensed. <br/><br/>The movie is a triumph of thematic values that far exceeds the ambitions of Silence Of The Lambs. In Silence, there was not much beyond the tightly controlled unspooling of the plot, and of course there was the dynamic and chilling performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lector: his character was that film's dark heart. But to compare the two films beyond their ""serial killer cores"" would be a mistake; they are truly two different enterprises altogether. In Se7en, we have the decaying city itself as the heart of what is unfolding around all the characters; it is as if they all dwell within its sickened superstructure, in a sort of grim resolve to continue on until it reaches its final, shuddering spasm & ceases beating altogether. And within this structure haunted by ceaseless violence and hopelessness, humans dwell in their daily struggles to get on with their lives, or even try and devote their lives to doing something about it, as in the case of Pitt's detective Mills. Meanwhile, there are those who have already spent their lives in futility against the ever looming, oceanic tide of sin, filth, and murder that has been washing in daily since as long as they can remember, as in the case of Freeman's detective Somerset, who is intent on retiring so he can escape to the countryside and enjoy some peace, clear air, and tranquility. And caught in between these 2 polarities is the killer, ""John Doe"", as expressionistic & sadistic a killer as we are ever likely to meet on screen, yet imbued with an underlying philosophical outlook that nearly demands the unsettled viewer's sympathetic understanding even in the face of his indisputably loathsome acts. The arc these 3 characters represent serves to ennervate the inner wire of that naked 40-watt bulb which weakly flickers on to reveal what is lying in wait inside the darkness enveloping the cellar under everyone's prettied-up homes: that we are grouped together in a darkening basement under the sky, subject to the mass-induced and traumatizing influence of apathy, greed and sloth engendered by the mob mentality of society itself. In Se7en's unrelentingly grim vision, no one escapes this evergrowing cancerous shadow on the face of humanity; not the serial killer ""John Doe"", who despite all his efforts to ""prove"" something to his fellows by his heinous deeds is doomed to be swallowed up by history as merely one of it's slightly darker footnotes; certainly not detective Mills who is ultimately victimized where it matters most, beyond hope and redemption; and in the final analysis, not even the well-meaning and morally focused detective Somerset, who in the end must face the traumatizing truth that no matter where he may choose to escape from the city and end out his days, he will never be able to escape the memories that made up his bruised and shattered life. Se7en is, in short, a triumph of artistic film-making on every level, and in this moviegoer's eyes, deserves as many stars as your rating system offers. A true classic in the psychological thriller genre."

","****MEGA SPOILERS WARNING****<br/><br/>Detective William Somerset is in the last seven days of his career in New York City homicide. He is to spend those seven days showing his replacement, Detective David Mills the ropes. The first crime scene the pair is sent to investigate is truly a bizarre one, a hugely obese shut-in has eaten himself to death, and is found face-down in a plate of spaghetti. Somerset insists that no one would take the time force a man to eat himself to death unless the act itself has meaning that this must be the beginning of something.<br/><br/>He asks to be reassigned and is refused. Mills asks if he can have the case and is also refused. Mills' next case is equally bizarre, a lawyer is found in his office having bled to death after being forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. The word ""Greed"" has been written in his blood on the carpet. Meanwhile, Somerset returns to the fat man's apartment and finds that the word ""Gluttony"" has been written in the grease behind the refrigerator.<br/><br/>Aha! Somerset realizes what's going on, a serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Both of the men realize that the killer won't stop his brutal killings until he methodically and creatively executes his victims until his final vision is realized and is remembered, and studied forever.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, this movie is not for the queasy, but apart from that one caveat, I can't recommend it highly enough. The acting by Freeman and Pitt is what makes this movie one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time. It's stellar! Crime movies don't get any better than this, folks. The mystery is clever enough to keep you guessing all the way to the last five minutes of the movie. The direction by Fincher is great, the city has never seemed more oppressive or dark. <br/><br/>The soundtrack by Howard Shore I believe is another reason why this thriller ranks above all the rests and sits up with The Silence Of The Lambs. On another note, Kevin Spacey turns in a truly memorable cameo. In fact, it's better than most lead roles people are giving now a days. He plays a truly disturbed person, and one that you know must be insane. Just in this movie alone, Spacey proves he is one of the finest actors today.<br/><br/>What sold me on this film and just how damn disturbing and dark it is. It's quite amazing. I've yet to see a film that can match next to the upcoming, soon to be classic, ""Saw"". How the film didn't get recognized by the Academy Awards is beyond me. I can't wait to see a movie matches the dark, disturbing and down right brutal way the film plays modern society as place where no one will get away with their sins, and the punishment is unbearable.<br/><br/>****/*****"

","To put it simply - Seven (i think the 7 in the title looks damn stupid) is the best film I've seen. As far as the pure cinema experience goes, I it shares the number one spot with Titanic (yes Titanic, no I'm not crazy), but Seven is the only flawless film I can think of.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward, but when Seven came out, the world hadn't yet been flooded with gritty looking, inferior serial killer rip-offs. There's a beauty to the simplicity. The film never takes the cheap way out, and deserves a lot of credit for that. There's a refreshing lack of clich√©s that makes it all the more easy to watch (just look at R. Lee Ermey's police captain - normally they only yell and scream at the hero, refusing to believe whatever theory he's got, but in Seven he actually listens to, and supports his men).<br/><br/>The acting is superb all round, and the chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is pure magic. The work behind the camera (Fincher's Fight Club may be the flashier one, but this is his masterpiece), and on the sets are equally impressive. The atmosphere and setting really pulls you in to the film, never letting go until the end credits roll. And the ending... the best one ever filmed, period. [10/10]"

The ugly awful horror that you may feel and experience from a really bad recurring nightmare that makes you fear going to sleep. Or the hopeless, despairing, painful horror you may feel as you witness the death of multiple innocents, like watching the Twin Towers collapsing on 9-11 on live TV. This film while done as a detective story grabs the viewer and thrusts them into what I can only describe as a travelogue through several layers of hell. <br/><br/>Other horror films may try to scare you(Jaws), shock you(Psycho), gross you out(The Fly), or use any number of ways to make you afraid. This is the first movie that made me feel true horror. Not just fear, but that sense of dread and despair that haunts your memories and makes you desperately wish it never happened.<br/><br/>The climatic scene, the opening of the box, is one of the strongest scenes of fictional horror put to film.

The murderer kills a variety of different people and writes the name of the sin he feels they have committed on the wall of the murder site in whatever substance he happens to find at the time. For example, he writes GREED in blood, GLUTTONY in grease, etc.<br/><br/>SE7EN is mostly just your run-of-the-mill murder mystery story, a genre which I've never really been into. However, this movie is also different in a couple of ways. The story, for one, I find to be incredibly clever. The murderer's plan is highly original and almost makes sense, in an insane sort of way. Every move the murderer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), makes is just another step in his plan, and all lead up to the ending--which, I have to say, is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>I think what sets SE7EN apart from most murder mystery movies is that it requires you to think a bit more. Instead of simply showing the exciting parts of a detective's job, such as the chase scenes (and this movie has just one, but a particularly good one), it shows the long, tedious process of finding clues and investigating. I think this element brings the viewer deeper into the lives of all of the characters and instills more feelings and care for said characters. And though the murderer's plan is made clear, there are still a few foggy aspects that are required by that noggin to sort out.<br/><br/>As for technical aspects, everything works. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, and despite what some reviewers think, I have to say Brad Pitt is too. Both do well in this movie, as does Kevin Spacey as the ""deranged murderer freak."" The script is great, if a little watered down by some cliches, and the direction is excellent. No complaints.<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't truly impressed with SE7EN until the ending. It was a little cliched, a little boring, and a little tedious. But I think that's the idea--that contrast makes the ending that much more shocking and therefore more brilliant. The most perfect ending to a great crime thriller. 8.5/10."

","Many people might be put off by the gruesome and twisted experiance that is director David (Fight Club) Fincher's suspense film. However, if you choose to be more tolerant about the graphic nature of the film, you will find it to be a suspenseful,exhilerating, masterpiece of shadows and thrills.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a burnt out cop (Morgan Freeman)and his new, hot shot partner(Brad Pitt) who are investigating a string of very gruesome murders. It soon becomes clear the killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins (Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, Envy, and Wrath) as his motive. The film is shot mostly in rainy, dark locations which intrigued me at first but soon got boring. However, just when you think the film will drop on its rear, it gets interesting again. The acting is a wonder. Morgan Freeman plays the burnt out detective with his usual charm and charisma and Brad Pitt is believable as Freeman's partner up until the last scene, which I felt like he was trying to hard to cry. Kevin Spacey, however, steals the show as the sadistic murderer. He is both terrifying and attractive and portrays pure insanity like no other actor I've ever seen."

They are allocated to a case that eventually turns out to be John Doe (Spacey) creating his own masterpiece of seven deadly sins.

"eadaoin7","8","0","0","2 March 2004"," Haunting, gripping, sadistic--welcome to America (minor spoilers)
","First of all, I would like to make a few comments about some of the other comments on the movie: First of all, it was actually intentional that Brad Pitt seem somewhat cocky & ne'er-do-well in his role; the point of his character was that he most likely came from a smallish town's precinct where the hardest crime was probably stealing from the collection plate, and his attitude was looked up to. In a small town. He, in their minds, had the attitude of ""those movie & TV cops"". In L.A., an attitude doesn't even get you a latte. So his bravado is supposed to be misplaced. But what does come through is the fact that he honestly does want to do the right thing his own way, and ""get the bad guys & teach them some manners"", usually with a lot of verbal & some physical abuse. Typical small-town, or rent-a-cop, mindset. Secondly, a lot of people claim that the gore was hard to take...WHAT gore? We only see the aftermath of the murders, not what they go through. And what they go through is only speculated upon, not hard-cold fact. The gore is in the mind of the audience. Frankly I am quite please that they took that approach, as it shows that the writers, producers, directors are giving the audience SOME credit for having minds & imaginations. Hollywood thinking their audience has a few brain cells--go figure... To sum up my feelings on the movie, I have to quote the artistic director, Rob Bottin, on this one--""This is a script that definitely gave me the butt-willies!"" From beginning almost to the end, I was impressed by not only the idea, but the approach to such an idea. And a haunting thought occurred to me...why hasn't this ever been done before in real life? Or has it, but was not clued in to? Not that I'm hoping this is so, of course!! I think that given the circumstances, the victims were actually handled with dignity. So many times in movies, the victims are exploited because most of Hollywood thinks that we only want shock and after-death scandals. Here, there was no dirty laundry airing, no contrite bloodletting...just the sad fact that they were everyday people in everyday lives (whether we want to admit it or not), and chosen to fit a specific killer's agenda. Much like most other serial killers. Morgan Freeman, as usual, does no wrong, and brings a quiet grandness to his role (and every role). Brad Pitt, with the aforementioned background character, holds his own and does a pretty impressive job to get most of us to forget that he's known for his looks alone. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't given much to do, but she does it amiably. And R. Lee Ermey, as always, is a comic-relief treat (ring...""This is not even my desk!"" slam!). Plus, how much fun was it for us to see ""Shaft"" as the governor?? One minor flaw I feel compelled to say, and this is just my opinion: Not the actor portraying him, but the character of John Doe, left me a little dry. When he first arrived in the station, his character seemed to fit with all that was discovered in his apartment. But once he started talking, he fell into the same old Hollywood Killer mode. Giving away all of his motives and intentions and thought processes right before the end. This contriteness is in EVERY killer movie, and was a sore disappointment. For me. Personally, I would have preferred not to have him speak at all, or very minimally. Case in point, at the very end when Mills has the gun on him and Somerset rushes up after receiving the box. Doe goes into saying what his role is in the 7 deadly sins, and what Mills' role will be as well...Hasn't that been implied already?? We KNOW who will be what sin, just by the set-up! And there's only two left--I think we can tell who is which! Sorry, but Hollywood--take note, please - we don't need every killer's life story, motives, and intentions spoon-fed to us. Besides, with everything only being implied in the rest of the film, having John Doe go into such a self-serving diatribe really goes against the grain, and gives the feel of the film a 180 turn...which makes it all the more sad when the first hour & 45 minutes have proved that the writers, et al, have the intelligence to not stoop to that level. However that is my only beef with the film. The rest; above par, superb, magnificent, and a must-see...that you will be seeing in your conscious and subconscious for a long while after the film ends. Guaranteed."

","If you would like to explore David Fincher, you should start out with this magnificent piece of art work. Even after 9 years the movie seems very fresh to me. Movie's two dichotomous detectives complement each other perfectly. We observe full speed action from Pitt. For Freeman it is always thought before action. He would like to understand this crazy world. Literature might be the key to understanding things. Terrific acting by Freeman, Pitt and Spacey. Having watched Fight Club and Se7en, I won't miss any feature directed by Fincher. He always directs clever movies which brings new questions to your mind. Straight 10/10."

","Se7en is an odd movie to enjoy so much.  I've seen bits of pieces of it in the past, but it was only recently that I watched the whole thing.  I was gripped to it for every minute.  It's just a smart and intriguing crime thriller, but don't eat anything while watching it!<br/><br/>None of the scenes really grossed me out when I watched it recently, but that's only because I knew what I was getting into.  I probably was a little queasy after watching some of those scenes the first time.  Yet we never see the crimes being done, only the aftermath.  Seeing those murders actually take place may have been a bit much.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Se7en rides on some great storytelling, gritty direction, and an all-around great cast.  One of the things I enjoyed most about the movie was the chemistry between the main characters.  This was most evident at the dinner scene as we were introduced to a friendlier, civilian side of the characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, as well as a strong supporting role played by Gwyneth Paltrow.<br/><br/>And I should not forget the classic ending to this movie.  You will remember it for a long time as well as the villain, who is played by an un-credited famous actor.  You probably already know whom it is, but in the spirit of limiting any spoilers, I won't go further.<br/><br/>All in all, Se7en is just a great flick.  It's fun, it's interesting, it keeps you guessing, and it's memorable.  The only drawback being that it may not be for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

"philb-15","Null","0","0","4 February 2004"," Pretty good, lets say se7en out of ten
","Although this is a good and very watchable movie, it does have some major flaws. There are three obvious ones: firstly, the ending, which is just so predictable. Kevin Spacey as the serial killer announces that there are still two victims to be accounted for and it comes as no surprise when it is revealed who those two people are. Secondly, Gwyneth Paltrow. I've never really rated her in any movie that I've seen and here she gives another bland performance. Thirdly, the scenes midway through the movie where Pitt, Paltrow and Freeman are getting to know each other over dinner, really drag.<br/><br/>OK, criticisms out of the way. The real plus points of this film are the performances of Spacey/Freeman and also the dark menacing atmosphere that is created throughout the course of the movie. Spacey is one of the best Hollywood actors around, almost in the Tom Hanks class, and here he gives a very restrained but menacing performance as the bad guy. Morgan Freeman always gives the same type of laid-back, calm, controlled performance and here it is used to great effect. This probably ranks alongside The Shawshank Redemption as his finest appearance on celluloid. Brad Pitt and (especially) Gwyneth Paltrow look a litle bit out of their depth among these two fine actors and they don't really convince.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially just another serial-killer-picking-ingenious-ways-to-kill-people situation, however it is refreshingly free of pointless CGI effects and has little in the way of gore, which is nice because the movie has to get by on atmosphere and dialogue, something for which Hollywood has not always tried in major films. Among the killings are a man who is forced to eat until he (almost literally) bursts and one or two others, many of which also reveal clues deliberately left by Kevin Spacey. It's an intelligent film which really would have been a 9/10 film had the major flaws which I mentioned been addressed."

It's brutal, stark and gritty - what Fincher captures best. The acting on offer is superb - Freeman plays it well as the old detective, who is retiring, but stays on for this last case.  Freeman is well spoken, and he is playing opposite a great Brad Pitt, who plays Detective Mills, a cocky, full of it new detective, who plays the part with ease, showing us the difference between the two characters, one being old, wise, the other being young, brash.

","There are two things in Seven that set it apart from the crowd.<br/><br/>First, the complementary ways of thinking from two detectives with conflicting personalities. Unlike the most stories of the same genre, Detectives Somerset and Mills formed a perfect partnership not by the similarity between them (of which there was few), but by their unlike-mindedness in nearly every point of view. Learned, sophisticated, and weary of a thirty-four-year career in dealing with crimes, Somerset allowed his heart to quit before the actual date of retirement came, dragging his feet in accepting challenges, and as a consequence the real value remained of him was to give what he guessed or believed based on his time-tested concepts and instinct. Mills, as opposed to his partner, was all fresh and green and ready for action. Their thoughts crashed practically all the way down to the end, and yet it was their very difference in mind and attitude that supplemented them each with what the other lacked in their mission to find the killer. <br/><br/>Second, the great disparity in power between the good and evil. It was plain that John Doe, the evildoer, was far more intelligent than the two detectives combined. And throughout the entire process of his well-planned killings, Doe kept having the upper hand, making his pursuers see what he wanted them to see at what time he defined for them. There seemed no way, absolutely no way for them to conquer him, to do what he was not intended. The last scene, appalling and heart-wrenching beyond belief, showed the utter helplessness from the men trapped and the powerful ill will of the trapper ¬°¬™ Somerset, with the feebleness in convincing even himself, called Mills to throw his gun away; Mills, suffering torture from shock, agony and rage, couldn't help but do exactly what he was set up to do; and Doe, with a triumphant smile on his face, embraced death with all coolness.

","Se7en unfolds in a dark, nasty and rainy place. Two hopelessly mismatched Detectives try to overcome their differences and solve an escalating series of gruesome murders that punish the Seven Deadly Sins. Somerset (Freeman) is about to retire and Mills (Pitt) will be his youthful replacement. From the very onset of the film they resent one another and this lends a disturbing quality to the overall film which I really like. The photography is grainy and dark - this is a perfect medium with which to portray the warped, Noir-ish logic of film's plot. It also looks great. Visually, its similar to Alex Proyas' The Crow but within the world of Se7en it really can rain all the time. At least until the dazzling conclusion where the killer's terrible plan comes to light and we witness the film's crowning moment. Not since The Wicker Man has the rug been so firmly pulled from beneath a central character's feet. Like Sergeant Howie in Robin Hardy's classic chiller, Detective Mills is manipulated and used as an unwitting pawn in a game of the 'hunted leading the hunter'.

","SPOILERS! SPOILERS!  <br/><br/>(NOT to be read by those who STILL have not seen the movie)<br/><br/>Seeing Se7en on TV last night, I considered myself extremely lucky that other than the very general idea of the plot, I knew nothing in advance about the development of the story and the brilliant twist at the end despite the fact that this movie has been around for so long.<br/><br/>With so much already said, I'm just going to take a one-angle look, from an angle that tickles my professional instinct: numbers. I have, after each of the following movies, tried to remember all of the 12 Angry Men, Dirty Dozen and Oceans 11, with various degrees of success. With Se7en, it's a slightly different thing. Everybody knows by now that there are seven murders. Nobody would believe that each murder would be introduced in a regular interval of, say, 20 minutes throughout the movie. But what did the director do to avoid a monotonous, repetitive pattern? This is what I asked myself before the movie started and told myself to watch out for.   <br/><br/>Seven murders over seven days, but definitely not going to be one a day. Well, the first three murders have something in common: to paint a general picture of the murderer. Gluttony happens on Monday, followed by Greed on Tuesday. However, the clever little twist is that the written message GREED (written in blood) is seen first, before GLUTTONY (written in grease), which is discovered upon a revisit of the murder site. Then comes a little break on Wednesday, again to avoid the monotony. On Thursday, the discovery of SLOTH is absolutely predictable to anyone who has watched a few murder mysteries, and meant to be so.  <br/><br/>With these first three murders, the ground is pretty well set. The inhuman, insane cruelty of the killer is confirmed in no uncertain terms. Now it is time to again break away from a routine pattern. The audience see a different number of events unfolding, some seem to be still quite predictable, some less so.<br/><br/>Coming to Saturday, murders number 4 and 5, of two women, are glossed over quicker, because there is not much information to be added. At this point, the audience falls into the usual mindset of whodunit-guessing. Then comes the first clever twist that makes Se7en stand out among murder mysteries. The sudden appearance and surrendering of Spacey (whose name I think was kept away from the opening credit, on purpose) the killer throws the audience considerably off balance. Where is the movie heading and how is it going to wrap up with the last two murders, they begin to ask. <br/><br/>
The more perceptive of the audience would by this time sense that this is not a whodunit thing and tantalisingly curious as to what that final twist is. Whatever you call it, it is nothing short of brilliant. In the last two killings, the true victims are not the persons killed, but rather the killer! The long waited ENVY and WRATH victimise Spacey and Pitt into killers, respectively. In the end, they did bring death to Spacey and whatever punishment the system deals out to Pitt. <br/><br/>If I were to split hair, envy does not really play a significant part in Spacey's action. It is rather used by him to complete a most ingenious plot. It is however so clever that you will tend to give your nod of consent to this artificial application of one of the seven sins in the plot."

"Eredain","10","0","0","20 June 2003"," The greatest, deepest, most insightful film I have ever seen.
","****SPOILER****<br/><br/>This is a philosophical comment to the POINT of the film, so it is quite in-depth. Although it does not go too much into the plot directly, the film is more enjoyable if one discovers said points of the films for oneself. Continue at own risk.<br/><br/>
Somerset: ""The first thing they teach you, is that if you are being raped, don't shout ""rape"". Shout ""fire"". THEN people will come running..... I just can't go on working in a place that nurtures apathy as if it were a virtue"".<br/><br/>The point of Seven is moral more than religious. Its point concerns APATHY, and explains how apathy actually IS evil. A New Testament example of this is the story of Lazarus (Don't get me wrong. I'm an atheist and deeply loathe the bible as a whole. Nevertheless, in part, the bible has a point here.). The wealthy man is deemed evil (in the eyes of God/eternity/objectivity) because of his apathy towards the needy (Lazarus) - evil enough, in fact, to be cast into hell. The moral of the story (of Lazarus as well as Seven) is that active harm is not necessary for one to be evil. One merely needs to abstain from doing good. Not all evil people NEED to actively harm others to get what they want. Some already have it, and choose to let others die at their door.<br/><br/>So I have no doubt that the people that Doe killed were evil. I have no doubt that Somerset hated them as well. Only Somerset was to loving a person to take on the role of judge, jury and executioner. Both Somerset and Doe have let the apathy of the world drive them to give up. Doe wants to die and take some of those cold-hearted bastards with him, and, hopefully, make his point and thus change the world. Somerset merely wants to escape to some distant place in the country. But in the end, Somerset simply can't turn his back on the world. He wants to go on trying to help. Probably inspired by Mills passion for justice.<br/><br/>
On a more depressing note, I believe that the moral of the story is, that these vices (seven deadly sins) are what make us human. Only one person has none of these vices - Somerset - and he is lonely and miserable. Inhuman(ly good). ""With much wisdom comes much sadness, and he that furthers his wisdom furthers his sadness"" (Ecclesiastes 1:18, loosely translated).<br/><br/>Mills has it sooo easy, not reflecting on life the way Somerset does. He is nevertheless truly good, in my opinon. And that is the only real hole in the pattern of the plot. Wrath need not be a vice/sin. Mills did not beat up his wife, nor run amuck and kill people or anything like that. His wrath was always just, and it never hurt the innocent. I completely love both him and Somerset.<br/><br/>This is the greatest, deepest, most insightful film I have ever seen."

","Contains Spoiler Se7en is David Fincher's Masterpiece. The first time I saw this movie I agreed totally with the blurb on the video cover. ""The most relentlessly chilling thriller you will ever see"". I can not think of any actor in any movie that has had such an impact on the overall appearance of the film the way Kevin Spacey did in ""Se7en"". He portrayed his character John Doe perfectly, as did Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. The way Spacey sat in the back seat of the car, perfectly still, talking in a most calm matter, referring to the people he killed  as worthless and unworthy of life was a scene that is unlike any scene in any other movie. Even Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter could not of outshone Spacey in Se7en. Spacey represented true evil, a killer that lurks and strikes with stunning precision and timing. The detail Fincher went into in the appearance of John Doe's victims also plays a big part in the overall ""shock"" of the movie. This is the film that made critics sit up and take notice of David Fincher, Fincher follows up on his Masterpiece in 1999 with ""Fight Club"" - also starring Brad Pitt (in perhaps the role of his career). I will close by saying this, if you haven't seen Se7en - see it. No other film will have the effect on you that Se7en will."

","My first introduction to the work of David Fincher was the oft panned ALIEN 3. While I hated this film less than most people, I was impressed by the overall look and the visual style. Several years later Fincher hit movie audiences in the face with SEVEN, which is a masterpiece of dark creeping atmosphere.<br/><br/>SEVEN follows the exploits of Detectives Sommerset and Mills, while on the trail of a killer who is violently acting upon the seven deadly sins (greed, sloth, pride, etc.). When broken down to that simple sentence, the film has the potential to collapse under its' own concept. The way the material is handled, however, shows inspiration and commitment by the film-makers. The movie is brutal and realistic; the murder scenes are unpleasant and not for the squeamish. The make-up effects by Rob Bottin are quite grotesque, especially the killer's ""prisoner"" who is found chained to a bed.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman in the lead role finds the right balance between professionalism and frustration as the killer continues to elude him. Brad Pitt as Det. Mills, the new kid in town, is layered, with just the right amount of maniacal fervor. This is especially important considering Mills' actions during the conclusion of the story. If the character had not been established, the ending could have seemed forced or contrived. The way Pitt portrays this smart, but angry man, gives the film the push it needs to pull off the final act. Kevin Spacey, a third-act inclusion, covers much developmental ground in a short period of time.<br/><br/>Behind the scenes there dwells much talent: the photography by Darius Khondj is so good you can almost smell certain scenes, Arthur Max's prod. design is decaying Gothic in nature, and the pounding percussive score by Howard Shore rattles your nerves (Shore later went on to score The Lord of the Rings films). Andrew Kevin Walker's story is sharp and has an explosive resolution. David Fincher's direction cemented him as a film-maker with a distinct style and he has proved this in subsequent projects (although I am in the minority for hating FIGHT CLUB, yet this is mainly because of the story, not Fincher's direction).<br/><br/>It is true that not every single element of the film works, but I admire SEVEN simply for the scene where Sommerset goes to the library(!) to help solve the case, which is something you don't often see in your run-of-the-mill thriller. 10/10 <br/><br/>Quick Trivia: in the published screenplay the ending takes place in a swamp; this actually makes sense considering that the characters are still in close proximity to a city where it rains on a constant basis. It also contains the opening scene that was cut from the film (it was later restored via the special edition DVD). The screenplay, itself, is also a good read, and of interest to fans and film-buffs."

This is his second best film, Fight Club being the first. Everything in it is so well done, from the acting (Kevin Spacey!), directing, script, and visuals. The city this takes place in isn't named but its shown as dark and gritty, constantly raining. The mystery is intense, its something I have never heard of before but it is done so remarkably well. Its hard to find a film like Se7en around, it can only really be matched by Memento. The last twenty minutes of this film are extremly suspensful, possibly the best end twenty minutes of any film.

","( Hesitated before committing the 777th comment! Shall make it snappy!) Se7en was shockingly overlooked by the Academy Awards ( but for a Best Editing nomination ). Still it had  some of the best assets a film can hope for: devilishly clever and faultless writing by Andrew Kevin Walker, magnificent photography by Darius Khondji which , with the  superb settings, created the haunting  atmosphere of the film, very good musical score (including an excerpt from a Bach piece aptly included ), and taut and gripping magnificent direction by David Fincher. So the film garnered many other rewards and met with considerable public success. The casting, though uneven, contributed thereto: Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow ( wonderful in ""Shakespeare in Love "" but otherwise overrated in most films ) are acceptable but have no real alchemy together ; Morgan Freeman is truly excellent, and Kevin Spacey simply superb ( his performance is said to have weighted  considerably on his  Oscar awarding for ""USUAL SUSPECTS ""); solid support in small parts is given by seasoned performers : R. Lee Ermey ( police captain ), Richard Roundtree ( D.A. ), Michael Massey ( man in massage  parlour booth ), and Richard Schiff ( John Doe's lawyer ); while John C. McGinley' s acting talents are just wasted; as to Charles Dutton, I just did not see him.

We'd like to cheer him on and see him less psycho, though we won't admit it. Yeah, we want to see the fat man and the lawyer and the drug-dealing pederast go down the tubes, and that's how the film catches us with our moral pants down. But the film doesn't follow through with the come-rage-with-me invitation. Spoiler - Instead, the psycho's murder of the relatively innocent wife of Brad Pitt's character causes us to loosen our alignment with the avenger and to rethink him as a madman. Just when the directors/producers/writers could have taken us to the looking glass, where we'd check our own cruelty and find it linked to our morality, they let us down and deliver another boy-this-bad-guy-really-is-very-unlike-us psycho movie that's strictly standard-issue."

","I had somehow missed seeing 'Se7en' when it went out in the theaters. Now, four good films after ('The Game' and 'Fight Club' among them), this 1995 movie of director David Ficher still stands as an original and strong creation. <br/><br/>This is not an easy film - much more violent and graphic than the usual detective drama. It's a multiple murder story, in an American city of eternal rain, ugliness and violence. The two main characters, played by Pitt and Freeman are fighting a war lost in advance, not that much with crime but with the insanity that attacks normal life. They seem to be motivated more by the need of sanity than by the need to enforce law and morals.<br/><br/>It's great to watch scenes like the one where the detectives and what seems a regiment of policemen are going out to make a search - it tells a lot about the police system dominating our lives. This is the work of a great director, and with such a director at helm, there is hope that even 'Mission Impossible 3' which he is doing now might be a good film.<br/><br/>
Pitt and Freeman are great. Spacey acts just for a few scenes, but that's enough to add his picture to the big actors playing serial killers gallery. Paltrow's role, unfortunately, is too conventional to allow her doing an act comparable to her partners. <br/><br/>The final scene is so different from the usual Hollywood ending, that it may shock a lot of viewers.

","""Se7en"" is without a doubt David Fincher's best work. Sure, he also directed ""Fight Club"" and ""The Game"", both of which were excellent, but I believe this is Fincher at his best. While ""Se7en"" didn't have the en masse popularity and impact that Fight Club had, it was just as raw, just as real, and just as entertaining.<br/><br/>Although it has many upsides, there are several downsides. Number one being that throughout the movie there is quite a bit of gore, but Fincher apparently thought the audience would lose their stomach at the end, and kept what was possibly the most impactful 'gore' scene hidden, and left it to the imagination of the viewer.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman played off of each other remarkably well, considering how different they, and their characters Mills & Somerset, are. Freeman put on the excellent performance that everyone knows he's capable of, and Pitt was just as good. Kevin Spacey was perfectly cast as ""John Doe"" because he, quite frankly, creeped me out. Moreso even then Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"" in ""The Silence of The Lambs"".<br/><br/>The best element of the movie, however, was Fincher's extraordinary use of the world around the characters. The raw colors, the amazing sound, and the non-main characters all made the movie feel as if it was real, and made it that much darker when the ""climax"" occured.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Se7en"" is, in my opinion, the best serial-killer based movie since ""The Silence of The Lambs"".

Incredibly, the film is nowhere near as gruesome on screen as most other gruesome flicks (""Gladiator"" comes to mind) and it is mostly the disturbing thought that there are people like this and perhaps the world isn't a rosy place with a few freaks... or perhaps it is. The film gets better with repeated viewings and I think that this is one film where Morgan Freeman just shines as an actor. Brad Pitt actually is remarkably good as a typical American who seems to have been educated through pop culture and is quick to the hip rather than to the brain as is Somerset, Freeman's character.<br/><br/>If you can enjoy a movie like ""Silence of the Lambs"" then this flick will take you for a ride. If you are simply disturbed by disturbing things in this world then you might not give this movie a chance. The DVD is remarkable and perhaps the most worthwhile DVD you can get with all the interesting commentary tracks. The previous reviewer probably also thought that ""Fight Club"" -- another Fincher film -- was just a social commentary applauding violence. Like that film.... there is so much to see and appreciate in this very dark film.... Fantastic, intriguing, and replayable..."

","This doesn't give away anything in the film, but it might hint at things<br/><br/>The reason when ""Seven"" (aka Se7en) should be ranked so highly is because it's a film that purely refuses to give into the Hollywood system. Firstly, it never shows you the crimes taking place, opting instead to show you the aftermath. And even then it never pushes it right into your face. It's more reliant on the audiences reaction within itself, within each individual viewer, which is far more powerful than a thousand special effects. Secondly, the ending (and not giving anything away) completely catches you off guard. It is like nothing you expected, and by obeying the rules it has already set out for itself (see above) it makes it all the more scarier. Coupled with the fact that the studio wanted to go with an alternative happy ending (for ""happy"" see conventional) and Fincher fought for his vision makes this a true rarity in cinema today."

I know they didn't have the volume turned down to low, because the soundtrack, and all other sounds in the movie were LOUD, its just all the actors sounded like they were mumbling. OK, maybe it was just the accoustics of the theatre. I rented it once on VHS, and there was the same problem -- you could barely hear anything that anyone said. OK, I had a lousy VCR, I thought it would be different when I got in on DVD. I watched it last weekend, and it was still the exact same problem. The sound editting on this movie is horrible, which is REALLY frustrating, because its an amazing movie.

I didn't understand why the producers had to make him such a jerk. However, it made so much sense after the ending. I was swayed to believe that Spacey would lead the two cops to a bomb, and somehow the two cops would symbolize the last two sins. I especially doubted that David Mills would shoot John Doe, but now I realize that that was necessary in order to make the movie so good. I should've realized that Morgan Freeman was foreshadowing when he said ""There will be no happy ending."""

","This is one of the most expertly structured thrillers I have ever seen. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are great. From writer Andrew Kevin Walker, the writer of the disgustingly terrible 8MM and SLEEPY HOLLOW. This film was much like 8MM as the murderer (whose name is not featured in the opening credits so as to surprise you) seems to have no remorse for what it is that he has done. Andrew Kevin Walker has created a more likable thriller with SE7EN, a film that still shows killing in a very graphic nature, but is not as vulgar or sickening. But, the film is far more violent. The killings are very horrific and disturbing.<br/><br/>Two detectives (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) are on the trail of a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a calling card on his random murders. The supporting cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow (in a much smaller role than she usually plays), John C. McGinley, Richard Schiff, Kevin Spacey, R. Lee Ermey, Leland Orser, Richard Roundtree, Richard Portnow, and Charles Dutton. Many of the characters that are listed as main ones, have very small parts to play. The film mainly revolves around Freeman and Pitt and the elusive killer. The film was destined to become a classic in the genre. And, it did. SE7EN is one thriller you have to see. SE7EN gets 4/5."

A film about many things: fate, retribution, sin, religion, evil, society.<br/><br/>A tale about a serial killer who murders people for their sins, and a mismatched buddy cop duo who must stop him before they too become part of his 'game'. When you break it down to its basics you realise that this could have been a disaster - Joel Schumacher directs Seagal and Van Damme in a shoot 'em up action movie where our heroes save the girl in the nick of time...<br/><br/>The fact that the story works so well is testament to Fincher's marvellous vision and the performances of Spacey, Freeman & Pitt. The depth and originality that are added draw us into the picture and make us care about the characters. Think for moment: in a movie about a serial killer, how many people do we actually witness being slain? This isn't Jason or Freddie. What makes this scary is that John Doe is presented as a real person - a guy from the big, dirty, rainy city who just might live in the apartment below you. The fact that he is not just a random psycho who kills due to irresistable urges or the cycle of the moon makes him so much more frightening.<br/><br/>For sheer edge-of-the-seat cinema, the final twenty minutes are as good as any you will see.

All the times while watching it that you keep telling yourself to turn it off, to get rid of this corrupt piece of trash, you are behaving exactly the way the people involved in making the movie wanted you to behave. You're supposed to envision the world and the people in it as pure Hell. Never in a film has urban life been so nightmarishly portrayed. From the dark and rainy days, to the smog and people-infested streets, down to the sick mind of the killer and the victims of society he preys on, this film sends a message out about what we value in life. Are we really happy living in a world such as this? This movie is very dark, and often depressing when it's not bordering on pure sickness. The murders here are so evil and unspeakable it's hard to imagine a human capable of doing such a thing. At times, I was appalled. Many will find this one hard to watch. In fact, if you don't, you may have more problems than the killer. But instead of being put off by it's violence and stunned by the things it dares to show us, embrace what the film is trying to say. No, it's not just showing you these twisted things for the Hell of it. It's trying to make you open your eyes and take in what's around you. This movie will force you to really take a good look at the world today, and scaring you into it is the best way possible. What's more frightening: sitting through the movie, or going out into the world when it's over? You decide. I recommend anyone that has a serious mind and likes intelligent, well-made movies that deliver more than the usual bag of tricks to see this, if you can stomach it. Next to Silence of the Lambs, it is the best crime thriller ever made."

","I first saw parts of ""Seven"" a few years ago, edited, on Fox.  I dismissed it as a film with only the intent to shock, and as a film with no meaning other than an unintentional celebration of violence and gore.  I did walk away from the film with my stomach turned inside out, and with certain scenes from the film (fans can guess which ones) playing over and over in my head, but I felt that the film didn't have the core or the heart or the meaning to make it a masterpiece.  After recently watching it again, I have changed my mind completely.  Although I still feel it isn't a masterpiece, in the same ranks as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Psycho,"" I do feel it can very well be compared to these greats.  I think ""Seven"" is just as good a film than ""Cape Fear,"" another famous thriller, both the original and the remake, and better than almost all thriller films I have ever seen.  I will admit that not since ""The Silence of the Lambs"" have I been so fascinated by a thriller--I loved everything about ""Seven"" from the grizzly and brutal corpse make-up to Kevin Spacey's short but brilliant act as John Doe, a serial murderer.  I thought that the sets were fabulous, possibly the best I've ever seen.  I thought the acting was good enough to completely change my opinions on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, both of whom I previously felt to be non-talents.  Both the climax of the movie as well as the ending moments were so well done I had chills running down my spine, unable to move my fixed eyes--even though I knew the ending from previously seeing parts of the film, I was still completely caught up in the story--I was still anxious, fearful, sad, curious, and on the edge of my seat the entire time. This film brings you into the true-life world of a serial killer and his victims.  It doesn't even stop to consider simplicity or suggestive filmmaking--it shows you every little sick detail.  This in-your-face method really almost makes you feel disgusted, but you can't take your eyes away. I loved how Fincher wonderfully showed the parallels between not only Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's character's, but between their job and how they each deal with it.  I can't say enough about this movie without spoiling it or making this review unreadable due to how unorganized it is, but I do recommend this very intelligent thriller--if you have the stomach for it."

I remember the first time I saw Se7en at the cinema, it was just before the buzz of the plot began to get around.

","Colour and lighting, Fincher emphasizes shadows and dimly lit scenes--the kind that lend more to the tone of the shot than to the ego of the star. You'd be hard pressed to find any light situation in any of his films that truly flatters the actors. Se7en is definitely Fincher's darkest movie--in mood and in lighting. The majority of Se7en contains very little light, the crime scenes being the most notable examples. In fact, most of Se7en's lighting is directional, meaning that it comes from an artificial source focused in one direction with a low falloff. The brightness of the desert setting during the climax is a dramatic shift from the rest of the movie and is perfect for the change in tone and action of the finale. The most interesting use of colour in Se7en comes when Mills and Somerset explore John Doe's apartment. Everything is, of course, red and dark. Camera work and editing, The chase scene with Mills and Doe is about as exciting as they come. The camera moves quickly with the characters, and the odd angles keep the audience from seeing everything--building paranoia and escalating the tension. The steady movement of the SWAT team as they descend upon the sloth victim is another well-choreographed sequence. All of Fincher's films feature some kind of chase scene, which is definitely a good thing, considering how effectively he pulls them off. Production and set design, A lot of the settings are buildings in decay; many of them were built from scratch and then made to look worn. I believe that Fincher often films on sets rather than scouting out interior locations because actual interiors rarely live up to his meticulous imagination. Rotting wood, rust, water stains and peeling paint all help to make each scene totally believable--more like moody still life's than movie sets.<br/><br/>In the spirit of rule breaking, Fincher makes his credits ascend upwards. I'm not sure if this is the first time this has ever been done, but it's the only movie I have seen it in. Aside from scrolling up, the credits are also visually interesting. Careless lines and scratches weave in and out of text."

","This commentary contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Screenwriters often complain about the ""A Film By ..."" credit showcasing a film's director for having conceived every aspect of the story.  If one takes a look at ""Se7en"" (particularly the DVD) one will see a flaw in this argument.<br/><br/>Reading the original source material -- the screenplay -- one sees yet another buddy-cop film.  The two detectives naturally don't get along, and of course one's about to retire.  The killer has a made-for-TV gimmick to his violent rampage (as Detective Mills himself says: ""You're a movie of the week, a bleeping T-shirt . . . at best!"").  The captain exists more or less to tell his detectives they're wasting their time and out of line (he does not, however, attempt to take their badges and guns).  By the end, the two heroes are (in Somerset's words) ""for the first time ever, in total agreement.""<br/><br/>There's even a Stallone-style punchline in the original script, which has Somerset executing John Doe and announcing, ""I'm retiring!""<br/><br/>Funny.  When you watch ""Se7en,"" you don't notice any of that.  The cookie-cutter script is transcended by David Fincher, the film's director, and his cast and crew.  One hesitates to say they ""livened"" up the film given its inherent murk, but without their contributions what would you have had?  A knock-off of a dozen other cop movies.<br/><br/>You can still spot the flowchart in some of the dialogue (especially the first meeting of Somerset and Mills) and subplots (the absurd notion that Somerset might not take this case as he is about to retire).  But the film never lets itself lurk in TV-grade banality.  Often Fincher stages the actors in real time, letting them exist as humans (witness the scene where Mills moves into Somerset's office, or the tiny pause after the dinner at the Mills' before conversation resumes).  The dirge-like music and grim crime scenes pulse with horror; afterward, the film pauses to let the two cops console each other as they sift through this violent mess.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman bring opposite styles to their characters and breathe life into their moments, but in the end product there is mercifully no mention of their respective races, and only perfunctory mention of their age difference.  They're two cops, working on a case.<br/><br/>In pacing and tone this film resembles an early 1970s cop drama like ""Serpico,"" where the audience is not force-fed exposition or standard lines of dialogue.  A lesser director and crew might have given us an episode of ""Miami Vice,"" with a maniacal, screaming John Doe chewing up his scenes. It is therefore worth mentioning the great choice by Kevin Spacey to play John Doe as the opposite of the Dennis Hopper-type villain which was Xeroxed into many films of the 1990s.  He is, as the movie says, ""methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient.""<br/><br/>By examining the DVD one can find the early stages of a rote film (in the deleted scenes, original ending, and script).  By watching the film itself one can see how masters of their craft can filter out the crap and deliver an end-product which doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator."

","This is a good film, though clearly below ""The Usual Suspects"" when rating films of the '90's. What makes the film stand out is its complete uniqueness. No other film comes to mind to even compare it to.<br/><br/>The achievement of the film is that even though it is unique, there is an undercurrent of believability about the whole thing. We know that mass murderers are a disturbing reality in modern-day life. We also know that it is not unusual for such murderers to plant clues, either consciously or subconsciously, i.e., to make it into a game played between himself and the cops.<br/><br/>This is what happens here, as the murders are carefully orchestrated to illustrate each one of the seven deadly sins. This is not so far out as it sounds, when you consider that we live in an era in which religious fanatics routinely blow themselves up for their cause, and routinely butcher countless thousands of their countrymen who oppose their cause in many places around the globe.<br/><br/>The explanation the Kevin Spacey character gives near the end of the film is entirely believable, and his performance, brief as it is, stands out. What is less believable are the performances of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as the detectives. The cliche of the cop about to retire paired with the energetic young cop has been beaten to death, and I am sorry it was used here. This would have been a better film if it had featured two detectives working together without the baggage thrown in (Freeman with his ""I'm out of here"" cynicism, and Pitt with his ""new in town"" naivete). The interaction of the two detectives just did not seem genuine to me. Freeman was better in other films, like ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Unforgiven"". And Pitt is just not one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the relatively few countries of the world in which the ""marketplace of ideas"" concept has taken root and flourishes are accustomed to expressing our ideas verbally. For the rest of the world, however, there is a depressingly frequent resort to violent action as a way of expressing ideas. In a world in which it is almost routine for Palestinians to sneak into Israel and blow themselves up in support of their cause, it does not seem incredible that the Kevin Spacey character here would sacrifice himself to his cause. As he says, ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.""<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","I'll quickly tell you about myself.  I am 14 years old and I was 11 when I first saw the movie.  I think that Seven is very good and worthwhile to see.<br/><br/>In some parts it was quite violent, but the violence made sense in the story line.  I think it was very good because it made you wonder what would happen next.  It had a very surprising ending, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it.<br/><br/>The other review paints it as being shocking and violent.  I personally don't think it was as bad as he made it out to be.  After all we shouldn't worry about fiction movies.<br/><br/>The movie stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow.  The person who acted best in this movie I think was the infamous Brad Pitt, as Detective Mills.<br/><br/>The story is about a murderer who kills people due to the seven deadly sins...eg. gluttony, wrath, pride.  The way he kills the people turns them agains the sin.<br/><br/>I would give this film 9.5/10!!!"

And then at the end of the picture, committing the ultimate act.  I won't say what, but he looked to me like he knew exactly what he was doing.

"ary","Null","0","0","3 May 1999"," Director David Fincher studies the limits of the cruelty and the human's degradation, through an implacable hunt for a serial killer!!
","A pretty and vain woman is tied in a bed and she has her face rip up with a razor. An obese man is forced to eat till his stomach explodes. A corrupt and greedy lawyer has part of his belly pulled up and he is forced to eat it. These are just some of the rudest scenes of a violent and morbid film that was filmed in 1995 and attracted a lot of people around the whole world to the box offices, but it also created plenty of polemic. The film is already one of the best thrillers done and it follows the noir style, generating,this way,an almost unbearable sensation of mystery, tension and fear, but at the same time attractive. The story of the film is intriguing and touching: detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) is sent to a new policemen's division in a violent metropolis (one of the great ideas of the plot is exactly not to mention in any moment the name of the city nor the year in which the story happens, making the show here more mysterious and intriguing ) and he has to team up with detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). It is obvious, from the first encounter among them,that the two don't understand each other and they don't like each other,but when a brutal series of murders begin to happen, following the seven capital sins, they are found in a situation in that they can either get join to hunt the violent serial killer or they won't be able to do nothing to stop the brutal crimes that are scaring the whole press around the world. And starting from that interesting and well-armed story several memorable and unforgettable scenes will happen, as the persecution in a full street, the talking and the thrill feeling between Tracy (Gwyneth Palthrow), the woman of Mills, and Sommerset in a restaurant, and the final climax that without a doubt is consecrated as the most shocking scene of film's history, and surprisingly this scene doesn't show anything concrete, but it suggests, what still turns everything more unbearable. ""Seven"" is an excellent film, a masterpiece directed with effectiveness by director David Fincher, who gets to ally a good plot and good sceneries (that explore the whole degrading aspect of the city: the homosexuals, the prostitutes, the drug addicts) with the exquisite Darius Khondji's picture, that certainly reaches the excellence level that, for example, Vilmos Szigmond got in ""Deliverance"". The only problem of ""Seven"", that impedes it of consecrating itself as an absolute classic of the gener√É¬¥ and to reign in the gallery in where the master Hitchcock's  films are, resides in the fact that the film ""gives away too soon"" the identity of the murderer. If perhaps the identity was surprising  the film would have shocked more, and it would become better. Even so ""Seven"" failed in that point, where it lacked more courage of the excellent film director David Fincher, but it achieved it's goal in many, many other points. But my analysis on the film only makes me to recommend it, and if you want yourself to be a part a  without- truces and breath-taking hunt,rent this film now!!!<br/><br/>""Seven"" is Rated R for grisly afterviews of horrific and bizarre killings, and for strong language; and it runs 123 minutes. The Cast: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Palthrow and John C. McGinley."

","It is not often that I am offended by a ""mainstream"" film. This is, without a doubt, one of the most distressing, disturbing and graphically horrific films I have ever seen. It approaches the level of shock and outrage I felt after seeing documentary footage of the appalling brutality and inhumanity of the various WW II concentration camps.

"ToldYaSo","10","0","0","24 April 1999"," The most disturbing film I have ever seen
","I've had this discussion with many friends on what the most disturbing film they've ever seen is, and the results have been fairly consistent.<br/><br/>The fact is, that ""Se7en"" is the most disturbing film I have ever seen in my 28 years and it will likely have a stronghold grip on that title for some time to come. I say this from a male perspective.<br/><br/>And while I can appreciate why some of my female friend's opinions that ""Silence Of The Lambs"" holds the ""Most Disturbing"" title, I have to say that title was lost when ""Se7en"" was released. David Fincher's dark vision is incredibly creative and harrowing and will likely stay with me for years to come. When I first saw this film with my brother, I was blown away. This film taps into the greatest fear of all men, smashing like a sledgehammer into the weakest, most delicate area of the male psyche. I didn't rise from my seat at the theater not because I couldn't wait to see the credits, but rather to let the feeling in my stomach subside, so that I may walk out properly with some semblance of dignity.<br/><br/>Being a newly married man, I found the film to be the sheer embodiment of my worst fears which spoiler guidelines prohibit me from elaborating on. ""Silence of the Lambs"" may have freaked me out a bit, but it never touched me the way this film did.<br/><br/>Coming home, I couldn't decide what to tell my wife about the film. I did enjoy the film. It's a masterful achievement for any filmmaker, and the principal cast was excellent. But I didn't want her to see it, and realize my greatest fear. I told her straight out the reasons why, and I think it scared her off enough. Eventually, I had calmed down, and changed my tune. It was the only time in my life that I have behaved in such a manner.<br/><br/>We had another couple over, and my good friend's wife had also not seen the film. We watched the video with due reverence, and at its end had a discussion about it. Both women agreed that they enjoyed it very much, but it didn't have the same effect on them as it did us. The fact that ""Silence of the Lambs"" victims were all female may have something to do with our wives' points-of-view. Nevertheless, I can scarcely imagine a film that would tap into my soul and chill it in the same way ""Se7en"" has."

","My expectation of Se7en wasn't that big. Maybe that's why i loved it that much. The actors are fantastic, the plot scary, and both the music and directing tops the best X- files episode. This one even gets on top of ''The silence of the lambs'' ( even though the copying from that movie is pretty obvious ). It got me in about the same way as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was dark and disgusting. I mean, just the idea of getting a big fat man eat himself to death makes anyone land on your knees and throw up. The city is as dark and rainy as in ''Blade Runner'' and ''The Crow'', the plot at least as good as in Silence of the lambs, and none of the actors have made a better performance than they did in this movie. The best of them was of course Kevin Spacey. This movie is going up to number 4 on my favorite movie-list. I don't think i can describe it any further. Go and watch Se7en now. If you dare that is."

","Let me say at the outset that I am not a great admirer of David Fincher as a director. Alien3 was far too dreary and bleak, while The Game seemed to be a hollow,if stylish, exercise in manipulation. Having said that, I must register my admiration for Se7en. It was both absolutely terrifying and  thought -provoking. The cinematography, the acting,and script were all superb. Morgan Freeman is indeed one of the world's greatest actors, while Brad Pitt does a great job  as the slow-witted, dogged, arrogant young cop. (Perhaps because his own personality in real life is so similar.) However, the revelation is the performance by the actor playing ""John Doe"" . I will not give his name, as that would help give away the plot Having sung se7ens praises, why do I call it ""nihilistic""? For one thing, the overall tone of the film is one of dread and despair. But much more importantly, Se7en boasts one of the most terrifying endings of any film I have ever seen. It makes the ending of Chinatown seem like the ending of It's a Wonderful Life."

"Jaime N. Christley","Null","0","0","5 April 1999"," Dark, depressing, captivating, thrilling
","1995 was the best year for movies since the 1970s.  Think about it: ""Clockers"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Heat"", ""Seven"", ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" all came out that year.  Even the Academy Award picked films were top-drawer:  ""Braveheart"", ""Casino"", ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Babe"", the list goes on.<br/><br/>In choosing the best film of the year, I keep wavering between ""Seven"", ""Heat"" and ""Clockers"".  Right now I've elected ""Heat"", but ""Seven"" is close on its heals.  This, to quote Roger Ebert, is filmmaking of a high order. Of all the skillfully crafted scenes and shots in the film, I will talk about two.<br/><br/>The opening scene is wonderful--it's not a car chase, it's Morgan Freeman's Detective Somerset getting ready for his last day at work.  I remember the camera gazing down on his dresser, upon which is carefully arranged his ""stuff""--the things he carries around on his person on a typical day.  I can't recall what the things were, exactly, I just remember what an odd, familiar feel the camera gave them.  Morgan Freeman assembles his detective with care:  we know before a word is spoken this is his last day on the job. His precision is reminiscent of the end of the ""Quentin"" chapter in Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury"", where Quentin does all of his day-to-day tasks, right down to brushing his teeth and inquiring about the correct time, just before.....<br/><br/>The other scene is the library scene.  It'd be fair to say that any modern film sequence that features Bach's ""Suite No 3 in D-major, BMV 1068: Air"" might be raised to the level of classic pop art, and in this case, you'd be right.  Bach is strangely appropriate here, and totally appropriate for the film.  So is Trent Reznor, who contributed the music for the titles.  What is the purpose of the scene?  Not much, just some guys looking stuff up in the city library.  Is it gloomily beautiful, sad, and memorable? Absolutely.<br/><br/>A few words on film music.  Critics tried to tell us that ""Seven""'s soundtrack was a mish-mash of classic and modern styles, serving only as a fishing net to catch fancy of as many moviegoers' tastes as possible. Negative, ghostrider, the pattern is full.  If I had to criticize ""Seven""'s music, I would say:  a director like David Fincher, who clearly takes soundtrack selection seriously, is apt to inspire copycats the way Tarantino did after ""Pulp Fiction"".  Fresh film school graduates who imagine they possess eclectic tastes (""yeah, I listen to Mozart and Metallica and all that"") will inevitably be inspired to try and duplicate Fincher's scoring. It can't be done:  movies aren't just clotheslines for catchy pop tunes and the random selection from ""Classical Music For Dummies"".  Anyone who studies film will agree with me when I say that the music, like the cinematography, must suit the story and the scene, not the other way around.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""Seven"" is a first-rate detective story, the best since ""Kiss Me Deadly"".  Performances, photography, Oscar-nominated editing, and (of course) music are all tops."

Powerful performances by Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Gwyneth Paltrow help this movie along swiftly, and without much error. But the real winner in this movie was Kevin Spacey as John Doe.

"Rerun-2","Null","0","0","27 February 1999"," A dark journey, literally
","Seven is a movie that left its imprint on my mind for days.  I remember being so shaken leaving the theater that I had trouble unlocking my car door, because my hands were shaking so bad.  It's that frightening, not in its content but its message.  It is not exaggerating to say that this film is lacking in any hope.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of the last seven days in the career of a veteran homicide detective, name Will Somersett, played by Morgan Freeman in a brilliant performance.  He is retiring after 30 years on the force, because he is simply tired of it.  He has seen so much evil, so much hate and death and gore and trauma, that when he learns that his replacement asked to be transferred to his precinct (in a seedy section of a city I don't recall ever being given a name), he is amazed.<br/><br/>The cop that will replace him is David Mills (Brad Pitt), who defensively reminds Somersett of his background, that he worked in homicide for 5 years. ""Not here,"" says Somersett, and treats him like a rookie, because in all the ways that count, he still is.  He still has hope, and still feels that he can make a difference, which is why he transferred here.  Boy, will he be surprised.<br/><br/>Their first case proves Somersett's point.  A very large man is found in his home, dead.  He was forced to eat at gunpoint until he hemmoraged internally, then kicked in the stomach to finish the job.  Another man is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh, and a woman is savagely mutilated, then offered both a phone and sleeping pills, and allowed to choose whether to call for help or commit suicide.<br/><br/>This is not your average serial killer.  Mills and most of the other cops believe the killer is simply brutally insane, but Somersett believes he is trying to send a message.  What kind of message?  Well, at the fat man's crime scene the word ""Gluttony"" is carved into a wall.  Other murder scenes leave behind the words ""Pride"" and ""Greed"".  ""The Seven Deadly Sins,"" intones Somersett.  He knows a lot about this sort of thing because he spends his evenings at the library, reading Dante and Saint Thomas Aquinus. Mills is less educated, and has to rely on Cliff Notes to keep up.<br/><br/>The plot grows thicker as the killer leaves more clues, and more bodies in a trail that leads through many apartment buildings that seem to be behind in their electric payments; there hardly seems to be any light anywhere.  It rains incessantly throughout most of the movie, until the climax, which I will not describe.<br/><br/>The movie is full of little details that add depth to otherwise small scenes.  One example: a man who runs a whorehouse is brought in for questioning after another of the murders is discovered.  In a lesser film he would have just been another slimy purveyor of cheap sex and kinky thrills, just to add a little color.  Instead, he is asked if he likes his job.  He answers by saying ""No, I don't.""  He leans forward, and glares at the cop. ""But that's just life, isn't it?""  Not exactly standout dialogue but my point is the movie takes the time to flesh out even bit characters.<br/><br/>If I have made this movie sound dreary, bloodsoaked and hopeless, then I have described it well.  It is all of these things, and intentionally so. To say that is not to criticize it; on the contrary, it is actually very well conceived and strongly acted.  The plot is brilliantly set up, and the movie is not just a sick exploitation picture.  Every murder takes place off-screen, save one.  The filmmakers understand that it is scarier to see the aftermath of a killing than to actually see it happen.  The movie has had a noticeable impact on television as well, shows such as Millennium and Profiler could be said to have been inspired by Seven.<br/><br/>Did I enjoy it?  In a word, no.  It is simply too dark, too staggeringly hopeless in it implications in the end that I cannot walk out of such a movie feeling like I ""enjoyed"" it.  That is not to say I don't think it was a good movie.  I admire its superior craftsmanship and its style.  But afterward I felt like going someplace with lots of people and plenty of light."

","Seven is one of the most disturbing films ever to come to the screen. This is one of those movies that will get under your skin, and stay with you for a long time. I appreciate this movie not because I am preoccupied with death, or horrific murder scenes...on the contrary, death and murder scare me, and so I would hope a film that portrays these things would do so in a very frightening way. Seven does. Indeed, this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I only recommend this one to people who can stomach very dark, and painfully realistic movies. If you do want to see it, be warned that it does contain some of the most disturbing murder scenes I have ever witnessed on film, and the ending will haunt you long after the film is over. However, the realness...the idea that in life there aren't always happy endings, shines through in Seven. If that is the kind of movie you like, or think you can appreciate, then by all means, see Seven."

","With Fincher's 'Panic Room' coming out next week, I decided to watch this gem of a detective thriller from 1995. I must say, however, that I watched the butchered BBC version which (for some God unknown reason) was shown pre-watershed AND with an hour's break in-between to show the news. This did not spoil my enjoyment, though, as it's one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>I've seen loads of detective thrillers (Kiss the Girls, Hangman, Resurrection, Along Came a Spider, etc.) and this puts them all to shame. It even seems unfair to pigeon-hole a movie this good, but anyhow there's a lot to like about it: <br/><br/><ul><li>The atmosphere created by Fincher is excellent, and the gloominess adds to the dark subject matter of the movie. It always seems to be dark and raining, and the filth of the city is really captured. The atmosphere is like a character all its own.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting is great. While the roles of the jaded-old-cop-near-retirement and the cocky-new-cop-on-the-block are nothing new for this genre, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring a fantastic freshness to the characters of Somerset and Mills, respectively. Kevin Spacey made a great John Doe, and Gwyneth Paltrow was good in her limited screen time. Another good thing was the film was never boring, as it's actually enjoyable to see Mills and Somerset interact and follow up leads. My only negative comment about the acting is Pitt goes WAY OTT on the climax. It was a bit hammy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good contrast between Freeman's disillusionment with the job (and with city life) and Pitt's eagerness to make a difference and to catch criminals. There's even a similarity between Freeman's and Spacey's characters, as both are world-weary and sick of the scum on the streets. The difference is Somerset has given up, while John Doe kills the people he believes are sinners. Is Doe Somerset's dark side?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Doe is a terrific serial killer- calm, rational, patient, but also menacing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending: brilliant.</li></ul><br/><br/>Anyone thinking of seeing Panic Room (or have already seen it) check this out. Brilliant."

Brad Pitt was great in portraying the leading character in this film; he and Morgan Freeman made it worthwhile. Morgan Freeman has showed everybody his outstanding acting skills; he seems not to be such an arrogant and bad person. He really enveloped himself into the role very well.<br/><br/>The plot is original and unexpected; I have to warn you ahead of time that there are some possible spoilers; it's not neither a happy nor a horror movie. Some parts of this interesting movie are quite disturbing. I shall probably never forget when the fat man died at the beginning; it was horrible to see that person dying because of gluttony. It was incredible and disturbing. It certainly made me think a lot.  On the other hand it was completely impressive when the person who died of laziness seemed to be alive; he looked terrible. As for the murderer Juan P√©rez (Kevin Spacey), he was great in portraying the killer. It's a movie that will make you think a lot about life and death. The outcome was incredible, I never thought Juan Perez had cut Brad Pitt's wife head off, and then Brad had killed him. It shows us that he killed him because of the wrath he felt. Overall, this is a dramatic and disturbing movie. I recommend it to everybody who likes very dramatic movies. 8/10"

","Se7en stars Morgan Freeman as the world-weary detective preparing for retirement and Brad Pitt as his young replacement in this moody crime thriller that leaves you gripped from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The two detectives are trying to track down a calculating, sadistic killer, known as John Doe, who is patterning his murders after the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy and Wrath.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** These murders really push the barriers of violence in mainstream cinema, with one overweight man forced to eat until he quite literally burst, one prostitute being shagged to death by a giant, spiked dildo and one horrifically mutilated victim found to be still alive.  However, most of the worst violence is suggested rather than blatantly displayed, and none of the murders actually occur onscreen, preventing the movie from becoming a run-of-the-mill slasher movie. ***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman gives his best performance ( save that as Redd in The Shawshank Redemption) as Somerset, the detective who's seen it all.  The audience is really able to empathise with him as he solemnly goes from crime scene to crime scene.  He also has some of the films most chilling lines, speaking of some of the horrors in society.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is great as well as the brash young rookie Mills.  He is more the action man of the two, but is every bit as well developed a character as Somerset.  Pitt performs his best at the film's tense finale.  Gwyneth Paltrow provides a balance to Brad Pitt's character as his wife, being more calm and friendly, and fitting comfortably into her supporting role.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** My favourite character, however, is John Doe, played chillingly well by the uncredited Kevin Spacey.  As he preaches his twisted message to the detectives in the car journey towards the climax, you can't help but feel that he's got a point.  In John Doe, Kevin Spacey has created the most chilling killer since Hannibal Lecter. ***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>David Fincher showed the world that he was a fantastic director with this movie, and he furthered the point with ""Fight Club"", meaning that he is (almost) forgiven for Alien 3.  With the sombre mood, he manages to make the unnamed city every bit as threatening as John Doe.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Se7en is a movie that you have to see, although not if you're squeamish.  Trust me, it will blow you away - 10/10."

","Not a ""horror"" movie as many have referred to it, but a grisly thriller on both physical and psychological levels. If the line between genius and insanity is a thin one, this movie is about what happens when the genius crosses over it in a particularly dark way. The two cops who have to deal with him are nicely contrasting, one battle-weary, the other gung-ho. Both of them are ultimately out of their depth against the genius madman. Brad Pitt does a superb job as the younger guy whose mind is slowing being blown, while Morgan Freeman in my opinion does not stretch much but competently handles the 'voice of experience' role. <br/><br/>If this movie has a defect, it lies in demanding too much from the viewer. It's not light entertainment. Excellent script, beautiful direction.<br/><br/>**** SPOILER ****<br/><br/>Someone mentioned that this movie could inspire copycats. Ever see the testimony of Brandon Wilson in the Matthew Cecchi murder where he suggests ""Execute me""?

"XRANDY","Null","0","0","4 February 2002"," Freeman is the impetus in this modern film noir masterwork
","Like `The Silence of the Lambs', `Seven' is a film that uses intense characters and psychological intrigue to move beyond the limitations of gore and decadence in serial killer flicks.  It is, after all, easy to make a film drenched in the depravation of a society approaching anomie, but it is not a simple matter to make it smart and fresh.  <br/><br/>Truth be told though, for all the well-exhibited talents of Pitt, Paltrow and Spacey it is Freeman who saves this film from trapping itself into a sordid mess.  He provides just the right edge as one of the most interesting cops ever on the big screen.  His profundity makes him a pariah to his peers, as he is azygous to the point of being incongruous among lesser thinkers.  This is juxtaposed nicely in the scenes where he goes to the library to construe John Doe's literary inspirations, while Mills (Pitt) snags some Cliff's Notes.  We quickly note that while Somerset (Freeman) is a bete noire in the police department (probably feared as many smart people are) he is the only person with the intellect required to defeat John Doe.<br/><br/>It is Somerset's contrast that provides suitable pauses in the tumult and allows for Pitt's intensity and Paltrow's tenderness to have convincing voices.  It is his erudite manner of investigating the grizzly murders that makes them more than psychopathic folderol in the long book of inhumane criminality.  If violence is truly an atavistic impulse, then Somerset reminds us that compassion probably is also.<br/><br/>A very disturbing, yet worthy effort that pays attention to numerous details.  A well made film that is highly recommended."

","The Thin Red Line is the best war film I have ever seen. But I hate to classify it as that, because if you do and someone reads that it's a war film, they're going to expect Saving Private Ryan.  The two were compared when first released because they were released the same year and were both up for Oscars.  However, the two are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILMS WITH DIFFERENT INTENTIONS.  So, I won't waste time, energy or space comparing the two.<br/><br/>There is a stellar, all-star cast, but there really is no star.  The film has a flexible narrative and the story adapted from James Jones' novel is told from different points of view.  This is a problem for today's audiences who are not open minded when watching a film that doesn't play like a standard popcorn flick or T.V. movie.  Like Mulholland Drive a viewer can come in the middle of it and not really miss anything as far as not understanding what's happening now.  It's like an or circular film that just keeps going - like the war for the soldiers that never seems to end.<br/><br/>This film has been criticized so many times, for so many different reasons. And those who criticize it, also criticize those who like it, saying that they (the people who like it) think that film is philosophical, when really it isn't.  Or theat the philosophy is only sophomoric.  But the film is about the soldiers and I would doubt that these soldiers were Philosophy majors, so if the philosophy is sophomoric (which I don't feel it is) it's because they are.  But I should point out and remind people that Terrence Malick taught Philosophy at MIT, and I would think he has a better comprehension of it that the people who are criticizing his use of it.<br/><br/>I also think that the people who criticize this film are the same hypocrites who hated 2001: A Space Odyssey, until it became a classic, and then started to like it.  The Thin Red Line is a film that is ahead of an audience.  Like the work of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, the film takes more than one viewing to fully understand, which may be impossible.  But if you're open minded enough, it is such an enjoyable movie in its grandeur.  That is another thing people dislike, its pretensions.  But how do they expect Malick to deal with a subject as broad as WAR, and not just a group of soldiers, and avoid the possibility of pretension? <br/><br/>Most war film deal with a select few that we as an audience get to know.  We don't here.  We only get to glance.  And we glance at so many people it's hard to KNOW any of them.  I have not fought in war, but I would assume that is what it is like.  You'd get to know who you're close to, but the others, you would just see.<br/><br/>I think that this film is more realistic about war than most.  We don't just see a constant attack.  We see the quieter moments.  Not all war is fighting, sometimes the hardest times are when nothing happens in life. People always say to ""keep busy"".  Well what happens if you don't?<br/><br/>We see the women in these soldiers' life (another thing criticized).  I don't know about you, but if I was alone in a war, I'd probably be thinking about the good things in life too - which unfortunately may also turn out to be bad.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is superb.  Nick Notle, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, Jim Caviezel are all fantastic.  The music is awe inspiring. When the main theme hits a certain point, a few minutes in it's breathtaking.  The cinematography - the island - is like a character in itself.  Man's war is at the same time a war against nature, against our environment.  I can't remember any other film that took such an effective turn in using the camera to make the viewer seem like you are in the film.<br/><br/>I can still remember some of the images.  They're imprinted like a photograph burned onto paper.<br/><br/>Whether people admit it or not, this film is a masterpiece.  It is one of the best films I have ever seen.  And I am glad that I had an open enough mind so that I could see that film for what it is - a work of true art."

","I thought this was a decent movie.  I did not think it was the great movie that many who left comments rave about.  Here is why:<br/><br/>(some spoilers, nothing big/about the end:)<br/><br/>Why were city detectives handling this very serious case by themselves? Where was the FBI?  Where were the psychologists and the profilers?  At least, why weren't these detectives trained in how to deal with this killer on a psychological level and what kind of man they were looking for -- ie, what he would look like, the kind of place he would live, etc.?  BASIC profiling skills.<br/><br/>Killers often return to the crime scene after the killing.  The detectives could have caught this killer early in the film.  But I guess there wouldn't have been much of a movie if they were educated enough to know what they were doing . . .<br/><br/>Read a few books on serial killers and you will know more than these two detectives did.<br/><br/>Serial killers are methodical and patient, as the Morgan Freeman character states.  Therefore, it does not make sense that this killer who started this killing a YEAR before the detectives knew what he was up to would skip ""wrath"" entirely.  Victim number #6 (I won't mention because I don't want to spoil it) did nothing wrong.  The killer goes on in the back-of-the-car scene that his victims weren't innocent --- blah blah blah -- but what about #6!!  #6 was innocent.<br/><br/>What did Morgan Freeman learn from all his reading and study at the library? It did not help him at all with catching this guy or stopping his killing.<br/><br/>When Brad Pitt saw that the killer had taken a picture of him (Brad Pitt), why didn't he worry that the guy might be interested in him or his life?<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman found the killer through that list of the people who checked out relevant library books. Why couldn't the killer have sat in the library and read the books?  What if the killer BOUGHT the books at a store?  He was independently wealthy, why did he need to check books out for two weeks when he could own them permanently?  Bought them with some of that stash of cash he had under his bed.  No records left behind.  No trail.  He went through the trouble to cut off his fingertips, but didn't go to a bookstore?<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment for me was waiting through the whole film to see the detectives do something wise or brilliant or meaningful or assertive to get this case solved and have the killer fall right into their laps.  The killer was dynamic.  The detectives were limp noodles."

","The title of the film 'Seven' is very exact and dominating in the telling of its story. Seven murders take place in the time of seven days, each death based on one of the seven deadly sins. The climax to the film also takes place at 7.07am. So the film cleverly bases its structure on the film's title. The film is in the genre of a neo-noir thriller. It gains its category through the dark techniques used throughout the movie. The deliberately dark and shabby lighting is to express how corrupt and depressing city life is. The fact the city is anonymous could prompt many people to name it themselves, New York, Los Angeles its left up to the viewer, or perhaps the movie is saying many cities are like this around the world. The film goes totally against the thriller cliche. The film throws away the modern day thriller rule book and makes its own rules where the good guy doesn't always win and the bad guy doesn't necessarily get caught. In Seven, John Doe is the killer, a bland, ordinary looking guy, with a bland ordinary name, but thats the point, murderers aren't necessarily monsters they're just everyday people like you and me. The idea of the movie is that in a world this corrupt, anyone is capable of murder and sin. This film does more than just give the usual tale of police chasing killer, it gives a film makers representation of modern living, and shows all the possible evils lurking inside it."

This is a gut wrencher from the first murder to the very disturbing last scenes.  If you have a weak stomach, you need to be warned.  The murders, mirroring the Seven Deadly Sins, are evil incarnate....not really too gory but just so damn evil.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman do good jobs as the police who are hot in pursuit of John Doe, the killer with the twisted, perverse modus operandi.

","What seemed to be a fairly typical formulaic serial killer mystery , with the older, world weary  retiring cop, imparting his ""wiser"" and jaded view of the world on a younger new comer, takes a sudden unexpected turn and becomes a brilliant original. The conversation that transpires in the car between the two main detective characters and the killer on the way to the final scene is absolutely mesmerizing. What's really fascinating is to watch Detective Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) face as he listens to John Doe explain his view of the state of the world as he realizes how much it resembles his own view as stated just the night before in the bar with his partner. Especially in regard to the apathy of the populace. Of course John Doe's solution to the problem is perverted and psychotic. John Doe is a very effective representation of twisted religious fundamentalism that sees every one that doesn't follow their particular moral code as infidels deserving of death, and carrying out their death is only doing God's work. This movie comes out of nowhere to be a piercing thought provoker. Added note: Great and fitting closing credits song ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" by David Bowie from his much underappreciated album, Outside."

","Before seeing this movie, I was expecting great things.  All of my friends who had seen it before me had told me what a great movie it was.  It was good, a taught thriller that was quite satisfying.  Until the ending, that is, which was the worst cop out of an ending that I could imagine for this film.<br/><br/>Up until the very last four minutes of this film, I would have rated it a 10.  The cinematography was fantastic, the acting by Morgan Freeman and R. Lee Emery in particular fantastic.  Also, Kevin Spacey was very good as John Doe, but there was something particularly hollow in his demeanor at the end. Without giving away the details, there is no way this is in the top 100 films on IMDB, but it is a good film.  It's no Citizen Kane, though.<br/><br/>The obvious comparison for this movie is ""Fight Club,"" another Fincher effort.  Fincher is much more successful in ""Fight Club,"" though, especially on the ending, which felt not only natural, but left you with closure (unlike in ""Se7en,"" where you are definitely left feeling that there was another half hour of unfinished business, or the ending should have been different).  I loved fight club, but ""Se7en"" I would not go and see again. Just flat out not nearly as good a movie."

And I didn't like the ending, not because it wasn't real or well written, but because it wasn't a happy ending where the good guy ""gets"" the bad guy.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly deep and in the mean time, very enjoyable. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey and Gweneth Paltrow deliver masterful performances. Paltrow's performance practically ruined the movie for me because she was so convincing.<br/><br/>I would recommend that people own this movie. Even though it has a rap for being gross, most of the gross parts are in the mind of the viewer.<br/><br/>This movie is proof that the most brilliant rendering of horror is that of human imagination. It proves that movie makers who spend millions of dollars making this computer graphics monster to look scary are looking in the wrong place. There is a part where someone is starved to the point where he eats his tongue. This most cruel thought that escaped even the most twisted producers of horror movies is not even depicted. Yet, when it is simply thrown out there, you cannot help the chills that run up your spine.. It is as if you are seeing this horrible act take place.. Each one of us will imagine it in his/her own disgusting and horrific way, yet all of us will have that chill. This is because the writing of the script is so solid, and the delivery of the actors is so strong that you BELIEVE them.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is the story of two homicide detectives, one old and retiring, the other young and new.. Both have contradicting views that represent the old vs new conflict in its generality. The young cop still believes in good, he still believes his job is to ""catch the bad guys."" The older cop's view has changed over time to just collecting evidence, he has seen too many ""bad guys"" slip away to still believe that his work actually leads to avenging the murdered victims. One studies the mindset of the murderer, the other studies the evidence and the finger prints. They are truly a pair.<br/><br/>This pair is assigned a daunting task.. That of a serial killer killing through applying the seven sins on people whom he perceives are doing them. For the sin of Gluttony, he would feed an overweight man until he dies.. And so forth. The killer is creative and is unbelievably dedicated and cruel.<br/><br/>The movie is not simply a thriller where you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the next gruesome murder to unfold, nor is it a trivial action movie where you know the good guy won't be harmed or that the bad guy will be caught. <br/><br/>I would have liked to see the movie end on any different note than the one it ended on, but it's just the harsh reality that the movie wanted to deliver.<br/><br/>In addition to the magnificent tale, the movie deliver several warning bells, such as police personnel in police stations who share info with the press for money. Also, the idea that the FBI having a few ""flags"" over certain books and people who borrow them or buy them. These are realities of the police world that were never addressed before and are addressed effectively yet in a realistic sense in the movie."

When a person is insane, as you clearly are, do you know that you're insane? Maybe you're just sitting around, reading ""Guns and Ammo"", masturbating in your own feces, do you just stop and go, ""Wow! It is amazing how f**king crazy I really am!""? Yeah. Do you guys do that?<br/><br/>*******WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead*******<br/><br/>One of the best mindf***s ever penned for the big screen, Se7en wouldn't have made my list if it hadn't been for the DVD (which was a better print quality than the original in theatres). The cut scenes on the DVD add to the whole aura of this film, and for me, make it that much better. I find the whole concept fascinating to conceive and somewhat disturbing to receive. Of course the film is based on the seven deadly sins and while it's completely religious in nature, Fincher seemed to focus more on the crimes than their religious implications. This is a very perverse and dark film, but that's what makes it great.<br/><br/>Plot/Story: This is one of those great stories that has one of the best endings in Hollywood history. The plot twists kept coming and coming that by the time the end hit you were so spun around that it was a compete shock to see it. What's even more impressive are the two alternate endings were almost as good as the one Fincher went with (one was actually filmed, the other was only on stills). The story itself revolves around a retiring detective and his up and coming replacement as they push each others buttons while trying to solve the most disturbing case either of them has ever been involved in. The villain (Kevin Spacey) meanwhile, has been planning to carry out his psychotic rage for well over a year and in the course of week has set a whole new standard in serial killing. This is an excellent, well thought-out script that deserved more awards and nominations than it got.<br/><br/>Acting: Freeman and Pitt are two of my favorite actors and they eat up the screen with two very believable characters. Paltrow does an okay job, a lot of people say she was excellent, but there's only so much you can do as a supporting cast, pregnant wife ya know? Spacey on the other hand takes his cake and eats it too. I hadn't seen Se7en since it came out until I got the DVD and the thing I remembered most about the movie was that the bad guy was great. When I watched the DVD and saw Spacey I nearly crapped my pants! I was shocked I couldn't remember his face, but stunned that I had such a vivid memory of the character. Some his best work was done on this film also.<br/><br/>Characters: The characters themselves are not as amazing as the people playing them, you can't relate to any of them and they all seem so complicated you wish the movie were longer just so you could figure them out. Of course if the movie were any longer it would have really dragged in a number of places.<br/><br/>Effects/Setting: The setting is typical for the mood. Everything is dark and gloomy, it rains all the time, the people are brooding and at times you almost understand why John Doe has went nuts and felt he needed to commit his crimes. The deadly 'sins' are what make it impressive, from gluttony to the full uncut vanity (cut so terribly short in the theatres), the stuff John Doe has done to these people is full of cringe factor.<br/><br/>Score/Soundtrack: Like the setting the music is just as moody and black. Perfect fit for a film like this.<br/><br/>Se7en usually makes everyone's Top 10, but not mine. It's a great movie, but the ending alone can't save it all. The pacing at certain times really bores me, and I know I can't be the only one. The brooding nature of the film is actually a part of the experience; Fincher makes it hard to relate to the characters for the art of it (I think). This is one of the best thrillers ever made, bar none. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt prove why they are two of Hollywood's most sought after commodities and still it serves as a stepping-stone for Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow. One thing, though, don't watch this film if you're in a bad mood, you might find yourself committing seven deadly sins. Yes, I went there."

","I believe it was Sophocles who once said: 'How dreadful the knowledge of the truth can be when there is no help in truth!'.<br/><br/>Se7en carries the same struggle as it lurks and creeps behind the film's agony. The plot is very simple. An unknown murderer has started a murderous spree using the seven deadly sins as his motive. Two detectives are involved with the case: Sommerset, an intelligent man ready to retire within a week and Mills, a rookie detective believing that he can break all the enigmas. The film is intensely dark and pessimistic and in fact there is no hope anywhere. The deaf citizens walk in the street, the cars drive through the traffic and the whole city resembles an urban atrocity. The name of the city is never mentioned but it appears as if David Fincher attempted to use a mixture of New York, Chicago and Philadelphia's outskirts which does not find a way to perceive itself into the viewer's tastes. It always rains and we never see a welcoming day. Even if there is light, they're hopeless pools of luminosity reflecting the dead surfaces that live within Fincher's world.<br/><br/>The characters are acted astonishingly. My favourite is Morgan Freeman's character, Detective William Sommerset. He plays an intellectual outcast of the city that no longer feels pity to help it breath again. He is a typical chess player: he picks his words carefully and cautiously plays his actions to a person. He has lost hope in humanity and only strives to work because it is the only object that allows him to express his hate to himself and the city. To others he seems bossy, prude and unpatient but he has a right to be. I presume that most people after seeing the film will relate to him more than the rest of the characters. Brad Pitt's Detective David Mills is probably the only character that smiles without any force. He is young, energetic and aims to do the best for his job. His wife, played my Gwyneth Paltrow also plays a part to keep the film carry a little bit of optimism. She is pregnant and does not want to tell her husband because she is confused of whether to grow a child into this corrupted city or have an abortion. The only person who knows about it is Sommerset. The film's ending holds one of the most disturbing scenes ever to be portrayed in the world of cinema. It isn't gory but just astonishingly shocking, having the ability to outrage any strong mind just because of the whole surprise that awaits directly into the end. Since this film was out a long time ago it will do no harm for me to mention the killer's (John Doe) performer who is Kevin Spacey. We only meet him during the late end of the film but he has one of the most interesting lines as he talks to the two detectives about the objective of his murders as they head along to pick up two more bodies. The scene where they show his apartment is beyond imagination; it actually describes his personality. He is a smart man gone insane. A typical example of a perplexed and bewildered person who no longer sees the need to carry with the laws of the community but the need to change them.<br/><br/>The film has its religious entangements but in the end it is not only concerned with the principality of religion but of the struggle to make a transitional move in society. Any non-religious or atheistical person will adore this film because it guarantees to represent the image of a world gone mad, deceased and lost in its oblivion. It's better to not mention the film's disturbing parts because they will reveal themselves whether the audience will like it or not. Since the WTC bombings, this film may not be pleasing to many people as it leaves them combined with an emotional end reaction. It is the kind of film that searches a place in the mind and locks itself indisputably. Fincher's FIGHT CLUB was more optimistic than this as it was filled with the of a dark humour but in my personal opinion this stays Fincher's best work so far and probably one of the best film of the 90s Hollywood shelves.<br/><br/>You will be confused, frightened and left into a pit of uncertainty. Enjoy."

But am I ever glad it was bought for me.<br/><br/>This is really great stuff. A dark rain-soaked city gave it style, superb performances by Morgan Freeman as a burned out veteran, and by Brad Pitt as hot-shot David Mills gave it creditable performances. John Doe was suitably chilling, and the plot unfolded brilliantly.<br/><br/>A few people say that the gore should have been cut back, but this is something I disagree with. Not because I'm a gore-hound, but the scenes of almost untamed brutality injected the horror of the whole situation into the stylish surroundings. The sloth victim in particular. A whole year....<br/><br/>There are some minor gripes however. I felt that the majority of time was spent on the first three victims, then the rest of them were slightly rushed through. At the end car ride, I was still guessing how exactly it was going to end. When the box made an appearance though, I knew straight away what was in it, although I didn't know how Mills would react until he did.<br/><br/>Lastly, and this is nothing to do with the actual film itself, but I am positively baffled by people who say that it frightened them, and that it was scary.

","** WARNING SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>All-original serial killer movie with so much twists as a rollercoaster ride, the most remarkable thing about of this movie is being an absolute work of genius from such a young and unexperienced director. Using all the old formulas, using all the old paces, using all the old actor's tecniques, the movie reinvents a world of cinema, and establishes an example. John Mills, a young homicide detective, is a newcomer to the city where the veteran Williams Somerset has worked for years. Mills is retiring, and he will be substitued by Mills. Somerset agrees with Mills sticking around him for a week, seven days, during which he will supposedly give some tips of the trade to the Mills. Turns out, this week is also the week when a scarily methodical serial killer purges his obsession. As Mills and Somerset investigate the death of a titanically obese man, everything leads to the conclusion that it was a homicide. When a famous lawyer is killed and the word ""Greed"" is written with his blood, they fear the worst. When they find the word ""Gluttony"" written with grease at the obese man's death site, the worst is confirmed: there is a killer which acts according to the seven deadly sins. This will be the ultimate test to both an experienced man and a rookie youngster. And they will find out that everything they think they can foresee is actually wrong. They will find out that the man they are following is actually controlling them. Making history, the movie relies on quasi-expressionist ways to transmit an entire mood: the weather never changing, contributing to a depressed view of a depressing world. The violence comes never from actions, but from the pictures, the shots are almost fixed, the time is never rushed, and the movie never gives up on itself, constructing, inventing, inovating, thrilling and scaring. This is not a light-hearted experience. This is an experience in the whole sense of the word. This movie is an unique oeuvre, and will stand the test of time by the way it is inimitable. A test of a director's talent, and a true cult movie which demands multiple viewings."

","Thrillers are my favorite type of movies, and this is my favorite thriller, so basically this is more or less my favorite movie of all-time!!!! Brad Pitt has become an awesome actor, not content to rest on his prettyboy image, and you just can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman.  To top it off, you have Gwyneth Paltrow posing as Pitt's wife, and a cameo by one of my favorite actors, who I sadly cannot reveal. Se7en is the story of two detectives (Pitt & Freeman), trying to catch a patient and determined killer.  John Doe (played by someone whom I cannot name), bases his murders upon the writings of Dante and his idea of seven deadly sins; gluttony, greed, pride, sloth, lust, envy and wrath.  The detectives must catch Doe before he completes the 7 murders and disappears from the public eye. What can be said about this movie, other than ""SEE IT""?  It is dark, it doesn't pull any punches and unlike most movies it stays true to itself right through to the end credits.  Many movies for box-office success will sugar-coat their endings at the expense of the story.  That is not the case here.  Here, they go the whole nine yards and it pays off in every way. Pitt and Freeman are great opposite one another.  While Pitt is youthful and energetic, throwing caution to the wind, Freeman is experienced, calculated and thoughtful with each move.  They have a strong screen chemistry that only heightens the payoff in the final scene. Gwyneth Paltrow, while not carrying a lot of screen time, rings true in each scene she appears in.  She is not only beautiful, but has a presence that is very strong opposite greats like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Se7en has set a new standard for movie thrillers.  It is not filled with camera tricks or long chase scenes down dark alleys (although there is one. It relies upon an intelligent story and fantastic performances.  It is a classic for fans of this genre for all-time."

","I've just finished watching Se7en for the first time since its cinema release, and I'm pleased to advise you seekers of truth that every 'serial killer' film produced before or since still cannot match it. I won't repeat the many superlatives that have been deservedly heaped on the film by other reviewers above/below; suffice it to say that its bleak nature, unremitting gloom and taut storytelling go to make up a sublime mix of madness and sanity. Here we have director Fincher's most satisfying work to date (and yes, that includes FIGHT CLUB!), in the form of a cinematic 'pound of flesh', cooked medium-rare, and served on an almost-stainless silver platter.<br/><br/>Boasting killer performances (pun intended) from all, the subject of 'theme killings' (not put to such effective use since the OTT Vincent Price 1970s classics THE ABOMINABLE DR PHIBES and THEATRE OF BLOOD) adds a finite touch to the numerous deaths involved, and lends the story a 'mythic' strength that it might not otherwise possess. By revealing only the aftermaths of the various murders in a similar fashion to that utilised in HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, Fincher stealthily avoids the 'exploitation' tag that could so easily have resulted from the presentation of such a subject. BONE COLLECTOR, COPYCAT, Freeman's subsequent KISS THE GIRLS - lower your candles in awe, gentlemen.<br/><br/>See it, for the love of Mike. You may love it or loathe it, but you won't be able to forget it.<br/><br/>As a footnote, the 2-disc special edition DVD is the one to watch, with its four separate commentaries (total viewing time - together with the film as is - ten hours!) and a whole host of extras. However, the Se7en completist may also like to hunt down the SE laserdisc boxed set. The format may be associated with the words 'elephant' and 'white' these days, yet not only are the LD's extras almost entirely different from those on the DVD, but they also feature a couple of contributions from spfx guru Rob Bottin, who is mysteriously absent from the DVD version."

"mathany2k","Null","0","0","4 September 2001"," superb!!!
","Alright,I want to make something clear here...this is a movie which probably showcases the sickest and most gruesome deaths ever! And I loved it. David Fincher has a way of pulling the audience in,making them think...if you're looking for a movie to relax your mind and just be entertained,then don't watch this movie. But if,like me...you are planning to watch something intelligent,something which will make you ponder and think about,something different...this movie is what you're looking for.<br/><br/>The basic plot of this movie is that there is a serial killer on the loose. He is a mastermind,carefully planning his murders for years and executing them perfectly...he does his murders according to the 7 deadly sins which are--gluttony,greed,lust,sloth,pride,envy and wrath. He feels that the world is messed up and he thinks that by committing these murders,he will be preaching to the people. 2 detectives are on the case,Det. Somerset and Det. Mills. Somerset is about to retire,but this case holds him back. He has had years of experience and is thoughtful of every case he handles.Mills is a newly posted detective and is very impatient when it comes to identifying clues and analyzing problems. To tell you more would be grave injustice...you have to watch it to understand more and form opinions of your own.<br/><br/>The acting is done superbly by the 2 leads,Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. Freeman plays Det. Somerset flawlessly and seems born to do the role. The ever-knowing Freeman is truly a character to be praised. Pitt is also fantastic,fitting perfectly in the role of Det. Mills. His acting is just the way you would expect a young detective to be. Pitt is fast gaining my respect as a high caliber actor. Although he has made stupid decisions before (Legends Of The Fall and Meet Joe Black), it's roles like this and Tyler Durden (Fight Club) that he truly shines. I really hope to see him more in movies of the same class. With these 2 brilliant actors helming the movie,how could it go wrong. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Mills' wife in the movie, a sweet,kind hearted soul just looking for a quiet and nice home with a loving family. The killer,who is uncredited...and I will leave it at that, also gives a superb performance.<br/><br/>The directing is really something to appreciate. Fincher creates the same bleak and dark atmosphere throughout the movie. It never stops raining and people get killed,mugged and raped at every corner of the street. It is really hard to believe,that Fincher was directing music videos once...his transition seems to be flawless. I have watched every movie of his and found each of them intriguing (except Alien 3). The storyline is amazing and it is just haunting to see the details of each murder potrayed so realistically in the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, you will realize something.A message should hit you. If it doesn't...then obviously,you didn't understand the movie. Watch this movie! You won't regret it."

","Okay, I'm sick of this whole, ""style over substance"" thing that everybody is talking about. What are you trying to imply, that the film was made without a script - that they made it up as they went along... It seems critics don't take the time to decide why they hate films anymore, it's a lot easier to say ""style over substance"", film is a visual medium for heavens sake. No other director has take the amount of flack for this than David Fincher, he's every critics whipping boy - and why, because he began his career making music videos, because he made Alien 3 and it failed to live up to ""lord"" Cameron's Aliens (1986)... It's just plain laziness - for god's sake take the time to analyse the film before you write it off as a failure.<br/><br/>Now onto the film. Se7en is basically the buddy cop movie, except the cops in question aren't really buddies... It's also a serial killer movie, but it has the guts to break every rule about serial killer movies you thought you knew. I love the questions this film raises, and if you're one of the people who I was addressing at the start of this review you'll probably be scratching you're heads - but yes, this film has a powerful message.<br/><br/>Se7en deals with society, it deals with something that we see everyday but most of us turn our backs to it. You only have to open a news paper and you'll see a list of terrible atrocities that have befallen people, horrendous things happening everyday, and we just turn our backs, in the words of John Doe (Kevin Spacey - and yes I got my I.D. from his character) ""we see a sin on every street corner, and we tolerate it, we tolerate it because it's common""... Every word delivered by Doe is of importance, it should sound clich√É¬©d but Spacey's delivery is so great that it becomes truthful, he say's later on, after describing why he chose to kill who he killed (Only in a world this sh*ty, can you say these people are innocent and keep a straight face""... This is all serious stuff, and I think one of the reasons people dismiss the film is because these are issues that they are not ready to face. <br/><br/>As everyone knows and comments on, is that Fincher is one of the most visually talented directors working today, and despite what people have said the gloomy low-key lighting and constant rain work brilliantly, creating an atmosphere, I must also point out Fincher's use of sound design, he and the sound engineer Ren Klyce evoke a sense of urban detachment whenever they can, the scenes with Summerset (Morgan Freeman) in his apartment, the violent domestic arguments audible in the other rooms. All of this is not Fincher trying to say, ""Hey look how clever I am"" but to draw the audience in. He needs those shadows to create suspense, to distract the eye of the viewer to something else, to lure them into relaxation.<br/><br/>
Yet still so many people have a problem with this film, they overlook the fact that it is a gripping detective thriller, or that the characters are 100% believable... There too concerned with what they call the sadistic gruesomeness that Fincher revels in. Well excuse me, but I though this was an adult film, this could have been a whole lot more violent, the murders are implied, you see only the after effects... If you have a problem with having to imagine things in films, then stop going to see R rated movies, stick to the family films.<br/><br/>There's so much more I want to say about this film, I don't think it gets the credit it deserves... And to all those people who have called it depressing - yes it is and so it should be, the world is not all sugar sprinkles and candy canes... And thank you to Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker for giving us something a little darker, for as Summerset states at the end of the film... ""Ernest Hemmingway once wrote, the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for - I agree with the second half""...<br/><br/>A Modern Masterpiece 10/10"

","Se7en entered British cinemas and I'm not entirely sure we were prepared for such an intelligent and demanding movie.  Spacey, Pitt and Freeman turn in some of the best performances imaginable for this type of movie and I could not believe that they were so ill-rewarded for their acting efforts.  A film that stretches the brain (literate film viewers whooped with joy to see such references hauled into public awareness) whilst recognising that most might not get all the clues (cue Cliffs Notes folks), well it makes a change from cheap devil-worshipping mythologies.<br/><br/>Walker created a screenplay sizzling with wit and intrigue.  You see almost nothing of the SEVEN that stalk the plot (though I swear a minor edit has occurred on the video version at the end regarding Tracey).  And the cinematography (of which much was made in the press regarding silver prints to highlight the darkness) has to be some of the most imaginative ever providing for a thriller drama of this kind.<br/><br/>I still find little intriguing details to attend to whenever I watch this movie - like others in my fav raves catalogue (Memento, The Usual Suspects, Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club) it demands something from the viewer's intellect and attention that some felt might have bypassed the ""Star Wars"" generation of special effects kids.  Wrong - I'm of that generation too, and trust me, there is still room for the literate thriller to pull the punters."
"moviegod37","Null","0","0","26 July 2001"," Serial Killer movie done right!
","It is a rare studio film (at least in 1995, when Seven was released) that has the cojones to be this dark, sinister, and depressing.  Yet, despite the dark tones and cynical view of the world, the film is totally mesmerizing. Great performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  Also, a completely chilling, albeit brief, portrayal of the killer by a now-famous uncredited actor.<br/><br/>My only gripe about the film is that it is a bit overstylized by Fincher. Honestly, it can't be dark and rainy 24 hours a day. But, for the most part, the style benefits the film.  Still, you may find yourself wishing someone in the film would flip on a light switch every now and then.<br/><br/>The way the movie builds up is nervewracking.  In the beginning, you find out that a killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his M.O.  You learn what these sins are, and then you begin to wonder what will happen next.  How will the next person be killed?  With each graphic and disturbing death, there is a greater sense of horror and disbelief.  The murders sound outlandish, but the realism of the film keeps each killing resting uncomfortably in the back of your mind. Also, unlike most Hollywood thrillers, you never actually see the murders happen, but see enough images that you can imagine each brutal scene. I think that adds to the dramatic value of the crime scenes. It is definately worth noting that this film is not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Seven, the ending absolutely blew me away.  Some may argue that it is predictable, but I think Fincher merely gives enough information to make you suspect that the ending may occur.  He then builds up the tension until you are dying to have your suspicions confirmed.  The first time I watched it, I truly couldn't believe what I had just seen. Almost like I wanted to believe it didn't happen.  It is as powerful and memorable of an ending as I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Many imitators have tried to use a similar formula, but then put in some cheap, Hollywood ending that ruins the film (ie, The Bone Collector).  If you want to see a serial killer movie done right, watch Seven."

Morgan freeman also gave a strong performance as the ""wise old owl"" cop so to say. gwyneth paltrow also had a strong preformance in the limited screen time. kevin spacey was the key to this film. very seldom does spacey not speak a line that is well thought out and has meaning to it. he makes you feel his character. the question through the movie is whether John doe, the killer, is insane or if he's a normal guy like you and me. at one point david mills (Brad Pitt) asks John doe, "" do you wake up in the morning and say, wow its amazing how f***in crazy i really am"" to which Doe answers, ""it makes you feel comfortable to label me as crazy, doesnt it"" and mills replies with a simple, "" yes very comfortable"". i thought this was a brillant scene as you makes you think that maybe this killer isnt insane, maybe he just wants to prove a point. he could be as normal as you and me but he believes in something so strongly that he's willing to kill and be killed for others to ""see"" it. i also thought this movie had ties to 8 millimeter. in 8 millimeter the killer or killers were normal people, they killed because they liked it and because they could. i think is kind of the same thing in seven. although John doe proclaims he's a ""chosen one"" and he does not want to kill, he proclaims he is not insane, no one molested him as a child, no one abused him. overall this is just a brillant film. the mood set in this film is perfect. almost every scene involves rain which leaves a dark, depressing mood which is perfect for the plot. the murders are detailed and well thought out. i would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror and others who want to see a true bred classic."

","***Spoilers Included **** I'm not ordinarily a horror fan, nor a crime drama fan.  This movie is a little bit of both, and in some ways, neither.  The crime drama portion is pretty straight forward--serial killer with seven deadly sins as a theme (when exactly is Hollywood going to give up the religios nutbag as murderer scenario?  Utterly stale).  The horror is a little more nuanced--the murders really are progressively more disgusting and disturbing, and really indicate not just a human gone insane, but rather a human turned into a monster. That's why Spacey's character is so pivotal, not just that he's the murderer--but the way he plays it.  He's polite, conventional, intelligent, even a touch feminine (epicene I think is the word).  <br/><br/>A famous historian once pondered the ""banality of evil."" The movie is in some ways about that--how this seemingly ordinary person has gone off the deep end, and in some ways, how he reflects an overall society which is doing the same thing. <br/><br/>The movie itself is very stylized--with colors and scenes carefully chosen to reflect the story, as in the model (pride) murder scene.  Nothing but whites everywhere, splotched with vivid red blood.  The characters are in some way the same: Morgan Freeman has an interesting take on Somerset, he's almost like a darkly fatigued Felix Unger, compulsive and neat, almost a reaction against the dark unnamed city around him, where it rains constantly--we don't really see the sun in the movie, not until the very end.  <br/><br/>Pitt is pretty decent as a dim but ambitious young police officer--you can tell he's not very bright, but begins to get the hang of things toward the end.  <br/><br/>Worthwhile, but some of the praise heaped on the movie is a little misplaced.  This isn't as good as Silence of the Lambs, much better than the wretched Bone Collector and Hannibal.  So all in all, if you dig serial killer movies, this is a decent addition to the list."

He is personally one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>If you don't believe me I think you should sit down and watch several of his films, especially this one. I could never picture Freddie Prinze Jr. or anybody else ever daring to take on this kind of role. That is why I refuse to sit down and watch those sort of films. I do not like to waste my money.<br/><br/>The plot is very basic. Morgan Freeman is a week from retirement. Brad Pitt is the new guy in town. They both team up to catch a serial killer who kills people by the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>You can always count on Morgan Freeman to be brilliant. I have yet to see him in a project he looks bad in. But I must say, since this film he seems to be only taking the smart-detective role, accept for ""Nurse Betty"".<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is wonderful in his role. He portrays a man who is dedicated to both his family and his work. Though he isn't anywhere near as smart as Somerset, he certainly trys. In a funny scene, Somerset travels to the library to read up on the sins. Mills mearly settles for the cliff notes of the sins.<br/><br/>A must see for all fans of the film is the newly released DVD.

Andrew Kevin Walker takes what seems to be on the surface an unoriginal concept and makes it his own, producing one of the most original screenplays of the 90's. David Fincher does a find job as the director of Seven. His direction compliments the gritty screenplay nicely. Howard Shore gives us a great subtle and ominous musical score. Darius Khondji's cinematography also pays respect to the script by making the images on screen very dark. If Seven has any faults it's in the performances and pacing. Even these faults are minor. Brad Pitt is pretty good as the cocky detective, David Mills, but he could be more dramatic in some of his more emotional scenes. Morgan Freemen is good but I feel that he underplays his character, William Somerset, a bit too much sometimes. Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film as the psychopath, John Doe. He speaks his lines with cold brutality. He is riveting to watch. Seven's pacing is good for the most part; one or two scenes tend to drag on a bit too long, however.

(You know, Gluttony, Envy, Brad Pitt's performance in this, making movies like this, and the other three.)<br/><br/>One sin that some members of the audience might be guilty of after this is Sloth, since the thing goes on forever. The film treats its own silliness with the greatest respect for its own seriousness, and there is an amount of eye-catching visual stylisation along these lines of which the only connection to the emotional body of the film is via a long, long extension. Piddling around with lenses, you could call it.<br/><br/>Plotted along the lines of an old Batman TV episode (the serial crimes of the Joker, Penguin or Egghead were no more or less plausible, or inventive, or humorous for that matter), the writing is kind of reminiscent of Life Savers candy, except those are nothing without holes, and this is nothing with holes.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance, striving for some sort of bizarre yuppie cool in a heroic struggle with the writers' apparent intention for the character, is possibly the most unlikely homicide detective in screen history. To be fair, Pitt's been a lot better in other movies. To be accurate, so has just about everybody else.<br/><br/>Stupid, modish, cynical picture. I believe the same director did ""Fight Club"". That's a much better movie, although the screaming plot holes and comic book dementia of the ending of that film bear a family resemblance to this one."

","This movie immediately made it into my top five and has remained there now for six years...soon to be se7en.  Sorry...couldn't resist. ;^)<br/><br/>The cast is a dream.  Morgan Freeman's negative-but-wise Detective William Somerset is the perfect counterpoint to Brad Pitt's brash, hopeful Detective David Mills.  Gwyneth Paltrow, although under-used, makes an impact as Tracy Mills, David's charming, beautiful wife.  and Kevin Spacey as John Doe is the most memorable.  The intelligent, quiet serial-killer has almost become a cliche lately, but Spacey's performance is menacing without ever having to appear as such.  He just plain creeped me out.<br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is perfect.  Detective work is a very slow, tedious process.  Fincher's direction effectively portrays it as such.  The show has a few fast and furious moments, but for the most part it moves at a snail's pace, which is appropriate given the subject matter.  And the tension just builds and builds...something many movies try for but few achieve.<br/><br/>The screenplay is also wonderful.  Conversations seem real, not forced as in most movies.  In Se7en, the dialogue (and the acting) made me feel as though I was looking in on the lives of the characters rather than having those characters play out a story for me.<br/><br/>I, unlike a few people here, thought the ending was perfect.  Those who disagree with me, think about it in the context of the real world.  Maybe you didn't get to see what you thought *should* have happened, but you have to admit that you saw what most likely *would* have happened.<br/><br/>Also, let me rebut comments which deride this film as being unnecessarily violent or a gore-fest.  There were only two scenes of on-screen violence in the entire movie.  One involves a gunshot on a long lens, and the other involves a close-up but barely discernable blow with a tire iron.  While we see plenty of blood and guts in other scenes, we do not see the acts of violence in the majority of them.<br/><br/>Se7en is a perfect 10 in my books."
"mrjoojoobean","Null","0","0","26 March 2001"," a great contemporary thriller
","This will be brief and informal. *LOTS OF SPOILERS*<br/><br/>great film-actually coordinates everything around the dark genre that encompasses the plot.  The music, the mood, even the scenery, works toward the scary thriller scenario.  That is one of the reasons why it is so well received.  Another reason being some relatively good acting, good writing, some depth to the characters, and people you might be able to relate with. I don't criticize Pitt's character because i've actually met guys like his character, and he plays a fine rendition of the personality type.  One might argue that there wasn't enough depth.  Well how much can you fit in a two hour movie without destroying something important?  Not much, and I think the amount which was added was just about right to preserve everything it needed to be a successful film.<br/><br/>Critics: -ending was weak-but who would have enjoyed seeing gweneth's dismembered head?  Certainly not I, and certainly not most people.  The ending was smart, and unconventional.  What else could you have asked for?  John Doe turning into a big red demon and blowing up Los Angeles?  It was good. -Those who say the plot was a no brainer, I wanna know if you have really examined the entire thing.  If so, and you know what this film is about without any questions, and can still say it was a no brainer, I wanna know where you get your information at?  Seriously.  If you can figure out se7en and think its totally stupid, there must be some really smart thrillers out there that have something better? Silence of the Lambs, which was damn good, probably was less of a brainer than this one.<br/><br/>I also want to note that-this film has a certain specialness to those who actually saw it in the theatre in 1995.  It was a breakthrough film for Spacey along with the Usual Suspects.  To see him on screen when he shows up at the police station all bloody; he put on a phenominal performance for a guy who wasn't a ""big name.""  And I think it shows.  The big money guys like Stallone and Swartennegger got replaced by lesser costing actors who ultimately bring the studio more money through fine acting skills and awards rather than bulky figure.<br/><br/>ok..that wasn't too brief...but so what?"

","Se7en is simply a great movie. It provides a unique motive for a<br/><br/>serial killer: to kill violators of the seven deadly sins.  Is a person<br/><br/>justified in killing if doing it for the greater cause of society?  Or<br/><br/>is it merely a veneer used to excuse morbid pleasures? Se7en discusses<br/><br/>this moral question.  Besides the plot, he characters are not bad<br/><br/>either.  Brad Pitt plays a defiant, rookie-like cop who partners with<br/><br/>the wise, veteran Morgan Freeman.  Brad Pitt of course acts to the best<br/><br/>of his ability.  It's too bad that he has achieved the taboo status of<br/><br/>being a heart-throb.  Morgan Freeman though is respected for his great<br/><br/>roles in the past.   The greatest part of the story ,though, is the ending which isn't<br/><br/>exactly a surprise but still is great how it ties the story together. <br/><br/>  Another good attribute of the movie are the sets.  They fulfill their<br/><br/>task of being depressing, dark, and just something that you'd see on a<br/><br/>rainy, dismal day in the city.  Even the scenes in the large sunny<br/><br/>fields seem to be oddly depressing and dismal.   Watch a great film: Se7en."

","Well for starters, if you haven't seen Seven, get to the local store and rent it.  Personally, it made my top 5 movies #1.  However my taste leans directly on this Neo-Gothicism that has been winning over people for about the last 20 years by using the dark-realism of Gothic architecture, acting, lighting,speech, all combined with this new sense of Evil that has been felt by nations seemingly since the 80's, when we supposedly sold our souls . Other selections much like 'The Crow','The Silence of the Lambs' , 'Dark City' and even to an extent 'the Devil's Advocate' remove the viewer from their safe-seats, and sits them on the rained-gritty street corner where a whispered conversation is taking place.  It removes that false sense of security that watching years of 'Happy Days' can give you.  For me, Seven was deeply philosophic (obviously), and I probably don't go a day without some reference to it.  However, the reason it digs so deep into us, is that it is absolutely possible.  Your average nutcase could copycat this movie, and claim insanity at the trial.  Enjoy!"

","SEVEN is a movie that won't leave you with that ""happy feeling"" after viewing but it will affect you emotionally in some way. You won't feel as though you've seen ""Sound of Music"" but movies with underlying themes are becoming a rare beast in most Hollywood schlock nowadays. Below may contain *Spoilers* so be forewarned.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly lighted and photographed evoking a noir-like feeling in the nameless, perpetually rain-soaked city it takes place in. The  murder scenes are truly sickening and as dark as the crimes that are portrayed but does the movie clearly evoke it's main underlying theme (civilization's increasing apathy causing our decay) or does the viewer lose it's meaning in the movie's superb visualization?<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the gore factor which in reality is somewhat under-stated in the film. No one is killed in a on-camera closeup and all but one of the killings are showed as an aftermath, the victim viewed briefly on screen and then revisited via Black and White 8x10's that fill aproximently a tenth of the frame. Many films show much more graphic violence although Seven alludes to a much more insidious deed and the viewer comes away with the feeling that they witnessed them in a much more graphic way than what was shown. All great horror movies do this as our imaginations are much more frightening than the actual image. It is also what makes well written horror novels much more frightening than the run-of-the-mill slasher movie.<br/><br/>The fact that most people remember the movie as being extremely gory says a lot about it's effective presentation which may also lend itself to being written off as just a gore-fest. If the viewer sees the film as strictly a blood bath of shocks it actually lends itself to viewer apathy since the film can be easily dismissed as a bloody serial killer flick in much the same way Pitt's character dismisses John Doe as ""just"" a lunatic. The viewer ends up waiting for the next shock instead of looking deeper.<br/><br/>I don't know if Fincher actually meant for this to occur or if it just happened as circumstance but it is interesting to see how apathy builds in ourselves esp. when it comes to repeated scenes of violence.<br/><br/>Freedman's character is used effectively in bringing the viewer back (as well as Pitt's character)to see the ""big picture"" so we don't get lost in just the gore. In fact he is the stabilizing force in the movie. It is also interesting to note that Freedman's character himself is the one fighting apathy and in the end loses out to it.<br/><br/>All in all a very good movie that at it's least gives some great and groundbreaking visualizes and manages to put some meaning in as well. Very few films by Hollywood of late have been able to do one thing effectively and Fincher has done both well although understated themes are probably lost on 95% of the viewing public which is why we are getting so many romantic comedies and beat em up flicks instead of intelligent films open to commentary and interpretation.<br/><br/>Also the newest release of Seven on DVD is superb and make sure you buy it over the earlier flipper release."

","SE7EN is quite an extroardinary film.  Unlike most films, which make everything sound so nice, this film bludgeons you with depressing images. The film is a ripe slice of hell, and is one film that you'll remember.  If you think you were pretty cool during the gruesome scenes, you'll probably have nightmares later.  David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker(wasn't he an assasin?  On no, that was Mark David Chapman) craft the film very well.  Every scene is framed well, and there is a feeling of bleakness. This film goes against the ""it's not what you think, it's what you're wearing"" complacent culture to show the ""eminent death"" culture.  Think about it, won't you?  Gwyneth Paltrow is talented, and cute too.  Brad Pitt is dumber than a bag of hammers, and Morgan Freeman is a noble savage. Kevin Spacey gave me the jim-jams something awful!

"ShinKyo81","10","0","0","2 March 2001"," David Fincher's best film & Best Thriller film
","Six years after seeing the film, ""Se7en"" is considered, in my opinion, the best creation of one brilliant director: David Fincher. Starting his career with George Lucas in ""The Return of the Jedi"" as camera assistant, now he's one of the most acclaimed film directors in the world.<br/><br/>His first worldwide known production was ""Alien3"", a sequel of the famous alien saga, the worst of all the saga, however. Then, in 1995, ""Se7en"" was out, and became a total success.<br/><br/>The film is a creepy, thriller production with a crew full of stars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Palthrow and the awesome 72nd Academy Award Winner Kevin Spacey (as leading role in AMERICAN BEAUTY). And the film was also an innovation in using weird and strange openings. This style was followed by several films like ""Mimic"", ""Arlington Road"", ""Spawn"", ""Fight Club"", etc.<br/><br/>Focusing on the film, ""Se7en"" introduces us Detectives David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) that are investigating several crimes which at first glance with no connection between them. After a deep search, they will find that only one man is behind all the murderers and with a philosophy: the seven capital sins.<br/><br/>With this plot, the film seems to be as other productions of the genre, but it's not. There are several points of ""Se7en"" that should be mentioned:<br/><br/><ul><li>Brilliant atmosphere, one of the most weird and strange sets and places never seen in a film. The fat man's apartment is incredibly created. There are lots of details, like in the sloth victim's house, with hundreds of that fraganced pine trees (you know, that things for the cars) hanging from the ceiling to cover the smell of the body.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Excellent performance of the acting crew: every character is well performed by its respective actor/actress. Special mention to Brad Pitt.</li></ul><br/><br/>
The following films of Fincher (""The Game"", ""Fight Club"", etc.) carry on the style created in ""Se7en"". I must say that all the thrillers produced after ""Se7en"" are just a rough copy of Fincher's masterpiece: they have just copied the atmosphere of the film but with no success. ""Se7en"" is the best one nowadays, no matter the budget, no matter the crew.<br/><br/>
David Fincher makes the difference. ""Se7en"" is an example, a brilliant masterpiece. WORTH LOOK!!!!!!! 10/10<br/><br/>One thing that I still think about is: why didn't ""Se7en"" win any Academy Awards Oscar in 1995? I found it unfair and still think so."

","The story of a murderer committing his crimes to preach to the world is a great idea for a movie, and it was carried out very well.  The story of a retiring cop teamed with his new replacement is a story that has been recycled over and over.  But it was done extremely well in Seven.  This movie is full of suspense.

"SanderStrijbos","10","0","0","5 February 2001"," Perfect!
","My friends think I'm insane, but I rate this one higher than Silence of the Lambs (the movie Se7en is most compared with). It's much darker and has a lot more atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, Silence...  was a fantastic movie, but Se7en is in my opinion the best serial killer film ever!<br/><br/>Everybody has seen the cliche of a retiring officer who's working in a rookie a thousand times (and more) and that's probably the only flaw this masterpiece has. It's a dark (and rainy!) look at the seven deadly sins which have become just another piece of our lives and there are no innocent souls on this planet left (according to John Doe). Everybody is guilty!<br/><br/>
The movie takes you with one surprise after another to the ending. The ending is the best part of the film (I've seen enough films to know this is does not happen often), when the detectives and their killer find the two other victims.<br/><br/>Special nods towards the cinematography (which is excellent) and the producers decision to not show the name of the actor playing the 'bad guy' in the opening credits.<br/><br/>This film is a must see for everybody who wants to see...

","I must admit that when this film came out, I totally ignored it, probably because I was only 9 nears old and I didn't care much for movies when back then.  Now, after reading several reviews, I finally decided to take a chance with it.<br/><br/>The story is set from what I understand is supposed to be New York City.  It is always dark and it is always raining.  Detective William Somerset(Morgan Freeman) is an elderly, burned out homicide detective who is about to retire.  Detective David Mills(Brad Pitt) is the brash, young detective who is set to replace Somerset at the end of the week.  But before Somerset can retire, he must tackle one last important case.  The two detectives arrive at the house of a obese man who was found with his face in a bowl of spaghetti. The second victim they find, a defense attorney, was forced to cut off a pound of his flesh. As further investigation into the murders continues, they soon learn that they were the first and second in a series of ritualistic killings in which the victims will be killed in accordance with the Seven Deadly Sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Wrath and Envy. I won't go any further than that.  <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey, of American Beauty fame, plays John Doe with perfection.  I didn't even know who he was until I saw this film.  His role as John Doe is probably one of the creepiest I have ever seen.  Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play their roles to perfection also.  Seven's ending really surprised me because it was very unexpected and there were no clues to hint it. <br/><br/>
I also like this film because it was directed by David Fincher.  I liked because he succeeds in always creating dark and suspenseful atmospheres in his films like Alien 3, Fight Club, and The Game.<br/><br/>Now I'm a very big fan of serial killer films.  I've seen most of the major ones The Silence of the Lambs, The Bone Collector, and this film. <br/><br/>**Spoilers**  There is one something that I want to make very clear. Resurrection, another serial killer film starring Christopher Lambert is not a Seven rip-off.  Although the two films do share the same qualities, they are two totally different films.<br/><br/>Now that is cleared up Seven a very chilling film and has a terrifying ending.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie's title sequence alone has changed the film and television mediums forever. Even if you aren't a film buff, you will immediately recognize this after seeing this beautifully creepy, acid-washed and frantic collage of images. Fincher's stylistic use of framing, lighting, and choice of cinematographer creates a mood that sinks like a brick to the pit of your stomach.<br/><br/>If I were to choose a genre movie that could definetley top Johnathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"", this would be the one.  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwenyth Paltrow are dead-on portraying each of their characters; respectively: a detective who has requested a transfer to the non-specific city's seedier side, a veteran detective who is set to retire in seven days, and a wife who is entirely reluctant about moving to this inner-city.  The events which unfold, wrap these characters into a series of situations where no viewer will guess the horrifying ending until it is fully set in motion.<br/><br/>Spacey alone deserves a separate paragraph.  If you thought Hannibal was devious and witty (and he is), check out Mr. Spacey as John Doe.  His subtle portrayal is in contrast to Mr. Hopkin's over-the-top, almost campy Hannibal Lector.  Kevin Spacey sets the ""creep-factor"" to 10 in his vision of a truly sadistic serial killer.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, even if you aren't a noir or horror fan.  See this movie, because there are a myriad of reasons to appreciate what Fincher has created.  If you think you won't get into the story because this, at first glance, appears to be a glorified horror movie, you will be cheating yourself out an incredible film experience."

As one of the major themes of the story and the primary motivation of John Doe's killings is the apathy of modern society -that no one cares about anyone else- I wondered if David Fincher was trying to trick us into feeling the same way?<br/><br/>Was I deliberately not supposed to feel for the characters, in order to have some 'feeling' (albeit through a strange agent) shocked into me at the end?

","I have seen my fair share of serial killer movies.  And of the ones I've seen, none of them hold a candle to The Silence of the Lambs.... Except Seven (or Se7en). We all know that Lambs is the greatest of all killer movies, and nothing can top it, ever.  But Seven is most defiantly worthy of a second spot.  I love the plot, the acting (who doesn't love Morgan Freeman?), and not to mention David Fincher's great directing.  I'm not a big fan of Brad Pitt, but he's better in this movie than most movies I've seen him in.<br/><br/>While this movie really isn't for the faint at heart, it is in no way a gory movie.  Fincher avoids many grotesque images by showing the facial reactions of the actors looking at the serial killer's work.<br/><br/>And the acting, oh the acting.  (SPOILING STARTING!) Keven Spacey is soooo creepy as John Doe.  Not Hannibal creepy, but creepy none the less.  Morgan Freeman shines above them all, being the great man that he is.  Many famous actors are in this movie with little parts.  Richard Roundtree (yes, Shaft) is in this, but only for a second or two.  Gwyneth Paltrow is in this movie, but I can't stand her.  She is such a little bitch (excuse my language, but she is).  I almost laughed at the very end (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talkin about).  But despite the fact I don't like her, she does a good job in his movie.<br/><br/>The thing I love about the plot is it is so untraditional. Most serial killer movies have the killer turn out to be a best friend of the good guy or even a fellow detective.  Not this movie.  Also, I love the realism. Like I said before, this is no Silence of the Lambs, not even in the realism department.  But it's still sooo good anyway.<br/><br/>Some people might not like this movie and consider it to be a traditional Hollywood Scream movie, but give it a chance.  This is a great find."

"stamper","8","0","0","27 August 2000"," 7 deadly sins
","This is one of the best thrillers I've seen and I've seen quite a few. You might say I'm an actual serial killer freak. This one sure is one of the best, it ranks right up there with other thrillers like Scream, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project, Copycat, Arlington Road and Fight Club (if you miss Silence of the Lambs, well I can't remember that film so good so I just left it out). The only film that is actually relevant here, because of the serial killer content is of course Copycat. I wouldn't say these two films are even (considering quality), hell no Se7en is better, but hey I must mention Copycat here, because that film featuring Sigourney Weaver was released in 1995 also and I feel it has been neglected or maybe just overlooked by some due to the big success Se7en was. If you like Se7en you'll like Copycat, because it is about a killer, who well copy's famous serial killers.<br/><br/>
Now finally on to the film in question. I feel like there is nothing much to be said about this film that already someone said or has written on this page. Still I must comment on it. For one thing I must do so, because this film features some of the best actors there are today and it also is original. First the actors, we have of course heart throb Brad Pitt as you might call him, well I call him one of the best actors of our time. He has done some really good films and by that I don't mean his older ones like Legends of the Fall or A River runs through it, no I mean this one, Fight Club (very good, very underrated) and maybe Thelma & Louise. In this film he delivers a good performance nothing too fancy but good. Especially in the ending I must say, for that part was his hardest. Good acting but not Oscar stuff. Then of course there is Morgan Freeman (see The Shawshank Redemption, Kiss the Girls and Outbreak), who is good too, as most of the time, when there is a job to be done he does it. And now for the best one yet, Kevin Spacey (whose best films are Outbreak, The Usual Suspects, A Time to Kill, The Negotiator, American Beauty and maybe The Ref), who is not that much on ¬ñ screen but if he is, damn. What a great actor. You might not think this when watching the film the first time except maybe at the very end. But if you watch the film a second time and have remembered the ending (you are probably asking yourselves if can you forget it, well I've done so once but now I've seen it three times and I'll never forget I think) you have to listen closely to the conversation in the car. The way Spacey talks and what he says, it makes so much more ¬ësense' when you know the ending. He is just so confident and already teasing men who don't think he is superior when he knows he is, for he has all the aces right up his sleeve. This brings me right up to the originality of this film actually. It is not only that the films story is very original, because never have I seen somebody kill people in connection with the 7 deadly sins. It is also original in the way they are carried out and that is what makes this film really special. The killings are not only brutal, but they are well prepared, so we are dealing with a genius of a madman, something that becomes very clear at the end and not until then, maybe. I think that you actually have to like this movie you must like it unless maybe it is too gory for you. If it isn't you'll like it, trust me.<br/><br/>

","MIGHT INCLUDE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Se7en is one of the scariest and greatest films of all time. Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances. Se7en is worth seeing. The writer, Andrew Kevin Walker should get more credit for an amazing story line. It actually made me remember the seven deadly sins - Greed, Gluttony, Wrath, Pride, Lust, Envy, and sloth. David Fincher - who is an amazing director and thumbs up for the Madonna music videos helps a great cast and creates a noir type world that keeps you wondering.<br/><br/>What's in the box at the end? I'm glad Fincher did not show you the real terror that was in there. Pitt and Freeman are policemen that become involved with a psychopaths mad killings. As the story goes - you see people die because of the deadly sins they have followed.

","I have seen many movies in my lifetime and I know for a fact it's very hard to make a good dark thriller. I'm a movie freak and I love studying films, so I believe I know what I'm talking about when I say Seven is extremely well done. David Fincher is the director and does a brilliant job. Everything clicks here, the chemistry between the lead actors is amazing and every scene is worked so well that when you watch this you almost forget this is a movie and it's not real. Seven is as real as a movie can get, I'll tell you that. Very few dark thrillers have captured me like this one except maybe The Exorcist and Psycho. I have read some of the earlier comments about Seven here and I'm sure those who didn't like it either didn't watch it or got so scared while watching they began hating this film. I know my sister saw it and she was so scared watching it she didn't even wanna hear this films name!. So if u don't wanna see a disturbing dark thriller then don't see Seven!!!. Seven is very dark and raw and it's not for sensitive souls. But if u do wanna see a tough thriller and a good movie too then this is the one without a doubt!!!. The direction is super, the acting is outstanding and the climax is electrifying. I give this movie four stars out of four."

","David Fincher lends his directing skills to help make Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay into one of the greatest serial killer movies ever made.  This movie has everything.  A cast of easily likeable characters.  A demented but creative nemesis.  A dreary setting.  Witty dialogue.  An original plot. One of the best endings in cinema history.  The film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's characters, William Somerset and David Mills, who are both police detectives.  Somerset is desperate to leave his job and Mills is excited to get in.  They make a great team when it comes to finding an elusive serial killer who preys on people using the seven deadly sins as his preaching tools.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a terrific performance as Mill's wife Tracy.  A superb acting job is done by the killer.  I won't mention the actor's name in case you haven't seen the movie yet.  This isn't one of those movies that you can guess the next scene before it comes.  ""Seven"" is packed with surprises.  This is a good movie for anyone with a strong stomach that enjoys fine acting and a great storyline.  I recommend watching ""Seven"" at night with no interruptions.  I wouldn't recommend eating during the film."

","First, I have to say that I agree with a lot of what's being said here about this film, so I won't repeat them, but maybe add a bit to what was said. If you haven't seen the movie yet, when I say spoiler, just skip to the next paragraph.<br/><br/>While I agree that this film was well made, I think it's a bit of an exaggeration, Abominabledrphibes (and others), to say that it's among the best ever made, and precisely because of one of the points you made, that some parts were just too graphic, but also because of what I see as some flaws in the plot.<br/><br/>For me, the explicitly graphic shots was what took the film down a notch from ""Suspense"" towards mere ""Horror"".  While they did leave some of the murders to our imaginations, I felt they could have left a little more to our imaginations in general.  For me, this is what makes ""Se7en"" not quite as good as Hitchcock's best work.  (Then again, didn't Hitchcock say that he would have liked to put more explicit things in his films?  I'll have to re-read ""Hitchcock"" by Truffant.)<br/><br/>The version shown in Europe is a few minutes longer, so maybe the US version has the worst bits cut out and would be more to my taste.  (I'd like to know what they cut out!)  If there's a TV version, I'd probably recommend that over the full uncut version.<br/><br/>There were also a few other aspects that felt like typical Hollywood manipulative filmmaking that for me made ""Se7en"" less than ""the perfect film"".  One scene that comes to mind is when both of the detectives are at home and going to sleep -- maybe the characters did feel a sense of foreboding, but the soundtrack at that point was just too strong, using music that would probably fit better when the characters are about to discover something gruesome.<br/><br/>I guess this is a general complaint that I have about Hollywood, relying too much on just the music to tell you how to feel or interpret a scene.  But I have to give some credit here, that they didn't rely on this technique nearly as much in ""Se7en"" as in other (weaker) films.  For the most part, I thought the soundtrack supported the plot and mood, and there were only a few places where it seemed manipulative.<br/><br/>I have to praise the way they did the ending, where neither explicitly gruesome shots nor heavy soundtrack got in the way.  I think, though, that by the end, I was already numbed so much that it didn't quite have such an impact when things got ""personal.""  (possible spoiler!!!!)  Sorry, I didn't think the package at the end was much of a surprise, but the seventh murder -- that was a great twist!<br/><br/>On the topic of soundtrack, I should also say that I found the music selections really great, the Bach piece included, though mostly I mean the heavy punk stuff.  I think the IMDB info needs to be completed here. Amazon.com says the soundtrack includes Gravity Kills and Haircut 100 as well as some jazz pieces.  (Yes, I read the guidelines, I'll make an appropriate ""update"" comment.)<br/><br/>I agree that other detective films are going to have to be compared to ""Se7en"".  It sets a standard that other films will fail to live up to. While this wasn't a film about excellent detective work, just good, dedicated detectives doing good work (I thought it was a little more realistic that they found their man somewhat on accident -- in the real world things often happen that way), I thought the character development (and casting) put this film in a class above ones like ""Silence of the Lambs.""  It belongs on the very short list of excellent modern ""film noir.""<br/><br/>Casting, everything excellent: Freeman is a solid foundation, Pitt adds some bang, and Spacey wraps it all up.<br/><br/>Direction -- wow.  I was lucky enough to see ""Se7en"" in a double feature with Fight Club.  David Fincher goes on my list of directors I will excitedly wait to see more from, though I won't be taking many friends because of the strong stomach he seems to require from viewers.<br/><br/>Character development -- except for the Pitt's character's wife, as mentioned before, I thought the they filled out the personalities pretty well.<br/><br/>Story --  I have to disagree with a few of the negative reviews here, I think seven deaths for the seven sins is rather creative, and the seventh murder, well, if that wasn't creative...  I just hope no crazy out there gets the same idea.  As for the plot, I thought there were a couple of holes (or maybe just unanswered questions) maybe I just didn't catch some of the dialog (send me a private message if you can answer these) (spoiler???) What really happened to the Freeman's character's ""wife"" and kid?  (spoiler!!!) Did she get killed by someone he was investigating, too?  And (big spoiler!!!) Fincher didn't give me any reason to believe that Pitt's character would be convicted by any jury, though he would loose his badge.<br/><br/>I know that most of what I'm writing here is nit-picking.  I thought this film was excellent, so I'm only pointing out flaws in what could have been a perfect film.  So, on with the nit-picking:<br/><br/>Some of you guys wrote that ""Se7en"" is a realistic depiction of the sometimes gruesome world we live in.  Sorry, I don't think it was perfectly realistic.  Yes, our society is really screwed up many ways, especially when it comes to murder and violence and for the most part, this one pulls it off, showing us this with great style.  (lots of spoilers!!!) But, like in Fight Club, where the murderer manipulates the cops into doing his bidding, I thought the killer here was also just a bit too all-powerful, all-knowing. If the detectives caught him off guard at his apartment, why was the place conveniently wiped of fingerprints?  How did he know that Pitt's character would be the one to keep guard over him in the end and that Freeman would be the one to run to the van?  How did he manage to show up at the police station just at the time the detectives arrived there, and do we really believe that a guy with bloody hands and shirt would go unnoticed by a station full of cops until he called attention to himself?  Or the biggest problem to me -- just arranging for the detectives and package to all work out the way it did (and pulling off a quick little murder in between) sorry, I didn't think that was realistic.  Not just the odds of the ending being timed right, but that this excruciatingly methodical, patient killer would be so cavalier about risking the completion of his perfect seven deaths.  And this last point is probably just being silly, but in real life, it doesn't rain hard all the time (even in Seattle), some rooms are actually well-lit and there certainly isn't scary music playing in the background when I think about how evil the world is.<br/><br/>One quick question here, I didn't catch it: (MAJOR spoiler!!!) which of the seven sins was Spacey's character supposed to be guilty of?  (And why isn't murder one of the seven sins?!)<br/><br/>OK, time to wrap things up.  (I'm sure I'm close to the 1000 word limit!) Despite all of the things I said above, I did like this movie, and give it a very high rating: 3 1/2 stars out of 4!"
"DeeNine-2","9","0","0","2 July 2000"," The preeminent serial killer movie
","We plummet the depths of depravity here. Arrogance never got such a cinematic comeuppance (not to mention gluttony, pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins), nor was innocence ever made such an alien as in this masterpiece of monstrous intent. Morgan Freeman stars as William Somerset, a wise and modest big city homicide detective ready to retire who finds himself partnered with David Mills, an arrogant young detective effortlessly depicted by Brad Pitt. As they try to find the killer there develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an engrossing movie. Kevin Spacey arrives after a bit as 'John Doe,' a 20th century version of a medieval scribe obsessed with sin morphed into a monster from hell. He sees himself as the personal judge, executioner and torturer extraordinaire of a vengeful god gone amuck.<br/><br/>Momma, lock the doors and bar the windows. Don't let this video into your home. You'll watch it, every last minute, and your kids will watch it, several times, their eyes between their fingers, and the end result will be a cynicism about humanity so deep that it'll take the blood of the lamb to wash it clean.<br/><br/>Well, that, or the realization that this is just Hollywood up to its old tricks. After all it's only a movie-or is there something more to this extraordinary commercialization of evil? One of the penetrating things about Seven is the implication that, through the Christian concept of sin and by our very nature, we ourselves create the serial killer and give him a justification to turn upon us and do his wretched deeds. The ending slyly suggests the triumph of evil; and indeed this cagey movie would be depressing beyond redemption were it not for the three things: One, the modest wisdom projected by Morgan Freeman; two, the essential innocence of Brad Pitt's character; and three, the fact that the horrible deeds are the work of only one man. Whether he is just an insane 'nut-bag' as Pitt's character exclaims, or part of our nature as the film implies, is an interesting question.<br/><br/>Serial killer film makers of the future will try to top this one, but I doubt if it will happen any time soon. This is already a classic. Incidentally, I do wonder about these guys (Walker and Fincher) who lie awake nights dreaming up this stuff. I hope they're only doing it for the money.<br/><br/>By the way, perfect font for the credits.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","After the unfortunate debacle with Alien3 (they couldn't even get the title right since a lot of viewers thought it was Alien Cubed..but never mind!), David Fincher fights back with a superbly crafted murder/mystery which goes beyond the norm (and others would add, the pail) for police crime movies.<br/><br/>Not a particularly complex story - all we have is a typical Mr Average Man who has finally had enough of present day society's steep decline into...well, as the title almost suggests....the Seven Deadly Sins.<br/><br/>His grisly murders represent each Sin and only a soon-to-be-retired police detective who ""...can't get involved..."" (skillfully played by Morgan Freeman) and his young upstart sidekick (Brad Pitt) manage to unravel the case, but at huge personal cost to both.<br/><br/>Its difficult to know where to start when praising such a brilliant film. But to begin with some of Fincher's old Alien3 directing habits are carried into this film. Most of the story is set in miserable, dank, wet and gloomy places - but this isn't a complaint but only adds to the foreboding that awaits us. You feel as if you're swimming in a pool of slime trying to keep afloat as Fincher moves from one scene to another, never letting the viewer, or indeed the main characters time to take a breath.<br/><br/>Fortunately Fincher doesn't go over the top showing us every murder in explicit detail. He knows we are intelligent enough to work out in our own fetid imaginations what the camera doesn't allow us to see. But having said that, the corpses that we do see would make even Dirty Harry choke!<br/><br/>Editing & lighting also go hand in hand with the cinematography, so too does the splatter-punk music score that surrounds the start & finish of the film. In fact its like a conspiracy against the audience - all the unit directors of the film crew (art, sound,2nd unit, editing, score etc) have ganged up with Fincher to give the viewer a real hard time - a feeling of truly being out there with Freeman & Pitt.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is, as always, a pleasure to watch. He seems to have hit all the right moves these last few years, especially in the underrated Shawshank Redemption. His character is very slow, methodical, patient...all those things his partner, Brad Pitt, lacks so glaringly,<br/><br/>Pitt is perfect for the young brash detective. The two cops remind me of reading a book - Freeman plays the cop page by page by page never wanting to cut a corner or skip a detail; while Pitt plays his character chapter by chapter, ever moving forward, not having the patience to look at the minute details on each page...and boy does he get the Early Morning Wakeup Call at the end of the film!!!!<br/><br/>But to my mind, Kevin Spacey, who plays Jon Doe, is the real king player here. Critically acclaimed in The Usual Suspects, LA Confidential & Glengarry Glen Ross), Spacey pulls off yet another masterclass act here.<br/><br/>He is not a madman or psychopath (as Brad Pitt feels he is) even though his crimes would make you think otherwise. Instead he is just a well-educated citizen who has simply had enough of seeing society fall apart outside his front door, and the police & the courts are seen as being impotent to do anything about it.<br/><br/>Spacey knows what Fincher wants from his character and plays it with relish; similar to John Malkovich's Mitch Leary character in Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire.<br/><br/>This isn't a glamour film that will make you glow & smile when you leave the theatre. This film wants to crush you with the sordid reality of what is actually happening to us all out there - a film that tells it as it is, and not as Hollywood wants us to view the world from their glittering perspective.<br/><br/>Se7en is a film where other detective films should be judged. It's unforgiving & relentless but a visual masterpiece for all that...and as for the ending....well.....<br/><br/>*****/*****"

Se7en has been criticised for being too morbid, gross and dark. Which it is - and it should be, it deals with serial killing, for Pete's sake!<br/><br/>What happens at the end of Silence of the Lambs? The killer utters a snappy one-liner (""I'm having an old friend for dinner"") and the audience kill themselves laughing... Yeah, right, we have just witnessed humanity at its cruelest and most debased and we laugh. We certainly don't think. You won't laugh after seeing Se7en - and you shouldn't. You WILL be depressed - and you should be. You WILL question society's morality (or lack thereof) - and you should. Most of all, you will recognise your own apathy.<br/><br/>Se7en is the first and only (fictional)serial killer movie that treats its subject with the respect it deserves. And by subject I'm not referring to the killer (John Doe), but the devastation he leaves in his wake and society's complicity. Yes, it is not only in terms of the seven deadly sins that this is relevant, but also in the eighth - APATHY, which is society's sin. And John Doe is its physical manifestation.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>Apathy is what allowed John Doe to commit his atrocious crimes in the first place. A man is tortured for a year and no-one misses him, his landlord doesn't give a hoot because his rent is paid on time. John Doe goes in and out of offices and apartments he's not supposed to be in, but no-one cares. The police sell information without a second thought to the possible consequences. Everyone brings packages and suitcases into a whore house, so who cares what the contents might be used for. And that is why these things happen in real life, why women are taught to yell ""FIRE!"" and not ""HELP!"" when they are being attacked. Because everybody turns a blind eye.<br/><br/>To quote John Doe (regretfully!!): ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer"". And that is exactly what Se7en does. We can't afford to ignore its message.<br/><br/>This is not a movie to be enjoyed, rather it has to be experienced.

Quite the opposite.<br/><br/>In a tale where a retiring police detective (Freeman) takes one last case along with his replacement (Pitt), only to find that their investigation leads them down through a very First Testament eye-for-an-eye lesson in the seven deadly sins, you cannot expect a merry romp down the yellow brick road.<br/><br/>As the victims have all been felled by such vices as gluttony, vanity, sloth, sex and such, Freeman and Pitt slowly realize that they are dealing not only with a sicko but one who means to follow his lesson on to the bitter end.<br/><br/>And that's it.

As Freeman so lucidly observes, ""This isn't going to have a happy ending."" - well, how could it?<br/><br/>Freeman is, of course, a sound center to the film and without him as a grounding wire, the whole film would have suffered through its grunge and blood and rainy days and nights.  Much has been said of Pitt's ineffectual stance in his role, but I think that's the whole point: he's the common man who just sees this killer as another wacko to lock up.  His eventual transformation is almost un-noticeable as he turns from a deadened, I've-seen-it-all type into someone who can't quite believe that such debased evil actually exists until.. well, that would be telling; suffice it to say that it's gradual and sudden all at once - and makes perfect sense, in context.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife about as well as can be expected under the circumstances.  R. Lee Ermey plays a more sedate version of the drill sergeant he made so vivid in ""Full Metal Jacket"".  And as for John Doe... it's a credit to his performance that he makes himself so eerily believable as someone who believes this is the only way to make people listen to what he has to say.  And, in some sick way, he may be right.<br/><br/>But the people aren't the stars here, and neither is Fincher's dark, foreboding direction - it's the story and where it leads to, it's the talks you'll have afterwards about what happens at the end, it's about sin and death and what really has to be done to make some people aware of what sin is around them and how dead we've all become towards it.  Maybe ""Se7en"" is more about how we react to the eventual lesson taught and how it's presented than the actors, the gore and the literary quotes.<br/><br/>If you can stomach the gore and your heart can take some pretty wrenching scenes, this may be a movie for you to watch, think about and, possibly, learn from.  I watched it and, myself, learned a pretty important lesson. Of course, every movie teaches its own different lesson to different people. See ""Se7en"" yourself and draw your own conclusion.<br/><br/>Eight stars for ""Se7en"".  Powerful: yes.  Disturbing: definitely. Unforgettable: absolutely."

","Every time I heard about Se7en, I heard about the shocking ending. Finally, I rented it, not wanting to find out about the ending somewhere else. (Which, I found out when it came, I already knew from an MTV Movie Award spoof [damn them]). But I must say, I was still shocked and terrified.<br/><br/>
Detective Somerset (Freeman) is nearing the end of his career as a detective when he is assigned to the case of some gruesome murders, with rookie detective Mills (Pitt). As Somerset and Mills continue a helpless investigation, it becomes evident that the murders are based on the Seven Deadly Sins, and the two detectives must fight to stop this killer before he strikes again..and again...and again.<br/><br/>A ruthless, bleak movie. I was numb by the end of it. For the most part, towards the beginning, the only thing that distinguished this from any other detectives-after-a-serial-killer movie (which there are far too many of) was how gruesome the murders were, and the fact that the primary female character, in this film Mill's wife Tracy (Paltrow), wasn't sent to stay with her mother halfway into the film. The murders themselves were quite disgusting, one guy being fed spaghetti until he died (which can either be sort of silly, or just downright disgusting) and one woman whose face was cut off, and then, while still alive, given the option of calling the police and living with a disfigurement, or overdosing on sleeping pills and putting herself out of her misery. All of this is implied after the fact, but it's still just as terrifying, and just as revolting. The acting is all quite impressive, especially from Morgan Freeman, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, who played the killer. Brad Pitt was alright; I didn't expect much from him, other than long spouts of profanity, which he allowed to the audience countless times. As for the climax...it was as shocking as reputated. I can't give anything away, but it was extremely well-written, especially in the final outcome, and also extremely tragic, and tragic only for how much the audience wouldn't have wanted the truth of the climax to be so. But those were some of the most tense scenes, leading up to the delivery. I could barely sit still. And after the movie ends, you're only left to think and be shocked.<br/><br/>I do recommend this, but only for those who can handle such a bleak, tragic, brutal movie. If anything, it's one to be seen to be believed."

","Se7en is definitely one of the absolute best films I have ever seen.  The whole atmosphere is as dark and scarey as the actual killings and action.  Morgan Freeman gives yet another excellent dramatic role who is sick of city crime but is unknowingly getting pulled into another game of violence.  This is Kevin Spacey's best role as an actor for sure, he plays the part, and fits the characters needs perfectly.  The only thing you can do to him in the movie is hate him to your fullest extent.

","This is without doubt one of the most stylish, yet simply frightening films to be made in a long time. Major credit for this film must be given to David Fincher, this film owes its success as much to his style and direction as it does anything else. This film has it all: a very good cast, great style, a good plot with some great twists, and a good dose of gore for flavour. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well cast as the leads, Freeman delivering yet another polished performance as the battle hardened mentor, and Pitt showing promise as the brash young detective. Undoubtedly a highlight for me was the chilling performance of Kevin Spacey, showing his immense talent in a brilliant cameo as John Doe, a villain on par with Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. A certain Ms Paltrow gives a solid performance as Pitt's beautiful young wife, but Spacey set the tone. The dark tones of most scenes are perfect in setting the mood of the film, and are used well by Fincher. A very good plot and screenplay, coupled with an original idea, combine with the cast and style to create a most unforgettable movie, and one of the most intense cinematic experiences in recent memory. 8 out of 10."

Despite the fact that the film critiques apathy it chooses the done to death subject of serial murder. Yawn. Even the excitingly shot chase in the middle rips off Blade Runner. It's all lazy stuff with some philosophical disclaimer tagged on at the end to make us think we've witnessed art rather than the bottom line of making a fast buck. It's meritricious crap. But what about Pitt's ridiculous performance, eh? There's no coherence at all, just some constant and bizarre jerking of the head all the time. The scene where he's chewing the fat with freeman about commitment is particularly gem. Keep still man, do you think if you keep trying to evade the camera we won't notice its you? What's sad is films like these have influenced television drama producers into doing dozens of carbon copy series in the UK. Stuff that used to be banned as video nasties now find pride of place in peak slots.

","It was in Alien3, that director David Fincher first made his mark: while the script may have been flawed, the acting mundane(save the ever-reliable Weaver) and the plot muddled, the film stayed afloat thanks to the fact that it simply oozed dark style.  With Se7en, however, Fincher gets an opportunity to stamp his visual flair on a more-than-competent script, and a jaw-dropping cast(Freeman, Pitt, Spacey et al), and, predictably, an utterly compelling film results.<br/><br/>For a serial-killer film, Se7en has surprisingly little on-screen blood letting.  However the depiction of a nightmarish city and ample forensic detail, together with taut acting and tense direction, means that it is at times an almost unbearably grim suspenser.  Pitt delivers his lines with twitching intensity, but is far more restrained than in his manic performance in 12 Monkeys.  Freeman is marvellously understated as a detective looking forward to retirement who is drawn into the grisly case which Pitt initially undertakes.  Best of all, though, is Spacey, who > has a mammoth screen presence, albeit only being present on-screen for a relatively short period.<br/><br/>Overall Se7en is a relentlessly downbeat yet mightily impressive film. Not since The Silence of the Lambs has there been a psychological thriller with such an oppressive atmosphere and soaring energy as this.  But while Lambs swept the Oscars in 1991(the only truly contemporary film to win the Best Picture award during the 90s) the Academy only managed to nominate Se7en for one Oscar(that for editing, which is admittedly superb).  While Se7en is not quite as masterful as Lambs, it ought to have won at least a few more nominations(how Freeman was left out of the Best Actor category, one would never know).<br/><br/>The only reservation I'd have about Se7en is than Fincher at times tends to overdo the depressing plot developments.  Certainly, the viewer can find little refuge or comfort in the ending, which means that the easily upset may want to steer clear; instead they might want to catch The Game, which has all of Fincher's visual flair and intensity, minus the downbeat tone. Otherwise Se7en comes highly recommended.<br/><br/>9/10."
"bhicks56","10","0","0","7 December 1999"," Fincher's first descend into greatness
","David Fincher's last three movies have been so individually great and unique, they all speak for their own in different categories. What he does here is take a smart, clever, and grisly script by Andrew Kevin Walker, pull down the shades and throw Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in a cinematic game that will stand with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as the greatest thriller of the 90s.  <br/><br/>Set in a city that is almost always gray and wet with rain, this movie does have a depressing feel, but watching this film over and over again, I always feel a bit giddy, as I know that Freeman's Det. Somerset isn't going to retire so easily and that Pitt's rookie Det. Mills is going to get one heck of a first case. They are great together from the start. Neither one has much of a sense of humor, but it's funny how odd of a couple they are. Somerset is patient, intelligent, and raises his voice as much as he reveals a smile. Mills look like a young lion as he jumps into enthusiasm when he works, caring more about action than about research. <br/><br/>The thing (and flaw) about Fincher movies is that there is hardly any women characters in them. Gwyneth Paltrow is very weak in her role as Mills' wife. She is only used for the climax in which the film is going. But the movie is such a distraction from that minor detail, it almost doesn't matter. The best sequence, hands down, is when Mills chases John Doe in his apartment, out of the window, into another building, onto a ledge, and into the murky streets of the nameless city.<br/><br/>One very smart move the movie has is not only revealing the character a good half hour before the movie is over, but giving him a speaking part which portrays him miles high over the usual cliched killers in cliched thrillers. You'll find very new things to watch in this movie, like other Fincher masterpieces THE GAME and FIGHT CLUB.<br/><br/>If the kids in SCREAM wanted more creative psycho killers, they got one, with murders like methodical and detailed puzzle pieces all coming to a wicked conclusion that puts everything in a bad game of jeopardy."

","This film is perhaps one of the most intriguing, thought-provoking movies in a long while.  The style by which David Fincher presents this movie is perhaps comparable to the late Alfred Hitchcock, an achievement not easily gained. Morgan Freeman delivers a stellar performance as a police officer on the brink of retirement only to be pulled back into the life he is trying to escape by a psychopathic maniac. Brad Pitt brings to the screen the mentality of a rookie cop dead-set on solving the case that just happened to fall in his lap.  Pitt somewhat lacks in experience compared to Freeman and it is evident in the movie, but hats off to his attempt to keep on the same playing field as Freeman. I believe that David Fincher wanted the identity of the murderer to remain concealed, otherwise this person would have been listed in the opening credits and on the movie poster, so I will end on that note. This movie is well worth $20 to own, let alone worth a few hour of your time.  A must see."

","It seems to be the trend now to equate this movie to Silence of the Lambs, but to me, this movie far surpasses that one. Not to say that Silence of the Lambs wasn't good, it was actually one of the best of its kind, and Hannibal Lecter might be the best serial killer ever. However, Seven blows that movie away and if not for The Usual Suspects, it would be the best detective-thriller of the 90's.<br/><br/>There are so many aspects to this movie worth mentioning, I couldn't fit it into 1000 words. Yes, this movie may be considered too slow for the action junkies of the world. Sorry, Arnie and Sly Stallone do not make an appearance here. But for those who place a higher importance on acting, directing, and storyline, this is the movie for you. Fincher deserves top mention. This guy continues to amaze me with top notch films. Never saw Alien3, as I don't like horror movies and don't care about the Alien trilogy. But The Game is a very underrated thriller, you can't go wrong with Sean Penn and Michael Douglas.  And as far as Fight Club goes, well, words cannot express how good that movie was, so I won't even try. But with those 2 movies alone, as well as this one, Fincher proves he is one of the best up and coming directors in the business.<br/><br/>We all know Brad Pitt is usually placed in movies merely for eye candy for the female audience, but obviously Fincher has a knack for bringing the best out of Pitt. He's really not a terrible actor, and he was actually pretty good in 12 Monkeys, but it is here and Fight Club where he does his best work. He's no Morgan Freeman, and he is certainly eclipsed here by Freeman, but Pitt manages to hold his own effectively. Paltrow is, well, Paltrow here, pretty boring and monotone, just like most parts she plays. But she is as important to the story as any of the others, and based on that she fits in well.<br/><br/>As good as everyone was in this movie, Kevin Spacey dominates the screen, as he does with every movie he has ever been in. He is far and away the best actor going today, and his role in Seven may be his best so far. Giving away any details of his part would take away from the effect of the movie, but let's just say it is chilling how good he is. Every scene is important, and the scenery and music help develop the mood of the story, which is definitely grim. Not sure why so many people have revolted at the ""gore and violence"" of this movie, as most of it is implied and never really shown. People don't seem to have a problem reading about it in the newspapers, in books, or even the Bible, but I guess it's different when it's presented in your face on the big screen. Doesn't make sense to me, but whatever. If you can look past that, you're looking at one of the top 10 movies of the 90's, and one of the best ever. 10/10, 100/100, 1000/1000, an all-time classic."

David Fincher with this one and ""The Game"",I would dare to say, is on footprints of some of the Hitchcock's best movies, and it would be very interesting to see what is next."

This film has all the ingredients of a thought provoking, highly entertaining film and the tried and tested old cop/young cop plot is given a complete and refreshing overhaul.<br/><br/>The menacing idea behind the film is second to the none and the addition of great performances by Freeman (on top form as the old cop) and Pitt (proving he can act) only add to the overall quality.<br/><br/>Includes one of the most memorable scenes in film this decade where John Doe utters the words, ""Detective. Detective. DETECTIVE""!<br/><br/>Prepare yourself though, for the ending that ultimately leaves a very long lasting impression on you.

I didn't see Seven in the theater when it originally came out because I thought it would be too gory and creepy, but am I glad I decided to see it.  This is a superbly crafted psychological drama/thriller with great acting by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two detectives on the trail of a serial killer caught up in religious fervor who happens to be extremely intelligent.  The killer chooses his victims based on the ""seven deadly sins"" (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath) and can only be described as extremely creative in the ways he kills and tortures his victims.  I was afraid the movie might be too gory for me, but I managed to stay in my seat, only covering my eyes a couple of times.

This film is absolutely brilliant, and it's difficult to think of a single misstep.<br/><br/>But it's not a film to enjoy; I think there's only one even vaguely upbeat scene in the film, there mostly to provide the necessary contrast with the awesome finale. The rest of the time it portrays the police inhabiting a city where it continually rains, where anyone could be indescribably evil, and where it takes the exceptionally twisted acts of the serial killer to shock the police.<br/><br/>Plaudits should go to everyone involved, with praise being heaped on Freeman, Pitt and Spacey. But the loudest applause should be reserved for the writer and director, Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher, for turning out such a masterpiece.

","Se7en is simply a masterpiece--one of the most disturbing movies ever made. Profound, intelligent, visceral, compelling, and masterful describe this chilling look at the mind and methods of a literate, brilliant and articulate serial killer.  Persons who like shallow, escapist entertainment with lots of explosions will probably not like Se7en, which deals with very deep and disturbing issues, and actually requires the viewer to THINK, unlike most movies today.  The film is not perfect, as no film is ever perfect, but the few minor flaws (there are no major ones, in my opinion) are far, far outweighed by the things this movie does right.  The acting by Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow and the unbilled killer is uniformly top-notch; the dark, gothic quality of much of the movie compliments the subject matter quite well; the music is haunting and spare; the gore and implied violence are never gratuitous, but merely to serve as important and visceral indications of the mindset of the killer, who chooses his victims and murders them according to the Seven Deadly Sins of literature: Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Envy, Pride, Greed, and Wrath.  The climax is a gut-wrenching finish to one of the most compelling movies ever made. I suspect that many people who do not *like* this movie and criticize various aspects of it are more disturbed by it than they would admit--it is not for everyone. One of the best films of the 90s, and superior to Silence of the Lambs."

","The establishing unit of Se7en suggest a standard entry into the cop genre. Summerset (Freeman) is tired of being a cop and of what he sees on the streets everyday. To top it off he has just been partnered with the new detective, and his replacement, Mills(Pitt), a know-it-all anxious to see some action. He even requires a metronome to fall asleep. Once the credit sequence starts, though, this movie is lifted much higher.<br/><br/>     When they arrive at the first murder scene it appears that a morbidly obese man has eaten himself to death. Upon closer examination at an autopsy it is discovers that the man was forced at gunpoint and therefore murdered. Immediately there is a struggle for power between the two, Summerset telling the younger Mills that he is inexperienced and that it is to soon for him to be working a major murder case, thought at this point only by Summerset that it is the beginning of something more. He doesn't want it either but is stuck with it anyway.<br/><br/>     Mills is instead handed the case of a murdered defense attorney.  He gets there to find a pool of blood on the office carpet with the word ""Greed"" written with the same blood. Meanwhile, Summerset finds the word ""Gluttony"" written in grease behind the obese mans refrigerator. Thus begins the chase to find the man killing with the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>    The movie is dark. Very dark. If it weren't for DVD, Se7en would look like a giant black blur on home video. This is a very bold move on the part of David Fincher and Cinematographer Darius Khondji. Se7en needs to look this dark as it greatly improves the power of the visuals. The acting is superb, which brings be to the best parts of the film, the dialog scenes between Summerset and Mills. They give this movie a great sense of gusto with there quiet character moments. The time in between the murders, therefore, isn't wasted, making for a much more fulfilling experience.<br/><br/>     Se7en is a great film with a climax that will stay in you head for days, and characters that you remember long after the shock is over."

Great writing, directing, cinematography, special effects, and acting highlight this film and make it one of the 10 best movies in the 90's. The seven brutal murders are either under filmed or filmed in dark unlit places so as to leave the viewer's imagination running in overdrive. Each murder is brutal enough to jolt you and make you not forget it. My personal favorit are lust, and sloth. The man tied to the bed and tortured for a year is sick and twisted as anything I've ever seen. The special effects of this and the gluttony murder are perfect. The writing is flawless in assembling this perfect crime with a purpose. The screenplay makes sure to be as descriptive in the details of each death so as to further the viewer's imagination as though reading a book instead of watching a movie. The creepy dark atmosphere of the movie can be credited to perfect directing. And great performances by the four central characters: Morgan Freeman (who is always great and gives any movie a certain nobility), Kevin Spacey who is perfect as the sick lunatic who's crimes go way beyond that of Keyser Soze, Brad Pitt (in his 2nd best role), and Gwyenth Paltrow who does a maximum job with her minimal screen time.

","What can I say?  I can see why this movie was recommended to me after I admitted that 'Silence of the Lambs' was one of my favorite movies. ""Seven"" features an interesting premise (an intelligent serial killer chooses his victims according to the seven deadly sins) and some pretty cool, very dark plot twists.  However, in my mind there is no comparison between ""Seven"" and ""Silence,"" and most of this judgment comes from the acting ability (or lack thereof) displayed.  Kevin Spacey is the only worthy actor in the bunch, and his performance is great.  Though I've seen Morgan Freeman in better roles -- he doesn't do much here.  Gwyneth was fine, but nothing special -- she was better in ""Shakespeare in Love.""  And finally, at the risk of being attacked, I would just like to say that Brad Pitt does not have much acting ability, and it is painfully obvious here.  His forced whining and yelling *almost* spoiled the last scene for me.  I say *almost* because I find the entire last part of the movie (the part with Kevin Spacey, incidentally) very well-written and worth seeing.  Spacey's character, ""John Doe,"" is extremely creepy and his lines are well-written and even funny at times. He is everyone's worst nightmare vision of a serial killer -- insane and dangerous, yet rational and calculating.  Spacey's voice is exactly right for the part -- it gave me chills.  Other than the last scene (the car, the desert), the movie is gruesome, often too dark, and badly acted.  The concept is a good one, however, and it is done justice.  Check out the way the ""pride"" victim is set up -- it's genius.  If you're a fan of Kevin Spacey, you won't be dissatisfied by the end of the movie.  He's basically why I saw it.  Caution, though : Brad needs SERIOUS acting lessons.  Or maybe he's had too many -- everything he does here seems forced"

","The ratings and commentary praising this disturbing piece of junk are mindboggling to those who have a mind and an ability to discern entertainment. Morgan Freeman is a great actor (What's he doing in this?)and Brad Pitt is a caricature of himself. The best one can say about this ""film"" is that it perfectly represents the self-indulgent nihilism of the Clinton years. It's easy to see why Kevin Spacey (John Doe #1) is/was such a big supporter. Garbage in, garbage out."

","It's rare when I can't find something to appreciate about a movie, but this is one of them. I loathe this film. It is horrifically violent and graphic. Truly disturbing, and I am not particularly squeamish. I like thrillers and the occasional horror flick, but this was over the top. I wish movies like this were never made - they can't be good for the public in general. If we keep ""advertising"" for extreme violence by making films like this, no one should be surprised when we get it. Exercising a little restraint and common sense for the good of society wouldn't hurt Hollywood, but they are much more interested in their profits than anything else."

This movie is one of the most overrated movies that I have ever seen in my whole life. Even if I am a big fan of detective movies, this is one movie that I will never watch again for the rest of my life. The dark and suspenseful environment was supposed to be thrilling and entertaining. I was so disappointed on how the movie flowed. It just never reeled me in. I was planning to give this movie a 5, but the atrocious and worst ending in the genre of detective movies showed up. So cheers for that great ending, you just received 2 more stars down.

"gurkpeter","3","3","8","28 August 2007"," Excellent craft work but not art
","Watching how the two detectives (a beginner and an experienced one) are pursuing a very intelligent serial killer is extremely well played and directed. Alone their interactions during the investigation is worth seeing the movie. The whole film is very much a male-type story except the character of the wife of the young detective. The appearance of the feminine character gives a human flavor to the work of the detectives transforming their male-like competition into elderly-young cooperation. Why I rate only 3 out of 10? Because the authors do not seem to understand the fundamental concept of the film, the 7 cardinal sins. The 7 cardinal sins are not actually sins themselves but are the source of other sins. Example: a married man seeing a pretty woman can feel desire to have her, but this is because men are biologically designed like this. If he acts to have the woman despite being married then he commits sins, but this sin is called adultery. So, in fact, there is one voluntary sinner in the film: the serial killer. The others - as the senior detective explains - just fail to work towards a balanced life, towards being able to love. The conclusion, that ""life is ugly but let's work to make it better"" is therefore flawed and makes the film a technically excellent work without the spirit that distinguishes craft work from true art."

","I can point to se7en as an indicator as to what is wrong with American Film today. It is ultimately the work of cynics who, despite possessing a remarkble skill for handling the technological wonders that make up film craft, have absolutely no respect or affection for the audience.Se7en celebrates the destructive power of evil in its purest form.  Although the film contains fantastic cinematography and expert performances from the cast (especially Freeman), I sincerely wonder at the motivations behind Fincher and the rest of the creators of this ugly, pretentious and abusive picture. It absolutely wallows in filth, grime and blood. To director Fincher's credit, he has probably come the closest to capturing Bosch on film. If they (the filmmakers) are out to expose the sinful nature of the human being well guess what, most of us already know that- Fincher has us at hello if that is his focus. Much has been written about the twist at the ending. I'm sorry, this ending shows no respect for the audience and their sensiblities what so ever. It makes the two hours one has spent watching this film utterly wasted. Because the most articulate character in the film is the hidden killer (played by an absolutly incredible actor), I wonder if the film makers see themselves as spiritual blood brothers with the pyschopath. The film is dark, unrelenting and completely devoid of any joy, hope or resurrection. Pessimistic films can be extremely effective note The Seven Samurai, The Sergio Leone films, Dr. Strangelove and others, but those films had senses of  humour and balance to their pessimism. Again, I ask the motivations of the makers of this film: If you want me to feel dirty, raped and corrupted by the ""real"" world, I already am, I don't need to raped in the ""reel"" world by cynical opportunists wanting to make a buck off of the audience's already jaded spirits."

As the killer, KEVIN SPACEY adopts a zombie-like pose, a flat monotone and recites his dialog with a straight face--but he's never quite believable enough in the role.<br/><br/>BRAD PITT spends much of the time protesting loudly against the authority figure who tries to calm him down when things get out of hand.

In other words, his masterpiece was for him to get shot out of anger. Kevin Spacey takes on the role of John Doe very well as a mysterious serial killer. He purposefully gets in the mind of the rookie homicide detective ( Brad Pitt). His plan at the end to receive a box with his wife's head in it is certainly very suspenseful, not knowing what would be in the box out in the desert.

"Leofwine_draca","8","2","5","13 March 2012"," It doesn't get much more influential than this...
","Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.<br/><br/>Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clich√É¬©d characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time."
"Kubris","10","2","5","11 June 2011"," One of the iconic films of the 90's
","IMDb Top 250: 27<br/><br/>Seven, David Fincher's first great film, is about two detectives in an unnamed city who hunt down a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his modus operandi. It's an original and clever take on the murder mystery. When those opening credits start to roll, with an awesome remix of Nine Inch Nail's 'Closer', the viewer begins to both dread what will come next, but also be unable to wait to see how it unfurls.<br/><br/>A very important part of Seven is its setting and atmosphere. The city, unnamed intentionally, is a savage, crime-riddled town that no one wants to live in. It sets the perfect landscape for such a bizarre killer. The direction is wonderful: constant rain, dark; this is a sad, dreary place, and no good can possibly come of it. It's one of Seven's greatest strengths.<br/><br/>Another great strength is the three major players. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the rookie and the veteran, and both are very convincing. Pitt, a five year veteran elsewhere, comes to the city intentionally with his girlfriend. We feel his unpreparedness, especially early on. He doesn't know what to expect from this dreary place; his reaction to the vomit and him waiting for Somerset outside the Gluttony murder, in the rain soaking with two coffees proves that. While some criticize Pitt's acting at the end, I think he aces it.<br/><br/>Freeman doesn't have as hard a job, he is the perfect smart and wise character. The last player is the killer, who I will keep a secret. From the killer's entrance to finish, you will be on edge as long as the character is on the screen. The lack of emotion is unsettling.<br/><br/>Visually, the film stands out: colours are seeped out of the picture, leaving darkness and rain: a great example is in the alley, with cameras facing up the guns barrel into the rain.<br/><br/>The last key to Seven's success is the plot. Full of action, suspense, and a few jumps, you will be engrossed by this story till its intense, shocking finale. Each of the killings are well-thought and shown in a gory, visceral matter, but not explicitly so. Sloth and Lust are absolutely atrocious in a good way, but I think Pride could have been fleshed out a little more. That could be the only suggestion I have about the film.<br/><br/>The less you know going into Seven, the better. One of the 90's best. 9.6/10"

I just viewed it again today, and although enjoying it I no longer get the 'kick' I once did. Once the ending is known, it definitely loses some of its power. See the ending more than a few times, and that loss starts to extend over the last 20 minutes of the film as well (starting from the time the killer turns himself in).<br/><br/>Something about the style of the film hasn't held up that wonderfully either, or maybe it's just been over-used at this point and feels tired. It could even be that I've gotten so jaded about ""stylish"" films that they're all starting to look a little bit pretentious.<br/><br/>I noticed there's a bit of recent backlash to all the ""10 star"" ratings and cult status of this film. Not unexpected, and maybe the reasons I've given above have something to do with it as well. As moviegoers, we've seen this kind of film a bit too often now, and it's lost some of its power to frighten or shock.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd still rate this movie highly, but I'm not so sure it's a masterpiece. A very good movie, yes. Worth watching, without a doubt (particularly if you enjoy this genre).

Kevin Spacey has the best part, but that's cause he's a nutbag. Pitt and Freeman are on the trail of a serial killer who keeps leaving clues in the style of the 7 deadly sins. It's an intruiging plot that has many odd and nasty characters and scenes that are worth watching.<br/><br/>Then comes the end. Brad Pitt's acting falls apart. I would swear that he had just gotten up and read the script 5 minutes before filming. I don't really want to say what happens because that kills the film and I'm not that kind of guy. Let's just say that Pitt walks into a situation that would make the strongest person fall apart. The emotion level should be beyond what humans would normally feel everday. It's horrible. And yet, he acts as if he already knows is like 'Oh man, that's bad. doughnut anyone?' It doesn't help that I figured out the end way before it came up, but I lost any thought of Pitt coming into his own as an actor. See the film, judge it for yourself."

","""Seven"" by David Fincher: a movie that attracted a lot of attention and made Fincher go down in history. His efforts devoted to this very original thriller were rewarded since it was one of the most successful movies made in 1995. ""Seven"" is probably one of the peaks of the film noir. It's based on a clever and especially devilish screenplay. This devilish side is particularly obvious by certain moments during the movie (notably the end): when Kevin Spacey (the killer) is leaving some clues at places where he committed his murders. He's leaving clues so that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt can pick up his trail but he's also mocking at police.<br/><br/>
Moreover, can we really consider the end as a happy-end. Freeman, once says: ""this isn't going to have a happy-end"". He's partly true. Spacey died but he managed to achieve his grim intention and he broke Pitt's life. When you look at his face in the last pictures, you might think he went mad...<br/><br/>The movie is also wrapped in a sordid, dreary even stifling atmosphere. The kinds of feelings you must feel by living such a story. Like ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcock, by moments, the movie is plunged into horror (the discovery of the murders).<br/><br/>At last, a dazzling performance comes to crown it all: a confident and a tiny bit conceited Brad Pitt teams up with a wistful and disillusioned Morgan Freeman.

But in every other department it stinks. The bottom line is a cliched script that manages to be both pretentious and ultimately meaningless at the same time. We are supposed to believe that a serial killer meticulously plans the murders of complete strangers to symbolize the seven deadly sins (why? Nobody knows. Because ""John Doe"" reads Dante is the closest we get to a motivation.) yet makes absolutely no effort to cover his tracks. The detectives on the case, one a veteran with one week to retire, the other a dim wit, who appear to have absolutely no idea about basic police procedure, still manage to capture said psychopathic genius via his library books! Because as we all know, anyone who reads 'The Divine Comedy', 'Helter Skelter' and 'Mein Kampf' MUST be a serial killer, right? To continue criticising the sheer stupidity and ludicrousness of the plot and the banality of the characters in this movie is just plain mean. The script is a mess, and no flashy lighting tricks will cover that up.  One of the most overrated movies of the decade by one of the most overrated directors currently working. 'Se7en' is a turkey, there's no other word for it."

He makes his job look easy, that's how you know he has talent.<br/><br/>Freeman on the other hand, was head long into his slide into mediocrity. His acting style is take it or leave it, forcing the other actors to come to him. Watch his scenes closely with R. Lee Ermey, the legendary Marine DI. Ermey forces Freeman to come to him!

"ronakkotian","10","1","2","4 October 2019"," Bleak, thrilling and crafted to perfection
","David Fincher's Se7en isn't just your ordinary detective investigating murders and trying to catch the killer film. It's much more than that. What makes this movie really stand out from the rest is the impeccible direction by Fincher and unpredicable nature of Andrew Kevin Walker's script.<br/><br/>Se7en is the story of two detectives who investigate murders committed by a serial killer who uses each of the Seven Deadly Sins to kill his victims.<br/><br/>After Alien 3, which Fincher doesn't consider as his film, Fincher creates a film that's jarring, disturbing and leaves a bad feeling in your stomach. His use of dark, ugly colours uplifts the depressing tone and the sound design makes Se7en feel as close as possible to reality. This film isn't one to forget easily. What sticks with you is the film's underlying message about the sadistic and violent nature of our world. How crime is rampant within each city. All of this is shown visually which makes me admire the way David Fincher helmed the movie.<br/><br/>I loved how far Se7en went in terms of its content. The aftermath of the murders are disgusting and give you the feeling of throwing up. The filmmakers didn't shy away from all the gore and this made me appreciate the film even more. In spite of the investigation taking up most of the film, there are some great character building moments as well. The scene taking place at a bar and the dinner scene strengthens the bond between our two leads and help us learn more about their personalities. These scenes made me genuinely care about Pitt and Freeman and that feeling made the ending seem even more shocking than what it originally was.<br/><br/>Aside from the aesthetics, the acting here is simply superb. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt create wonders together. Their acting seems really believable and elevates every scene they're in. The killer, I won't mention who, surprised me when he showed up and for the short amount of time he's in the film, he steals the show. His motivation is well realised and well though out which makes his character fleshed out and someone who'll make you think deeply regarding the cruel state of the world.<br/><br/>Se7en is a total winner and one of the best mystery thrillers to have ever been made. Everything is done to perfection and it wouldn't have been done without the direction, acting and screenplay. Se7en will get under your skin and stay there for a really long time."

","'What's in the box?' is probably one of the most devastating well-known movie quotes of all time. 'Se7en' was a groundbreaking thriller upon its release and a lot ahead of its time. Today's post-post-modernist, post-truth and, a post-whatever-cynical era we live now, 'Se7en' feels as fresh as the newest release. That says a lot about the masterpiece (and perhaps even more about the times we live in). A cruel, gritty and sadistically realistic serial killer movie that's message and motives are as meticulously crafted as the crimes depicted in the movie. David Fincher's visual style was perfect to bring such a disturbing story to life. You might not like it what you see on the screen, but you will not be left untouched by it. Appalling and disgusting, yet intelligent. The layered screenplay leaves the viewer in doubt about the morality of humans in general, and what is most frightening, doubt in their own morality. Because with our deepest and darkest thoughts we agree with everything that John Doe says in the end. And we really don't know who to despise - ourselves or, that monster. The two detectives on the case, young and enthusiastic Mills, and old stoic Somerset (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman respectively) form a perfect pair. Mills is cocky and, thus seems careless, Somerset is always calm and, thus seems not to care. They are both smart investigators and Somerset seems like mirror image older Mills.<br/><br/>I heard someone say about this film that, 'Se7en' is the 'Saw' for the thinking person. I would say that 'Se7en' is really messed up (although masterpiece) buddy-cop movie.<br/><br/>And how lucky was Kevin Spacey in 1995 - getting the chance to act out two of the some of the most infamous movie twists aff all-time in the same year."

","Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.<br/><br/>The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
"mitchellchristopherlong","8","1","2","7 November 2014"," 'Se7en' (1995) brings the horror down to earth
","Horror films often pertain to the supernatural, but what's even more frightening is realism. David Fincher's 1995 thriller ""Se7en"" provides a grounded tense race to catch a serial killer. Slow moving, gritty, and disturbingly plausible, it's a great break from the sequel-ridden franchises filled with villains who won't stay dead.<br/><br/>In an unusual pairing, seasoned Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) teams with newcomer Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt). The two are polar opposites: Somerset is near retirement, and hardened by his years on the force, whereas Mills brings an upbeat enthusiasm. The partners investigate a string of grisly murders, which they discover are based on the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, pride, wrath, envy, sloth, and lust.<br/><br/>Several elements complete the terrifying portrait ""Se7en"" paints. Visually, there are graphic murders, but moreover sadistic and methodical killings. During their investigation, Mills and Somerset reveal that the killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), has been planning his attacks for over a year. There's also the stark realism. Unlike pure evil entities like Michael Myers, Doe actually has justification for his crimes, albeit lunatic ravings, but he nonetheless attempts to rationalize his actions. Additionally, Doe doesn't strike in dreams, has no distinguishing traits, and is relatively average, except for the whole psycho killer thing.<br/><br/>Rounding out the haunting genius of Fincher's film is a disturbing, and completely unforeseen ending. No spoilers, but suffice it to say you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. ""Se7en"" scares through mimicking the profiles of actual serial killers, rather than relying on paranormal villains. There's a thought-provoking theme of manipulating religion to validate one's own actions and beliefs, a relevant and adaptable topic. A thrilling scramble, ""Se7en"" is an unconventional horror flick with the biggest blow arriving just before the screen fades to black.<br/><br/>-- Mitchell ""Moe"" Long http://www.examiner.com/movies-in-durham/mitchell- moe-long"

The duo investigate a particularly barbaric murder, in which a fat man was forced to eat to death. Soon they face equally unique murders involving death by blood loss from a cut of a pound of his own flesh, by shock after coming out of some kind of chemically induced bed that has kept him immobilized for one year.

A well-crafted movie, with a great combination of fierce plot, and dark theme. Morgan Freeman did a great job in a role of a mature cop. Brad Pitt seems more one-dimensional.

The movie remains focused throughout, drawing the attention of audiences, with the gradual unfolding of the events, creating a sense of mystery throughout, with a shocking ending. Kevin Spacey is outstanding in a small, but challenging role. David Fincher's brilliant directing will leave you shocked, you will be begging for more films like this.

How very on-Hollywood of them (the cast didn't want to go back if they changed the ending). ""What's in the box?"". And the fact you do not know why the killer hands himself over, till you get the picture for the final act. Kevin Spacey didn't want to be on the poster so no one would know he was John Doe.

Eventually it leads to one of the most climactic endings seen in a thriller film for years.<br/><br/>David Fincher's visuals, along with the performances of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman (whose characters are written by Andrew Walker), aid in the immersion of this gritty, yet strangely poetic film - an experience you won't forget."

"justlex1313","10","1","2","18 June 2014"," Is murder justified?
","The plot of this film revolves around the seven deadly sins and murder investigations over the period of seven days. The lead characters, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), follow clues and do research into the seven deadly sins to catch a killer named John Doe, (Kevin Spacey). <br/><br/>The theme of this film is how the seven deadly sins relate to the actions we choose and why we choose to take them. Many people would agree that murder is a sin but this film makes the viewer question if murder can be justified. Each victim in the movie is guilty of one of the seven deadly sins and each victim is murdered in such a way that it reflects the sin they are guilty of. The film can make the viewer consider that maybe the victims did deserve to die.<br/><br/>Each victim is guilty of one of the seven deadly sins; gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, lust, envy, and pride. Throughout the movie each murder scene tells a story as to what sin the victim is guilty of. Each murder scene also contains a clue that leads Mills and Somerset to the next murder scene. An interesting spin on the movie is that Mills seems to become one of the seven deadly sins himself, when he seeks revenge for his wife, Tracy's, (Gwyneth Paltrow) death. The viewer would typically have empathy for Mills decision and think his actions could be justified.<br/><br/>Lighting, camera angles, sound effects, and raw emotion are successfully employed throughout the film, setting the mood for the enthralling theme. The lighting in some of the murder scenes is low and signifies suffering and death. There is a scene in the beginning of the film that silhouettes a detective who was talking to Somerset. The detective makes the assumption that the victim was killed out of love by his wife. In this scene as he is walking away from Somerset the lighting causes his body to become a silhouette. This is showing the detective's naivety and lack of paying attention to detail.<br/><br/>There are several moments when the camera angle is low. One in particular is of Mills and Somerset standing in the rain, talking. This scene takes place shortly after Mills and Somerset meet and portrays Somerset taking a ""you don't know how cruel this city really is"" approach toward Mills. <br/><br/>The music that plays in the background adds to the thrill of many scenes in this film. In the opening credits the song that plays is an uncredited remix by Nine Inch Nails and it sets the foundation for the film. There is a scene when Somerset makes a trip to the library to research the seven deadly sins. The night guard turns on music that seems soothing and peaceful. While this music is playing Somerset is looking through books and murder scene photos giving the scene an ironic feel.<br/><br/>Raw emotion allows the viewer to relate to the characters. This raw emotion is present in the last scene of the film when Mills realizes John Doe murdered Tracy. Mills' tears and facial expressions signify the grief he is experiencing and the dilemma he is facing at that very moment. He is suffering an internal battle on whether or not he should kill John Doe to avenge his wife's murder (wrath) instead of letting the justice system do its job. The characteristic of the overall theme to this film, wrath, can be related to the theme in Kill Bill Volume 1 and Volume 2 where the main character seeks revenge as well.<br/><br/>This film has all of the necessary ingredients to bring the viewer into its ironic reality of religion and murder leading up to the final sin at the end, leaving the viewer completely satisfied."
"matsfrijlink","10","1","2","10 June 2014"," review on Se7en
","The movie Se7en tells the story of two homicide detectives, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), who try to solve seven mysterious murders. All the seven murders are committed very sadistically as the victims are badly mutilated. The mutilations have the purpose of symbolizing the seven deadly sins described in the Bible. David Mills is the new homicide detective and he is aided by the soon to retire William Sommerset. The difference between old 'veteran' Sommerset and 'rookie' Mills brings quite some conflicts in the beginning, but eventually the both of them agree that if they want to catch the killer, they will have to work together and make use of each other's strengths. The movie takes some major twists and turns at the end, and this does contribute to giving the movie a satisfying ending. <br/><br/>We think Se7en is a good movie. The story behind the murders with the seven sins connected to it makes you think, whether or not the murders were really that bad, or did the victims (sort of) deserve it? Asking yourself this question is the result of the strong movie, as you would normally not even consider if a murder was right or not. As mentioned before, the movie builds up to the end, which does live up to the expectations created by the rest of the film, as the ending is just as dramatic and well done as the other parts of the film, which leaves you with a satisfied feeling. <br/><br/>Editing plays a very big and important role in the production of movies, and this movie is no exception. Basically, everything that is even slightly altered from the recorded parts is included in the category editing. Editing therefore is making changes in filmed fragments, and putting these changed fragments together to form a fluent and pleasant to watch movie. An editor therefore has to make a lot of decisions. What parts should he choose to put together to create the right feeling and to satisfy the producer? why should he choose these? Etc. Editing, however, is not just used to make the movie look good or catchy, it's also used to give the audience a certain feeling, imprinted in their minds by the director. In this way, the director can set the experience of the movie to his hand. <br/><br/>Using things such as different lighting, camera height, music and shot length, the movie directors can give the audience certain opinions about the characters without even having the character say a single word. Characters with power are often filmed from a low perspective, as this symbolizes them being greater than you. Meanwhile, meaner or evil characters often have a darker glow around them and different background music, because this creates tension. Difference in Shot length shows a difference in the amount of energy used. The shorter the shots, the more energy is in the actions. For example, in a shooter, shots constantly change from one to the other, whereas in a love-story, the shot length is way longer, to make it more romantic and lovable. <br/><br/>This movie includes a lot of dramatic and painful scenes, wherein the director made use of a range of different shot transitions, to highlight the different amounts of tension in the scenes. In order to make sure that the message is communicated to the audience, they use longer shots and they pause between the monologues. In this way, the audience is forced to think about what's being said and what the message of the movie is. When energetic and active scenes are concerned, the director chose for short shot length, and fast shot transitions, in order to give the scenes more speed. <br/><br/>The film was shot in a way that is uncommon in popular films. It was shot in a special way using special lighting, making lots of shadows and silhouettes. The film was then edited with a process called C.C.E, which enhances the quality of the lights, making the dark parts darker and the light parts whiter. This alteration from the original is permanent. <br/><br/>Most of the colors used are shades of black and grey, so that parts of the images with primary colors (red, yellow and blue) stand out in contrast. In this way, red is often used, because this reminds the people of blood. The colors of this movie have a fakish look. This way, the viewer gets the impression that they watch a coloured-in black and white movie. This sequence is called neo-Gothic, and in my opinion fits well with the story and the rest of the movie, wherein mainly darker colors are used which corresponds with the dark murder theme. <br/><br/>Although this is a pretty rad movie, sometimes scenes can get a bit too slow for our taste. This made us lose track of the story a bit, halfway through, and as a result we had to rewind some parts, to understand them. I have given this movie some thought and can conclude that the directors and producers made an excellent decision regarding the choosing of the actors starring this movie. Morgan Freeman is perfectly able to capture dramatic moments, making the viewers feel sympathy for the actor, and thus making them follow the story better. Likewise we think Brad Pitt is well chosen too, because he is highly experienced with action and shooting scenes. Furthermore, the storyline isn't as linear as one would expect from a crime thriller. On the one hand it's a straightforward murder mystery, but on the other hand there are loads of plot twists to make the movie more interesting and challenging to understand. <br/><br/>We think it's a highly interesting movie. We would definitely recommend this movie, because it is an highly enjoyable and interesting story, and the way they made use of the different kinds of filming editing gives this story even more tension when needed."

The suspense draws the audience in and keeps them entertained whilst the incidents unfold, and remain relentless and shocking throughout; the tension building the whole time for the exciting finale.<br/><br/>Whilst the film keeps you latched on, it does provide a lot of detail, which I personally feel needs your entire attention, and a second viewing, to fully understand and to pick up on information missed the initial time. Even so, this didn't let the film down."
"joeschreurs","10","1","2","10 May 2014"," The best movie i have EVER seen
","this movie was the best movie i have ever seen , kept my eyes locked at the screen for every second. it stars two of the best actors alive which makes it come across that much more real, some movies are ruined by bad acting or just bad directing but this ..... it has everything i look for in a movie a ending that you did not see coming ,,, well basically i didn't see any of it coming in this movie and Morgan Freeman deserves a medal for his acting in this movie. the sins where captured in the best way possible and the clues the killer left where not something you could easily pick out but not so far fetched that it is impossible. i just loved this movie until the very end of it its a jaw dropping piece of art."
"claymohr","7","1","2","2 May 2014"," GREAT concept and beginning thennnn...not so much
","I liked this movie from the moment it started. To me, mixing religion with anything makes 'anything' infinitely more creepy - and this film started out just that way.<br/><br/>I loved the premise of the movie and how each new crime is set up for the viewer. Also that the movie is set up in a world where each day seems grayer than the previous - and each crime more gruesome - it really does a great job of grabbing your attention from the first scene.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman does an excellent job of a weathered, yet wise, detective - and then there is the Brad Pitt element. Ms. Paltrow does fine work in this movie. And then there is Brad Pitt...<br/><br/>I want to like Brad Pitt. Maybe it's just that I haven't seen the movie yet where he does a great job and doesn't seem like he's trying to act 'too hard'. I have a hard time believing his character in this movie (or any movie he's in for that matter). But, the other actors and the script for this movie do a great job of carrying him along.<br/><br/>Then there is the 'end' of the movie. I'm still annoyed by how this movie ended. The last scene seems to be in direct contrast with the imagination, set up, reveal, shock and get-you-by-the-short-hairs script used in the previous 80 minutes of this movie.<br/><br/>So...my 7 out of 10 basically means, for this movie - if it comes on - I will most likely get sucked into watching it again. And then when all the great scenes are over with and I've become weary of one person's acting - I will find that the last 10 minutes are a good point to realize, ""I've been sitting down watching enough TV today - time to go get something done. Like popcorn."""
"ewugraduate","9","1","2","20 April 2014"," One of my favorite movies
","This movie is really good. First, it has two of my favorite actors: Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey so you know it's going to be good. This movie is based on a man's (played by Kevin Spacey) obsession with punishing people who he believes are partaking in one of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play the detectives after him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife to Brad Pitt's character, and while it may seem that she doesn't play a crucial role in the movie, her character turns out to be pivotal in how the end of this movie plays out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about serial killers and those who distort the Bible to their own beliefs. If you have a weak stomach, though, then this movies might not be for you. There are a lot of disturbing images and swearing throughout so I would not recommend it for children. Also, parents really do need to use their judgment when it comes to letting their teens watch it. It's rated R for good reason."
"saytosandeep","8","1","2","16 April 2014"," MY REVIEW: It will be Eighth Sin not to Watch This!!
","Se7en. An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!"

","Se7en has it all, yes and somewhat still does pretty Damn well (compelling entertainment wise) without the very marketable Nudity and Sex...

A must see if you care for the very very Dark side of Humanity Se7en is a rare Treat Directed By David Fincher And Can be watched Till basically Your time on this very mixed up Planet is up..."
"RolltheClip","9","1","2","20 March 2014"," A relentless tour through hell
","The origins of my love for cinema began when I started to discover many films similar to Se7en, ones that really provoke mass discussion long after seeing them. That overwhelming necessity to really explore the deeper meaning of the movie. They don't just aim to entertain, but to challenge opinions and push people to comprehend short-comings in society.<br/><br/>When the young, cocksure Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) moves to the city hoping for a more thrilling line of police work, a string of murders are set in motion. He is consequently partnered with the diligent veteran, Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) to resolve the case, forcing them to put aside their differences to end the sequence of events, only to become pawns on a much larger board.<br/><br/>Throughout the feature you get the feeling that these are two very different walks of life, the generational divide in their work methods are shown clearly. Whilst Somerset is cultured, world-weary and methodical, Mills is very impulsive and head strong, aiming to make an impression within the force yet not having the same determination when investigating. A montage shows Pitt's character is struggling to concentrate at home, meanwhile, his elder is shown pouring over books in a library, making reasonable headway with the case.<br/><br/>This is no buddy-cop movie, it's unrelenting and brutal throughout. Although all the murders happen off-screen, the events are retold via the crime scene investigations and photographic evidence which enhance the aura of mystery around the killer, building up to the final chilling performance by Kevin Spacey as their very own John Doe. Blank of regret and emotion, he fits the performance perfectly as you can see the criminal exuding delight as the detectives are forced to pursue him through the grisly cat and mouse game.<br/><br/>One of the ways that Fincher expresses how twisted the city-living can become is by the similarities between the characteristics of the 'insane' Doe and the disciplined Somerset. They act as two parallel examples of how someone can deal with a poor hand. Where the detective originally set out to better the world via law enforcement, using his intellect to prevent misconduct, John Doe executes a series of pre- meditated murders using his knowledge as a message to the masses. Their cynical outlook on how humanity has become so apathetic is resolved in two completely polar ways, their likeness fascinates me.<br/><br/>I believe that part of David Fincher's plan when filming this was to hold a mirror to modern society. For us to scrutinise why, when murders are committed, we show no empathy? Horrors and tragedies are a staple fixture of the world today and much like Fincher's 'Fight Club' adaptation, it questions the very core of how compassion seems to have become less predominant, replaced by a love for money, consumerism and our own well-being. How accustomed we have become to awful events described by various media outlets on a a daily basis. All roles perfectly delivered by all actors involved. The ending flawlessly ties all loose ends within the plot whilst delivering its distressing climax, undoubtedly still provoking debates over a decade after its initial release."
"videorama-759-859391","9","1","2","4 March 2014"," Se7en plus 2 = brilliant stay at home film, which is bound to shock and engross
","Seven is the best example of story structure I've ever seen in film. Everything comes at the right time, in a script, brilliantly crafted by Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote an earlier draft in 1992, with a different ending, unlike the final one that jarred me, and left me open mouthed, haunting me for many nights later, if almost turning me off the movies. Cocky rookie cop, Brad Pitt and a more wise veteran detective (Freeman) work an out of the ordinary case, involving a killer, punishing people right down to the T, based on the seven deadly sins, some quite gruesome and graphic murders shown, led by excessive examples, sloth and gluttony, wrath and envy, the key to the finale of this nuts scenario. The brilliant performance from the very well respected actor playing our John Doe, I didn't recognizing until ten minutes later. You go into Seven, thinking it's just another serial killer movie, you come out, somewhat disturbed, jarred by it's none more shock ending, you'll never see coming, and it's great twenty minute lead up, which for some people who are easily disturbed, should steer away from. Freeman is solid here, where in many familiar start scenarios, here, he's just retiring from the department, when who should walk in, but cocky, arrogant, anger charged Pitt, in one of his best ever performances, where these two great actors were praised, warranted some acting stature. We have light hearted moments, ""meet the family"" scenes that worked well, amidst the mostly heavy and intense material, the John Doe chaser scene is awesome. Seven is flawless, I must say, it's opening theme to the song closer, that plays over haunting credits amongst disturbing and engrossing images, rocks, as does the closing soon, as a duly reminder as the consequences of those victim's sins. Put this is on your final bucket list of movies. Awesome cover poster."

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","10","1","2","31 January 2014"," ""People will barely be able to comprehend it, but they won't be able to deny it.""
","""Seven,"" a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see filmmaking of a high order. It tells the story of two detectives - one ready to retire, the other at the start of his career - and their attempts to capture a perverted serial killer who is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his scenario.<br/><br/>The look of ""Seven"" is crucial to its effect. This is a very dark film, the gloom often penetrated only by the flashlights of the detectives. Even when all the lights are turned on in the apartments of the victims, they cast only wan, hopeless pools of light.<br/><br/>The enigma of Somerset's character is at the heart of the film, and this is one of Morgan Freeman's best performances. He embodies authority naturally; I can't recall him ever playing a weak man. Here he knows all the lessons a cop might internalize during years spent in what we learn is one of the worst districts of the city. He lives alone, in what looks like a rented apartment, bookshelves on the walls. He puts himself to sleep with a metronome. He never married, although he came close once. He is a lonely man who confronts life with resigned detachment.<br/><br/>""Seven"" is not really a very deep or profound film, but it provides the convincing illusion of one. Almost all mainstream thrillers seek first to provide entertainment; this one intends to fascinate and appall. The killer obviously intends his elaborate murders as moral statement. He suggests as much after we meet him. When he's told his crimes will soon be forgotten in the daily rush of cruelty, he insists they will be remembered forever. They are his masterpiece. What goes unexplained is how, exactly, he is making a statement. His victims, presumably guilty of their sins, have been convicted and executed by his actions. What's the lesson? Let that be a warning to us?<br/><br/>The killer, as I said, turns himself in with 30 minutes to go, and dominates the film from that point forward. When ""Seven"" was released in 1995 the ads, posters and opening credits didn't mention the name of the actor, and although you may well know it, I don't think I will either. This actor has a big assignment. He embodies Evil. Like Hannibal Lecter, his character must be played by a strong actor who projects not merely villainy but twisted psychological complexities. Observe his face. Smug. Self-satisfied. Listen to his voice. Intelligent. Analytical. Mark his composure and apparent fearlessness. The film essentially depends on him, and would go astray if the actor faltered. He doesn't.<br/><br/>""Seven"" is unique in one detail of its construction; it brings the killer on screen with half an hour to go, and gives him a speaking role. Instead of being simply the quarry in a chase, he is revealed as a twisted but articulate antagonist, who has devised a horrible plan for concluding his sermon. (The actor playing the killer is not identified by name in the ads or opening credits, and so I will leave his identity as another of his surprises.) ""Seven"" is well-made in its details, and uncompromising in the way it presents the disturbing details of the crimes. It is certainly not for the young or the sensitive."
"ln922010","8","1","2","12 January 2014"," I would recommend
","First off, this movie does not have a ""happy ending""; this is why I could not give it a ten star rating. For me to give a movie/TV show a ten star rating it has to have a happy ending. I'm not going to lie I was so upset the first time I watched it and told everyone the movie was horrible. However, I really liked the movie, I was just harping on about the ending. That being said, I think the movie itself was brilliant. It would not have been as good if it would have had a ""happy ending"". The part at the end that I hated made everything fit perfectly. Knowing the end results made me like it more when I watched it again. Great acting by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Also this movie is not scary at all. I do get scared easy in movies (that aren't even scary movies). I refuse to watch scary movies actually, so for me to say it's not scary means it's not scary. I was obviously surprised by the ending and that always makes a movie so much better to me is when I can't figure out the ending until the end."

Two cops, an experienced veteran of the streets who is about to retire and the ambitious young homicide detective hired to replace him, team up to capture the perpetrator of these gruesome killings. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, they too become ensnared in his diabolical plan....<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, stop reading and watch this masterpiece. But I don't know anyone who hasn't seen this, and as soon as you mention the film, everyone I know gives that look, because the first thing you remember the ending, and the subliminal image of Paltrow.<br/><br/>Set in a nameless city, its and odd mixture of thriller, Gothic horror, and genuinely touching, funny moment, this is what makes the film unique.<br/><br/>It doesn't prepare you for the conclusion of the film. Pitt is a happy man, new job, wife and a relatively stable home. Freeman though, is a troubled individual, having to have aids to help him sleep.<br/><br/>But Fincher is a genius in the way that he ups the tension without the audience being aware. Every new murder is more disgusting than the the last, and the the line 'California, stay away from here, John Doe has the upper hand' tingles the spine, regardless of the amount of times you've seen it.<br/><br/>It really is the epitome of, you can never see it in the same light as the first time you saw it.<br/><br/>It really is that powerful.<br/><br/>Brilliant stuff"
"Kathryn96","9","1","2","15 December 2013"," Great movie!
","I watched Se7en, which stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey and I was gob smacked at how well crafted the storyline and ending are. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive. Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over. Very Highly recommended and I would give it 9/10."
"AaronCapenBanner","7","1","2","4 December 2013"," Deadly Sins
","David Fincher directed this dark mystery that stars Brad Pitt as detective Mills, who joins more experienced detective Somerset(played by Morgan Freeman) in their murder investigation that seems quite bizarre, as the victims were killed via the judgment of the seven deadly sins(gluttony, sloth, etc.) The killer is quite clever and patient, though the detectives do eventually track him down, and after his arrest, learn that he has one more victim in mind to complete his master-plan, and that it involves Mills' wife(played by Gwyneth Paltrow)... Impressively directed and acted film is supremely well-crafted, with a knockout of an ending you won't see coming, though it is so unrelentingly bleak & depressing that it can be a chore to sit through, yet it remains worthwhile viewing in spite of this."

","Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt are obviously just another classic white / black duo of two butting personalities. Once the sexual tension is relieved midway through the film they both realize they are in for a treat emotionally when they encounter a villain that rivals Joe Pesci in Home Alone 2. With no Macauley Caulkin to booby trap a cunning bastard these two are left to play clue until the tragic end of themselves & their faith in Christianity. Yet hold the phone there is still hope, as we have seen in the comeback of Ben Affleck after making the film Gigli, Morgan remains astute even in the faltering of the human soul in villains & heroes because we see him later in life as the head of Wayne enterprises. All in all this movie reiterates that life goes on, unless you have committed suicide or are in fact in purgatory."
"JTx13","7","1","2","9 November 2013"," Very good play on humanity
","Albeit somewhat extreme, this movie does a virtuous job of indemnifying how human society is degrading as a whole. Our perverse and void of emotion (or extreme emotion) is hopelessly captured within the span of this movie. Who are we if we are not ourselves and not truly trying to be better people? This is a movie worth watching. I did so on the terms of a review for a school project and it actually was more meaningful than I was expecting. the writers may have not intended such a dramatic realization that if our actions are unkept then we would be ultimately subject to what was illustrated in this movie. a few suggestions to this movie would be to watch it with a sincerely open mind, thoughts to who we are, who we could be, what we have been, and how we should voyage into the future."

Most of horrors novadays doesn't scare so much as Se7en. Storyline is awesome and actors play very good, especially Bradd Pitt in final scene - unforgettable. Morgan Freeman always play well and so he did. After watching Se7en you will start to compare all thrillers with it.

"Red-Barracuda","9","1","2","16 October 2013"," Very successful dark and grisly, noirish murder mystery
","If you simply read about what Seven is about you would be forgiven for thinking it sounded an incredibly hackneyed affair. A world weary detective a week from retirement is paired with a young hotshot colleague to work on a new case of grisly murders. They don't get on at first but once they get to know each other they begin to form a bond and prove to be a good team. This synopsis makes Seven sound like a generic buddy cop movie. And, to be fair, it is that to a certain extent. But fortunately the truth is in the detail.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher is a visual stylist and it's the look and feel of the movie that helps transcend it to another level. The setting is a nameless, hellish city where it seems to constantly be raining. There is a consistent feeling of impending dread. The visual elements of the film emphasises this. It goes for a dark neo-noir look, what with the rain and the shadowy interiors. The buildings all look like they are from a bygone era, while the men seem to dress like they are from a 40's film-noir - hats and trench coats are the order of the day, despite this clothing being completely out of fashion in the 90's. It's this attention to detail that gives Seven such an interesting look and feel.<br/><br/>Then we have the serial killings themselves. They have been staged to represent the seven deadly sins from the Bible. Each horrible death is targeted against someone who breaches one of the sins and their punishment is an elaborate and violent lesson against their transgression. It's a great set of crimes to base a detective film around. The mystery narrative progresses at first in a fairly traditional way but towards the end the rug is pulled out from under us and we enter unexpected territory. It's this unpredictability also that makes this a fine unconventional thriller. The principal actors are all very good, with a particular standout turn from Kevin Spacey towards the end. Spacey is very adept a doing 'cold' and here he is pitch perfect.<br/><br/>The story arc winds its way intelligently to an unforgettably nihilistic climax and Seven ultimately has to be considered one of the best serial killer films out there."
"Aly200","8","1","2","22 September 2013"," Dark, Twisted and Terrifying
","Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. <br/><br/>Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is electric as their characters' personalities clash perfectly. With Pitt playing the hot-headed rookie with Freeman as the seasoned veteran, Mills and Somerset are initially at odds with each other as Somerset disapproves of Mills's quick temper. However the duo realizes that they both must solve the riddle behind the film's killing spree. But their efforts come at a high cost at the film's close when the epic twist is revealed (which I will not reveal here).<br/><br/>The murder scenes are grisly and unsettling which should not be viewed by the squeamish. Director David Fincher does spare us the horrible ""Lust"" murder in the film; the details are vaguely described by a witness/participant. And the film's climatic death is portrayed only by the reaction of Morgan Freeman's Somerset as he discovers the truth and valiantly tries to stop the film's final brutal act.<br/><br/>If you are able to handle this chilling tale, be prepared to check behind you."

Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying. To say much more would spoil the final scenes. Generally I can take or leave the whole crime/horror genre--it just isn't always my cup of tea--but this film is deeper and more raw than most. 8/10"

","There are very few horror movies that have come out in the past twenty-five years that manage to deliver on the ""horror"" front without resorting to taking the gore over the top, or playing all of the lowest common denominator cards. Se7en is the exception to the rule. It's most bone chilling moments are dialogue driven, and plot progression is what packs the punches, not formulaically placed ""one-up"" death sequences. The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for ""perfect 10"" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact.

One of their best performances to date, in my opinion. I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over. If you've yet to check it out, you should do so right away. I give it a ten out of ten, mainly because of the creepy setting and very original plot."

","A wonderful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat The Film Seven was written and directed by David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker. This film stars Brad Pitt (Detective David Mills), Morgan Freeman (Detective Lt. William Somerset), and Gwyneth Paltrow (Tracy Mills, David's wife). David is the new detective in town and going to be taking Somerset's place in the department. They start as partners and take on Somerset's last case. It started as a murder case, thinking this was just the ordinary case they soon find out otherwise when they come across another murder. Putting the pieces together they realize that these murders are related. There is a killer on the loose who is killing people based on the seven sins: Sloth, greed, gluttony, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Through most of the film it is raining or night time which helps to build the suspense of the movie. I think if the director would have had more day time shots the film would not have been the same. This film was outstanding and I would highly recommend that you rent it and see for yourselves."

","An amazing film with a great twist. <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's first entrance as John Doe was one of the highlights for me, and goes down as perhaps the most chilling entrance of any villain in a thriller.<br/><br/>Se7en is gruesome at times and watching this movie alone in a dark room late at night will do two things: enhance the impact in a good way, and enhance the impact in a highly impacting way. Your choice.<br/><br/>A 'must-watch', especially if you're into chilling, suspenseful and downright evil thrillers. The other part of this film that makes it so intense is the long moment of indecision that David Mills (Brad Pitt) has at the end of the film. He takes so long to decide, and as an audience we know what he should do, but know he's not going to do it. This is a credit to David Fincher and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Read this whole thing in Morgan Freeman's voice. If you like how that sounds, watch Se7en."
"Sonic_Ocean","10","1","2","22 July 2013"," Se7en is a beautiful film and worth watching. I agree with both parts.
","Getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things I've done for myself as a person who loves film. Deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. Movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. This is everything that makes Se7en a great movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the film, but first I have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. It is just pure grit and grime and I love the film's consistency in its tone. Not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. These aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. A key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in film thus far.<br/><br/>What also makes Se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from Morgan Freeman who makes each movie I've seen him in have depth and character. While Freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, Kevin Spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. To deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching Hannibal Lecter on screen was a feat that I didn't even know could be accomplished. I was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. He was that captivating in his acting performance.<br/><br/>I don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch Se7en. The film is so good that I had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. A pure classic in every way."
"fritzgagi","8","1","2","12 August 2012"," The curious case of John Doe
","A psychopathic killer goes around killing people, staging their death according to one of the seven deadly sins. Two cops are assigned for the case, one is experienced and stoic and one is impulsive and heated. As they investigate the case, they get caught up in the killers game and need to immerse themselves in his psyche.<br/><br/>David Fincher orchestrates this film as a pretty straightforward thriller for the most part. The two cops go from crime scene to crime while both of their characters get explored and you get to understand why they work how they do. The dynamic between Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt really works here because neither of them is a cardboard cutout, simply there to convey their respective life mottos, but real three-dimensional human beings, allowing for some genuine conflict. The killer here is a self-perceived messenger of god, on a mission to show everyone how messed up the world has become. Kevin Spacey portrays him as intelligent and seemingly controlled, rather than insane, which you would expect from someone who puts heads in shoe boxes, thus making this villain scary as hell.<br/><br/>The ending is plotted perfectly and it thematically rounds up the movie. Although its pacing isn't pulled off as perfectly as its written, its still one of the best endings you'll ever see in a thriller."
"mikes-movie-review-onlin","9","1","2","15 April 2012"," ""An exercise in storytelling, visual style and suspense""
","David Fincher's dark, gruesome and intelligent thriller Se7en remains one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It's dark visual tone and use of pathetic fallacy coupled with the harrowing story of a killer attempting to teach humanity a lesson is both disturbing and brilliant. Fincher shows audiences his true capabilities as a director, and Se7en is an exercise in storytelling, visual style, and suspense, making it one of the definitive crime thrillers of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The film begins in a miserable and unidentified cityscape, perhaps Los Angeles, or New York. Perhaps it is simply a metaphorical version of all the crime in American urban areas. This city seems ‚Äì for at least the one week the movie takes place in ‚Äì perpetually covered in fog and light rain. We are introduced to Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), a young and impulsive cop who was transferred to the city. He is paired with Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), an older, calmer, meticulous veteran to the force with one week left before retirement. The contrasting pair make a nice centrepiece for the havoc which is to be wrecked upon them by an unknown murder.<br/><br/>Their first case together is the supposed murder of an obese man, found bound to a chair, he was forced at gunpoint to eat himself to death. His crime was gluttony. There are six more deadly sins, all of which the meticulous, patient, and above all disturbed, serial killer plans to use as his MO. They are: greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. Somerset, who has a keen insight into the mind of the killer, asks to be taken off the case but remains in contact with Mills as he reads through Dante's ""Divine Comedy"", Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"", and other prose relating to the seven deadly sins. Together the pair of detectives get closer to the murderer, eventually ending in a climax which is brilliantly scripted by Andrew Kevin Walker.<br/><br/>The key to Se7en's success as a crime-thriller is the feel of the movie. Fincher is terrifically talented at bringing to life the most stylish interpretation of the material possible. The sinister atmosphere of the city is only furthered by the grisly murders and the seeming hopelessness of finding the murderer. Even when they find what they think is his apartment they don't discover a single fingerprint. Also vital to the film is the script by Andrew Kevin Walker. He gives Morgan Freeman just enough poetic lines to run with, and the killer presented here is unique. He is intelligent, he writes his thoughts down journal after journal, he is patient, calm, sensible, and he seems to enjoy killing his victims. Interestingly, the murderer is presented with about 30 minutes left of the film, given a speaking role and made an important character, opposed to simply being the unnamed monster behind the killings who is caught at the end. I won't ruin who plays the killer for anyone who hasn't seen the film, just know that it was a smart choice both to cast this actor/actress, but also not to advertise it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt gives a strong performance as Mills, the younger cop who loses his temper more frequently, but still believes he can make a difference. I wouldn't have liked anyone else to play the role, but I could see a handful of other actors also embodying Mills. Somerset, on the other hand, could not logically be played by anyone but Morgan Freeman. Freeman's calm deep voice, and his presence on-screen is unavoidable. His character more questioning of the supposed good nature of humanity, yet still devoted to catching the killer. He is intellectual, he reads Milton and Dante and Chaucer for clues to the murders, and he thinks before he acts, unlike Detective Mills. This difference in character serves as an essential plot point later in the film. <br/><br/>David Fincher has become internationally successful as a maker of both highly stylish thrillers (e.g. Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and more sweeping dramatic films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network. Se7en was Fincher's first real venture into the crime-thriller genre, and it stands as one of his best works. The director is certainly unafraid of being uncompromising and violent, and he shows a strong understanding of visual style and artistic expression. Many shots in this film are incredibly memorable, being just a part of what makes Se7en such an unavoidable film."

","This is a dark, disturbing movie. It is intense, scary, and thought provoking. The dialogue is excellent. But it will disturb you. When I went to see this movie in the theatre, I was on the edge of my seat, not just out of tension, because I was straining to hear what everyone was saying. I know they didn't have the volume turned down to low, because the soundtrack, and all other sounds in the movie were LOUD, its just all the actors sounded like they were mumbling. OK, maybe it was just the accoustics of the theatre. I rented it once on VHS, and there was the same problem -- you could barely hear anything that anyone said. OK, I had a lousy VCR, I thought it would be different when I got in on DVD. I watched it again last weekend, and it was still the exact same problem. The sound editing on this movie is pretty bad, which is REALLY frustrating, because its an amazing movie. You'd think that someone else would have mentioned this to the producers by now, and they would have re-edited it for the DVD.<br/><br/>Still, if you have strong ears, and a strong stomach, this movie is well worth watching."

The movie is excellently acted all around and Freeman and Pitt are at the top of their games.<br/><br/>The films horrible crimes are described in graphic detail and you are left wondering after each one which sin will be next and in what creatively insane manner the killer will strike.

"brando647","9","1","2","16 March 2012"," A Modern Crime Classic
","I think just about everyone who has seen ALIEN 3 can agree, it's pretty crappy. We should all be thankful that Hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director David Fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. After throwing himself under the bus to complete ALIEN 3, Fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with SE7EN. The film is a modern classic and most people will agree. I love a good serial killer story, and SE7EN is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. Thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, SE7EN is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for Fincher. In the film, Detective William Somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more na√Øve Detective David Mills. Mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. Mills' first case, and Somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. A new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint).<br/><br/>This is a dark, twisted movie. From the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". And it only gets more twisted from there. We never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name John Doe) in action as the audience. Instead, we see the aftermath as Somerset and Mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. John Doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. SE7EN is the most gripping serial killer/thriller since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. While there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, I would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. Despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, I'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. It's a strong ending and I'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. Not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes.<br/><br/>Every element of this movie contributes to its strength. The cinematography from Darius Khondji is amazing. The visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. The high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (I really loved the red neon cross in Doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with Detective Somerset's view on life in the city. I would love to get my hands on the screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director Fincher. The cast in this movie, again inspired. The only real important characters in the film are Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills (Brad Pitt), and the killer John Doe (who I won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about Doe). Morgan Freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. Somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until Doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. I've also got to give Pitt some great credit here because SE7EN was the movie that helped me realize Pitt was more talented than I'd believed and more than just a Hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in FIGHT CLUB, another awesome Fincher film). And finally, the actor portraying John Doe is excellent. Doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. All together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite."

A beautiful model whose face has been slashed dies, pride is her great sin and all of the Catholic big seven are covered by the end of this very well written and thoughtful analysis of a sick mind.<br/><br/>Freeman and Pitt make a great pair, and Kevin Spacey is creepy as John Doe, the suspect.

","Awesome acting performances by Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey too; reminded me of his role in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. But, in spite of such high quality performances, and some fantastic screenplay and editing, nothing could make me deny the fact that the script was just average & not anything more than that. Although the climax was ""gut-wrenching"", as called by few, it was not at all so much worth watching. I came through this movie, after having watched a lot of movies of the genre of crime-mystery-thriller. I think such movies can be made far better, by adding some kind of twists at the ending. The one given in this movie was not essentially a twist; it was just something to add 2 more to the 5 sins to make it Seven. I'm not at all telling that its a bad movie.One can rate it 8/10 but obviously not 8.7. And you know there's quite a lot difference between 8 and 8.7, here at IMDb. Movies like The Usual Suspects, Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, etc. are better."

","So I seem to not have written a review for this film back when I saw it two years ago. What can I say? It's a great film. All of the classic elements of a crime thriller. Of course, that powerful ending... it still worked very well on a rewatch. Morgan Freeman steals this film though. He is the much more interesting character, and gives a quiet, understated performance. Paltrow does as well in her limited screen time, as does Kevin Spacey. This feels like a Fincher film... it's impeccably, almost perfectly made, with the usual colors and cold tones that Fincher films have. Overall, from the 5 Finchers I have seen (this, Fight club, Zodiac, Benjamin Button, and The Social Network) this still ranks at the bottom, though all he has is great films, and I have rewatched all of his films at least once."
"WatchAnything","7","1","2","7 May 2011"," Movie #1 (Format: DVD, Widescreen)
","Last Thoughts First: Cinema attracts all forms of oddballs, don't it? Why anyone with any notion of The Bible or sin sits through a film like this is anyone else's guess- but who has time to play games? ME! People who could need a film like this to tell them anything about the world we live in or confirm what they already believe are only useful to this movie in, hopefully, having bought a ticket or copy of the home video. I on the other hand am such a freeloader- I first saw this on VHS, borrowed a copy from someone else who paid the rental fee. And this morning, I watched it on DVD- again, not my copy and I've never paid to rent it.<br/><br/>The Movie: Morgan Freeman is always intelligent and thoughtful, that's his gimmick. He's the real star of the movie, yet he doesn't get top billing because he isn't white- like international heartthrob, Brad Pitt. Pitt is always obnoxious and annoying, even when he's playing a whiny vampire. I'm not much of a fan of either. They're both still doing their gimmicks. But only one of them annoys me. Surprisingly, it's the one who plays the guy who's always on some kind of sugar rush / caffeine high. Does his character Mills have ADHD or something? Either way, I don't care. I get it, he can't control himself and expects others to do it for him; he needs to shut up or simmer down. They're the hard-boiled detectives covering the case of The 7-Sins Killer - my nickname for the guy, not something you hear in the movie. The movie's too busy with actor gimmicks. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the same sweet-hearted pretty blonde chick she always is. That guy who's always on The Military Channel actually plays a fairly perceptive chief / commissioner type- although he has the single dumbest line in the movie (the ""Southern Baptist upbringing"" quip). Kevin Spacey plays a fanatic, which we all know he's good at. And Scrubs' John C. McGinley plays a skinheaded SWAT team psycho, with the movie's single nastiest line of dialogue (do you remember what it was?).<br/><br/>The Moral of the Story: The world sucks and nobody cares. And Brad Pitt needs to learn more about subtlety. His attempts to bull viewers into paying more attention to him rather than Freeman are feeble and if this movie caused any of his ""Sexiest Man Alive"" admirers to sleep with one eye open... Good. But, I doubt what the killer said rang very true. About what he does being studied and followed for years. Instead, it was just hollowed out for brainless copycats like Saw (2003). If people were smart enough to appreciate the killer and his work in the context of his mission... why does Saw currently have a 7.7 rating on IMDb? Sounds like he had just a little too much faith in the human race."

I came out and thought wow what a movie. I have seen it numerous times since and it is such a great film on many levels. Brad Pitt's descent in to despair, Morgan Freeman seeking solace from a nameless city he hates to live in, and a simply ingenious set of murders by a crusading yet mad serial killer played sublimely by Spacey. I love the fact that even the dialogue is not clear along with the story so it is impossible to know what is to happen next. In fact over the next couple of days, I think I will watch it again.

The dark visual style throughout the whole film and of course the acting is astonishing.<br/><br/>The characters depicted in the film are characters we all can relate to in some way or another. David Mills played by Brad Pitt, who knows that the world is a dark and cruel place, but still has the faith to believe in everything thats good and positive about it. Det. William Somerset played by Morgan Freeman, who has already given up on the world a long time ago. And John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, who gives us a chilling performance as a twisted individual who simply ""would not take it anymore"" (like Travis in Taxi Driver said).<br/><br/>At the end of the film you'll get one of the most disturbing endings of all time. A ""what would I have done"" kind of ending. That was the exact question I asked myself after I viewed it in amazement. The only other Ending that could possibly be as great as Se7en is THE MIST, which came out in 2007.

","Se7en takes the tired and clich√©d serial-killer genre and twists it on it's head. Literally. Andrew Kevin Walker wrote a doozy of a script and the acting by a stellar cast is superb. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt match each other scene for scene and Kevin Spacey's performance is nothing short of outstanding. He is chillingly believable as the morally ambiguous serial killer. The only one who disappoints is Gwyneth Paltrow, her character not given much time to develop due to not receiving much screen time. The final scene between the three male leads is electrifying. The cinematography is bleak, raining in almost every scene except the last. The denouement is shattering and leaves one feeling very unsettled. Despite there being little to no violence on- screen, it is extremely dark and chilling. This is a movie that will leave you questioning the morals of the world around you.

The first being the multi acclaimed ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the third being ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"".<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is the kind of movie you can't stop watching. Since the opening sequence you know you are into a slick, atmospheric experience that is backed up by excellent acting, a solid plot, great dialogs, and suspense.<br/><br/>You won't get a more interesting plot in a serial killer film. But it's not everything about the killer known as John Doe. The story behind the life of the rookie detective and his relationship with the veteran cop that is about to retire is excellent. They make the perfect on-screen duo of the 90's Horror/Thriller genre.<br/><br/>I enjoyed big time the accurate Criminology and Criminlastic facts such as techniques, theories, and more detailed situations.<br/><br/>We have the chance to experience the film through the killer's eyes and understand his bizarre motives. Sure, the whole serial killer investigation is interesting enough to keep you watching, but also the personal situation between the young couple is what carries the film on it's back.<br/><br/>The movie is not for those who have a weak stomach as the killer's motives are very explicit when shown. We have access to them via post-murder scenes when our heroes investigate them.<br/><br/>The Direction is excellent. The movie is atmospheric but elegant at the same time. When big budgets are squeezed, you get great movies like this. The cinematography and art direction are outstanding and truly create an insecure place where you can actually feel there's a serial killer on the loose. <br/><br/>The acting is superb. Morgan Freeman is one of those versatile actors who can master emotions and control the pace of the whole film. He's great and delivers plenty of emotions. Brad Pitt demonstrates he's not only a good looking guy but also a fine actor. Gwyneth Paltrow convinced me as the tender young wife who supports her husband's dangerous work. R. Lee Ermey is always a delight to watch!<br/><br/>The ending is truly shocking. It will leave you sad, mad, shocked, and probably scared.<br/><br/>I will remember ""Se7en"" for these scenes: The opening murder scenario, when both detectives meet on a rainy day, the shocking ending, Paltrow's conversation in the cafeteria with Freeman, John Doe's introduction in the police station, the shaking apartment, etc.<br/><br/>This is one of the best 90's movies.

Pitt and Freeman both go to investigate and eventually they realise that the killer is murdering his victims based on the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, envy, sloth, wrath, lust and pride). the film is so amazingly put together. one little problem with this which isn't really a problem to be honest is that the film should be on longer, its a classic film that really should be on for at least two and a half hours instead of only being on for two. the music and the camera angles are so stunning. some of the scenes are very shocking and will leave you thinking for many days after watching it. the chemistry of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is nothing short of remarkable. they both should of won Oscars for there roles in this. Gwyneth Paltrow (A Perfect Murder) plays a good role as Pitts girl. one role that really was breathtaking was Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, Superman Returns) as the killer. he should of won an Oscar for that role too. the ending to this film has to be one of the most shocking and most powerful i've ever seen. it really hits you like a wave and doesn't let go until the end credits. what a masterpiece this movie is.<br/><br/>i'm so glad this film is in the top 30 films of all time because this film is definitely worth it. if you love this film you should try another Fincher classic called Zodiac. Zodiac is one on the greatest serial killer films i've ever seen. this film is going to remembered forever and not many films will surpass its brilliance..........

Hopefully, Mr. Freeman just missed getting nominated for ""Best Actor""; he certainly deserved to be, for his sharply focused take on the character type also happens to precisely reflect the mood of the piece.<br/><br/>******** Seven (9/22/95) David Fincher ~ Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow"

David Fincher said in an interview around the time of its release that he wanted to make a film that scarred people like Jaws. He certainly achieved that in my book.The film lingers long in the memory after viewing it and that is a rare thing in todays throwaway Hollywood disposable film production.I own Se7en on DVD, its not a film that i would ever watch to cheer me up but its one i'll keep going back to remind me how great films can be. 10/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","8","1","2","12 September 2007"," a dark and terrifying thriller that if you can withstand its horrific style and gritty suspense, will be realized as one of the finest films of the 90s
","Of course, thrillers and horrors, which ""Se7en"" is top of the line, are not everybody's cup of tea. And many people probably would find a film such as this just simply too gory, too violent, and too graphically realistic to find appealing or even compelling. ""Se7en"" was not intended to be a movie for the soft-stomached, and maybe even made to twist knots in the strong-stomached. Whatever the case, it is exactly what it was intended to be: a horrifying and hair-raising thriller. But what it also possesses is excellent craftsmanship and creativity. All of the traits needed for a great film are present in ""Se7en"". I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I couldn't get some of the scenes out of my head. Not just because they were so brilliantly shot, but also for being so disturbing. But this did not make me dislike the film any. Sure, I got chills up my spine, but I saw it as an excellent example of film-making.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" utilizes the basic concept of most cop movies. Two detectives, quite different from one another, try to track down a serial killer and bring him to justice. But ""Se7en"" takes this basic plot idea and expands it a little further to give all of the characters a purpose. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman were both magnificently flawless in their performances and gave us the impression that we were looking at real cops, not just two popular actors performing on screen. That's what I really look for in a movie with big stars on the cast list. I see if the characters are used to create good performances and characters, not just to lure people into the theater. And the serial killer, whose identity and performer I will keep anonymous for those who have never seen ""Se7en"" turned out to be one of the most brutal and above all, cunning serial killers and what's more, his actions had a purpose in the film. Instead of just simply murdering people for the fun of it or even having a personal problem with them, he bases his attacks on victims who he feels have committed a crime that society does not feel is worthy of a penalty. The effect of limiting his screen time helped to increase the effect of his initial appearance, very much like the shark from ""Jaws"".<br/><br/>The set designs in the film are amazing. We are never told on screen where exactly this city is located. Maybe it's Los Angeles or New York City, but whatever the case, the city is displayed as one of the most grimy and dirty cities you'd expect. We seldomly, if ever, see a clear blue sky while under the tall skyscrapers. There's smoke in the air, it's raining almost all of the time to give enhance the appearance of such a dirty environment. And then we think about the characters, one of whom has lived almost all, if not all of his life in such a place and wonder how he stayed so long.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is a magnficent example of 90s film-making. Perhaps it is a bit flawed in a few aspects, such as too much dialogue sequences that seem to drag on for a while longer than they should. But it works out as a thriller and horror film on an epic scale. Some people will find it too disturbing for them, but for me, it's a very well-done film with an unexpected and brilliant climax.<br/><br/>""Ernest Hemingway once wrote ""the world is a fine place and worth fighting for"" I agree with the second part."" -Morgan Freeman as Detective William Somerset"

","This is quite simply one of the best pieces of film making in cinematic history. I watch a lot of horror/serial killer flicks and for the most part, 99% of them all follow the same formula. Se7en on the other hand goes by no script ever presented before. This is a totally original, imaginative and twisted tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire way through. It is quite simply one of the most well written movies I've ever seen and ranks as #3 on my all time favorite movies. <br/><br/>The ending is like nothing I've ever seen before and totally blew my mind.

"uroskin","9","1","2","23 July 2007"," Noir horror
","Watched that noir horror movie Se7en on the weekend because I was stuck in a household without many commercial-free alternatives. I normally don't go for grisly films, especially those with Brad Pitt, but since it had such a good write up on rottentomatoes, and I am such a bad movie theater goer these days, I couldn't really pass it up - even if it meant sitting through almost 30 minutes of commercials as is wont on New Zealand TV. I thought it was rather wonderfully done, despite the grisliness. It's not often that you get Dante and Chaucer as major plot references in Hollywood films these days. (If you don't want to watch the film, there is a highly readable film script). You can't but admire the tenacity and the complete obsession of John Doe with his project. I had him down as an Asperger's Syndrome guy right away but I was unsure about his priorities. I mean, we can all empathize with getting a pound of flesh back out of a greedy lawyer, but why did the prostitute have to die? She wasn't the one guilty of lust, her johns are and they got away with only a knife dildo strapped to their groin. And why did he think sloth the worst of all the deadly sins? The victim took a whole year to die a particularly slow and nasty death - much worse than Jesus in The Passion - while the others were dispatched relatively quickly. I still can't take Brad Pitt seriously, but Kevin Spacey has surely deserved his place among the screen's worst baddies."

"dragonshield","9","1","2","22 May 2007"," Brilliant screenplay, amazing role performances, all in all a definite thriller masterpiece
","I wasn't so sure what to expect, either a very brutal and a disturbing movie or an intelligent and an exciting thriller. Well, it was brutal at parts, disturbing at times, but it still managed to be an intelligent and an exciting thriller all the way through, a true diamond for the thriller -genre. The movie tells about two homicide detectives, an experienced veteran detective Somerset who's about to retire from his job and another detective Mills, a rookie who's supposed replace Somerset after he's retired. They soon team up together when they find out that there's a serial killer who commits his murders by choosing victims who each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins. A perfect plot for a thriller indeed.<br/><br/>I just mentioned about the plot being perfect for a thriller, but does the screenplay manage that perfection? Oh yes, it does. The screenplay (written by Andrew Kevin Walker) is absolutely amazing, along with the whole storytelling. The whole movie is exciting and thrilling throughout all the way from the beginning till the end by not making one single stop or telling any irrelevant subplots. It focuses on the main theme, the whole progress of solving a crime in a very detailed way, making it undeniably one of the best thrillers ever made. Another thing mentioned above is that it was brutal and disturbing at times, but it still doesn't take it over the top. I could describe those parts as being important for the film itself. By showing these brutal things it makes you alert and sort of scared, and really makes you despise the unnatural murderer who's behind the horrible crimes. You really start to live the movie itself, you want to catch the criminal and make him pay what he has done. That is because the absolutely brilliant storytelling the movie has, also giving it a very good flow which causes the 2 hours go in a blink of an eye. That is what a real flow should all be about, making a 3 hour long massive epic movie seem like only a 30 minute short film. That is what ""Se7en"" manages, a flow that's just so good it's a real pleasure for eyes to see.<br/><br/>The directing is close to excellence and it is lead by David Fincher whose work I will most certainly be observing in the future, as I was so pleased on the result he managed with ""Se7en"". Fincher sort of follows the whole story as it should, translating the screenplay on the screen in a very successful and an entertaining way. The movie also got nominated for an Academy Award back in 1996 in the category of Best Film Editing. To be honest, I immediately noticed how detailed it actually was, how it made that flow even better scene after a scene. It makes the whole movie more immense and stirring, backed up by the great cinematography which gives the movie that dark edge it needs. The music's just gorgeous, building up the tension and making your heart beat very fast when there's these highly intensive scenes, giving the whole movie that final touch. It is composed by one of my favourite composers Howard Shore and to be honest the music is very much like Shore. I can't describe it more precisely, but if you're familiar with his work you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Starring Morgan Freeman as detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt as detective David Mills a thriller couldn't ask more from the lead actors. Both role performances are outstanding and both actors are very convenient in their roles. Morgan Freeman happens to be one of my favourite actors of all time and he's indeed one of those actors you just have to admire because to me the man hasn't done one single bad role performance in his career. Freeman is very convincing as detective Somerset, giving the character that Freeman -edge it needs, being wise and witty, a perfect mentor. I must admit that Brad Pitt also happens to be one of my favourite actors and as detective Mills he does a superb job, making the character what it's all about, the one with the looks, being fierce and serious. Both of the characters have this very realistic depth in them. To me Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were one of the best pair teams I've ever seen on the screen, they just compliment each other's performances so well it just almost makes me shed a tear.<br/><br/>""Se7en"" is all in all an amazing movie. Surely one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's intensive, immense, exciting, detailed and thrilling, just what all thrillers should be like. Everything seems to click in this film; Brilliant screenplay, directing close to excellence, great characters and even better role performances, intensive cinematography and music that just captures the whole essence of the thriller -genre. Despite the fact of it being somewhat brutal at parts it really doesn't matter in the end, it still isn't that tasteless over the top violence the horror -genre seems to have, so you shouldn't even worry about what I said about it. I'm not saying it's a movie suitable for children, I'm saying it's a movie where even the brutal and disturbing scenes are made with a good taste and a classy style. I'd give it a 9.5/10, but as that is impossible it has to satisfy with the more than deserved 9. All this gives you an absolutely guaranteed motion picture experience, it does it smoothly and it does it with style. A thriller among the best."
"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","17 May 2007"," One of the scariest, nastiest thrillers ever filmed - makes The Silence of the Lambs look like a children's movie!
","1991: Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs shocks the world, gets almost unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike, and wins five Oscars, proving serial killer flicks can be more than just a sub-category of the thriller/horror genre. 1995: David Fincher, still scarred by the mixed reactions to his first film, the underrated Alien 3, unleashes Se7en. The latter wins no Academy Awards, but people are so impressed/disgusted/terrified by the ferocity and bleakness of Fincher's vision it actually manages to make Demme's work seem rather tame. So uncompromising it is occasionally hard to watch, Se7en paints a disturbing portrait of madness no other film has been able to match.<br/><br/>Ironically, none of the gruesome murders in the film occur on screen: what we are shown is merely the aftermath, which is more than enough to upset the weak of stomach. It sure as hell upsets William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a police officer who is about to retire but has to solve this last, horrific case. Helping him with the investigation is the edgy David Mills (Brad Pitt), a young hothead who wants to put the killer behind bars and make sure he suffers as much as the victims (the killings are based on the seven capital sins). Unfortunately for them, this guy is not someone you catch that easily: John Doe (a name usually given to unidentified corpses) is a cold-blooded, calculating psychopath, and once he unveils his big project, nothing but pain can derive from it.<br/><br/>What distances Se7en from most Hollywood thrillers is the consistently dark, nerve-cracking mood: while the average shocker has some kind of redeeming trait in the end, Fincher decides to go all the way with his unflinching study of the human psyche, leaving no room for hope or salvation. As repulsive as they may look, Doe's murders are actually little more than the premise: the really bad stuff happens after-wards, and even the most skeptical viewers will probably gasp in horror as the film reaches its almost unbearably bleak conclusion (the kind of ending late-night pub discussions were created for).<br/><br/>The unsettling atmosphere is also due to the performances, Freeman's understated sadness being the ideal counterbalance to Pitt's brooding rage (a side the actor took to sublime levels in his other collaboration with Fincher, the splendid Fight Club). But it is Kevin Spacey (there's no use in not mentioning him, since by now everyone knows he is in the movie before they have even seen it) who truly leaves a mark, in the role that, alongside his Oscar-winning turn in The Usual Suspects, set the bar for every other villain to have been created since. He may not be on screen for much time, but then again, neither was Anthony Hopkins when he played Hannibal Lecter for the first time. The difference is, John Doe is so merciless and sadistic even Lecter would probably be afraid of running into him.<br/><br/>In the end, some people might not be able to watch this film; some might even refuse after reading a summary. But those able to stomach it will see not only a very cruel thriller, but also a compelling example of everything that's generally missing in Hollywood nowadays: film-making has seldom been so bold and fearless."
"lual","10","1","2","3 May 2007"," It stays with you
","Se7en is an excellent thriller. Sure, it might be a little bit over-stylized and the ending is not quite as logical as it seems to be at first, but none of that disturbs the experience of watching this film.<br/><br/>Every aspect of it is superb, the writing, the actors, the editing, the sound, the music, the direction.<br/><br/>I am not going to repeat the plot yet again.<br/><br/>I just want to point out what makes this film so special: It stays with you. After the first viewing, the images are burnt into your head, the ending leaves you drained and broken and you will think about it for days. Even though the effect wears off after repeated viewing, you can always remember the way you felt after your first experience with this movie. it is so strong that you can even remember it if someone just mentions its name. It is the kind of movie of which you never forget where you saw it first, who was with you and what it was like. I watched it in a cinema 13 years ago and can still remember the exact mood of that evening.<br/><br/>This, in my opinion, is the greatest accomplishment a film can achieve."
"matlefebvre20","9","1","2","27 April 2007"," Seven reasons why you should love ""Se7en""
","ONE: original and well-built story. Initially, ""Se7en"" is a story about two detectives who investigate on a peculiar serial killer. This murderer gets inspired of the seven deadly sins to choose his victims and their punishment. Just a reminder, the seven deadly sins are: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, lust, pride and envy. The summary is well enough to convince people about the originality of the story. Scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker builds a script that hooks and never exhausts itself during the full two hours that the movie lasts. The movie is full of surprises and plot twists and reaches its paroxysm at the very end with an astounding, exploding and almost-miraculous climax that has already become legendary and which reflects the atmosphere and the ideology of the story in an adequate way.<br/><br/>TWO: the main actors. ""Se7en"" also works because of its two main actors. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt both deliver extraordinary performances. Freeman is Detective Somerset, ready to take his retirement, while Pitt is Detective Mills, who has been hired to take on Somerset's job after the latter leaves the homicide section. The most striking aspect about both characters is the chemistry between them. Sometimes, we see that they like each other and sometimes, it appears that one of them is about to jump on the other one. Pitt is by far the best of both actors with his detective with a boiling and impatient attitude and with methods that are too radical to Somerset's taste. If there's another actor that deserves to be mentioned, it's Kevin Spacey who plays the mysterious killer. He can't prevent himself from saying that he acts for the good side and he pretends to be an example to follow. But he nevertheless remains a sadist and he's one of the most horrifying killers in cinema's history.<br/><br/>THREE: horrible images. For those who love horror movies, they will get well served with the pictures that they'll see. Even if none of the murders are portrayed on screen, the aftermath is horrible anyway, mainly because of the nauseating pictures shot by the crew of director David Fincher. In fact, the committed murders are so horrible that it's not even necessary to look at the corpses to feel repulsive sensations. The only thing that's needed, it's for somebody to tell the murders and the listener will certainly get grabbed by an impression of terror.<br/><br/>FOUR: the cinematography. Apart from its images of horrifying murders, ""Se7en"" also impresses by its general cinematography. The title sequence is catching and the sinister music that comes along sets the table for the general atmosphere of the film. The lighting belongs without a doubt to a modern-era film noir, putting emphasis on the darkness of the unknown metropolis shown in the movie.<br/><br/>FIVE: its vision of the world. ""Se7en"" isn't only a movie about a sordid murderer. It's also a movie having a pessimist vision of the world, where nobody is good, nobody is fine and everybody is bad. That's a vision which doesn't look like any other that was seen before in Hollywood. The only movie similar to ""Se7en"" that I've seen is ""Taxi Driver"". In the city that is shown, it's always raining, it's always dark and sinners move into the streets. Despite the fact that Spacey is a sadistic and insane killer, the fact remains that he's the most philosophical character of the lot and he wants to get sure that the viewers don't leave the theater with a smile upon their faces. And it's precisely the movie's objective. And even if the killers gets himself killed at the end of the movie, Fincher manages to make it look like it's not an happy ending. This pessimism is also present in ""Fight Club"", which is better than ""Se7en"", but not by far.<br/><br/>SIX: its description of police work. ""Se7en"" is also remarkable for its accurate description of the police world, more specifically the homicidal section. Pitt and Freeman, as well as their colleagues, look like real police officers and not actors. We really could feel that we're in a real investigation instead of a fictitious story. We visit many places and we assist to the use of sophisticated techniques. <br/><br/>SE7EN: redemption for David Fincher. Overall, ""Se7en"" is a powerful movie that charges like a locomotive and it wants to be sure that the viewers don't leave it unscathed. It really is one of the most striking thrillers of the 90s and it's a great example that Hollywood isn't necessarily synonymous of censure and respite. It's also a redemption for David Fincher who was only known at the time for the disappointing ""Alien ¬≥"". From now on, Fincher could show that he was an exceptional filmmaker and he kept going with other masterpieces, such as ""Fight Club"", ""Panic Room"" and ""Zodiac""."

"grezza_2004","10","1","2","8 April 2007"," Se7en will never be silenced
","I think it is unusual that while the other great film of this kind of style, The Silence of the Lambs, won the main 5 Oscars, Se7en received only 1 nomination and no wins. While Silence of the Lambs is obviously a great film and is more thrilling than Se7en, I just find Se7en so much more interesting. Enough comparison, heres why I think Se7en is one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>David Fincher doesn't show you any of the bizarre killings during the film, instead showing viewers the crime scenes and photographs. This gets you really involved in the film, as you form your own gritty mental images of what has happened. The script is fantastic, the murders are bizarre yet ingenious. The killer is a fascinating character. Kevin Spacey asked not to be credited for his role, as he thought people would not be concentrating on the film properly and waiting for him to appear. His performance, although relatively brief, is every bit as good as Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The setting David Fincher has used for his unnamed metropolis is excellent, using shadows, dark lighting and narrow alleys to create a dark and dingy place where evil lurks, the perfect setting for this storyline to unfold.<br/><br/>The twist ending is fantastic. Along with Fincher's other masterpiece Fight Club, the twist gives it an extra edge and makes the film better. Se7en is by no means a horror film, but the gruesome visuals and especially the ending make it actually scarier than most horror films.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend your first viewing of Se7en to be 2am in the morning like mine, but any other time I would recommend it as strongly as any other film. 10/10"

An excellent peace of acting from both main characters (Freeman and Pitt). So different as to what sort of roles Brad Pitt usually takes on. A classic usual weird and strange vibe from Mr Spacey as well. The way that the pot really does make sense in its bizard way. I would not change anything in this film at all."

","Seven is about two detectives, one old school, and one new school, who are placed on a homicide case together. Things start to get very strange as the killer turns into a serial killer with a definite pattern. After the inevitable whining between the new partners, they start to actually do some good work together. The murder themes are the seven deadly sins and each murder is executed according to one of the sins. Some good special effects and really disgusting scenes make this film not one for the kids. I've watched this film several times because each time you pick up more visual effects. They finally capture the calm and cool killer who plays on the younger detectives frailties very well pushing all his buttons while the old guy tries to keep things from escalating. The twist at the end is well worth the rest of the film. If you don't like sick and disgusting mutilations, stay away from this film."
"Torgo_Approves","10","1","2","28 December 2006"," The world is a scary place.
","With this movie and 1999's ""Fight Club"", David Fincher cemented his status as *the* most visually creative director of the 90's, and one of the most original, inventive and compelling storytellers working in Hollywood. If ""Fight Club"" was the ultimate theme park ride for repressed white collar slaves, ""Se7en"" is the haunted house. While not a horror movie per say, it is infinitely more frightening, emotionally scarring and disturbing than anything that George A. Romero, Dario Argento or Hideo Nakata could possibly offer.<br/><br/>From its first frame, ""Se7en"" sets its tone with Fincher's bleak visuals, moody weather and Howard Shore's slow, atmospheric music (you won't believe this is the guy who would go on to make the unforgettable Lord of the Rings score). It's a visual masterpiece, throwing you into an anonymous, dark city which seems to be the Nirvana of the dregs of society. In the middle of the city's violent everyday chaos an invisible John Doe has set a horrible plot in motion, his goal to punish seven unrelated people for their crimes, turning their own sins against them (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy, and Wrath). Working methodically, patiently and intelligently, Doe builds at his murder masterwork, piece by piece, slowly drawing police detectives Somerset and Mills into the web. Somerset (played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman whom I usually detest) is the hardened, cynical veteran who's about to retire, Mills (Brad Pitt, exceptionally good) is the rookie who's troubled by his own naive personality and hot temper. The ""unlikely partners"" thing might sound clich√©d by now, but trust me, you won't even notice. <br/><br/>What makes the movie so compelling are the fantastic performances from a diverse cast, an utterly unpredictable, frighteningly sadistic plot, intelligent scriptwriting by Andrew Kevin Walker, and David Fincher's superb direction, which is unlike anything you've seen before. Fincher shows an uncanny ability to keep the viewers at the edge of their seats, creating, through the use of visuals and music alone, an angsty, forceful sense of unease which lasts until the film's shocking climax. Anyone who thought Brad Pitt was all good looks and no talent will have to take it back after seeing him convince beautifully as Mills, and Freeman's character is, for once, not the sugar-sweet know-it-all he's typecast himself as. Gwyneth Paltrow is also good as Mills' wife. But it is John Doe who leaves the lasting impression - the uncredited actor (whose name I won't mention, in tradition with the movie) gives a monotonous yet completely spellbinding performance and you find yourself understanding and sympathizing with his motives far more than you'd want to admit. <br/><br/>Se7en is grisly, sick and depressing, although most of the horrific violence is only implied, never shown. However, the aftermath of the murders - especially the revoltingly sadistic Sloth - is often enough to make you lose your lunch. This is a feel-bad movie and it's proud of it. You cannot watch it expecting another ho-hum, by-the-numbers thriller in the vein of, say, ""The Sentinel"". ""Se7en"" is depressing, frightening, shocking, fascinating, original, and it features enough talent acting-, direction- and script-wise to fill a hundred Sentinels or Domestic Disturbances. Bring some friends with strong stomaches and watch it - if you dare. But make sure you'll be able to sleep with the lights on."

","This very good film is about Detective David Mills, a new detective, and and his partner, Detective Lt. William Somerset, who is about to retire, working on a case of a serial killer using the seven deadly sins for his motive.<br/><br/>The first person to die is a person with the sin, gluttony. The aftermath of the ""kill"" is very disturbing. That's basically the word that would describe all the other kills in this film. This film is a very good thriller. In fact, it's one of the best films ever.<br/><br/>Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman gives great performances, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, played by the killer, although he shows up almost through the last half of the film.<br/><br/>Just like Saw, the killer wants to punish those who are bad. For once, we have a killer we agree to, or at least I do. Like many thrillers, this film has this great ending. This is a smart thriller. There's not a lot of action. It's just your usual detective story.<br/><br/>If you like a very smart thriller that will make you think, without making you look stupid, with great performances, this movie will do."

","Okay, maybe I'm giving this a 7 because I saw ""Fight Club"" before ""Se7en"". And maybe also because I'm not so keen on thrillers.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked watching it. The characters are cool, the plot is tight and sharp and it sure has its moments. Hell, it made me read Milton and Dante.<br/><br/>But what shall I say...it's simply not as big and cool as ""Fight Club"" is. Okay, it doesn't want and it doesn't need to be that. But if you wanna top up the content of a thriller with some critic on the society, it's just natural to be compared with ""Fight Club"". And this battle has a clear winner.<br/><br/>Others than that, the movie has a beautiful cast, leaded by two of the best actors of all time, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey.

","Se7en is one of my all time favourite films. You cannot fail to be completely drawn in by the thrilling story of two cops on the trail of a sadistic murderer using the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, but Brad Pitt also shows his strengths rather than just being a pretty face! Director David Fincher unleashes a horrible reality of a dangerous - but also clever - serial killer, who doesn't care if he is caught or not.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is watchable as David Mills' (Pitt) wife, but the real star of the show is Kevin Spacey as John Doe. He portrays this part superbly delivering such depth into the character you can actually see into his terrifying and gruesome world.<br/><br/>A final nail in the coffin brings with it a great ending, which sends even more shivers down the spine of those who have witnessed this truly exceptional and groundbreaking film. Terrific."
"hawkeyepierce3191","8","1","2","19 November 2006"," Se7en's distinctive dark style and killer premise make it worthwhile despite some glaring problems.
","Se7en is so interesting in a number of ways and for a number of reasons. The first is simply that murder stories have an interesting, visceral appeal which Se7en is able to put to use. To compound the powerful drawing force of murder mysteries, Se7en has easily one of the most interesting concepts in the history of murder mysteries, as the killer bases his murders on Dante's Seven Deadly Sins. Each new murder proves to be an interesting twist, since new details about the case as a whole are revealed, and since there's no telling in what gruesome fashion the murder will have been carried out. Indeed, the murders of Se7en are symbolic yet extremely grisly, meaning that the movie will both capture your attention and take a part of it for good.<br/><br/>The movie is also given excellent performances by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Costner. In the type of performance that by now seemed attuned to his abilities, Freeman plays a muted, wizened character who has seen his share of crap in the world. Costner also gives an excellent performance, both in how he plays quieter parts well, and how he fills the shoes of a serial killer perfectly. The best villains are the ones who truly believe they are doing the right thing. Easily the most chilling scene of the movie is the scene where Costner explains his side of the story. As Freeman's character describes, the killings are his ""sermons"" to the world, his teachings to a world with a skewed perception of morality.<br/><br/>""Fight Club"" director David Fincher brings his gritty, dark sense of style to Se7en by filling the spaces with shadows and quiet, creepy music. It becomes clear almost immediately that this unnamed city is a place to hate--a dirty place full of prostitutes, beggars, and psychos, a city that shares none of the glamour of the darkened ""Sin City."" As the movie progresses, more and more you get the feeling that it's getting darker, and that everything is spiraling out of control.<br/><br/>That said, the movie has several very distinct weaknesses which easily make it harder to watch, and harder to enjoy in principle. The gaping hole in Se7en is named Brad Pitt--while clearly his character is meant as Freeman's foil--an impatient, aggressive rookie--he ends up being frustrating and obnoxious throughout the movie. There is an immediate attraction to Freeman's character, and so with the introduction and development of Pitt's character, Mills, you end up liking him less and less. The vast majority of the profanity is used by Pitt, and it is not used in an effective manner at all. Furthermore, Mills does not have one interesting bone in his body, and Pitt's acting skills are MIA for the duration. Pitt is obviously more attuned to unique roles, such as Tyler Durden, and not roles requiring a typical type of acting.<br/><br/>The ending, while interesting and definitely worthwhile in concept--and on the script--is dumbed down quite a bit by the anti-climatic pacing and Pitt's aforementioned shortcomings. But when you can ignore Pitt as much as possible, and when Spacey's character is introduced, Se7en proves itself to be one of the most interesting concepts in a long time that is, for the most part, cashed in on."
"Jonny_Numb","9","1","2","16 November 2006"," Could very well be the best serial-killer film ever made
","Some cinephiles give praise at the altar of Hitchock; others worship Kubrick or Scorsese. Personally, I'm a David Fincher fan, and see him picking up where they left off. Easily one of the most distinctive and talented young directors to come out of the 1990s, he still remains something of a 'cult' filmmaker, in spite of the $100-million box office take of ""Seven,"" possibly the best, most intelligent serial-killer thriller ever unleashed on unassuming film patrons.<br/><br/>What Fincher pulls off--and pulls off brilliantly--is a straight-faced, serious approach to a concept that could have easily devolved into camp or slasher-flick excess. On initial glance, the notion of a serial killer who picks his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins seems like the type of tongue-in-cheek fodder for a low-budget '70s or '80s exploitation item; even the tag line (""Seven Deadly Sins--Seven Ways to Die"") sets the tone for a straightforward, mainstream thriller.<br/><br/>What a surprise, then, that ""Seven"" is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind (""The Silence of the Lambs"" follows close behind). Even more surprising is how the film stormed into the public imagination after ""Alien3"" (1992), Fincher's sour--and quickly forgotten--directorial debut. I hadn't seen a former music-video director operate with such authority in the realm of mainstream cinema (and, come to think of it, I haven't seen one since). Nor have I seen a director take as many commercially-averse risks within such a short career--""Fight Club"" (1999), despite a short theatrical run and polarized reviews, has become to young-adults of today what ""Easy Rider"" was to the Flower Children in '69.<br/><br/>Granted, the amount of respect I've given ""Seven"" has fluctuated over the years, and it seems that only now do I see it as being a near-flawless masterpiece. At 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--I couldn't latch on to Morgan Freeman's dialog, and found Brad Pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with Fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-Hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer R. Lee Ermey in a small yet serious role?). While Brad Pitt's performance might inspire hoots of derision from some, he is actually pitch-perfect as the young, idealistic Detective Mills--this isn't Brad mugging the camera with his good looks for 2 hours; on the contrary, his counterpoint to Morgan Freeman's worldly, jaded, and cynical Somerset makes the movie. And once the killer is captured, these 3 characters share an entrancing conversation within the confines of an unmarked police car; sure, we get to hear the killer's explanation for his crimes, but it is in the tones and reactions to what is said that the sequence conveys a disturbingly chilling power. (It may seem moot at this juncture, but I will say nothing of the killer's identity, save that it was a choice casting decision that paid off wonderfully.) Even Gwyneth Paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as Mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with Morgan Freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of Hollywood Happy Endings.<br/><br/>Which brings me to one of the most surprising--and refreshing--aspects of ""Seven"": the way in which it relentlessly plays against audience expectation. Like the murderer's motive, this is not a film of happy endings but lessons learned (in the harshest way possible). To those who have seen the film--love it or hate it, that incredibly subtle yet wholly grisly final scene is unforgettable, and truly shows that, contrary to current horror trends, ""less is more"" (notice that all but one murder happens off-screen).<br/><br/>While I could gush at even further length about ""Seven,"" I think I've made my fanfare more than clear. It's an introspective, compelling film that manages to mine terror and pathos from those daily transgressions we all view as ""common."" And it established David Fincher as a director of great (and continued) promise. Kudos."
"coolfasho-1","Null","1","2","4 November 2006"," Se7en manifests itself as a masterpiece in every aspect.
","A succession of atrocities are perpetuated by a sacrosanct and ingenious yet lethal antagonist. These atrocities are associated with the seven sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, wrath, greed and sloth. By illustrating a stunning depiction of the seven sins in virulent, grotesque and disturbing scenes the serial murderer (Kevin Spacey) expounds his actions as a trivial facilitation towards the cleanliness of an already corrupted and evil society. <br/><br/>Intent on pursuing justice and alleviating their own curiosities, Detective Lt. William Somerset (who at first stipulates his leave after 20 years in the force) and David Mills (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt)are presented with an array of misguided and inconclusive pieces, amalgamated by the killer himself. As the clues build further and further, Detective Lt. Somerset sustains a consistent methodical approach (although periodically vagued by a contradicting whim to retire) to the deciphering of these enigmas, but the impetuous David Mills aspires for instantaneous results. Finally, when both have practically given up hope for lost, the unexpected occurs, and an alarming twist of events which keeps the viewers on their seats unfold."
"maryandkidsathome","10","1","2","16 October 2006"," Se7en is a modern cinema classic
","Detectives Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are investigating the death of a morbidly obese man and after the autopsy realize that it was a homicide. A few days later another man is found murdered in his office building with the word greed written on the carpet in his own blood. On to something, Somerset goes back to the home of the first victim and finds the word gluttony written on a wall behind a refrigerator. He and Mills go to their boss and tell him that whoever is committing these murderers is using his victims as representations of the seven deadly sins and must stop him before he finishes his plan.<br/><br/>Se7en is one of the greatest films made in the last 15 years. It is the only film to successfully mix Film Noir and Horror. The characters are completely developed and the hellish decaying atmosphere is perfect for the film. this is so original and innovative that you never know what could happen next.<br/><br/>Se7en is David Fincher's best film he as (and probably will ever) made so far. He does a perfect job capturing the horror and gruesomeness of the murders being committed and the two detectives struggle to solve the murders and also the decaying enviorment which the film is set. John Doe (kevin Spacey) has now become one of the most sadistic killers in cinema history despite the fact that we never see him kill anyone. He is played terrificly by Kevin Spacey although he does not appear until the last half hour of the film. <br/><br/>Another thing that makes this movie so great is it's unhappy ending. John Doe leads Somerset and Mills out to a trailer where a U.P.S. man delivers a package. Somerset opens the box and sees the severed head of Mills's wife (gweneth Paltrow) inside. Mills then kills Jhon Doe and is arrested. There is no other film that could ever compare to Se7en.

"angelofvic","5","1","2","14 July 2006"," Somewhat flawed, but intriguingly disturbing movie if suspense is your genre.
","Disclaimer: I saw this on television; and while there was no written indication that the movie was cut, due to the 2-hour (including commercials) format of movies aired on television, up to 1/4 of this movie may have been cut, which may have colored my opinion of it.<br/><br/>This movie shows major flaws in directing, acting, casting, and plot. In the end, to me only the incomparable Morgan Freeman held it together, plus the dramatic ending gives it a lasting place in one's memory. The whole, however, is riddled with flaws -- from, for example, the silly over-dramatic cinematographic effects (lights flickering on objects just because the director thinks that's cool, and dozens of other annoying and distracting visual fancies), to the heavy-handed extremely over-dramatic and loud music (when all that's happening is that a rather routine crime scene is being investigated). This is the sign of either a poor filmmaker or a thin plot; in this case, it was both.<br/><br/>The actors aren't all up to par either. Brad Pitt is off -- just out of his early sex-god roles in Thelma and Louise, A River Runs Through It, and Legends of the Fall, he hasn't quite entirely got his acting legs to play a serious cop role yet, and although he does fine for the most part, there are several ""off"" moments which spoil the flow and realism of the movie. His inconsistency is distracting. Paltrow has not quite got her chops yet either, and this is still the infancy of her career. And Kevin Spacey seems greatly miscast -- Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) he is not. I kept seeing K-Pax or any number of other cherubic-cheeked sweet-guy Spacey roles in this performance, not a serial killer. Plus they used a very skinny, nimble, athletic stunt double (who did not look at all like the very stolid, round-cheeked Spacey) to play John Doe up till the time he is captured and we see his face, which compounds the feeling that Spacey is grossly miscast. (If that wasn't a stunt double, then the character was portrayed in two personas too widely different to be totally believable.)<br/><br/>But then again, Morgan Freeman is a Rock of Gibraltar and can save any movie, even one with as many plot flaws, film-making flaws, acting flaws, and casting flaws as this one. Although I found this movie to be a disappointment (Silence of the Lambs it most definitely was not), in the end it was worth seeing because of Freeman and because of the intriguing ending.<br/><br/>I'd say, if thrillers/suspense (especially disturbing ones) is your genre, by all means watch Seven; if not, you may want to view something else instead."

","Morgan Freeman makes this movie a standout. What a classy guy. A great movie, well written and it shows in this movie. I plan on buying this on a CD so I can listen to the book and see if it follows the movie. When I first saw this movie, I was prepared to just see another crime/mystery, but as you get into the movie, you see it is more than that. Morgan does his best to not like his new young partner. He also wanted this new, young partner to know he could not count on him being around for long as he was getting ready to retire and just wanted his days to be nice and quiet. The new partner did teach Morgan that young, upcoming detectives can and does become a very good cover your butt type of detective. I especially liked the part about Brad's wife making a point of meeting Morgan, she went out of her way to do that."

","If it weren't for Grand Guignol and Italian Giallo there wouldn't be a Jonathan Harris or a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. If SILENCE OP THE LAMBS had not reached the theaters, there would be no SE7EN. SE7EN in itself is a step-up from its predecessor in art-directed crime thrillers that seems to not only present the madness within society as much as thrive in its murky waters.<br/><br/>David Fincher, a man not known for making light comedies and feel-good stories about life and love and hope plunges his viewers into this sick world which at times seems on the verge of being eaten up whole by the God of the Underworld. It's a place we could call home, but is not inviting in the least. And worse -- there is a serial killer on the loose. One of those monsters engendered by the city's own lapses into dehumanization, who have a penchant with toying with his persecutors because of the power this game grants him by default.<br/><br/>We've seen or heard about his type before. Jeffrey Dahmer. The Zodiac Killer. Son of Sam. Ted Bundy. John Wayne Gacy. The Green River Killer. And of course Jack the Ripper, purportedly identified as Walter Sickert by Patricia Cornwell's exhaustive investigation. More in the latter's mode of killing but taking his murders into the realm of the bizarre, the John Doe who detectives Somerset and Mills are trying to catch is one of a kind. One who writes extensive passages which say a lot, but inform rather little. One who reveals himself to be uber-intelligent, almost pleasant, but twisted to the point of no return. One who commits seven of the most unnatural acts against any human being. We recoil because we never see them happening. Only the remains of systematic torture.<br/><br/>There is precious little to know about John Doe and maybe this is the point David Fincher wants to establish. Despite his extensive notebooks, or his rationalization as to why these murders needed to occur there is little behind the soft-spoken man with the fey eyes -- and this makes him evil in an old-soul kind of way. All it takes is one look to know this is something that has been with him for years. All it needed was a progressive birth/abortion to see the light.<br/><br/>Fincher is a master of mood, of dread. His previous film was ALIEN 3 which aside from its stand-alone nature from the rest of the franchise and conscious cruelty had excellent lighting, the darkest of sets and a feeling of overwhelming trepidation. It was an express elevator ride to hell. SE7EN is, while more colorful, even bleaker. Fincher's New York is an inferno of rain and emptiness closer to the 60s and 70s. Despair dominates the movie all throughout: there is no escape. Had this film been made in the 40s it would have out-done the best of film-noirs. His quadrangle of leads could not be better: Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills has several small scenes that indicate all is not well with her marriage to Det. Mills (Brad Pitt) who due to his commitment to his job has become estranged to her. Kevin Spacey plays John Doe like a man you would open up to, which proves to be the Mills' fatal mistake. It's up to Somerset, played delicately by Morgan Freeman, to bring some closure into a film that otherwise would sink under the pressure coming from its depravity."

","Se7en really raises the bar on the cop and serial killer movies. And it is not like any other movies from it's genre.

The atmospheric look of this movie is outstanding. Hallways always have this dark unsettling blackish tone and non-stop pouring rain occupies the outside world.<br/><br/>I think Brad Pitt gives his best performance up to date in this movie. His not caring acting style really fits the character of the rookie Detective Mills. But it is Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who display the best acting in this movie. Their characters have depth like very few movie characters have. Morgan Freeman with his dynamic, brooding acting style brilliantly portrays the intelligent, cynical Detective Somerset. And the range of Kevin Spacey 's acting gives his character, the serial killer John Doe, an extra dimension of depth.<br/><br/>Detective Somerset knows the rules of his profession. And he tries to warn the rookie Detective Mills from the dangers involved in it. But Mills is too busy proving himself on his new position as a detective, he doesn't really care for the advice. And as the numbers of the murder victims grow Detective Somerset, who wanted to retire, changes his mind and stays with the case to warn and help Mills. Somerset tries his best to educate Mills on the subject of serial killers, he gives him books to read on the case and tries to give him moral advice too. But in the end John Doe, the serial killer, is the one who educates them both on the subject of morality ¬Ö screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker gives this movie one of the most tragic endings I have ever seen on movie.<br/><br/>Must see movie"
"UblaGoo","10","1","2","19 January 2006"," A masterpiece!
","Se7en is an amazing movie in so many ways. It is, in fact, my favorite movie, and here is why:<br/><br/>To me, the story and themes in Se7en are incredibly interesting and well thought out. It is not so much the murderer, the killings, and the police work that matter, it's what lies beyond these. The movie deals with the fundamental ways with which we look at life. This is demonstrated best by the diametrically opposite views of detectives Mills and Somerset, respectively, but also the views of the killer, in contrast to their views. Apathy is the key word here, while Choice is another important factor, which is intrinsically connected to Apathy. Apart from this, the story is masterfully told; it does not rush anything. It takes its time to make the points it needs, which are plenty, without seeming to add any superfluous elements. <br/><br/>The technical aspects are pure genius. Not only is everything executed flawlessly, but put together it all has a certain synergy that makes it all seem, well, better than perfect, really. The cinematography is excellent. Many of the camera angles are different, but not weird or artsy just for the sake of being either of those. The visuals have a sharp purity to them, and are incredibly clean. So clean, in fact, that you can see the dirt and dust in the air at times (particularly in the Gluttony crime scene.) Many scenes are somewhat dark and gray, for instance all the rain, but it is shown so artfully, which makes them incredibly interesting instead of just depressing. This depressing motif is highly fitting to the themes the movie deals with, though, so it is not at all out of place or misused, in order to try to just seem artsy or dark. <br/><br/>The sound and music is not just good, but so fitting and so well done that it actually enhances the experience of the movie, something I feel sound and music are supposed to do in movies ¬ñ and not just in the simple and cheap way tension music does it in so many thrilled and horror movies. Both the sound and music go in and interact with the visuals (or the other way around) on just about all situations in the movie. Like the very first scene, where we see Somerset in his kitchen, where the ambient sound actually goes in and gives us audio clues to the surroundings and situation. Or the legendary (often since copied, never outdone or equaled) intro title sequence, where the titles and the gritty, almost evil visuals move and shake in sync with the industrial grinding of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". A scene standing in stark contrast with that one, but no less interesting, is the Library scene, with Bach playing in the back (until it slowly moves into the front). It is an incredibly aesthetically pleasing scene, almost like a fully fitting music video for one of the most soothing pieces of classical music around. <br/><br/>There are many other scenes that merit at least a page each of praise on the audio and visual aspects, like the Lust scene, the Interrogation scene, the Chase scene and the scenes from the movie's finale, but there is simply not room for it here.<br/><br/>The acting is also dead on. It is just so fitting that it becomes great. Freeman has an aura of experience and intelligence over him, but also a strong sense of having given up and resignation that often shows, as the character is supposed to be portrayed. Pitt might not have gotten equally appreciated with his effort, but living up to Freeman is no easy task. I feel Pitt, with his impatience and visible energy, does an incredible job, playing the diametric opposite to Somerset, which in my mind is the exact way that character is supposed to be portrayed, as well. <br/><br/>The movie, I feel, leaves you stunned. It gets the point across better than any movie I have seen, not just by cheap shock effects, but by a deep, disturbing rumbling that culminates in terrible realization. It does indeed get your attention by hitting you with a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>As a final note, I would like to mention that the amount of gore and violence seen in the movie is not great. Strangely, many people seem to think so. They claim the movie was too harsh and violent, but when you confront them with this, it turns out they only got this impression, but didn't actually see anything. This, I feel, is a testament towards the skill with which the director so expertly implies these things, instead of going for cheap, visual thrills and shock effects by actually showing all the gore. <br/><br/>And that is why Se7en is my favorite movie."

","This thriller, that doesn't really thrill, is more interesting as a character study and a dark expression of the 20th Century. The films story is set over 7 days in New York where Detective David Mills, (Brad Pitt), has just transferred, he is partnered with Detective William Somerset, (Morgan Freeman). Over the course of a week a series of murders occur based on the seven deadly sins; Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. The two detectives hunt the killer down like prey only to discover that they themselves are the prey.<br/><br/>Genius is not a word that I use lightly but it is an adequate description of Seven. The whole film reeks of class and intelligence with this quality exuding from its two main characters. Although polar opposites Mills and Somerset provide an interesting combination with Mills' impatient and impulsive mannerism's opposing Somerset's more thoughtful and calculated actions. This pattern is used most subtly with the films sound as Mills is always make some kind of noise whether tapping a pen or talking inanely he clutters the silence that Somerset appreciates so much."

The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where goodness and mercy have surrendered to human apathy, allowing a killer to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme overwhelms the central characters. Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good. The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for director David Fincher (following the misguided ALIEN¬≥), this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs."

","Seven was magnificent. I can't believe I didn't know of it until now. My husband claims he didn't tell me about it because he wants to protect me from ""bad things"", which is very sweet, but I am so particular about movies that even something like a badly done ""romance"" or ""comedy"" will upset me and lets not even talk about annoying ""kiddie"" movies. I am rarely motivated to post a review of a movie: I will only do so if a movie is exceptionally good, or (I won't waste time on just an okay or mediocre or bad movie: those kinds of movies are the norm) if I have been lead to believe a movie would be good due to, say, excellent prequels and I ended up inexcusably let down by it.<br/><br/>Seven delivers. I don't know how else to sum it up. I have read the more recent comments of others and I am pleased to see quite a few of you know what your talking about. The effects: the lighting, the sound, music, the way the scenes and story was set up: pretty much everything is executed perfectly. And because of this the actors are able to exhibit their talents to the fullest of their capability.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman has this way of saying things in such a believable way: he's a wonderful actor. Brad Pitt is extremely convincing and the supporting cast is the icing on the cake as far as acting goes in this movie. Everyone worked well together to make this movie great hence lots of credit needs to go to the writers, editors, visual effects, sound effects, soundtrack and overall vision of the Director (and I'm sure there's more I've left out).<br/><br/>To the person who criticized ""Saw"" for copying Seven: I had the displeasure of seeing Saw before I even knew of this movie and I thought to myself at the time: they could have done soooo much better with this. And you are completely correct. Saw isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is quite bad, and maybe something for one to see if one can obtain humor from bad acting (I like Danny Glover, but unfortunately the movie was bad. And Cary Elwes was over the top in the overacting department). See Saw everyone, if you're in the mood for somethin' a little freaky, and aren't in the mood to take a movie too seriously.<br/><br/>Seven seems real. It's fiction but... believable. And it is tastefully done, for being a movie about about killing, death, and dark things. People get disturbed for varying reasons of their own. Silence of the Lambs (again to the person who was writing about Saw copying Seven) is excellent, but I don't watch it too often because I get too disturbed by it. Seven is a little different because the movie sets it up so that at least in my opinion, there is less of a sympathy factor for some of the victims-SOME, I stress. I can't go into further detail without risking spoiling the movie for anyone else who might be reading this but those who have seen the movie, maybe you'll know what I mean. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie for those who want to see a dark, disturbing...profound and meaningful thriller."

","The film ""Se7en"", directed by David Fincher (Fight Club), is a stylish thriller that pulls out all the stops to catch the audiences attention. The wily veteran detective, William Somerset, is played excellently by Morgan Freeman. He brings up the younger detective, David Mills, surprisingly well played by Brad Pitt, who is not known for his role in dramatic films. Later on, Pitt will work with Fincher in Fight Club,but that is a different story. The two detectives are chasing a serial killer who is committing murders according to the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Wrath, Envy, Pride, Lust, Greed, and Sloth). The deaths and murders in this film are not too extreme, but they get the point across. The plot and storyline is well planned and thought out. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife. This is Paltrow in a smaller role and she plays it well. But lets not forget how the title of my summary comes about. The killer,named appropriately John Doe, is played maniacally by Kevin Spacey, a sick and twisted Kevin Spacey who's in fine form after The Usual Suspects and before American Beauty, both of which he won Academy Awards for. Fincher shoots this movie flawlessly; the camera-work is excellent, cinematography is good. And the ending is one that is a predecessor for films such as Saw and The Bone Collector. 9/10"
"rchrdshelt","10","1","2","9 October 2004"," My new favourite film of all time
","I saw this film about 5 years ago when I was about 12 and never appreciated it because I had trouble understanding it. I realized that I wasn't really listening to everyhting that was being said. I saw it recently and absolutely loved it. I love suspense thrillers that aren't too complicated and perfectly paced. I wasn't a huge fan of Silence Of The Lambs although it is a good film. The same applied with The Bone Collector, which I thought was well paced but had a pathetic ending with a stupid motive.<br/><br/>This movie however is completely flawless. It has great Acting, Directing, Writing, Editing and Photography. I won't delve into the plot as I'm sure you know it. This movie never gets boring at all, every scene is interesting and I think the script is one of the best ever written. I am now a huge fan of Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher. Morgan Freeman's performance just about stole it for me, although Pitt and the supporting cast, and the killer especially, were very good (I'm sure you all know who it is but I won't reveal who it is so not to spoil it for anyone.)<br/><br/>This movie is not particularly violent to be honest, it just shows some very graphic bodies afterwards but nothing that is unbearable. The last 30 minutes are what really did it for me as far as suspense and surprise goes. It is quite possibly the best ever twist i've seen in a movie and it works perfectly. Everything that is said in the build up to it by the killer comes true. It is so well-paced and done so it doesn't give anything anyway and you'll be glued to the screen, like I was throughout it. The most important thing about this movie is to watch it when you don't have to leave the room or forget about what has gone on previously. You must listen very carefully to it in order to fully understand and appreciate it. When I saw it 5 years ago I didn't appreciate it enough because I wasn't doing this.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best murder-mystery/serial killer movie ever made. it definitely deserves to be in the top 100 movies on IMDb and should be a lower number than 54. it should be in the top 10 in my opinion. I keep changing my mind about my favourite film so sorry about that! Anyway, It has everything needed to be perfect as explained above. Go and see this film if you adore your mystery's or perhaps any type of movie. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>A definite 10/10"
"MrBiddle","Null","1","2","6 October 2004"," It's hard to comprehend. But no one can deny it.
","Directed by David Fincher.<br/><br/>If this film had a clear-cut protagonist, I'd say it would have to be Somerset. The characters come to the surface as Mills (Pitt) is paired with Somerset (Freeman), Mills being an overconfident, cocky Detective and Somerset being the more laid back, methodical and wise.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely as Tracy Mills, who hides her being pregnant to her husband but seeks advice from Somerset. What's interesting is to see how vile ""the city"" was portrayed in SE7EN. Somerset quits because he can't take it anymore. Paltrow doesn't want it here, but she couldn't tell David to have them go back home because she doesn't want to be a burden. It is the perfect symettry of the underlying theme of <i>sin</i>, and how the killer uses capital punishment and how he uses his work to preach.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie and haven't been spoiled, mind you there is almost nothing that is gonna prepare you for it. The ending is not for the squeamish... Fincher portrays the final scenes with ominous nuance and beautifully photographs them. Wonderful early-morning scenery in that deserted setting.<br/><br/>Fincher, as a former music video director uses his technical expertise on cinematography, editing and he does it very well, as every shot of this movie is brilliantly crafted and edited in. That low-angle ""worms eye view"" shot of Doe pointing his gun on Mills's head. The temporal snippet of the shot of the slide of Mills's pistol snapping back as he fires it in the final scenes, the taut editing of Mills kicking the door to Doe's apartment. Reminds me of Forest Whitaker opening the safe in PANIC ROOM, right when he pulls it open, the movie cuts RIGHT INTO the safe. And many other beautiful shots in this movie...<br/><br/>This is NOT a feel-good movie, so if those kinds of movies are your bread and butter, you might want to pass on this one. But then again this movie is too great of a film for you to even miss.<br/><br/>I said Somerset is the protag of this movie. He is. You'll see his arc during his VO, the last line said in the film.<br/><br/>You may find the ending of SE7EN hard to comprehend, but it is something you will remember and can not ever deny.<br/><br/>Grade A+"

","Very good thriller, in spite of Gwyneth Paltrow's involvement.<br/><br/>I generally detest Gwyneth Paltrow in everything she's done. I can't abide her presence and it is my personal opinion that she suffers from a total lack of talent. However, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt pull this one completely out of the wastebasket, dusts it off, and sets it back on the shelf.<br/><br/>The story is very telling, the performances are completely professional, the set designs are inspired, and the whole production is darkly and eerily executed.<br/><br/>You can, however, see Mr. Pitt's character from 12 Monkeys in his character in this movie, as they were filmed very close to one another.<br/><br/>You can see some of the schizophrenic mannerisms exhibited here, which in no way draws from the character, nor does it draw from the finished product. I found it rather endearing, in fact, as I enjoyed 12 Monkeys very much.<br/><br/>Freeman and Pitt work together quite well, after a slow and faltering acceptance of one another, to lead you down the road which takes you into the dark and noisome mind of a killer.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad movie. I'm very grateful that Ms. Paltrow's part was small and almost inconsequential.<br/><br/>I've just one question, though. What is with the fascination with Christian legend, of late? There are thousands of ancient civilizations out there which worshiped thousands of gods/goddesses.<br/><br/>What is with this Christian obsession? While this is an original screenplay, with creative and unique elements, due to its Christian elements, it gets thrown right in with about a hundred other movies of this type.<br/><br/>It rates a 8.1/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Eerie, atmospheric and particularly gruesome crime drama, understandably rate R. The constant analogies between this movie and ""SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,"" should be spared. The differences outweigh the similarities.<br/><br/>The disturbing premise is about a homicidal lunatic killing people he feels that are violating the proverbial seven deadly sins (Sloth, Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Envy, Gluttony and Anger, for those like myself, who occasionally dozed through Catechism). <br/><br/>The picture starts in a low whir and builds intensity, with applied layers. The tempo throughout is gloomy, dark and pervasive, and frankly, it works well for the film. The script is full of loop-de-loop twists and is explicit. It doesn't bore and doesn't skim, which is a credit to the screenwriters. Effectively, you won't feel your IQ has been undervalued. The performances are well above average.<br/><br/>The major problem with SEVEN is the tepid ending. For the final scenes, you'll have to stretch your suspension of belief from here to Moscow and back. I simply just didn't buy it. The dimension between the severity of the crimes and the weak, impudent and predictable ending, just didn't quite jibe. The screenplay zipped along and felt like it simply...ran out of gas."

Maybe that's not the point if you are doing a ""comment on our society"" as someone stated here, but to me it matters when you are trying to do a crime mystery / thriller. I didn't get thrilled, so I did not like that movie. <br/><br/>As Chandler wrote it in an essay, if you want to kill somebody, you don't train a snake to sneak into a closed chamber to bite the victim, you don't dress up in a costume (see Edgar Wallace), you don't invite ten people to a remote castle just to kill 'em one by one (Christie). No you simple ambush the victim and kill him in a dark back road or like Hitch did it in ""Strangers on a train"" on that island or the killing of Arbogast in Psycho (yes I know there was a dress involved).<br/><br/>This movie was clearly made before C.S.I. hit the screen. Heck, this movie was made before they invented witnesses or anything else which would be a challenge to the killer, like being seen when he stalks his victims by a neighbor or something... He just enters the apartments of these people like he owns their places and then kills 'em in the most complicated way just to create the effect. And he gets away every time. He's a genius, he's better than Ars√®ne Lupin, better even than Keyser Soze, better than the Joker, you name it. <br/><br/>Make your comments on society and do a movie like ""American History X"".

","***Spoilers included****<br/><br/>Great.  Just what the world needs.  Another dark, disturbing, gratuitously violent movie that has delusions of achieving the dizzy heights of a modern classic.  Sure- I recognise that the movie has good points.  The performances are pretty good, the camera techniques and photography employed effectively enhance the subject matter and hey- there is always Gwyneth losing her head - something that should have happened a long time ago (if you think I'm probably not a Gwyneth fan..well- you'd be right).  But my objection lies in the completely depraved scenes that accompany each of the seven (sorry about that - I meant, of course, Se7en) sins.  This is torturous violence at it's most debased.  And if the movie is about how desensitised we all are to the problems of the world we live in, then why did this movie make me leave the cinema feeling violated?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  I'm wouldn't consider myself prudish or oversensitive when it comes to violence on the screen- after all, I am a classic Gen X, who grew up watching violence and sex of some form or another manifest before me.   I can usually watch serial killer movies without too many problems (apart from the entirely involuntary hands over the eyes during the critical moments).  But this was different. This was disturbing.  Maybe I just can't stand the suffering and torture of the human condition that was evident in this movie.  Or maybe it was because the good guys definitely don't win out in the end and I've been so Hollywoodised (yeah- I know it's not a word, but it was the best I could come up with) that I can't handle this fact.<br/><br/>Seriously, don't bother with this movie."

","It's powerfully directed by David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances. The filmmakers stick to their vision with such dedication and persistence that something indelible comes across something ethically and artistically superior to The Silence of the Lambs that refuses to exploit suffering for fun or entertainment. The reason to see Seven, which is decidedly not for the faint of stomach, is not for the punishment of sin, but the many virtues of Freeman's contribution. Seven is a work of extraordinary style, upsetting power and narrative daring. The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. The film is quite involving. David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in film history, far more interesting than Silence of the Lambs. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give great performances in this film.The pace is fast and the shocks build beautifully. The actors within it all reel with convincing horror.<br/><br/>It's not the identity of the killer that gives Seven its kick -- it's the way Fincher raises mystery to the level of moral provocation. Despite some truly fantastic work throughout the '90s and 2000s, Se7en still remains director David Fincher's best film, albeit by a very narrow margin."
"lisa_thatcher","Null","1","3","3 October 2014"," David Fincher's timidity prevents a truly great film.
","Please note: This review contains spoilers. To be read after watching the film.<br/><br/>Se7en is the second time David Fincher has insisted on a weirdo number title that doesn't make much sense other than to look cool, but fortunately it is the last. The story goes New Line had refused Andrew Kevin Walker's script because of the now (in)famous head in a box ending, preferring it rewritten as a detective noir, but when they sent the script to Fincher offering him the project, they accidentally sent the original script and Fincher took the project based on the original end, and strangely, because he saw the film about a meditation on the evil within us all, rather than a police detective thriller. If Se7en is a meditation on the evil within, then god help us, because as Mills (Brad Pitt) says to Somerset (Morgan Freeman) several times through the story, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) is mad, and no matter how much you want to dress him up in the admiration we all have for a passionate dedication to our individual projects, what gets us in with Se7en is the graphic imagery, not the important statement on psychological depth. Se7en never once turns the camera on the fascinated viewer, it merely tells a story very well, and its subject choice reveals a talent Fincher has for tapping into a cultural zeitgeist that can sell a product or a story, but leaves the creative thinker at the margins of the goings on, and never the subject of it. Fincher never once makes us ask ourselves why we want to see images of a man who has eaten himself to death, he just gives them to us, standing by our side, pointing outward at the evil we ""get"" and ""chose"" not to ""be"". It's a horrible waste, because the film screams for the point to be made, through Somerset's self-reflection and Tracy Mills' (Gwyneth Paltro) external observations (as the film stands she is barely more than a head in a box) and painted precisely as it is with just slight variances to both those characters lines, the film could have been a masterpiece of societal observation instead of a glamorous cop flick that becomes all about its gruesomeness. As we will see, Fincher is completely capable of this level of observation, because he goes there in his best film Zodiac, but he pulls away from it in Se7en, speaking to his overall problem of subject versus object - holding a mirror up to the people (art) or giving them what they want (advertising).<br/><br/>If there is a running theme of intellectual constraint in Fincher's films, there is a compensatory splendor in his equal parts subtle and intensified aesthetic pallet, that sees much of the impact of atmosphere he tried to evoke in Alien¬≥ fully realized. The world of Se7en is made unrelentingly bleak, all the unlit rooms and preoccupation with torch-light notwithstanding. It almost always rains in this unnamed burg where no one switches a light on, nothing really works and people inspecting apartments never think to stay in them to look around for longer than five minutes. Fincher used bleach bypass to retain the silver in the film stock, washing everything in a tinted gray that gives flesh both living and dead a pasty quality. Nothing, even Paltrow's face and hair, is luminous. Blood is always a dark, liquid earth brown.<br/><br/>Those who fought for the ending, Fincher and Pitt specifically, knew to do so because it is the punchline that gives Se7ven its heart, the rest of the script being too clich√©d (the retiring cop and the rookie newbie, the last-minute superior serial killer, the visits to the library to sink into his ""mind"", the black cop white cop Lethal Weapon thing) to amount to much, particularly when stripped of the only punch that would have given it teeth that I articulated in the first paragraph.<br/><br/>Yet Fincher could see a script that lent itself to potent mise-en- scene and in many ways, this will define him as a director from this film forward, which is partially why Se7en is usually thought of as his first film. Fincher the adman knew to sell John Doe as a concept right from the beginning. The opening credits (something Fincher will become more and more famous for) are devoted to the serial killer, the part of us Fincher falsely imagines Se7en is highlighting. Actually, Fincher plays it safe offering John Doe to us packaged (Brown box delivered if you like) in sleazy funk, indulging us ah-la-music video. The opening title becomes it's own narrative concept and it's not till later in the film we realize we were watching John Doe, as Fincher would say, ""working on some really evil s$%^."" The choice of (another) bad script and the focus on the serial killer is where Fincher creatively sells out, because it's not until Zodiac that he realizes just knowing what we want and giving it to us doesn't make him deep or even clever. He needs to focus on us rather than feed us, instead adopting the central conceit of advertising that assumes because it knows what will motivate us, that it is smarter than us. Se7en is a beautifully crafted film, and Fincher draws solid performances from his talented cast, but his own timidity prevents it from being a truly great film."

But one of the greatest villains of all time must be Jon Doe played by Kevin Spacey. The character was incredibly scary and completely out of his mind but still seemed quite intelligent and focused. Spacey did a superb job in portraying him. The story reminds me a lot of the book ""Illuminati"" by Dan Brown but without the ""happy end"". And that's what I really didn't like: Why did Mills Girlfriend have to die in the end?. I get why the writes chose this Ending but did it have to be this cruel? I felt so scared and quite throughout the whole movie and I really needed something good to happen in the End. <br/><br/>I would still recommend this movie because of the great cast and story."

Thank God he proved us wrong! <br/><br/>Se7en is a thrilling movie with a climax that keeps you thinking about the movie, days after the initial viewing!The plot makes the movie completely re watchable, making this defiantly worth a purchase and great addition to your home video collection. First of all, this movie is dark, literally and figuratively! <br/><br/>The cinematography just suits the tone of this movie. Two cops, both keen on catching their man, are on a chase after a array of murders specifically resembling the seven deadly things. The deaths are never shown on screen, just the mess left after really keeps the audience thinking (the movie is very thought provoking) and how disturbing they can be, really does make the audience think twice about your own morals! The acting is top-notch with three amazing actors portraying the main cast- Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt, but Kevin Spacey steals the show in his memorable performance.<br/><br/>Even the supporting cast is brilliant! For me what really brings the whole experience together is Howard Shores brilliant score. I mean who didn't get goosebumps just watching the intro credits! <br/><br/>I' d highly recommend you watch this film!"

","It's a shame not everyone knows about 'Se7en', for some reason it hasn't become a popular classic like others. It really is a fantastic film that proves that films don't need to contain lots of gore to be scary.<br/><br/>The acting overall is great; there are few films where everyone performs well but this is one of them. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances here and contributes a lot to this film. Brad Pitt does perform well but it certainly isn't his best. Towards the end, his acting seems too forced unfortunately during the scenes where his performance is the most crucial. Kevin Spacey is fantastic here; he really does make you shiver. His creepy performance here is definitely his best. <br/><br/>The script is really clever yet the story is so simple you wonder why someone hadn't come up with the idea of a killer killing people for each of the seven sins before. Each murder and each motive surprise you especially the films' climax. It has become one of the most famous endings in history and has been spoofed by huge numbers of shows. I won't give the ending away of course because I think everyone who watches 'Se7en' for the first time need to watch it with no clue as to how it ends to truly understand the greatness of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Se7en' is a fantastic film worth watching. It's really violent but doesn't contain as much gore as expected and sets a good example for quality film making without the need for excess."

","This film is one of the best serial killer films I've seen. It is a very dark film and it is nearly always raining.. I loved Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in this, two different characters who seem to get along more and more as the film goes on. Its also nice to see Gwnyeth Paltrow playing the role of Brad Pitts caring loving wife in it. This film is not for the faint hearted as there are gruesome scenes and shocks. The film is about two detectives going after a serial killer who kills his victims based on the seven deadly sins : gluttony, lust, sloth,wrath,greed, pride and envy. It seems pretty simple, but as the film goes on you become more interested in the plot and want to see what treat the killer has left this time. When the killer is revealed is my favourite scene in the movie, you don't see it coming and it's brilliant. After the film had ended, I had so many emotions going through me. I felt depressed, shocked, amazed and even some happiness. This film shows the brilliance of David Fincher and if you have not seen this film go and watch it."
"ddude1116","9","1","3","14 January 2012"," On the road to greatness, they pulled over at the last moment.
","As soon as the film ended, and David Bowie began to play on the credits, I could only wonder why David Mills shot Kevin Spacey when he seemed so much like he was not going to. And then I realized it was a faulty seam at the end of a blanket, which would allow it to unravel and fall apart. Don't misunderstand this; I'm not complaining. The end seam may be insufficient, but it is still one of the warmest blankets you could have the pleasure of, and it only unravels once you aggravate it. No. I'm only reflecting, and wondering. I wonder how the ending could have changed to suit the grandeur that is the entire film prior to that fatal shot? What if Kevin Spacey lived, or they gave no indication whether or not Mills shot him or did not shoot him. I cannot honestly say, only that the ending is the reason why this film is one of the best of the year, and not all time. Perhaps, that only way to accurately describe such a thing is in its own words: ""There isn't going to be a happy ending. He's only human, and that will be disappointing."" Either way, Se7en is a phenomenal achievement in film, marred only by its own brilliance. It seems as if it burnt out at the two hour mark, and then faded away, fading from the annals of memory and grandeur."
"Desertman84","10","1","3","29 December 2011"," Se7en:A Cinema Masterpiece
","Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller,Se7en ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes and one of the best films he has ever made in his career.This thriller, which also contains horror and neo-noir elements, directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker,stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman together with Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey and Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset, a homicide specialist just one week from a well- deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills, the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy, into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for.Then,David Mills and William Somerset are deeply involved in a case involving a series of sadistic murders. Each murder corresponds to one of the seven deadly sins of Christianity: gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed and wrath. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. <br/><br/>This is definitely a classic thriller that presents a brutal, relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances, slick gore effects, and a haunting finale.David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in American film history.Although the story can be considered formulaic,Fincher contrives a stylish, intentionally ugly look that transcends the pulp narrative that would leave the viewer breathless and horrified.Although it is a violent film,the director handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analysis and briefly glimpsed post mortem shots, but never showing the violent acts themselves for which he should be credited for the superb direction of this film.As for the performances,both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give excellent portrayal of the cops trying to solve the murder and catching Kevin Spacey,whose portrayal of the diabolical is one for the books and clearly has shown his acting talent and capabilities.Definitely,Seven is the most disquieting,memorable and powerful thriller in years.Truly a masterpiece."

","John Doe was no wonder a Roman Catholic, cause he thought people should save themselves in the way he chose. Or he was a derivative of the Catholics, that he believed so strong that only his ways of salvation are just, which no doubt would lead to tyranny and dictatorship, which we had about one hundred years ago.<br/><br/>I, perhaps like some of you, understand, in a way, his motive, or the feeling on those who he reckoned as sinned. Gluttony, Pride, Greed, Wrath, Envy, Lust, Sloth, these are natural, or doom-to-be-developed weaknesses of every human beings, we do not hate those who possess the sins, but who indulge and self-justified, especially when we think we are not one of them. And that, is what Detective Somerset and John Doe would both agree with.<br/><br/>One's just naturally think less of those who are no match with him, the cause of which is the occur of shallowness, that's why John Doe puked on the superficial man who he met on a subway platform, the man was labeled as superficial only because he liked talking about the girls the weather and other trivial things of daily lives. And he deserved that.<br/><br/>Shallowness itself is not a sin, but the indulgence or the blindness of which makes it a real sin, that's why Socrate was a saint, ""I know that I know nothing"".<br/><br/>Lots of people today do have that kind of sin, the choice to lead a superficial life, and they call it a way to fulfill the commitment of the pursuit of happiness. ""Is that supposed to be funny?""<br/><br/>However, in the modern society of Capitalism, such sins are tolerated, as long as they don't develop into crimes. We call it ""Freedom"". It's no doubt a Protestant way to deal with such problem, and lots of us seem to intend to keep it."

","I will tip toe around this claim ever so carefully, but I think it is a relevant argument to made that this film's integrity if of equal value to that of Silence Of The Lambs. Spacey's performance is just as impacting as Anthony Hopkin's Lecter. There is also is mildly similar blueprint to the script and characters, per dealing with rogue detectives. <br/><br/>The main difference is the psychological study of Clarice Starling's deep relationship with Lecter, while in Seven the dichotomy of the two officer's and their respective relationship is at the forefront.

","David Fincher's fiercely idolized Seven is certainly an interesting and well-made film. Finely acted, meticulously shot and composed. It very effectively portrays the greatest city on earth as dark and Gothic, rotting and falling to pieces, its citizens weary and confused. What prevents Seven from being a true masterpiece is that there is very little meaning or depth below the layers of supposed erudition. It doesn't help to allude to Dante and Chaucer when your film has nothing to do with their work ; it seems to me that these references were deliberately added just to create a false sense of meaning in the minds of viewers who don't know any better. Ah, Thomas Aquinas ! Hemingway !!! Deep stuff this must be......well, not really, though. The film is content to scratch the surface of difficult ideas, hinting at more interesting things but resolutely going for the cheap thrill nine times out of ten. John Doe is a grand and terrifying killer, but one that exists only in the imaginary world of movies."
"Stampsfightclub","5","1","3","14 April 2009"," good at turns, but not worth the hassle
","Two detectives try to hunt down a serial killer who seems to be attacking his victims using the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>David Fincher at the time of Se7en's release was the man known only as the director who destroyed the Alien franchise, and quite right. Apart from a stunning final that showed his potential there was simply a collection of medium shots with none of that vintage scene stealing fast montages and flashes that would become so effective in his future release Fight Club and Panic Room. So there was a bit of pressure on here as casting renowned star Freeman and most recognized newcomer Brad Pitt about a delicate and interesting topic, and he didn't disappoint many. Seven is now renowned as one of the finest horrors ever made.<br/><br/>Starting off with a detective retiring and an ambitious but na√Øve new cop surprise surprise we have tension. This has been handled in so many films it is ridiculous and if you're expecting anything different in terms of this pairing, think again. The tension between the pair is obvious, the predictable gung-ho attitude by Pitt's Mills is soft and Morgan's law-abiding Somerset is simply boring.<br/><br/>So here we have 'drama' and as both are on the hunt for a serial killer we have 'crime' and the mystery man is attacking his victims with the deadly sins and so we have horrible murders that would label this as 'horror'. When reading descriptions I noticed this was labelled as one of the scariest films ever. I however didn't seem to find what was so scary. Sure the concept would have been scary if the murders had been effectively established but the pair of detectives hardly seemed bothered. They were mere happenings that stumbled in their way. This is a shame as this is a debatable topic that questions religion, social class and humanity. Apart from blood messages, you won't be jumping behind the sofa any time soon.<br/><br/>So Se7en simply tries to tackle too much. Horror, crime and drama are all encoded and seemingly not enough; the inclusion of the rain drenched city places it in noir too, as does Gwyneth Paltrow's flat protagonist. Impressive scene settings and costume design but when there is no plot there is no give, no adrenaline to match the mood.<br/><br/>There is also a lack of action in this 1995 picture. A full hour had passed before my head was inclined to be entertained. Then the final climax was finally worth watching. Heart stopping and well acted by all involved made Se7en moderately interesting. But despite this heavily debated climax and odd twists, it is not worth the whole waiting around"
"trakz7","6","1","3","12 August 2008"," Amazing thriller, with a ruined ending
","This review is for people who consider this movie the BEST THRILLER EVER.<br/><br/>I watched this movie because a friend of mine told me that it's one of the best thrillers ever. I have to admit that he was right. The theme (the seven deadly sins) is excellent, I really like thrillers with religious or historical influences. The actors play so well that I couldn't take my eye off the screen, but sadly, there are a few things that make this movie very predictable.<br/><br/>First of all, it's the wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) of Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). When she reveals that she's pregnant to Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), everyone will know that something has got to happen to her and their child.<br/><br/>The second thing is that Pitt is so hot-headed, that you have to be very naive to think that nothing will happen to him.<br/><br/>I also can't understand what was Tracy's sin. If John Doe's sin was the envy, the only sin that remained was the wrath, but I don't think that this had anything to do with the detective's wife. Than I realized that it must have been the detective's sin for killing the murderer, but then why did he remained alive??? As Morgan Freeman said, the murderer needs seven dead bodies with seven deadly sins to complete his masterpiece. I really don't think that this was complete.<br/><br/>Anyway, I must say that this movie is very original, I can't compare it to any other thriller. It would be one of my favorites, but the ending is the most important thing in every movie, but this one was not so enthralling. I was waiting for a huge clashing but it didn't come.<br/><br/>I give 6 stars for this movie, because after all it was worth watching, a few scenes and ideas will remain in my head for a few days, but this could have been the best thriller of the 90's if it had a more shocking ending."
"gavin6942","9","1","3","7 August 2007"," The Essential ""Tracking the Killer"" Movie...
","A detective (Brad Pitt) moves to the big city (possibly New York, but never stated) just as another (Morgan Freeman) is retiring. For the last seven days of the retiring detective's career, they must track down a serial killer who bases his killings around the seven deadly sins. Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley, and Richard Roundtree also appear.<br/><br/>This film starts out with an amazing Nine Inch Nails remix of ""Closer"" over some spooky credits that will play a part in the film later on (but you probably will not make the connection until your second viewing). This sets the tone for a mid-1990s film of nihilistic, dark despair. Unlike another mid-1990s film (""Empire Records"") that focused on the pop aspects, this film is for all those who saw the dark side of the decade.<br/><br/>That nihilism is evident, and really summed up the 1990s for some (and ushered in the peak of Tim Burton's career, along with industrial music and films like ""The Doom Generation"". John Doe speaks of the general ""apathy"" of the world, which came to the forefront in the 1990s, I think, with Marilyn Manson and ultimately ending with Columbine when we were shocked back to our senses. If the 1990s were a color, it would have been black.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning, even in the death shots. The gluttony victim, which starts the movie out, is a corpse you will never forget. The acting here is quite good, perhaps among Brad Pitt's best work. There is an odd moment or two, but overall he is flawless. This is likely the film that solidified his career for the next decade (more than ""Thelma and Louise"" ever did). Morgan Freeman is great, but when is he not? His mere presence exudes genius.<br/><br/>As far as serial killer dramas go, this one is as well written as possible. Another one, ""8MM"", from the same writer, is also pretty good. But I think this one takes the cake. Other cop dramas with Morgan Freeman (""Along Came a Spider"", for example) are also well written. But again, this takes it. The blend of action, humor, dark grisly death and literary intelligence is just superb in its smooth mixture. What other serial killer is using Dante and ""Paradise Lost"" as a guidebook? <br/><br/>Can I again say the supporting cast is good? Paltrow almost never fails to impress, and this is one of her more vulnerable roles -- a dainty flower in a hurricane. Ermey is his typical authoritarian self, but more reserved here, to his credit. And Roundtree is at the peak of his career, as well -- this may not be ""Shaft"", but I think he comes across as a serious actor here in a way he never has before.<br/><br/>As anyone will tell you, this film is ranked in the top fifty for a good reason: it is a stellar film. If you do not mind a little blood and plenty of curse words, you will love the intricate and well-woven plot here. I recently watched the film again -- possibly my fifth time now -- and it only grows better with repeat viewings. In short: Delightfully sinister!"

Although I didn't see it credited, there must have been someone appointed to keep the torch (flashlight) batteries fully charged, as I have never seen such profligate use of torches, whether hand-held or attached to weaponry. And why do film directors love rain so much? I don't remember glimpsing the sun at all in this film - so no contrast in the weather. However, the stark contrast between Somerset and Mills did bring a little sunshine to my viewing. ""Se7en"" grabbed my attention from the beginning and held it throughout, although I found my credibility being stretched on occasion. It is difficult to pinpoint these more dubious parts of the plot without giving at least some of the story away, but viewers should be prepared for the odd raising of a questioning eyebrow."

","It might be because I've seen a lot of films since it's release in 1995 that have borrowed heavily from its visual style, which was possibly very unusual at the time (I can't remember) but this didn't ring with me as strongly as it has with some people. It's very much a David Fincher with decay and desaturated colour tones everywhere, lots of grand, decaying buildings and a feeling of gloomy, low tech nostalgia sliding in at the sides, and that's very welcome, but it's not as gripping as some make out.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't a *bad* film, by any stretch. The plot's well balanced, the characters nuanced and believable (except Brad Pitt who's such an annoying brat I can't see how anyone anywhere would hire him as a cop) and the dialogue is good enough (although really Morgan FReeman brings a real shine to it that Pitt can't match), with the exception of some slightly hammy bits.<br/><br/>The main thing that seems to have gripped everybody is the serial killer's supposedly insanely clever twisted, creepy, dark, disturbing plan, but I don't really think it's as creepy as all that. Saw, a far less interesting film, was WAY creepier, although I suppose it borrowed heavily from Seven.<br/><br/>Also, I don't really care much about how creepy serial killers are anyway, I think it's just a cheap titillation device.<br/><br/>Where this film's most interesting is where Brad Pitt's character gets his come-uppance for being such an annoying little twerp. And even that feels a little bit cheap, there isn't a moment where he's on screen that he doesn't irritate, which may be the point, but it's a bit much to make an entire film about an evil serial killer just so you can give an imaginary jackass a slap in the face.<br/><br/>But Morgan Freeman was good..."

Brad Pitt was brash, and affectionate. Kevin Spacey was Kevin Spaceyily good.

He believes that these sins are practiced daily, and no one thinks otherwise. Now, he takes revenge on 6 (in a way, 7) people to show that each one is living for a wrong reason and believes that their deaths will have him become notorious as a killer, but in the same way, a hero for showing people the right path.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the movie grabbed attention and played it out in a way that made the viewer have to read the killer's mind to follow along. Somewhat like Hannibal Lector. Plus, I loved the beginning credits, amazing camera work."

","I don't know if Brad Pitt is just a so-so actor or if his being in the same movie with Morgan Freeman just makes it appear that way. Freeman is one of my choices for best actor in Hollywood today. Off-screen he appears to be as quiet and dignified as he does on-screen. He is one of the Hollywood actors who, thank God, you never hear spout the political bird-droppings that so many in Hollywood are prone to these days and which have surely diminished Hollywood in so many eyes. The movie was a fine vehicle for Freeman, who seems born to the role of the thinking police detective. I was somewhat turned off by Pitts affected accent in this movie which, by and large, with the exception of a few scenes, held my attention and there were several scenes that were riveting. I don't know why, but the first time I saw this movie I considered it just so-so but on viewing it again I've changed my opinion and now consider it better than average."

In Alien3 it was the death of Ripley.  Here it's the final confrontation between Mills and Doe.  This tradition continues with The Game, Fight Club, and Panic Room.  In all these cases, Fincher works with typical cliched material that shows its influences all-too-well.  Only Fight Club is the most original in conception.<br/><br/>Pitt shows his usual excess dedication into a role, Freeman's boredom makes all his roles indistinguishable.  Harrison Ford has the same problem, that's why he relies on wardrobe changes to make a different face to the audience.<br/><br/>The whole concept of serial killers is like comedies and action movies. Always trying to hustle one more surprise on the audience.  This is better constructed than 'The Usual Suspects', more stylized than 'Silence of the Lambs', but less human.  It's the 'Hunt for Red October' of the detective genre.<br/><br/>This would be Fincher's ""commercial"" film of the three types I've listed.

These guys do not exist. There has NEVER been a psycho-killer with an involved ""relationship"" with any police officer of any police force, and finally, real life serial killers are losers who choose very vulnerable victims at random. The only pattern to pattern killers are that they find victims because many people are nice and trusting and so they become prey to the wolves occasionally, sort of a reverse lottery where unlucky people cross paths with these swine. Why Hollywood glamorizes these creepoids is beyond me. It doesn't surprise me that the same director who annihilated the Aliens series with the inane Aliens-3, directed this flick.

The worst part is that the movie is set up to have the correct ending, but they pussed out and went with something completely ridiculous. The way it could have actually worked is if Gwyneth was wrath because we find out that she went through with the abortion that she discussed with Morgan Freeman. Then John Doe kills Gwyneth (wrath), Brad Pitt kills Doe (envy), Bam Bam: masterpiece completed. The only thing I could think of that could have happened was this anti-abortion ending was shot down by some idiot producer, so they had to change it to something more ""politically correct"" (democratic), but I was shocked to find that the correct ending wasn't even in the special edition DVD, so I can't fathom what went wrong here."

The movie is too long, too bloody/gory for no good reason, the off-plot filler dialog is awful and irrelevant, why with such a theme for the film they couldn't think up anything compelling for their protagonists to say ?? The ending revolves heavily around certain characters, and besides the fact it's terribly acted out by Brad Pitt particularly, it is an escalated climax to something that hasn't gained enough momentum to really be dramatic.

"CinemaClown","Null","1","4","27 October 2014"," Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Lust. Pride. Envy. Wrath ... What's Your Deadly Sin?
","Blazingly original, darkly disturbing, downright shocking, extremely grim, relentlessly brutal, insanely powerful & emotionally devastating, David Fincher's breakthrough effort is an intensely haunting masterpiece which today is widely & rightly considered amongst the greatest thrillers ever made, and is also notable for marking the commencement of an impressive legacy that continues to get stronger with every new Fincher film.<br/><br/>Taking place over the course of a week, the story of Se7en concerns two homicide detectives; the soon-to-retire William Somerset & the newly transferred David Mills, who become deeply involved in the recent case of appalling crimes relating to the seven deadly sins and desperately try to hunt down the sadistic serial killer before his mission is accomplished. The plot also covers the detectives' initial friction with each other & the contrast in their working methods.<br/><br/>Ingeniously directed by David Fincher, the film is a staggering work of perfection from start to finish in which the smallest of details end up contributing to the whole premise & the dark plot in itself feels like something that was spit right out from the abyss. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker is very carefully but masterly structured with each event, character, their motivation etc being properly weighed before it is penned down in the script.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, production design team does a stellar job in providing the decaying & dismal environment to the whole picture which is further enhanced by its bleak photography that adds to the inhospitable look this film was aiming for. Editing makes sure every sequence is relevant to the plot & smoothly unfolds the events as the film progresses while Howard Shore's score effortlessly elevates the nerve-jangling tension to a nearly unbearable level.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, Se7en features a very dependable cast in Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow & others but what truly makes it work is the remarkable chemistry between Freeman & Pitt as Detective Somerset & Mills, respectively. Freeman plays his character in a very calm & composed manner and is instantly likable. Pitt does go a bit overexcited in few scenes but his performance still stays within the realms of his character's dimensions.<br/><br/>Yet it's actually our serial killer who ends up stealing the show from the moment he reveals himself to the audience to the very twisted, bone-chilling & unforgettable finale that's powerful enough to haunt its viewers for a long time. Also, the opening credits sequence alone is in an entirely different league as the sense of creepiness it invokes only serves as a warning for what lies ahead and the film as a whole works immensely well as a fascinating meditation on evil.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Se7en is one of the darkest, creepiest & finest examples of psychological horrors that remains as effective today as it was back at its time of release. The extent to which its story tries to delve into the minds of serial killers is pretty unsettling yet the uncompromising approach the director took in envisioning a sinister script on the silver screen makes it all the more admirable. A dark, brooding & unrelenting terror of epic proportions, Se7en is certainly David Fincher's darkest film to date & definitely one of the greatest achievements of its genre."
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","4","13 October 2014"," What's In The Box? Am I Right People?
","""Se7en"" is an exceptional thriller written by Andrew Kevin Walker, and directed by the always more than impressive David Fincher. The lack of creative freedom he had with ""Alien3"" (1992) turned him off the idea of creating anymore, but the script they sent him managed to garner his enthusiasm. Unfortunately they also sent him the script with the original ending they wasn't going to use, leading to Fincher and Brad Pitt fighting for the script. It's a fascinating story I bring up because the film has rumours of many alternate endings, I implore you to do a little research on what might have been.<br/><br/>I suppose I should also say if you're a fan of ""CSI"" (2000-present), then you must have seen ""Se7en"". The newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the retiring William Somerset (Freeman), are homicide detectives who become deeply involved in the case of a sadistic serial killer, whose meticulously planned murders correspond to the seven deadly sins. From the uniquely disturbing title sequence, to the overall shocking scenarios and finale. After watching this movie so many times now, I'm stunned at how engaging and refreshed I am to watch it all again and still find little things in the corners of each frame and shot composition. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's chemistry and banter together is still as engaging, and how they haven't appeared in a film together since is beyond me. It was also the time rising star Kevin Spacey was on the scene, and even with the little screen time he has his presence is so memorable it's crazy.<br/><br/>Other than that, the brutal crime scenes still have the power to shock and make people feel faint. To me David Fincher's work has this kind of style that began with ""Se7en"", and over the years he's made it distinctly his own. Nowhere is this more prominent than in the long bleak shots of the city in both night and heavy downpour, and for some reason part of me hearkens back to the urban street life painted in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). The performances are solid, the set pieces are vivid and the script work and pacing is impeccable. If you haven't already seen it, stop what you're doing and definitely make it you're next viewing experience because it really is one of the 1990's absolute best.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Often mimicked, yet never trumped. In a current wave of never ending shoddy horror movies, ""Se7en"" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that will keep you enthralled all the way towards the credits. 10/10."
"BA_Harrison","9","1","4","11 February 2012"," This ain't a seven: it's got to be at least an eight or a nine.
","I consider David Fincher's Seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenon‚Äîmore specifically, the Saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut.<br/><br/>However, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), I don't resent Fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge against‚Äîa masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile.<br/><br/>Fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was Alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. Without studio interference, he successfully delivers his vision‚Äîa visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. Despite its gruesome subject matter, Se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity.<br/><br/>An ingenious script from Andrew Kevin Walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from Kevin Spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie."

Se7en was lacking in both areas. I'll admit that the whole idea of incorporating the seven deadly sins into it was clever. However, the movie was not capable of holding my attention because it did not show any of the crimes as they were happening. When I watched the movie for the second time, I managed to stay awake. Once I got toward the end of the movie when ""John Doe"" was introduced, I finally understood what was so good about it. The end was definitely praiseworthy because it was the only intense part.

The fact that so many other reviewers gave him kudos tells me that intellectually Americans have fallen way behind in what they look for in a film. We truly are just about 'action, action, action' as Marlene Dietrich once said. Maybe that is why foreign film is so much ahead of us. Too many Americans have been raised on 'TV Movie of the Week' and 'Murder She Wrote' as their mother's milk. They simply don't look for nuances in character and personality. Underplaying is much more difficult that overplaying. Mr. Pitt does a ham actor's job of it. This isn't the first time I've witnessed his gross inability to reel in his own personality. He keeps playing Brad Pitt, bad boy of film as if flip dialog and pouting and shouting can make him the next Brando. It's a shame, but the ending fails enormously and I think was predictable.

Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done.

","Seven (1995) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Intense and rather disturbing thriller has Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman playing detectives trying to track down a serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his motive. I remember seeing this the opening day in theaters and I really left the theater disappointed. While I found it a good entertainment, it never really struck me as anything great until many years later on repeat viewings. Today I think the story, acting and directing makes it one of the best films of the decade. Fincher's dark style really creates a thick and rather eerie atmosphere, which runs from the opening to closing credits. The screenplay offers up a lot of tense action but I think the key to the film is the quieter moments where we get to know the two detectives as well as Pitt's wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. When the killer's identity is finally revealed, and I won't ruin it here, the film even lets us get to know him in perhaps the most chilling scene in the movie. I think having the violence centered around the seven deadly sins was an interesting choice and the motives and conclusion could be endlessly debated. I guess it's to be expected that Freeman and Pitt would be opposite type of characters and the screenplay doesn't take the easy way out on this but instead it uses this to bring up the energy and we're able to see the killer from two different view points, which is a rare thing in thrillers like this. Both men give excellent performances with Freeman being the older, wiser man while Pitt is still wet behind the year but trying to make his mark in the profession. I know this film was a hit when originally released but it seems like it's become a classic over the past few years and I personally wouldn't argue with anyone calling this film that. I think it gets better with each viewing in the same sense that many Hitchcock thrillers get better."

In closing, Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) suggests that it is indeed not a nice world, but that it is worth fighting for. However we are never told why.<br/><br/>Freeman and Brad Pitt make the most of their roles as two very different detectives pursuing a very disturbed individual, played in truly haunting fashion by Kevin Spacey. I for one though am getting sick of religious nuts. It seems almost every person that is portrayed as having a faith is also naturally mentally unstable. ""Chariots of Fire"" is the only film I can think of that shows Christianity in a good light, yet the number of religious wackos in the movies is astounding.<br/><br/>Fincher has given his pic a customary dark, wet look (not unlike his ""Alien3""), and he has thrown in some very strange, 'rock video' style credits.

Unfortunately, that isn't true. Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow can't give great performances like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave in ""The silence of the lambs"".  However, Morgan Freeman is a terrific actor and so is Kevin Spacey and so the two of them together can compensate for Pitt's and Paltrow's performance.<br/><br/>  The movie starts off in a house.  Someone has been murdered.  The sin this person had committed was gluttony and it seemed he was killed in this way: someone held a gun against his head and forced him to eat spaghetti until he bursted open.  The detective in charge of this case is an experienced detective named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and is shortly teamed up with a young detective named David Mills (Brad Pitt).  We them have the opening credits and the camera is filming inside the murderer's house.  It is filming his hands which are working on a table and you realize how careful the psycho is.  He cut off the end of his fingers and put bandages around them simply to be sure the police do not find any finger-prints.<br/><br/>  The next murder is committed is a person whose sin was greed, then sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and finally lust.  The seven sinners all having been murdered, Mills assumes that the murderer will not strike again and that he has only to catch him.  But that's not what John Doe (Kevin Spacey), the murderer, has in mind.  No, instead of hiding out after his seven murders, he turns himself over to the police and has a last surprise for the two detectives, a surprise that will horrify them and allow the viewer which one is able to know when to hold back and which one should be holding back.<br/><br/>  David Fincher does a better job directing this than directing Alien√Ç¬≥. However, I thought there was too much unnecessary gore in the movie.  Brad Pitt does a good job with what he is given and Morgan Freeman is as excellent a in any other movie.  But Kevin Spacey walks away with the movie and gives probably the best performance as the crazy John Doe whose way to describe a murder is as scary as seeing him commit one.  It wasn't any surprise he won best villain of the year at the MTV movie awards.  I think he didn't get a nomination for best-supporting actor because he already had one in ""The usual suspects"" which he won.  The only disappointing part of the movie is truly Gwyneth Paltrow's performance who seems to be shy in front of the camera.  It's a good movie that got a little too much credit but is still worth watching."
"rkevinwilliams","5","1","7","6 June 2015"," disappointing effort
","I could give this film credit for acting, for cinematography, character development, etc., however, the failure seems to be in the story. <br/><br/>It is obvious from the outset what the ""seven"" refers to in the film, however it remains to be seen if the characters or the audience will be able to figure out what this will ultimately end up leading to as it goes along. I suppose it depends on how perceptive the characters or the audience are. There is a message behind the whole thing, and I will give credit that the message gets across and that is why I will give the movie half points for that execution, but as for surprises I will give it no credit at all.<br/><br/>The failure of this film is in the ultimate outcome as the detectives are not smart enough themselves to figure out what the viewer of the film can see coming."

","This is one of the best horror thrillers of all time. It's extremely gripping VERY disturbing and very suspenseful with 3 AWESOME Main leads, Saw was awesome but Se7ven is better. This movie really messes with your mind and really makes ya think, and it's no date flick that's for sure. This made me squirm in my seat couple of times. The ending is especially chilling and trust me you won't see it coming, it's very unpredictable and will make you feel uncomfortable (in a good way. there is plenty of shocking blood and violence. We get a corpse with a huge pool of blood around it , blood on a window, plenty of bloody disturbing imagery, LOTS of nasty looking corpses, nasty stitched up corpse, corpse without a stomach (nasty) gory photos, corpse with no arm, severed hand in a jar, bloody beatings and more!. The acting is Oscar worthy (in my humble opinion). Morgan Freeman is absolutely stunning here and there is no doubt his performance was Oscar worthy he and Brad Pitt had AMAZING chemistry together and was EXTREMELY likable. Brad Pitt is AWESOME here and did a VERY good job and his character was really likable and was great in the emotional scenes. Gyneth Paltrow is GORGEOUS and does excellent as David's wife. Kevin Spacey is VERY good here however i am not saying another word. R. Lee Emery does what he has to do well. Overall i HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest you see this right away! ***** SEE IT NOW!!!"

It should leave you with some impressions, not to go in bad with empty head.

","I basically thought this movie was exploitative junk.  The violence was gratuitous and the plot was not compelling.  Although I must admit that I found the movie very disturbing, that does not mean it was well made. Watching people being tortured and mutilated for no reason is disturbing even if the movie as a whole is terrible.  Moreover, my views are not based on my being squeamish -- which I am not.  I think Silence of the Lambs -- which is gross and disturbing, and which some people compare to Se7en -- to be one of the great movies of all time."

","I used to have a thing for movies, but I think that I've more or less exhausted the supply of good ones. ""Seven"" was not one of the good ones, despite the high rating. The main problem comes in the form of the villain. I just didn't buy it. By going down the list of the seven deadly sins, it seemed like he was trying to incite reform amongst the people. However, he did it in a way that kept it from being relevant to the general populace. The scale was completely warped just for the sake of the number seven. There needed to be more blood spilled in a less ordered way to scare people, and I would argue that such a killer would know that. Fear motivates people and could have brought about the changes that all the characters wanted to see take place. That would have been an interesting movie--people dedicated to maintaining order realizing that the order needs to be subverted to do actual good. That is an interesting conflict. Could the divorce really happen? The groundwork was there for such action to take place, but the result would have been too thought-provoking to be thrilling for the average viewer. Fear shapes people's behavior more than anything else, when present. Think about how many churches you see on your way to work. Inertia takes over when fear is absent. The killer was too calculating to suffer so many ineptitudes. And speaking of ineptitude--I am saddened that people seem so incapable of telling the difference between a good movie and a bad one. Shame on you again."

","From director David Fincher (Alien¬≥, Fight Club, Panic Room), I had heard about the film, seen one or two clips, and heard about things go on and the concept, so I was really when I finally watched it. Basically two homicide detectives are partnered to investigate a series of homicides. They are soon-to-retire Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and short-tempered but enthusiastic replacement Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). The murders are inspired by the seven deadly sins: Gluttony (overindulgence and overconsumption), Greed (or Avarice, the desire and pursuit of material possessions), Sloth (habitual disinclination to exertion, or laziness), Pride (or Vanity, the irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments), Lust (or Lechery, intense longing), Envy (jealousy for another person's good fortune) and Wrath (or Anger, uncontrolled feelings of rage, even hatred). A man was forced to eat until his stomach ruptured, representing Gluttony, and a defence attorney was killed after a pound of flesh was taken from him, representing Greed. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find the third victim, a child molester and drug dealer, strapped to bed and starved to death, representing Sloth. Photographs of the third victim were taken over a year ago, showing that the crimes were planned far in advance. Somerset and Mills use various literal sources to identify anything related to the seven deadly sins, including John Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno, and through library records they identify a man called Jonathan ""John"" Doe, and track him to his apartment. Does flees as they arrive, Mills gives chase, Doe holds him at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. After breaking into the apartment, Mills and Somerset find it contains hundreds of notebooks revealing the psychotic nature of Doe, as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made bladed strap-on, representing Lust. The following day the fifth victim, a female model is found dead with her face mutilated, Doe gave her the choice of calling for help and living disfigured, or committing suicide by taking pills, representing Pride. As Somerset and Mills return to the station, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim, he cannot be properly identified, as he has removed his own fingerprints, meaning he literally is ""John Doe"" (anonymous). Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims, but only under specific terms, or he will plead insanity, Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees. The detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location, while a helicopter follows them. Soon after their arrival, a delivery van approaches, Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset stops the van, the driver has been instructed to deliver a box to them. Doe taunts Mills by telling him how he admires and is jealous of his life with Tracy, he himself is representing Envy. Somerset opens the box, he is shocked by its contents and warns Mills to stay back, Doe states that he killed Tracy, her head is in the box, and he reveals that she was pregnant. Despite warning Mills that Doe will win if he kills him, Mills shoots Doe, fulfilling the final murder, and himself representing Wrath, in the end the devastated Mills is taken away. Also starring Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Police Captain, Scrubs' John C. McGinley as the California SWAT team leader, Richard Roundtree as District Attorney Martin Talbot, Richard Schiff as Mark Swarr, Mark Boone Junior as Greasy FBI Man, Reg E. Cathey as Dr. Santiago and Speed's Hawthorne James as George the Night Guard at the Library. Freeman is great as the dignified and credible detective on the brink of retirement, and he is equally matched by the raw but idealistic Pitt, Paltrow is alright in her short time, and Spacey steals the last few scenes as the psychopathic killer. This is a really clever and sophisticated postmodern movie, the script and narrative is daring, the murders and violence are disturbing, you follow the mystery unfolding, there is a jump or two along the way (the man strapped to the bed thought to be dead suddenly waking is a good one), the use of dark colouring and underlighting adds to the bleakness, and the twist ending is fantastic, it is just a marvellous must see crime thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Brad Pitt was number 15, Morgan Freeman number 27, and Kevin Spacey number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 The World's Greatest Actors, and the film was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

Did he also commit a crime? Which of the seven crimes did he commit? He used his jealousy to kill sincere love, anger to kill greed, arrogance to kill laziness The murderer's crime is already above the seven - extreme. Why does the man who commits lust kill the prostitute instead of the client? After all, the killer is a pervert.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, there was no voice or face of the main character, just a series of orderly actions. Under these actions, we heard the sirens of police cars, decoration motors, car horns, children's crying Gradually these noisy noises almost cover the voice of the protagonist. This way of expression is very realistic and documentary mode. Does it also symbolize that all evils originate from ordinary life?<br/><br/>There are many contradictions in the film, s and m are black, white, old and young, and their personalities are also different; there are several bright lights on the pure dark tone; a large section of shadow background or backlight contrasts with occasionally flashing neon lights, laying out that there will be bright hope in the city wrapped by crime.<br/><br/>Morgan's performance has been superb, introverted and calm.

","This week I watched the crime drama mystery called Se7en (1995). This was a very interesting film that revolved around the detectives who were on a serial killer case. The setup of the characters was probably the biggest initial draw into the story. The incoming young and raging rookie, played by Brad Pitt, is an excellent foil to the outgoing calloused detective, played by Morgan Freeman. The movie's aesthetic really contributed to the experience of the movie. The shots were very cinematic and the lighting lended itself well to the color grading. Albeit a gritty film the shots had a very high artistic value. This seemed to play up some irony in the film, almost a beauty through chaos kind of effect. The story was also very engaging and I thought that it was (mostly) enjoyable. The first three fourths of this film I liked. Then it started crossing some dark boundaries, which I don't think are great areas for filmmakers to go. There were several murders against women, which appeared to promote a sort of violence against women. Yes, it's a story, but it seemed to be a little too grotesque and dark for some viewers to be okay with. There are ways to tell a similar story without making it so vile. The end of the film also took things a little further than necessary. If you like feeling like dirt when you end a movie experience, then you may enjoy this sort of film. I will not watch it again, nor will I recommend it."

","Fincher being the director should explain everything but for the normies out there i'll still try to explain the greatness of the movie, for as long as I can hold back my laziness.<br/><br/>So the specifics of this director comes from his tense atmospheres, plus dark tone and colors and camera movements. David is usually sticking cameras with characters, moving according to them. This technique creates the feeling of us following characters' every movements, decisions and actions in person. Fincher is also master at catching insane focuses for intensity and mystery.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, the idea is captivating. The serial killer, who murders people following the order of the biblical Seven deadly sins concept. Two utterly different detectives try to solve the case, while many unexpected things happen to them. While the plot may seem simple, the unpredictability of the movie never let's the audience to breathe out.<br/><br/>The ""simplicity"" of the plot is easily compensated by very well-written characters with interesting personalities and traits. Two main characters, Sommerset and Mills are characters of great contrast. First one is old, about to retire. he is lonely person, very cold-minded, calm and rational. He is very experienced and reserved. While the other, Mills, is completely opposite. He just came in town, working in a new department. He's just gotten married, full of life. often can not control his emotions due to the inexperience. pretty simple and honest character. Thus the movie offers great chemistry of two different characters. The ambiguous, enigmatic and reasonable antagonist is the highlight of the movie. His motives and goals are understandable, explaining the mental and moral downfall of society. The serial killer, named John protested how normal the sins had become. The prostitute, corrupted lawyer, uncontrollably fat scum, arrogant women and etc. they had all just become part of society, like they are ordinary people. The killer finds pretty interesting ways of killing them, according to their sins, making it look like the victory of social justice.<br/><br/>Its needless to mention the greatness of the cast. It's a duo of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, against Kevin Spacey, duh?<br/><br/>To sum up, this movie is the great piece of detective and mystery genre. exploring the dark side of the society and the antagonising ideas of it. The movie offers one of the best endings through character development. Well there are not many movies, where villains win right? not that it bothers me, he was not wrong."

","SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>
The movie se7en, directed by David Fincher and released in 1995 stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Pitt, is a young detective taking place of Freeman, who is an old, grizzled, detective who thinks he has seen it all, that is until this case. 
The goal of our heroes is to catch a new serial killer on the loose. This new serial killer, because of the unknown identity of the killer is referred to as John Doe. After investigating the first of Doe's crime scenes it is unknown as to why these killings were committed. But, after the second crime scene detectives noticed the word ""GREED"" written behind a painting. It becomes apparent that John Doe is committing murders based off of the seven deadly sins written by Dante Alighieri. Soon the other killings follow: Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Pride. After the murder of pride is committed the detectives have hit a dead end. This apparent defeat is short lived when the killer, still known only as John Doe turns himself in. Through negotiations John Doe exchanges a written confession for the detectives to take him out to a field. It is there when a box is delivered to the field with Brad Pitt's wife's head in the box. Before Pitt is made known of it John Doe tells Pitt how much he envies him, thus committing the sixth sin. Pitt, obviously outraged and furious shoots John Doe in the head committing the seventh and final sin: Wrath. The movies with Brad Pitt being carried off to jail and a distraught Morgan Freeman who goes on to retire. 
se7en has strong Christian undertones and themes. The strongest and most prevalent of these themes are Good v Evil, with evil coming out on top by the end of the movie. Now the problem with evil coming out on top is that it paints Christianity in a bad light. John Doe is a devout Christian and that is why he commits these killings. This battle between good and evil is illustrated by Doe committing killings, with Pitt and Freeman being at least three steps behind. And sadly, the ""resolution"" of our hero, Brad Pitt is not really present. But, the ending of the movie does give a message that coincides with biblical truth and that's shoving Christianity down people's throats. Doe states in the movie that in order for the love of God to be spread, he must first display to the world what is wrong with it. I'm no expert but that is not the kindest way of letting people know about the love of God. As stated before Christianity is of main prevalence in the movie. Christianity is not portrayed in a positive light with the main villain being a radical Christian committing multiple murders in order to spread the gospel. 
On the subject of evil being celebrated in the film, one could argue both points. One side would argue that the fact that evil wins is celebrating it. But, the other side would argue that the film depicts not only evil, but the effects it has on people's surroundings and it paints it in a bad light. And lastly, you can only recommend this movie to people with strong stomachs and people that can handle a film taking their religion hostile. 
All in all, se7en is a masterpiece of David Fincher. It's constant suspense and stomach turning visuals will keep a viewer glued to their seat for the entire runtime."

","""Seven"" or ""Se7en"" is an American movie from over 20 years ago already that features 4 Academy Award winners playing the main characters: Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, even if none of them had an Oscar when this film was made. Spacey won the very same year though and it was an amazing 1995 for him. Fittingly, these over 2 hours here are at their best in the last half hour when he visibly enters the picture. I am fairly certain that the greatness of these last 30 minutes clouds many people's judgments about this movie. Lets be honest. The first 1.5 hours are really solid, but not great. The idea of letting a killer commit his murder in style of the 7 deadly sins is a nice one, but the execution in detail left me wanting for more of course. I am not the greatest Pitt or Paltrow fan, but they play their characters well here. And Morgan Freeman is a delight as always for sure.<br/><br/>I personally believe that if they had managed to keep the first three quarters of the film more essential and possibly kept the movie 15-20 minutes shorter, this may have been an even more rewarding watch. The director is David Fincher by the way and after a prolific career of music video direction (and Aliens 3), this film here was his big breakthrough that turned him into one of the A-list directors in Hollywood, which he still is today. Nonetheless, I have to be a bit critical about this film here. IMDb has it almost in the top20 films of all time based on the rating and that is very exaggerated. The critics consensus seems more appropriate. It is probably among the 10 best films of 1995, but nowhere near being an all-time great film. As much as I liked the final chapter here, I would need to be very generous already to call it an all-time great ending. Still, the film is worth seeing at least once for sure and I recommend it, especially if you like the actors."
"datorsiers2","8","0","2","22 December 2014"," Disappointed about the ending :/
","The movie had a high tension built up towards the grand ending and i thought it was gonna something extravagant and awesome, but it turned out to be quite plain, yes, John Doe was the ''envy'' and by killing Mills's wife and her unborn baby, he carried out his plan, hence Mills shot him as his punishment.<br/><br/>That left the last sin - ''wrath'', and Mills was the wrath at the end, since John Doe provoked him to punish him for his envious life by killing him.<br/><br/>The idea was great, got super curious about the ending, but the problem was, that it didn't really seem that John Doe wanted to be a normal man, he was not envious of Mills's life, he was just insane. That part made no sense. Really expected the ending to be way more complex and interesting, however the movie was not bad overall and was quite enjoyable."

The plot twists and murders in that Dexter are just so much more gruesome and interesting than the ones depicted in Se7en that I just wasn't surprised by the ending. I could pretty much predict what was going to happen during the entire movie after watching 96 episodes about a serial killer. <br/><br/>I'm sure it was a great movie back in 1995 and had I originally watched it back than I would probably be giving this a 9/10.

","I admire this film, I really do. It's setup is not the most original. Two cops, one young and aggressive, one old and weary, try to catch a serial killer, whose murders are frankly a bit too gruesome to really exist. And yet, because of the pure acting talent and because of the storytelling ability of the director, it manages to become one of those films that I will remember until the day I die. It's full of shots and scenes that are just so perfect, so fitting, that they instantly touch something within you. There honestly isn't a single scene that doesn't immediately catch your interest.<br/><br/>So, is it a perfect movie? Actually no. I mainly have a problem with the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's a brilliant ending, one that you absolutely didn't see coming, but the logic behind it is a bit faulty. The rest of the murders were all very poetic, full of twisted justice against the sinners. But the final two... they're clever, in a way, but they don't seem to fit the pattern as neatly as the previous ones. But this is me nitpicking. It's still a brilliant movie, whether or not I would have done the ending any different. And I would have, but I can respect the filmmakers' decision to make it like so. There's logic behind that decision. Whether or not that logic fits the logic of the movie is a matter of taste, really.<br/><br/>So yeah, definitely one of those movie that you have to see at least once. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are both immensely talented actors, the style and cinematography are both flawless and the story is masterful. Highly recommended."
"itamarscomix","8","0","1","14 January 2012"," A good thriller
","David Fincher's now-classic neo-noir isn't as shocking as it was 15 years ago, neither in its levels of violence nor in its twisting plot. As serial killer films go, I believe Fincher outdid the achievements of Se7en with the underrated Zodiac - Zodiac's cynical indifference was to me more original and more poignant than Se7en's ominous manipulation. Zodiac's main point was lack of consequence; Se7en pretends to have more consequence than it actually does.<br/><br/>But consequence or not, Se7en remains a perfectly solid thriller, entertaining, gripping and extremely well-crafted. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both give understated but very fitting performances, and the masterful cinematography makes for a very powerful experience, 15 years later. A masterpiece it ain't, but a very good piece of film it certainly is."

","David Fincher is a genius. I love this film, and some people might be turned off by its violent nature, but it really is an amazing crime thriller. A murder mystery tale at its finest.<br/><br/>The cast is superb. Morgan Freeman portrays Detective William Somerset, an experienced crime-solver who has been on the force for many years. He plans on retiring soon, & grows tired of the city's horrors. Freeman excels as a character burdened by the city's dark and twisted web of crime. He just wants to get out. Brad Pitt is also very good as newly transferred Detective David Mills. He's short-tempered and impatient, almost the complete opposite of the elderly Somerset. People don't give Pitt enough credit, in my opinion. He's a fine actor & often overlooked (though he is getting the attention he deserves nowadays).<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also excellent, with Gwyneth Paltrow playing Mill's wife. She is having trouble adjusting to the dark cityscape in which they now inhabit, and fears that something terrible might happen to her in the oppressive place.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple. A sadistic murderer has been going around killing in a way that relates to the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, & Wrath. It's very nasty business. Together, Somerset and Mills attempt to solve the murders. What follows is a dark & complex tale as the detectives race to find the murderer.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is excellent, it's dark and mesmerizing. The city is literally crumbling, and the look is achieved perfectly. The directors & writers really did good work on this, and there is some real emotional weight to the film. The villain is excellent as well (& I'm not going to spoil who he is played by, even though most people have seen this movie by now).<br/><br/>& then ending! What a shocker. Bottom Line; If you haven't seen this, watch it! I'm surprised I'm so dang late on this."

","Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi.<br/><br/>David Fincher is notorious director known for making cinematic masterpieces. I also love his filming style, as his progresses with thought and precision, other than fast-paced filming with no thought. Se7en was yet another film I have yet to see, and the film interested me with it's high ratings and thriller-esque. But when I sat down to see it, I was gratefully disappointed... Se7en started of great. The performances was top-notch, and Fincher did a wonderful job capturing a creepy atmosphere over the film. The movie progressed at a reasonable rate, but the one thing I didn't like was how it concluded.. See, the thing is, I like movies with a twist that cannot be seen from the beginning. Sure, I didn't know John Doe was Kevin Spacey, but the whole head thing wasn't too much of a shock. And the thing was, the whole movie built around THIS; a head. It was highly predictable and highly stupid.. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt worked around to the conclusion reasonably, but it was all too rushed, or maybe too overdone. Now I'm not bashing the film, and the only thing that left me disappointed was the worked up conclusion that gave no sense of thought into it. The film does have the Fincher touch though, and he did a fantastic job with it. See, this is where it comes in again, the TWIST was worked up so greatly. We're watching these murders, the mind-games, and the confusion between it at all. But all this is wasted, truthfully, on a twist ending that made me shriek nor feel anything. The creepiness and everything else was wasted... So I recommend the film if you haven't seen to many thriller films, and can expect a clich√©d twist. Many people seemed to enjoy the film, which I DID, but I think the twist left a bad taste in my mouth. So see for yourself. 6/10."
"xkhushali","9","0","1","19 November 2011"," Excellent movie, Must see.
","This movie is what I call a solid, A+, suspense/crime movie. It was innovative and very well-written. The cinematography in the movie was chilling with most scenes being dark or rainy thus adding to the effect. There is only one focus on this movie and that is Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman)'s journey to find a psychopath killer (Kevin Spacey) who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his guide. We see each murder as a crime scene as opposed to the murders happening; this I thought, added to the suspense of finding out who this killer is. The crimes lead up to probably one of the biggest twists in cinema history. It will have you guessing, what will happen? Everything will go through your head, and you will probably be wrong.<br/><br/>This movie, just like Fight Club, proved that Brad Pitt is not just a pretty face. His acting skills alongside Morgan Freeman are salute-able. Freeman is great in just about any movie just as this one. And Kevin Spacey...his work was phenomenal. His character is probably one of the most remarkable ones ever; and he aced at bringing him to life. Gwyneth Paltrow was also in the movie as David Mill's wife. Her parts weren't too big, but she still did well.<br/><br/>I highly suggest watching this movie if you like a good mystery/scary movie. It will defiantly stick to your head after watching. Movies rarely ever scare me, but this one came really close."

","David Fincher's bleak thriller, about a serial killer that chooses his victims in the order of the seven deadly sins: gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed and wrath.<br/><br/>Grossing $327 million at the box office internationally, Seven was a commercial success. The filming took place in Los Angeles, California.<br/><br/>Plot: In an unidentified city of near-constant rain and urban decay, the soon-to-be retiring Detective William R. Somerset (Freeman) is partnered with short-tempered Detective David Mills (Pitt) who recently transferred to the department.<br/><br/>The detectives investigate a series of murders relating to the seven deadly sins, such as an obese man who was forced to feed himself to death, representing ""Gluttony"". They find clues at each crime scene related to other deaths, and believe they are chasing a serial killer. A set of fingerprints found at the scene of the ""Greed"" murder ‚Äî the fatal bloodletting of a rich attorney ‚Äî leads them to an apartment where they find an emaciated man strapped to a bed. Though he initially appears to be dead, it soon is discovered that the man, a drug dealer and sexual deviant before his captivity, has been kept alive and entirely immobile by the killer for exactly one year to the day. This victim, who dies soon after being found, represents ""Sloth."" Though unable to learn anything from the insentient victim, the detectives agree that the killer has planned these crimes for more than a year.<br/><br/>Somerset is eventually invited to meet Mills' wife, Tracy (Paltrow), who is unhappy with Mills' recent move to the city. Somerset becomes Tracy's confidant, and she meets with him after the first few murders. Upon learning that she is pregnant but has not told her husband, Somerset confides in her his fear that the city is no place to start a family, and reveals that he had ended a relationship years earlier after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Somerset advises her to not tell Mills if she plans to have an abortion; otherwise, if she decides to keep the child, ""spoil that kid every chance you get"".<br/><br/>Using illegally obtained library records, Somerset and Mills track down a man they dub 'John Doe' (Spacey), who has frequently checked out books related to the deadly sins. When Doe finds the detectives approaching his apartment, he opens fire on them and flees, chased by Mills. Eventually, Doe gains the upper hand and holds Mills at gunpoint, but then abruptly leaves. Investigation of Doe's apartment finds handwritten volumes of his irrational judgments and clues leading to another potential victim, but no fingerprints. They arrive too late to find their ""Lust"" victim, a prostitute killed by a man wearing a bladed S&M device, forced by Doe to simultaneously rape and kill her. Some time later, they investigate the death of a young model whose face had been mutilated. Having chosen to kill herself rather than live with a disfigured face, she is the victim of ""Pride"".<br/><br/>As they return to the police station, Doe unexpectedly appears to them and offers himself for arrest, with the blood of the model and an unidentified victim on his hands. They find out that he has been cutting the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints. Through his lawyer, Doe claims he will lead the two detectives to the last two bodies and confess to the crimes, or otherwise will plead insanity. Though Somerset is worried, Mills agrees to the demand. Doe directs the two detectives to a remote desert area far from the city; along the way, he claims that God told him to punish the wicked and reveal the world for the awful place that it is. He also makes cryptic comments toward Mills.<br/><br/>After arriving at the location, a delivery van approaches; Somerset intercepts the driver, leaving Mills and Doe alone. The driver hands over a package he was instructed to deliver at precisely this time and location. While Mills holds Doe at gunpoint, Doe mentions how much he admires him, but does not say why. Somerset opens the package and recoils in horror at the sight of the contents. He races back to warn Mills not to listen to Doe, but the killer reveals that the box contains Tracy's head. Revealing that he purchased information about Mills by posing as a tabloid reporter, Doe claims to represent the sin of ""Envy""; he was jealous of Mills' normal life, and killed Tracy after failing to ""play husband"" with her. He then taunts the distraught Mills with the knowledge that Tracy was pregnant. Somerset is unable to contain Mills as he unloads his gun into Doe, becoming the embodiment of ""Wrath"". After a catatonic Mills is taken away, Somerset is asked where he will be; he replies, ""around"".<br/><br/>The film ends with the sun setting over the desert, with Somerset quoting Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls: ""'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.""<br/><br/>Planned alternate endings for the film: [1] In which Mills is killed by Doe, then Somerset kills Doe. [2] In which Somerset kills Doe in order for Doe's planned way to die at the hands of Mills foiled. Also Somerset states he is doing this so that Mills would replace him at his job.<br/><br/>Verdict: among the best serial killer films ever made. BUY IT!

","The formula has been used before, an experienced and world weary detective (Morgan Freeman) is assigned a veritable rookie (Brad Pitt) as a partner to solve a crime that's about to evolve into a serial murder case. That's pretty much where the similarities end however, as director David Fincher takes us on a compelling, if not sordid ride into the belly of a cinematic beast. Based on the theme of the seven deadly sins, ""Se7en"" is a film you're not likely to forget, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. Though the sin of gluttony opens the story with the gruesome imagery provided by a coroner's description of the crime, the horror only builds as detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) follow the taunting trail of a yet to be identified killer. As the story progresses, the method of the murderer involves some of the most disgusting ways to dispatch a victim, and it's the discomfort the viewer has in imagining these crimes that play such a visceral part of the film's experience.<br/><br/>For all of the picture's implied gore and violence, the most riveting sequence of the film takes place after John Doe gives himself up, leaving the viewer to wonder how this is all going to play out. I must say, Kevin Spacey can be a harrowing presence in a film, and the way he portrays the serial killer is a study in implied menace. His demonic influence overpowers the ride out to the field where he's about to unload both barrels on the pair of detectives. His envy of the lawmen's skill compels the final deadly sin of wrath to bring the picture to a gut wrenching conclusion.<br/><br/>This film is not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for someone who likes their crime thrillers wrapped up neatly with a bow by the time it's over. Somerset certainly knew that ""This isn't going to have a happy ending"", but little could he have expected the twisted result of John Doe's final act of desperate, solemn fury."
"jzappa","10","0","1","7 September 2011"," A Ballad for Modern Apathy
","A bleak, gruesome, horrific and clever thriller, and filmmaking of a distinguished kind, it tells the tale of two detectives, one all set to retire, the other at the outset of his career, and their efforts to catch a jaundiced but cunning serial killer using the Seven Deadly Sins as his narrative. As the film begins, we meet Somerset, a painstaking veteran cop who lives a lonesome bachelor's life in what seems like a furnished room. Then he meets Mills, an impetuous young cop who indeed requested to be transferred to Somerset's district. The two men probe an exceptionally grisly murder, an obese man having been hog-tied and force-fed to death.<br/><br/>His sin was gluttony. Shortly Somerset and Mills are examining similarly creative murders concerning greed, sloth, lust and the like. In each circumstance, the murderous means is fitting, and revolting. Somerset deduces that the murderer, John Doe, is using his crimes to sermonize. The look of this pulp meditation is vital to its achievement. This is a very sinister film, the murk regularly diffused only by police flashlights. Even when all the lights are on in the victims' apartments, they shed merely ashen, despondent puddles of illumination.<br/><br/>While the story is present-tense, the set design evokes the 1940s. Gary Wissner, the art director, uses dark blacks and browns, cavernous shadows, lights of sickly yellow, and a lot of dark wood furnishings. And it virtually always rains. In this cutthroat world of darkness, Somerset and Mills move with increasing fear. Somerset perceives that the killer is using ancient literature as a muse, and researches Dante, Milton and Chaucer for clues. Mills opts for Cliff Notes. A leg up comes with Somerset's feeling that John Doe must have a library card. But the stiffs amass, in bitter thickset detail, as terrifyingly vivid as one sees in commercial films. The few twinkles of soul and hopefulness come from Mills' wife¬Ö One of the most skillfully and innovatively edited contemporary American films, perhaps its most beautiful montage features Somerset in the library researching the Seven Deadly Sins while his friends, the library custodians and guards, share their boys'-night-out loft ritual, with an unexpected blackly comic punch line: When the sequence ends, Fincher hard-cuts to Mills losing his temper at these confounding research materials. The contrast between Somerset's reservedness and erudition and Mills' man-this-sucks horse sense and youthful dopeyness starts to make pretty broad strokes, but there is some charming buddy-cop undercurrent that works without a glitch into the glass sheen of the film's atmospheric tone. It's because Andrew Kevin Walker's script and Freeman and Pitt's chemistry that the film is so moving. For instance, the chasing of John Doe through the streets gives Mills the till-now belated chance to show his bones as an impressive, dedicated cop.<br/><br/>The material independently could've been managed through numerous approach, but David Fincher pinpoints suggestive atmosphere, and Walker writes dialogue that especially for Morgan Freeman is judicious, learned and lyrical. Ultimately, it sinks in that the killer's sermon is being urged directly to the two investigators, and that to appreciate it, they may have to imperil their hearts and their psyches. Fincher's fatalistic noir ballad is distinctive in bringing the killer on screen with half an hour left, and gives him a speaking role. Rather than just being the game of a hunt, he's exposed as a warped yet eloquent enemy, having contrived a hideous plan for finishing his sermon."

This film is one of the best films I've seen in my life. What can I say about Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey and the chemistry between the three. Kevin Spacey he should win the Oscar for this role This film was a must for nominations for the Academy Awards best director, best film Best Actor Supporting Role Kevin Spacey. Script was more than a wonderful and intelligent work of this film. The best scene in the film is the debut of Kevin Spacey when he was screaming at the top of his voice shocked and I was afraid Spacey character in the film was really really scary. Have you noticed the color of the film was dark and the rain was beautiful.Since the first shot in the film to the end, one word will repeat three times. Epic. Epic. Epic.

","Se7en, directed by the at the time relatively new director David Fincher(who would go on to make fight club and the social network), still stands as the greatest crime thriller since its release.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of two detectives: Morgan Freeman as the calm close-to-retirement cop, and Brad Pitt as his young cocky partner. Their partnership may seem clich√©s but the chemistry between the two actors is brilliant. Both actors give some of the best performances of their career's. The supporting cast also does well too including: Gwyneth Paltrow , R. Lee Ermey and Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>The film is told very differently to most cop drama, going for a more depressing look at the world and the city, as the story follows the cops trying to take down a killer who is murdering people in a style of the seven sins. And the story works well throughout with loads of plot twists and turns and a brilliant ending that still ranks among the best film endings ever.<br/><br/>The action keeps moving from fast paced chase scenes to the slowly-paced crime scene investigations. David Fincher manages to tell a moving and emotional story that also mixes little bits of dark humor with some well directed action scenes.<br/><br/>In total if you haven't seen Se7en yet then I'd recommend you go and see it soon, as its one of the best crime thrillers ever made, and features two great actors on top form."
"hatchet39","7","0","1","6 July 2011"," Overrated Masterpiece
","Overrated Masterpiece. I think thats an oxymoron, but its true. This film is a masterful look at a decomposing city and the unfortunate few who happen to live in it. It features great performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman along with Gwyneth Paltrow and R. Lee Earney. I guess I should summarise the plot since this is a review, but didn't you see the movie? Why else would you read an IMDb review? Are you a nerd, like me? But I digress...the film tells the story of two detectives, Mills and Sommerset, who are investigating a series of brutal murders in the form of the Seven Deadly Sins. There you go, ya perfectionist slob. There's my summary. Okay, I'm sorry about being mean so I'm going to describe everything else about the film just so that this will constitute the structures that are built in order to be a review. In fact, I'll indulge myself and create a little meta-review. As said before, Freeman and Pitt (and everyone else yadda yadda) are great in the film. In fact I think Pitts a little like the film: an overrated masterpiece. Seriously, he isn't that good. That is unless if you pair him up with David Fincher or let him star in Babel. Many have praised Fincher's direction post-Se7en as perfection at its best. Many contemporary reviewers, in other word internet nerds (like me!) have praised his direction here. But they seem to forget that they are praising him for praise-sake. His direction here is a little a sophomore in its presentation, lacking the punch of Fight Club (a personal favorite) or Zodiac. Though there is this one shot of the Killer pointing the gun at Pitt's temple. Its simple but I see the depth of the future cinematography of Fight Club. I did right spoiler at the top of this review so I shall spoil. Kevin Spacey is the killer and bloody good one at that. He delivers the part not ironically but with a knowing grimness that Ledger's Joker emulated. He knows what he is doing is bad and he knows that he shouldn't be enjoying what he's doing but he does. And in that comes a great villain. I wish IMDb gave out ""1/2's"" because a seven's undermining the film but an eight would be pushing it. The film itself is good but not as good as everyone says. As a proper ""debut"" (Alien 3 doesn't count) though, its up there with Blood Simple and Reservoir Dogs. That's it I guess. I'm never good with endings but to quote Ferris Bueller ""What are you still doing here? Out Out!"""

","This movie is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There is a lot of originality here. Although the murders in this film do not occur on screen, the aftermath is very disturbing. I really like the storyline to this film. Two detectives are trying to capture a murderer who kills his victims according to the seven deadly sins, hence the films title. For those not familiar with the seven deadly sins, they are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, lust and gluttony. There is good character development, a lot of suspense, some scary moments and it is very disturbing. If you like films directed by David Fincher, I would recommend Se7en. If you do not like films that are filled with disturbing and grotesque images, I would recommend comedy films. If you get the chance, rent it or buy it. You will not be disappointed. It is definitely worth a watch."

"RJBurke1942","Null","0","1","29 June 2011"," Where a misanthrope turned sociopath provides seven deadly lessons.
","On this, my second viewing of Seven (after sixteen years), the flaws in the story and production are more apparent. That knowledge hasn't reduced my admiration and appreciation of this film, however: the script is tight and sharp; the acting is just brilliant; and the photography and editing are all you would expect from a finely crafted thriller that uses dramatic irony, terror and horror to great effect. Add to that the moody mise-en-scene in drab, dark de-saturated color which just makes all of the cityscape so much more unappealing and implicitly menacing.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it, this is the story: a seriously deranged man plans and implements a series of ghastly murders, each of which is thematically linked to one of the seven deadly sins. Beginning with gluttony and so on to each sin, the plot involves the efforts of a thirty-year, world-weary veteran detective, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) ‚Äì Somerset is appropriate name because he's on the eve of his retirement to his rural property ‚Äì and a gung-ho hotshot youngster, David Mills (Brad Pitt), who together begin the task of sifting through the deliberately planted clues to hunt down the killer. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Mills' wife, Tracy, and does a beautiful job with the few scenes she is in; more importantly, she acts as the linchpin for the final horrific ending.<br/><br/>So, to that extent, it's normal fare for a crime thriller (recall, for example, The Bone Collector or, more recently, No Country for Old Men).<br/><br/>What sets it apart, to a large extent, are the succession of extremely bloody and violent crime scenes we see as a result of each murder, leaving no doubt in viewers' minds about the cruelty exhibited by the killer. Frankly, it's much better filmic technique for developing the character of the killer than witnessing each murder in action (for which we should be thankful, in my opinion).<br/><br/>The story is set in an unnamed city (but was shot mostly around Los Angeles) and it's raining most of the time. Actually, not quite: it's raining on cars when there are interior shots in autos but, in the background, it's mostly sunny, quite obviously. A slight flaw, I know, but it's very obvious on second viewing. More serious, in my opinion, is the story itself: the whole premise of using the seven deadly sins as thematic, murderous underpinnings for each crime lacks credibility. In the real world, it's just not believable ‚Äì the sine qua non, after all, for excellent story-telling ‚Äì when all of the factors about the killer's preparations and implementation are revealed. Hence, to that extent, Seven is fantasy.<br/><br/>Granted, The Bone Collector (1999) suffers in the same way. But, not so No Country for Old Men (2006). And still the best, recent example of believable story about serial murders is The Silence of the Lambs (1991).<br/><br/>Still, if you like unrelenting suspense build-up, then Seven is a movie to see, for sure. Apart from the good aspects already mentioned above, I have to include a minor spoiler and make special mention of Kevin Spacey who plays the role of the killer: if ever there was a guy meant to play the role, it is he. Even though we see him only in the last half-hour (except for a brief moment in the second act which, if you're not alert, you will miss completely), he dominates everything as only Spacey can.<br/><br/>You can theorize about the rationale for making the movie (other than as money-maker) as an indictment of modern city-living, a commentary on the base nature of humanity in general, or as an extreme example of how the dark side of personality disorder can wreak urban havoc ‚Äì or all three, of course.<br/><br/>Don't bother, is my advice; just sit back and...be entertained, perhaps? Overall, I give it seven...hmmm.<br/><br/>July, 2011."

Needless to say, and with the benefit of hindsight I thought it was quite dull and very boring.<br/><br/>10 years later and boy did my opinion change. For now not only do I consider this film to be a masterpiece, but also the single most extraordinary film I have seen since I first watched James Cameron's Titanic in Jan 1998. <br/><br/>Shot through what can only be described as a grainy grey lens, the film highlights the ambiguity of it's characters by drowning the city and in it's landscape in a hopelessness reflective in the killings. It is also invariably raining in the film, which also adds to a sense of depravity and despair amongst those who inhabit this place of woe. <br/><br/>John Doe (the offender) is breathtakingly realised by ***** ******(I won't give it away) and Pitt and Freeman both work brilliantly together as their on screen alter ego's work tirelessly on the case at hand, whilst all the while deliberating on such themes such as morality, redemption and whether or not the guy they're after is just another fruitcake or something much more...<br/><br/>So to conclude: Se7en is astonishing throughout, with mesmerising direction, perfect casting and a top notch ending worthy of the award for the greatest film ending of all time...Se7en..it'd be a sin to miss it."

One of the main beauty of this film is, as the movie tends to become much more serious and tragic, it pulls you into the mood of the movie itself, rarely a great motion picture can do that but Se7en was able to. For those who think Brad Pitt is just some commercial pretty boy (I thought so myself) this movie indeed proved me ever so completely wrong, this is one his finest movies, Brad Pitt is defiantly one of the best actors lurking around Hollywood, along side with veteran and lovable actor Morgan Freeman who also delivered outstanding performance like he always does in his movies, all and all, Se7en is a great marvelous film, the reason I say it can be watched once in a lifetime is because the ending breaks you down psychologically and it's a one time experience, watching it again and again will give you pleasure of a great movie but not the ending feel."

","Superbly crafted mystery about two detectives, one a veteran (Freeman) one a rookie (Pitt), on the hunt for a serial killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. Isn't dated and is an instant classic. Ermey and Paltrow are well-cast as supporting characters. Scary, thrilling, memorable; but predictability is nearby, and even the climatic twist doesn't appear to be as shocking as intended. Some of the characters' back-story (specifically Freeman's) seems to be overly developed and completely unnecessary to the plot at hand.

"michael418","8","0","1","23 February 2011"," Superb Thriller Marred by Brad Pitt's Awful Acting
","Comparisons to The Silence of the Lambs (SotL) are apt: this film is directed with all of the skill and taut suspense of that earlier masterpiece. Se7en, like all of Hitchcock's best films, and like the fore-mentioned SotL, builds tension through suggestion and atmosphere. There is very little actual violence or gore in the film, but what is SUGGESTED is horrifying. The cinematography is superb: the film almost physically feels dirty and grimy. Darkness pervades all, and by the end of the film I had the doors all locked and felt a curious urge to bathe myself, to scrub off the filthiness and evil that is omni-prevalent in the film. It knows the creepiness of silence and emptiness, and the scariest portions of the film are usually also the most uneventful. The score is good and matches the visuals nicely. The acting is almost perfect: the background roles all do their job well, Morgan Freeman is convincing as a seasoned and cynical investigator, and Keven Spacey is brilliant as the unhinged, moralizing serial killer. Brad Pitt, however, is an awful actor, and he is the one thing I found really wrong with this film. Actually, most of the movie he was adequate but irritating: I just accepted that the character is supposed to be cocky and irritating as well and moved on. But the ending... let's just say Brad Pitt almost ruins what is one of the most shocking endings in cinematic history with his inability to act. Otherwise, the film is nearly perfect, but because Pitt's acting broke my immersion in the film during the climax, I can only award it eight out of ten stars. Hopefully people will learn to keep him far away from roles that require any actual acting."

","In a dark, gloomy city where the rain never stops and the signs of urban decay are everywhere you look two detectives hunt down a serial killer. The first detective is William Somerset, about to retire and desperately looking forward to a quiet life in the country away from all the urban misery. The second is young hotshot David Mills. He is to be Somerset's replacement and he can't wait to get started. He actually asked for this assignment. He relishes the opportunity to deal with the worst of the worst in this hellish city. Of course he has no idea what he's in for. Somerset knows. Or at least he thinks he does. Because not even wise, old Somerset could possibly anticipate the events which are about to unfold. These two detectives, one on the way in and one on the way out, will be forced into a reluctant partnership as they work one chilling case. The dead bodies begin to pile up and Somerset and Mills get more than they ever could have bargained for. And quite possibly more than they can bear.<br/><br/>Somerset and Mills find themselves investigating a bizarre and horrifying series of murders. By the time the second body turns up it is clear that an obviously deranged, though also obviously intelligent, killer is planning on murdering one victim to represent each of the seven deadly sins. A morbidly obese man is forced to eat himself to death. Gluttony. A rich attorney is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. Greed. And so on. The killings are gruesome. The killer, dubbed John Doe, is a man clearly capable of unimaginably monstrous things. And somehow Somerset and Mills have to stop him before he completes his set. Before he completes his deranged sermon to the world. It all makes for one morbidly fascinating movie. And one with a unique twist. Serial killer movies generally go one of two ways. Either they show you the killer all the way through as you watch him do his bloody work. Or they keep the killer invisible and focus solely on those pursuing him. This movie leads you in one direction and then whips you around and turns everything on its head. Rather brilliant stuff.<br/><br/>As we watch Somerset and Mills do the old cop/young cop routine we've seen in so many other movies the contrasts between the two are exceedingly obvious. These are two very different men, attacking the John Doe case from two very different perspectives. Somerset is calm, collected, a thinking man. And Morgan Freeman, with his quiet dignity, portrays this perfectly. Mills is a man more about action than thought. He's brash, emotional and a little immature. You get the sense early on that this is a man who may not be ready for what he is going to have to face. In playing this part Brad Pitt has his ups and downs. It's not a bad performance by any means but there are moments where the character's words and actions don't really ring true. Mills comes off as being a little too insecure, and at times downright childish. The contrast between Mills and Somerset is supposed to be obvious, and supposed to be a major theme of the film. But at times the contrast is just a little too stark to be believable. Even in the incredibly tense, drama-packed finale Pitt's Mills comes across as much too whiny and immature. His reactions to what he is confronted with just don't seem to fit. Perhaps Pitt went just a touch too far in displaying all of the insecurities and personality quirks which make up Detective Mills. But it's nothing bad enough to really detract from the overall movie-watching experience. Director David Fincher crafted something rather special here. So much more than just another serial killer movie. It's smart, it's riveting, and in the end it's quite jaw-dropping. Maybe Pitt is just adequate. But Freeman is brilliant. And one other performer is even better than that. But that final, perfectly fitted piece to this puzzle you have to discover for yourself."

She who lived with Pride had her nose cut off to spite her face. It is then a choice given by Doe for her to call for help and live the rest of her life without a beautiful face, or to take her own life. He who committed Sloth was bound to his own bed for an entire year where he soon after swallowed his own tongue and deteriorated in both mind, body and soul. Those who chose Lust were forced to perform a sexual act wearing a strap on with a slightly sharper point them normal. The prostitute was raped, killed and had her genitalia mutilated in the process and the client had to live the rest of his life with what he had done to her in order to save his own life.<br/><br/>All events in this film are politically poetic enough to make your puke and despite if you have a weak stomach, I advise that you do not give this film a miss.

","Se7en is the very interesting film about a serial killer using the seven deadly sins to kill his victims. That part of the plot alone should urge you to want to see the film, period. It's such an original concept. The writing goes farther than just the psycho killer stuff. It's much deeper and more emotional than that. From start to finish you never feel distant from the characters or the story. <br/><br/>From watching the Siskel and Ebert review I started watching this expecting to get this NC- 17 material that slid past it's R rating. I'm not sure I understand why everyone thought Se7en was incredibly disturbing. Is it? Yes. But you don't see any of the actual murders, just the aftermath. Then again, I am very used to disturbing elements in films, so I may have an immunity to it. <br/><br/>The performances from it's leads are the backbone for the film. Freeman and Pitt, very different roles, very different performances. Freeman's performance is nuanced, but still as effective as Pitt's, who has the showy, obnoxious role. He never fails to show us his intensity. Kevin Spacey's extended cameo here stands out as one of the best performances of 1995. With not even 10 minutes of screen time, Spacey walks away with the film. <br/><br/>Se7en is a suspenseful film, but I look at it more intellectually, rather the entertainment value, though it's very entertaining. It's not as scary as many people think. You're not getting a Scream or Halloween here. You don't see much of the violence...you get to imagine it in your head. And that's what's most frightening.<br/><br/>Mesmerizing from beginning to end. It's close to perfect, what is keeping it from being perfect? I'm not sure, it's some weird conflict at the beginning of the film. It doesn't drag you in at first, necessarily.

He was the best actor within the group. But I would point to Andrew Kevin Walker again, as he created and actor proof character, but Spacey delivered.

","When it comes to genres being overdone in Hollywood, the Murder-Mystery is at the top of the list, and only a select few ""heavy hitters"" come to mind. The film most widely accepted as the best murder mystery is ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", which I would have to agree as well as ""Rear Window"" and a few others, but where ""Seven"" stands out in this genre compared to others is in the film's dark, innate ability to tell a gruesome murder story set in a crime addled side of New York City. The character interactions are incredibly played out as well as it's cinematography, but this film is so dark, grisly and shocking that you literally CAN'T look away from the screen for the two hours it plays out, it grabs your attention like a drill instructor at boot camp and doesn't let go until it's over. The cinematography was captured beautifully and reminded me slightly of ""The Dark Knight"". Take note though; this ISN'T your average murder mystery, at many parts it is VERY disturbing and is most definitely not for kids, but what makes it so good is the gritty unrelenting realism of crime in the big city. ""Seven"" is so well done and has so many twists and turns in it, that I constantly found myself at the mercy of the surprises. Even at the end when you expect the story to take on a lighter path and maybe show a little redemption, it gets even darker and more sinister. After Morgan Freemans' monologue at the end you get the overwhelming sense of the true realism this story has to offer over all others of it's kind.

The Seven Deadly Sins, also known as the Capital Vices or Cardinal Sins, is a classification of vices propagated by the early Christian Church as being the most objectionable and immoral. They fit within St Augustine's rhetoric in terms of fallen humanity's tendency to sin. The list consists of gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. ""Seven"" incorporates the literary references of the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" into a compelling but shocking serial killer story.<br/><br/>Brad Pit, in one of his best performances, plays a rookie detective, David Mills, teamed with veteran and soon-to-be-retiring Detective William Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman in one of the best roles of his unequaled career. They are investigating a series of ghastly homicides in an American urban center that seems a helluva lot like Chicago. The veteran detective has seen almost everything an urban cop can endure during an average career before the beginning of the story. However, as events transpire, they reveal things even he, after decades on the force, hasn't experienced. The rookie has no idea what's in store for him, and by movie's end he will have sustained the most horrific experience of a police detective coming-of-age ever shot on film. We get the sense all rookie detectives go through a kind of ""baptism of fire"" but nothing which would prepare a newbie to the force something as simultaneously horrific and devastating as that presented in ""Seven"".<br/><br/>Unlike the usual street crime, these murders have a disturbing combination of dreadful horror coupled with high literary intelligence. The killer incorporates religious and literary symbolism into his acts of unspeakable violence and murder. Each act and victim reference a different ""Deadly Sin"". The killer may be mad but he is an highly intelligent madman, who could probably quote Dante while loading a Magnum 44. The well-known actor who plays the killer/religious fanatic who reveals himself toward the end is perfect casting.<br/><br/>Hollywood rarely produces films with such a combination of horror and high intelligence. The closest comparable film is ""Silence of the Lambs"" whose character Hannibal Lecter is strikingly similar to the fiend in this film, although their motivations are entirely different. Both of these characters, the killer of ""Seven"" and Hannibal Lecter, are homicidal sociopaths of uncommon literary knowledge, which communicate disturbing overtones of higher purpose. They are the type who would probably view the act of crucifixion as an artistic statement.<br/><br/>This is an incredible film both in its dreadfulness and its cerebral content, but definitely not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. As for myself, this is probably the limit in terms of the disturbing meter--worse than this would be out of bounds. Despite the gruesome subject matter, this film has enough compelling elements, from the literary references to the relationship between Pitt and Freeman, that it does work as a masterpiece of the serial killer genre. And the ending is one of the most compelling and original conclusions I have ever witnessed in this type of film, but don't expect the main characters to be celebrating with beers at the end. There are very subtle hints during the film which point to how the movie's ending will unfold, but like most movie-goers during my initial viewing, the ending erupts like a dragon flying straight out of Hell."
"Anthony_gunner","10","0","2","7 April 2010"," The best thriller
","The movie ""Seven"" is very certainly the best thriller I have ever seen. In addition of an excellent casting composed of two of the best actors of Hollywood, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, this film has an excellent script. Indeed, even if in the beginning it seems to be very classic with a young and inexperienced detective and an other one who is old and about to retire himself, it is rather different from the other films of this genre since the acts of the murderer are based on the seven deadly sins, which make his murders sadistic and spectacular. Which impressed me the most is the atmosphere which is dark and oppressive, the scenes are poorly enlightened, it rains almost the movie, the murders are violent and bloody."
"poolandrews","8","0","5","2 April 2010"," Brilliantly gripping thriller.
","Se7en starts as rookie homicide detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) is paired up with veteran detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is set to retire in seven days time. The first case they are called to is that of an obese man who has been forced to eat himself to death, then a lawyer is found dead with the word Greed written in his own blood by his body & upon checking the obese man's apartment the word 'Gluttony' is found written in fat & grease. The connection is made & Somerset believes that a serial killer is at large who has some higher motive & is using the seven deadly sins as a moral reasoning behind his brutal crimes. Somerset is sure that he will strike again & he does, as more mutilated & tortured bodies turn up it emerges that the killer is playing a macabre game that will see him & his crimes remembered forever...<br/><br/>Directed by David Fincher this is quite simply a marvellously gripping serial killer thriller that is as good as The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & is considered a classic, as I write this comment Se7en is placed at number 26 in the IMDb's all time top 250 films as voted for by the ordinary person who uses the site (not stuck up critics) & who am I to disagree? The whole production blends together seamlessly to create a truly gripping & absorbing thriller, from the gloomy production design to the terrific acting to the wonderful script & it's character's. It's easy to be drawn into the world of the two leads as they search for a serial killer, Freeman's fantastic performance as Somerset in particular is great to watch, he is thoughtful, precise, likable & smart in an ordinary bloke sort of way while Pitt as Mills is his opposite who is naive & immature. Together they make a perfect contrast of character's & they feel like real people. The script has some great twists & turns but the big one at the end is a real show stopper, it's a great twist ending that just works on so many levels & is brilliantly executed. Se7en has it's seedy, sleazy & gloomy moments but it tries to paint a world where sin is accepted all to freely, there are some great speeches here especially by Somerset that indicate all is not lost but it's easy to see that the real world is full of the sin that is punished here & that we also just accept to readily so it even has a strong relevant social message that does have meaning but at the same time but the script still manages to make a terrific dark thriller out of the ideas here. Lasting for two hours & not being the most action packed film ever patience is definitely needed but I do think the twists & plot do hold ones attention very well, for me the two hours flew by & it didn't feel that long which is always a great sign & one that the film didn't bore me & maintained my interest throughout right until it's killer twist ending.<br/><br/>The film looks great with dark & gloomy production design that suits the downbeat seedy world created in the script. There are some gruesome murder scenes & shots of dead bodies although little in the way of actual on screen violence (the killer is never seen killing or hurting anyone on screen for instance), the special effects as expected are top notch (just look at the obese man's corpse on the autopsy table). People make mention of the fact it's always raining in the city scenes but apparently this had nothing to do with thematics or style or the makers vision but because during the first two days of Brad Pitt filming it was raining so to avoid any continuity issues the makers decides to make it rain during all Pitt's outdoor scenes. Apparently the brilliant Canadian director David Cronenberg was offered the chance to direct but he turned it down, imagine how good this might have been if he had accepted? Denzel Washington was offered the part of David Mills that went to Brad Pitt while R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe was considered for the role of the killer.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this was New Line Cinemas first big budget 'A' film & it made a load at the box-office, filmed in Los Angeles in California the name of the city where Se7en takes place is never actually mentioned on screen. The acting is superb all round, Freeman is excellent as is Kevin Spacey & R. Lee Ermey while it was nice to see Shaft himself Richard Roundtree.<br/><br/>Se7en is a terrific serial killer thriller that has a great script, a great twist, super acting, good effects, striking production design & a fair bit of depth. There aren't many films I would call classics but maybe Se7en would be one of them."

","""I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue."" ‚Äì Detective Somerset <br/><br/>David Fincher's ""Seven"" sees rookie cop Brad Pitt hooking up with veteran detective Morgan Freeman. In typical cop movie fashion, Freeman is due to retire in a week, but a spate of violent killings pulls him back on the job, the serial killer committing ritualistic murders inspired by the seven deadly sins.<br/><br/>The first act of ""Seven"" is rife with clich√©s: a hotshot rookie paired off with a wise old timer, a serial killer who loves toying with cops, a narrative which bounces from one lavishly decorated crime scene to the next etc etc. Throw in the obligatory foot chase, library scene, motor mouthed police captain (Lee Ermey) and an aesthetic which owes a little too much to both ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The X Files"", and you'd think you had a fairly routine serial killer movie on your hands. Only you don't.<br/><br/>Fincher creates a festering world, dank, putrid and forever bathed in rain. More interestingly, his narrative goes to great pains to reverse the trend found in most serial killer movies. Whilst most genre films treat their killers as monsters, deformed and different from us, ""Seven"" challenges our view of monstrosity and paints a world in which the monster is us. ""We see a deadly sin on every street corner,"" John Doe, our serial killer states, ""and we tolerate it! We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial!""<br/><br/>Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust are everywhere, even in Morgan Freeman's wise detective hero, the moral centre of the film. ""We're no worse than he is,"" Freeman says, sympathising with John Doe and chastising others for labelling him insane. Both men are teachers in their own way, both trying to fix the world, Freeman by arresting the guilty, Doe by killing them outright. Doe, without history, family or fingerprints, thus becomes a kind of symbol for man's collective guilt, trying desperate to shock the world out of apathy.<br/><br/>These themes are summed up best in a throwaway bit of dialogue when Pitt asks the owner of a prostitution parlour whether he likes the things he sees around him. ""That's life,"" the guy shrugs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the message is not only that we are all guilty, but that in creating ""relative"" versions of guilt, society only degenerates into a kind of mass indifference. ""It's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life,"" Freeman says at one point. ""It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it. Hell, love costs: it takes effort and work."" <br/><br/>The film ends with Freeman quoting a line by Ernest Hemingway ‚Äì ""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."" ‚Äì and then stating that he agrees only with the second part. The world's cesspit, but it's worth fighting for.<br/><br/>Fighting for a better world is, in a sense, what Fincher's ""Fight Club"" is about. Released at the tail end of the 1990s, the film belongs to a group of films (""Magnolia"", ""Safe"", ""The Ice Storm"", ""American Beauty"", ""Fight Club"", ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Fear and Loathing"", ""Far From Heaven"", ""The Savages"", ""Happiness"" etc) which sought to explore middle class resentment, each seeing American life as being empty, mundane or a suicidally dull bore.<br/><br/>Post-war cinema had long worked out its existential issues with a variety of masterpieces (cf Antonioni, Bergman, Ray, Minnelli, Sirk etc), but then came two decades of excess and so stupor. When American cinema finally re-woke up to its deep rooted malaise, it tended to skirt around the issue. Fulfilment thus became a sexual problem, all these films revolving around white males who seek empty flings and biochemical bliss. ""Fight Club"" belongs to this group, though here sex becomes a kind of bare-backed man-on-man homo-erotic violence. Elsewhere Fincher attacks rampant consumerism, and highlights a perceived loss of masculinity in our modern society by having his hero, a wimpy Edward Norton, gradually becomes his alter ego, the animalistic Tyler Durden. Tyler represents Norton's repressed animal nature and sense of rebellion. It is through Tyler that Norton ‚Äì who spends the film drifting from one support and rehabilitation group to the next ‚Äì learns to lash out, creating a underground boxing club which eventually evolves into ""Project Mayhem"", a terrorist group which seeks to tear down modern civilisation.<br/><br/>But the great joke of ""Fight Club"" is that the film subtly mocks the fantasy image of Tyler Durden. Durden, the manly anarchist and poster-boy for raging male hormones, is ultimately just another ineffectual support group. Another product to buy into. <br/><br/>What's offensive is that, whilst the film acknowledges that reactionary forms of rebellion don't work ‚Äì capitalism absorbs and internalises all attacks - and that raging against the usual figureheads are empty gestures (Norton wants to blow up credit card data-banks and beat up his boss), it's unable to point to either any real solution, or any actual ""cause"". This would require artists who are actual geniuses.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings."
"bman75","9","0","1","11 March 2010"," A Stunning Thriller
","Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt star in this incredible thriller about a killer that mimics The Seven Deadly Sins through his murders.<br/><br/>Se7en is a fantastic, dark, and gritty thriller with many twists and a incredible climax. Morgan Freeman being one of my favourite actor's in film, delivers a fantastic performance and presents a very compelling character for the film. Although not being a fan of Brad Pitt, he still performs well in this movie and both the actors compliment each other. Freeman however, steals the spotlight for most of the movie mostly due to the character that is created and how compelling and well thought out he is.<br/><br/>The story does start off a little slow but it really does pick up after about twenty to thirty minutes in. It keeps you guessing on what will happen next and will keep you on the edge of the seat. The ending of the movie I feel was the best part of it all. I will not say anything about the ending but I'm sure it will shock you.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a fantastic movie and I would recommend it to any adult who is a fan of the thriller genre. Go see it."

","I always get excited to see serial killers movies, even when they're bad, it's a very entertaining and complex genre and always gets my attention. But what makes ""Se7en"" so great?<br/><br/>In it's first sequence we are introduced to William Somerset (Freeman), an old and quiet Detective that is indignant because of how decadent and violent his city has become. Now let me say that the only mistake of the movie is that it tries to tell us how hopeless humanity has become, but it is not true, it's so not true, that they never mention the name of the city they are in, if it's NY, they would have to show the charm and beautiful NY, if they were talking about California, they would hake to show all that Californian glamour, the one that looks more like the city of the movie is Vegas, but then again, they would have to show the rich part of it, there's just no town as decadent as that one.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about it's good parts, and they are not few, every single thing in this movie is very well explained, which is admirable in some movies, and in others not, but it's great in this one because it makes you wait, not only for the final part, but for every scene you're watching, it grabs you in a way that deserves applause.<br/><br/>The acting is not brilliant, but great, except for Spacey's outstanding one, that gives the character an air of superiority and serenity that make him sound even reasonable sometimes. If the movie didn't have an ending it would already be great, but not happy with that, Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher made one of the most shocking ending you'll ever see, that image burns so deeply in my mind that when I remember, it gives me goosebumps.<br/><br/>Verdict: This dark, gory and complex picture will stay in your mind forever... Now, stop what you're doing, and go see this one!"

","David Fincher has always had a very different style from that of other directors. Whether it is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's drowned out feel or Fight Club's frenetic hipster camera-work, it's Se7en that definitely is his best film. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give excellent performances while the script engrosses the audience. Any way one looks at it, this film is great and there's no doubt about it.<br/><br/>Se7en follows two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) in their search to find ""Jonathan Doe"" (who later appears as Kevin Spacey), a murderer who has been leaving crime scenes that follow the Seven Deadly Sins. Freeman is great as an old, wise detective who is ready to retire while Pitt only good as a cop turned detective who is looking for action. Pitt's wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, makes for a good secondary character who is constantly trying to relate to the two detectives in their search. As the detectives push further to solve the case, the crime scenes become grislier and tensions rise in the corrupt, rainy unnamed city.<br/><br/>There's many great things about Se7en, but one of the best is the opening credits. One might ask how the opening credits can be so great, but it must be seen to be believed. The opening credits consists of many cut together shots of someone, presumably ""Jonathan Doe"", creating a disturbing notebook of photographs and letters set to music that is barely even music, but rather just creaking. Most of the shots are shaky and overexposed and yet so beautiful. How is it possible that something so beautiful? Only David Fincher could achieve a sequence so effective. The credits set the tone wonderfully through the movie and, if watched very closely, clues to the plot can be unlocked. If anything, the credits are worth a look.<br/><br/>To continue explaining Fincher's greatness, one must explain how he creates the tone of the movie and what he does that makes the viewers feel disturbed by the end of the movie. Although there is almost no violence on-screen, the crime scenes are enough to make people feel sick. Every shot in the movie is very dark and almost hard to understand. There are no shades of bright colors throughout the whole movie. These dark shots, which may remind many viewers of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, give the film a very gloomy feel that no other film really does. Combine the shades of black and gray with the gruesome crime scenes and one gets a very dark and creepy movie.<br/><br/>There really is no other way to say it: Se7en is quite an amazing movies. There's some brilliant direction from David Fincher (as per usual) and great performances from the cast. The movie is thrilling and at the same time brutal forcing audience members to wonder whether or not they would like to finish the movie. Roger Ebert once said that a true film buff sees films that nobody else has heard of. I must say that I disagree. To become a true film buff means seeing movies like this and then appreciating and understanding them. It is a movie like Se7en that stands the test of time and is universally regarded as wonderful by movie buffs and everyday movie watchers alike."

And there is a good FBI strategy for finding possible criminals.<br/><br/>They do not question anyone besides one of the dead man's wife. They do not really go after the criminal.<br/><br/>He had to come to them.<br/><br/>The villain's plan with the 7 deadly sins is great.<br/><br/>Also the family affairs of Brad Pitt and Gwyneth were a little too much.

"ennieday09","10","0","1","8 October 2009"," My favorite movie of all time for a number of different reasons
","Se7en is unlike any other movie I have seen before. This movie made me realize the genius of David Fincher. Each scene developed brings a different mindset to the audience because of the surreal art direction that gets into the psyche of the viewer. Each moment on screen gives you a feeling of what it is really like to be in the mind of someone who is insane. Andrew Kevin Walker writes a story that is daring, complex, and brilliant.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman inspecting the first murder and the different personalities each detective has in the way they work. Brad Pitt's rebellious attitude and Morgan Freeman's old school antics is a great team of bold and brass. As each murder occurs, we can see the different reaction it has on the detectives and the way their stature is shaken by these events. Each different gruesome murder found increases the shock factor for the audience. To think that one man can do such manipulative and sadistic acts leaves the viewer stunned and wanting more. David Fincher couldn't have created a more suspenseful and elaborate plot to keep the audience on edge.<br/><br/>While Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play their role to a T, the real star of the movie is yes SPOILER: John Doe himself as played by Kevin Spacey. The shear brilliance of this character is amazing and makes you uneasy with how intellectual and cunning he really is. The famous scene in which he gives himself up to the cops leaves you saying WHAT?! WHY?! and asking many other questions. While this is his first appearance on screen in the film, the presence of his character only gets better as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The second most famous scene to me has to the be the long monologue the two detectives and John have in the car ride on the way to the murder scene. This to me is one of the most memorable pieces of dialog in any movie i can remember. The genius of this scene is shown mostly in the ways Kevin Spacey answers the questions the detectives throw at him. Example when he questions Detective Mills about the fact that the people he murdered were innocent, actually leaves yourself questioning, Is John Doe really the evil one, or is society the devil itself? This was just a prelude to the most amazing ending to any movie I can remember.<br/><br/>After the long car drive to the scene where John Doe is supposedly showing the detectives where the last two victims of his grand scheme are held, the unexpected hits you like a speeding bullet. In my opinion, I believe that the majority of the people who watched this movie think the last two victims were Mills and Somerset themselves and John Doe was just luring them to the be the final victims of his masterpiece. But David Fincher and company leave you with your jaw dropped and eyes wide open. As the scene progresses, a van is seen coming towards their direction. A man comes out saying he is supposed to deliver a box to a Detective Mills at this time. At this point I'm thinking what in the world could be in that box? Is it a bomb? But as Detective Somerset goes to investigate the box and John Doe says that he admires Detective Mills life, it all slowly starts to piece together.<br/><br/>Once Doe mentions he admires him and his wife Tracy, everything starts to make sense. Once you find out Mills wife Tracy's head is in the box you are left speechless with eyes glued to the screen and cannot look away. John Doe's famous line, ""It seems that Envy is my sin"" is one of the biggest twists in movie history. And finally telling Detective Mills, ""Become vengeance, Become wrath"" is still one of the spookiest lines spoken on film to date. When Doe is shot and everything is over, you honestly have no idea how you feel. Its an assortment of feelings like amazement, sorrow, shock and disbelief. A great film is a film that you can watch over and over again and not get bored. This was one of those movies for me.This is by far my favorite movie off all time and if you watch this classic, maybe it will become a personal favorite of yours as well."
"dust-7","Null","0","1","22 September 2009"," Strange and inconsistent
","Pitt is miscast. This film is supposedly about a killer finding victims to 'hash' with the seven deadly sins. It's still a rather arbitrary selection. The killer is almost supernaturally agile. When we discover it's Spacey, the audience says - huh? But somehow we believe him in the role, and forget about the agility earlier on. But not Pitt. Freeman narrates (as he does in films) with his dialog to try to paint Pitt as impulsive. But Pitt's character is controlled, and insecure. He's more worried about how people see him than he is to run into a burning building to save a puppy. While Pacino would have been too old to play 'the kid', someone more like Pacino would have been better; nervy, neurotic, quick to assume, etc.<br/><br/>They get a lead on Spacey, after figuring out they have a cluster of serial murders to begin with, by saying to themselves - now what kind of books would a vicious torturer check out of the public library. And I said - . . . . ? wha? I guess we take 'googling' for granted these days. Back in the day, everyone got their info by checking out public library books? What's more, Freeman is tied in to an underground source network that can get him FBI or CIA or whatever data. How does that matter? Well, you see, apparently the FBI or CIA or whatever was keeping track of who checks out which books from - the public library. So they ran a list of books and got back Stacey's name. They go to his apartment, he's coming down the long hallway with some groceries. They see him. He sees them. He pulls a gun and starts shooting. Suffice to say, he climbs the buildings and run the streets of the city better than Spiderman. And he corners Pitt on the ground, puts a gun to his head, but then runs.<br/><br/>Next we know, Spacey comes into Pitt's police station, covered in blood, and surrenders himself. Pitt and Freeman say, they guy's going for seven murders. They had only five at that point. Spacey says, I'll show you guys. But it has to be youse guys. They say - show us.<br/><br/>So they drive out into the desert by a cluster of electrical towers. And they stop for Spacey to lead them off into a field. There's a chopper shadowing them. But only Freeman notices a van barreling towards them. He jumps in his car, blocks the road, and orders the van driver out. Meanwhile, Pitt has Spacey kneel and Spacey takes the moment to reveal his dastardly plan. He's already visited Pitt's home. He's abused his wife, murdered her, and chopped off her head. And he says - that's her head coming now. Van driver says he got $500 to deliver a box. Freeman looks inside the box. Pitt on the radio asks the question. And by the time Freeman drives back to Pitt and Spacey, Pitt is just about to pull the trigger. So Freeman says - don't do it. But he does it and gets hauled away for murder. Spacey was counting on Pitt to shoot him as the seventh - whichever sin Spacey's character associated with himself. I didn't catch which he though was the wife's sin.<br/><br/>Like I said, a Pacino type would have been much better in that role played by Pitt. It's difficult to get the 'message' of the movie. Usually, the cops are shown covering up for one another. So, here, the logical thing to have expected was that the chopper crew saw Spacey lunge for the weapon, with Freeman backing them up on that. Instead, they haul Pitt away. If the 'message' was don't let emotion overcome you, again, in most films the cops are shown covering. So - blam! - dead serial killer . . Pitt gets a trophy, roll credits. At least Freeman might have mentioned temporary insanity - the supposed defense in Gothika where such also wasn't mentioned."

","If you were Mills what would you do? I wonder what those who so vigorously oppose the death penalty would have done if they were in the place of Mills; if they honestly could place themselves in his position? Seven presents an interesting prologue for a reasoned discussion of capital punishment. One has to wonder how often those who so vigorously oppose it are able to empathize with those who are thoroughly victimized by evil, wanton and vicious killers. Typical of movies they never take you into the future life of the main characters (sequels never quite do it). It is only assumption imagined by the author or viewer. However, the discussion is valid in debating the future of Mills vis a vis Somerset's philosophy, John Doe's philosophy, and Mills chosen course in the ""wrath"" of the moment, as well as the likely course if things had continued in the legal system, and the insanity defense was chosen. In any case Seven provides an opportunity for meaningful thought on the subject."

The movie was very shocking (so it makes it interesting to watch).<br/><br/>4. Well described psychotic killers intentions.<br/><br/>5. No boring moments (you can feel an intense in every minute).<br/><br/>6. Good actors performance (aspecialy Kevin Spacey's performance, i couldn't imagine him playing a psychotic killer).<br/><br/>7. Clever cops (the detectives used interesting ways to get information)."

","Intentionally gloomy and unintentionally drab, Seven can be a difficult movie to watch for many reasons. The murders are shown and described in their most gory form. However, for a crime thriller, the movie moves at a surprisingly slow pace and the plot (beyond the brilliant idea of using seven sins) is almost too basic. Understandably, this movie was also to serve as a tirade against society and a critique of crime-ridden cities. But what the film loses in thrill value in achieving this is hardly justifiable, especially when the whole premise of this movie screams a feverishly fast and an intricate battle of wits. The film owes a lot of the accolades it receives to the 'brilliant' twist in the end. However, this film came at a time when the idea of a twist was a fairly novel concept. So, if you have sat though most of Chris Nolan's and Shyamalan's work before seeing this, you could out-think twist in this movie , and perhaps even expect it. That though is not the film's fault. It is watchable for its intriguing premise, good performances and subtle commentary. However, don't be surprised if it fails to fulfil your appetite for a real crime thriller."

","The scene in which David Mills(Brad Pitt) shows his anger towards a news reporter(actually the murderer in disguise) is perhaps the most important scene in the movie.This scene asserts that David is the eligible ""Anger"" victim.In my opinion the movie is not about capturing the murderer but the craftiness the murderer shows to complete his mission.Honestly think of Se7en with different ending then perhaps se7en would have ended in trash bin.<br/><br/>The combination of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt was definitely a strength to se7en.Kevin Spacey as cool John Doe was perhaps the strongest performance in this movie.All victims faced violent deaths and se7en would remain etched in the viewers mind for a long time.I wonder if girls loved this movie.<br/><br/>8 for se7en"

","In this analysis the number system based on 12 using 7 is analyzed as symbolic under the Christian Orthodox faith. This case deals with visual-audio signals used by a serial killer professing to be a judge of 7 deadly sins. By his judgment actor Kevin Spacey plays the role of the executioner.<br/><br/>What does 7 really mean from the Bible. The 7 Churches of Ephesus in Persia were well known during the time of Jesus Christ in the Middle East. Does 7 really have a symbolic notion underlying a meaning that is a numeration of sins recognized by the Chatholic faith that are meant have no other judgment but death by the nature of that sin, and carnation.<br/><br/>Judgement of life questions the essence of spiritual energy that for Roman Catholics is the Holy Spirit. As for philosophy of science we are determined to have free will or determination to act. This is the duality of Jesus Christ where people are utilized due to the essence of the Holy Spirit from the father for political science and administration of justice. Thus, the motives of actor Kevin Spacey in this film as analyzed by actor Morgan Freeman as a detective are based on a catalog of environmental stress over time that manifests itself as becoming a good judge of people. The climax ending is the truth to the plot of Seven, that actor Kevin Spacey is his own Jesus Christ with the above understanding of an Orthodox viewpoint and mundane references to numerous accounts of how the number seven is used in the Holy Bible.<br/><br/>I question the plot of this film based on the use of numbers as with other television shows such as the Electric Company from Public Broacasting System (PBS), and Himitsu Setai Goranger. As based on natural science theory and philosophy of science as the Freemansons utilized history and great minds to create new technology they manipulated numbers. Other than for analysis key historic dates were 1717 and 1919. I think an argument can be made as much as why the number seven is a focal point but of little value in the Holy Bible as numbers are used by Freemasons to establish brotherhood, or occult.<br/><br/>Personally I would like to see the actor Morgan Freeman and actor James Earl Jones appear in a film plot as wise men traveling to see the Emperial Chinese family of the Han Dynasty for information to save their people. As found by the valuable silk road into Africa, where the stars are used with ancient astrology. They in turn exchange stolen information about an Egyptian djed."

"sannelehmann","10","0","1","21 July 2005"," Body language
","""Se7en"" is one of my all time favorite films. It has stayed with me ever since my first viewing. I must have seen it 6-7 times and I still get a quiver down my spine, when I watch certain scenes. I don't think I can say this is true of very many other films.<br/><br/>I think the reason why this film made such an impression on me is because it speaks to the intellect thorough the body and visa versa. It makes it evident that although western civilization has subscribed to the vision of the separation between body/mind, we cannot separate these to entities in our experience of reality. We cannot exactly determine whether we make decisions based upon gut-reactions or if we make them through reasoning.<br/><br/>The first part of the film plays mainly upon the capacity of the viewer at imagining physical pain. The best example being the pimp who has been lying in his bed for a year, but who is still alive. The first time I saw that scene, I felt nauseous and disgusted. I thought of it as a straight forward gut-reaction, this man who has suffered such pain, and he is still alive.<br/><br/>The darkness of the city, the bleakness of the future for people living there coupled with the acute presence of tenderness in the characters also strikes me. Once again I had a very physical reaction to the scene where Somerset speaks Mills' wife about her being pregnant. Although he himself has chosen not to bring up children in such a harsh world he says ""If you decide to have them, spoil them every way that you can."" Every time I see this scene I find myself crying.<br/><br/>When we finally reach the end of the film, when we are transported from the rainy dark city to the open and nowhere-to-hide place where John Doe wants to deliver his package. The dialog of the serial killer has the same effect on me every time - I get a stomach ache... The brilliance of it all being that I cannot exactly explain where this stomach ache comes from. Do I get a stomach ache simply because this man is such an eloquent incarnation of evil? Or is it mainly because I cannot help but agree with some of the things that he is saying? ""Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial.""<br/><br/>John Doe has a lot in common with Somerset, who also feels despair at the way of the world: ""I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was virtue.""<br/><br/>John Doe's actions, his evil master plan marks him as an insane person, who has transgressed the taboos of a ""civilised"" society, even though his deed was to punish other transgressors.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we have had to imagine all the terrible deeds that John Doe performed on people of - granted - questionable moral dispositions. We get to see him, and listen to his tale. However appalling his actions are, the actual fact that I as a viewer can agree with some of the things that he is saying turns the physical nausea of imagination from the first part into a kind of intellectual nausea... How can I agree with him even a little bit? This in turn once again creates a physical reaction - a stomach ache. I get a physical reaction as a response to my own reasoning.<br/><br/>It reminds me that we all have some type of evil within us, we want pedophiles and evil lawyers to get what they deserve. We can imagine doing something to put things right. But we wouldn't ever do it - that would make us insane. We can imagine this exactly the way the film has let us imagine the pain afflicted, but not let us see it.<br/><br/>In short, my fascination with this film comes from the fact that it speaks to the intellect through the body and visa versa. It shows me how experience cannot really be separated into body/soul. At the same time as it shows me exactly how much I experience the mind and the body to be two separated entities.<br/><br/>A true masterpiece!"

The way John Doe rationalizes his behavior makes me believe that there are such people out there and that is freaky. The movie is of course absolutely brilliant, true David Fincher style. Each of the murders is so grotesque , its almost a celebration in his camera. The most mortifying scene for me is the manner John Doe kills his 'LUST' victim. Most people miss out on the subtle humor in the movie when they see it the first time ; the conversations between Mills and Somerset crack me up. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie. For a movie that's 10 years old, it still beats other creepy movies like Ringu for its sheer reality."

","Seven is unique movie in very many respects. It belongs to that subset of movies that combines thriller with aspects of religion, though, without resorting to supernatural forces (Stigmata, Green Mile, etc.) which turn off many people, including me. The movie is indeed an epic-it is the epic of one person, a serial killer, who weaves together his seven murders with the seven deadly sins, such that each victim is a practitioner of the sin, hence making him/her complicit in his/her murder according to the murderer. Though the serial killer cannot be the protagonist by definition, the charisma that he commands and the legendary feat that he accomplished dispels the Foucaultian myth that ""the Man is Dead."" Just one, simple man, through ingenious plotting and scheming, creates a religiously inspired masterpiece and leaves the rest of us in ""shock and awe."" The darkness of the movie is unrivaled. I first saw in Turkey, and later many many times in Chicago, and the revealed darkness makes more sense in an American context. Since Bladerunner, I have not encountered a movie so dark and captivating nonetheless. Apart from the fabulous plot, characters contribute a lot to this success: Brad Pitt is the impatient, young, high tempered tragic hero, a role he will turn to many many years later in Troy. Morgan Freeman-the great detective as always. And Gywenth Paltrow does a great job as well. This movie is the defining movie-masterpiece of the 1990s and a must see for anyone."

","Se7en<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10. Directed by David Fincher.<br/><br/>When I first saw 'Se7en' eight years ago, I thought that I'd never see it again. The first viewing left me in a horrified and miserable mood. Even though I felt the movie was really well made, the dark empty feeling was so intense. Eight years later, I find myself viewing 'Se7en' for the eighth time. So on average, I see this movie once a year. It is still intense to view, but much easier to take in, yet on each viewing, I notice little details that I missed on previous viewings.<br/><br/>'Se7en' follows the story of a deranged killer John Doe played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey. John Doe viciously kills his victims, treating his acts as sentences for those who sin.<br/><br/>Investigating the murders are Detective Somerset played by Morgan Freeman, and Detective Mills played by Brad Pitt. As their investigation goes deeper, the two detectives find themselves subjugated in John Doe's plan.<br/><br/>Some quotes from 'Se7en':<br/><br/>William Somerset (Morgan Freeman): If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil, I mean if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations, but he's not the devil. He's just a man.<br/><br/>
William Somerset (Morgan Freeman): This guy's methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient. <br/><br/>David Mills (Brad Pitt): He's a nut-bag! Just because the f#@ker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda! <br/><br/>
John Doe (Kevin Spacey): We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night.

"oliertripp","9","0","1","24 April 2003"," A Thriller Which Dares To Think
","Morgan Freeman has always been an extremely distinctive actor, be it his hair, his voice or even his general appearance. But he is also an excellent one, with this 1995 thriller being one of his finest roles to date. At first you think this film is just your bog-standard serial killer thriller, albeit an impressively shot one. However, as the film progresses, you realise that this film also deals with serious moral issues (witness the killer's denial that he has killed 'innocent' victims) and generally exudes such an overwhelming sense of depression it's hard to believe sometimes that you are watching the supposed real world. Throw in extremely brutal and sick killings, with the razor-edged dildo being a particularly gruesome standout, and excellent performances from Freeman, Paltrow and Pitt (who's arrogant, hot-headed Detective Mills is the template for his electrifying performance as Tyler Durden in the director's later film Fight Club.) But the real honours must go to Kevin Spacey. His serial killer 'John Doe' is a terrific role to play and he does so with admirable flair. The expression on his face when he is about to be shot by Mills makes your skin crawl and your flesh tingle. All in all, this is an extremely impressive film, which really needs to be seen on DVD in all its gory glory. Although perhaps not quite as brilliant as Fight Club, it is a journey into a place that you will never want to enter. Ever."

Also there are implications near the ending that Brad Pitt did not go home after John Doe got caught and he mentioned he should call home or do something like that but he did not. When I saw the three guys driving along I was wondering who would die. At first I thought John Doe might have set up some trap to kill the two detectives. But when I saw the box I knew at once that Brad Pitt's wife's head was in it and Brad Pitt would kill John Doe.<br/><br/>To me this movie is not as good as the Usual Suspects. The characters are not interesting. The plot is so so. Seven sins, so what?! Nothing is left in my mind after viewing it."

","""Seven"" was one of the best detective thrillers I've seen in years. Fast paced, somewhat realistic despite Pitt's terrible acting ability in almost everything he does.  A notable scene comes to mind with that said.......where he's got the gun pointed at Spacey and screaming when he knows what's in the box........that has got to be some of the WORST acting I've ever seen.  I believe that Keanu Reeves might be able to do a better job, or maybe even Kathy Ireland would have done a better job as well. Anyway, despite all of that, the movie is STILL quite gripping.  And yes, just because someone is a bad actor/actress doesn't mean that the movie they play in can't be great! Seven is one of those examples!  Morgan Freeman, one of the greatest American actors today held that movie together along with Spacey as far as I'm concerned!   Definitely worth a look!"

","On the subway today, a man came up to me to start a conversation. He made small talk, a lonely man talking about the weather and other things. I tried to be pleasant and accommodating, but my head hurt from his banality. I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him. He was not pleased, and I couldn't stop laughing.'<br/><br/><br/><br/>David Fincher's `Seven' is a beautifully crafted film about something more then it seems.  The whole film seems as if it is an orgy of gore and gothic themes, but (simply) it isn't.  `Seven' seems gory but truly on a visual basis it isn't.  It gives you thoughts that will make you think different. It is so mentally visual.  There is hardly anything in it, visually, that would shock you.  Yet people seem to refer to it as a gory disgusting film, I disagree.  It makes you think about everything and makes it worse if it came right out and put it on the film.  I am surprised to say but as I look back on every film I have seen this situation has never come up.  This is the only film really to gross the viewer out without doing anything amazingly shocking, visually.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It (like all of Fincher's films) is so different from everything else out there.  I love its `evil look' sort of like everything was under water then uncorked dry.  It has a `wet' texture and such a beautiful light to it. It does so much more then it could have done.  Not falling for right angle turns in the plot, or stupid one liners.  It is different and undoubtedly stylish.  The film centers around a serial killer who has been centering his murders around the seven deadly sins.  Two cops, one about to retire (Somerset), and one new on the job (Mills) are put on the case.  The film seems so simple but truly is one of the best cop movies ever made.  It is a very disturbing masterwork that has beautiful direction by one of my favorite directors David Fincher.  The film would not be anything if it weren't for him, he brings his style to the film like Scorsese or the late Kubrick did.  His direction is flawless and it always has been.  In his other two films (Fight Club, The Game) he seems to direct with perfection as those are both very amazing films.  His style is so obvious you could see a scene from any of his films and know who directed them.  Plus it is so very involving with the brilliant acting of one of the greatest actors of our time Morgan Freeman and one of the greatest up and comers Brad Pitt.  Some deceive Pitt as a pretty boy but the man can act beautifully and this film is his best film along with Freemen's.  The film is a character film, it has so much depth in cinematography and so much punch to it's plot that it gives the actors their chance to shine, plus it opens the door to one of my favorite actors (can't tell it would spoil it).  The sick part of this film is that I sympathize with the killer he is truly right.  But in the end, wrong.  Still he does have a point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>`We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. And what I've done is going to be puzzled over, and studied, and followed... forever.'<br/><br/><br/><br/>`Seven' at it's heart is a statement on the worlds declining morality, Like `The Godfather,'  `A Clockwork Orange,' and so many before it.  It shocks but makes a very important statement with that shock, we as people are evil and not fearing of any consequence.  `Seven' does this perfectly it seems to tell you one heck of a good story and give the viewer something to think about about.  The film is one of the only pieces of art the nineties brought.  It is one of the best thrillers ever made and one of the smartest. David Fincher's `Se7en' is a must see film and one of my favorites.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

How did it even get there? How did Somerset know to slip his knife through the door at that exact point in the door? I bet the editors were kicking themselves after they missed this one...<br/><br/>The conversation in the bathroom when they are shaving their chests for the wires. I believe Mills said something like ""uhh"" and then somerset says ""huh?"" I thought I had dozed off and missed something but the person I was watching this with had the same thought: ""What the hell was the point of that?"" I was waiting anxiously to find out what Mills was holding back only to be left hanging. Now a big flaw but noticeable.<br/><br/>When Doe dropped his grocery bag and started shooting I was definitely surprised. I believe the only reason for this was to give the detectives a reason to chase him, and thus get Mills in the situation where Doe puts the gun to his head for a few seconds and then leaves, foreshadowing that Doe still has some purpose for him. I could easily conceive of a few better ways to write that part... and I'll have to echo someone else's response that it seemed like they were chasing the phantom of the Opera. This was the only ""cheesey"" part of the film, and compared to everything else, it just didn't fit.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film was incredible.

","I must say this is one of the best movies of all time but there are a contradiction, a logic mistake in the movie that I can't get around.<br/><br/>The fulfillment of John Doe's horrifying plan is based around David Mills (Brad Pitt) and his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow). John Doe envy Mills wife, that's is sin. And when Mills kills him he is punished and in the same time Mills wrath is punished by letting Doe win and the fact that is wife is dead.<br/><br/>
The plan of John Doe has been planned for a long time. The victim of sloth has been tied up in his bed precisely a year. So we can be sure of the fact that John Doe has planned it at least a year.<br/><br/>We also learn that Mills and his wife have recently moved to the nameless city because of Mills new job. They have only lived there four a week or something.<br/><br/>Then we can see that when John Doe started his sinister plan he didn't know about Mills and his Wife. His sin wasn't obvious.<br/><br/>Of course we could say that he could have picked another woman, another victim for his own sin (envy). But then it wouldn't have been an inspector. Freeman character is unwed so he is excluded. It had to be an investigator of the gruesome murders to have worked the way he had planned.<br/><br/>This is just a thought that I got. But I don't see anything wrong about it.

I don't want to go off on a rant here, but having 2 cops walk around in the rain merely going into apartments for nearly two hours bores me to death.  The ending was cool, but hardly makes up for this sad attempt.  You want disturbing?  You want a REALISTIC portrayal of violence in the mind of a serial killer?  Forget watching Seven, watch Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.  I dare you to watch both these movies and say Seven is better.

And how could the detectives be part of the plot?  How could he know who would be assigned or what their circumstances would be?  What if they took an extra three weeks to find his hidden clues?

"pigmanfilms","7","0","1","1 August 2001"," A disturbing murder mystery
","In my opinion this is one of the finest murder mysteries to have come out in the 90's.  Sure, the movie had a fairly unoriginal plot and structure, but so did Gladiator and Braveheart, and they won best picture.  But that's not even the point, the point is, the movie works with the structure and plot. <br/><br/>
The film is a well put together investigation film with an interesting idea. Add to that, the fine performances of Morgan Freeman and John Doe(I can not tell you who plays him for fear of giving away something).  And usually I don't like Brad Pitt but he fits his role in this film perfectly.  Also, there is the new and innovative shooting style of David Fincher which have become some of his signature trademarks: the dull lighting, bleak atmosphere, always accompanied by a feeling of dread.  Some people have complained about how it always rains in the film but I feel that it only adds to the movie's distinct feel."

","I did not see this movie until recently.  I had seen Fight Club on DVD, and decided that Se7en may be worth my time, especially, because friends had seen it while it was in theatres, and they were disturbed and agitated by it.  While there is nothing really terrible about the movie, it did not excite or move me.  I got neither the superficial thrill or the profound revelation that I like to get from movies.  The problem for me was my ability to predict how the movie would end, particularly, since I am usually very poor at this."

","First off, all the stuff that has already been said but should be reiterated anyway: Writing, Plot, Acting, Cinematography, Directing are all A+ here. But the thing that really strikes me about this film is how sympathetically John Doe is portrayed. This is rarely done (if ever) in mainstream cinema because it alienates a good portion of the audience. Se7en does it in a great way, however, because while the portrayal may be sympathetic, it doesn't make the mistake of making him an anti-hero. While the movie understands the reasons for his crimes, it still recognizes that he is a monster. Not for everyone, but deffinately a movie worth seeing."

Morgan Freeman delivers a top notch performance and R. Lee Ermey (Drill Sgt. Hartman from ""Full Metal Jacket"") delivers a surprising performance.

"tyler.exley","Null","0","1","27 July 2000"," Inconsistent, but tries hard to be clever.
","I watched Se7en on video last night, for the first time after its theatrical release in Germany on 23 November 1995. At the time, I thought it was brilliant and saw it a total of four times in theatres, both in English and dubbed. I was in particular impressed by the character of Lt. William Somerset.<br/><br/>That is the crux of the problem. Last night, viewed from a distance (in time), I wondered about, among other things, the Lieutenant's name. What is the connection between W. Somerset Maugham and the character played by Morgan Freeman? Is a literary allusion intended to provide the movie with a pseudo-intellectual touch? Impressive.<br/><br/>What irritated me most, however, were the script's many inconsistencies. Examples to illustrate the point: SPOILERS ALERT 1) Let's accept the assumption that the FBI compiles lists of indexed titles and keeps tabs on those who take them from libraries. Any person who has ever accessed a database knows that in order for a search to produce results as accurate as the ones yielded in Se7en, the search criteria must exactly match the results (and vice versa). How on earth did the two detectives know exactly what titles John Doe had taken out?<br/><br/>And if, in order to get a library card, you must provide identification, why would the killer, smart as he is, supply his real address and a name like 'John Doe'. How would a librarian react when confronted with a name like that? Suspicion is the word, I believe.<br/><br/>2) On the drive out of town, to the scene of the two last murders, John Doe rages against the notion that his victims were 'innocent'. What about Detective Mills's wife and her baby, in particular the latter? Why did they have to die, even if John Doe's self-admitted mortal sin is Envy? That makes a total of nine victims, not seven. And if death is, in Doe's opinion, the punishment for each of the mortal sins, how can he be sure that Mills will be executed for shooting him? And why did one of the victims (Pride) have an, at least minimal, chance to save her life?<br/><br/>3) In the scene in Doe's apartment, Somerset comments that it would take a team of 50 men a whole month of 24 hr shifts to read all the notebooks. I wonder how long it took Doe to fill them.<br/><br/>4) At the dinner table in the Mills's apartment, David claims that they found out about its proximity to the subway/trains only after they had moved in. The real estate agent is supposed to have shown them the place briefly only, though on more than one occasion. Now, even though the city is unnamed, it is large, with regular subway/train traffic, let's say at intervals of 10 minutes. I wonder how the Detective was suckered into renting the place, in particular as it seems to be a large apartment, looking at which would definitely take more than ten minutes.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief should be the basis of watching most movies, but Se7en stretches the demands on credulity rather thin."
"the dude-3","7","0","1","10 April 2000"," An Overblown Sermon
","If ever a movie was completely represented in one of its characters, ""Se7en"" was it.  (possible spoilers) The two preachers of the film are John Doe, the character portrayed by Kevin Spacey, and the director, David Fincher. Fincher's film has a purpose just like that of John Doe's murders, to shock American into recognition of its major faults: its sins.  Unfortunately Fincher's point is lost in his bombastic and brazen style which dominates all of his films.  Fincher seems to be quite the cynic in his view of the world.  In ""Se7en"" there's not a person in the world, or at least NYC, that's not a sinner, and we're living on a veritable hell on earth.  ""The Game"" presents a paranoid world where no one's life and security are concrete and ""Fight Club"" shows us just how superficial of a culture we are. Unfortunately, Fincher also seems to be an optimist at heart, and this is where his films lose their potency.  At the end of each film he tries to give some glimpse of hope.  At the end of ""Se7en"" Morgan Freeman quotes Hemingway, saying ""'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.""   At the end of ""The Game"" it turns out the paranoia was only part of an intricate joke and ""Fight Club"" falls apart on itself when(among other things) it tries to present some sort of solution, which was, best as I could tell, love.  If only Fincher didn't try to provide some sort of happy ending(albeit minimal as in this film) his films could be much more powerful(like Neil Labute's ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors"".)  He makes his point and then unfortunately loses it in an overblown style and ludicrous attempts at happy endings. Compared to the rest of his work though, ""Se7en"" is his most effective film to date with fine performances by Freeman and Spacey."

","Other reviews discuss the plot of this thriller.  In this review, I only wish to highlight that Seven is vastly superior to most serial killer movies and is worthy of Alfred Hitchcock.  David Fincher gets convincing performances out of all his players (even Brad Pitt).  The film drips with dark atmosphere and claustrophobia.  This film will be remembered long after most films of the 90s (and 80s) are fading memories.  A throwback to American cinema's courageous years - the early 1970s.  See this movie."

"benzene","4","0","7","6 November 1999"," I don't know what everyone sees in this movie.
","I don't understand why people think this is a good movie.  The plot is predictable yet not really believable, the hero is unlikeable and the villain, who is supposed to be the movie's moral foundation (go figure *that* one), ultimately pulls the rug out from underneath the movie at the end.<br/><br/>The scene where Brad Pitt allows the killer to escape was irritatingly hard to believe.  And what was the Gynneth Paltrow character's (not to mention her unborn child) sin?  The killer was careful to choose people who (at least in his mind) deserved to die yet at the crucial climax he completely broke with his pattern in a most incredible way.<br/><br/>And where does a ""moral"" serial killer come from?  Seems like an oxymoron, but of course in the end we see that he's not moral after all.  Still, the whole concept rings hollow and leaves one wondering what the point of the movie was anyway?  It seems like it was just a story created to give the film makers a chance to show grisly murder scenes one after another in an attempt to shock us.<br/><br/>If you want to see a much better movie along these lines (and much more disturbing because it's believable), watch ""Henry, the Portrait of a Serial Killer.""  And be sure to give it a higher vote than this turkey."

","[NB: this review may contain a semi-spoiler]<br/><br/>Congratulations on crafting such a wonderful work of life-affirming art, I DON'T think. I saw this movie on the TV last night; I'd had no particular expectations of it, though I'd heard it'd been given big raps. All I can ask now is: why? Seven - sorry, 'Se7en' - is burdened by, well, a ridiculous contrivance of a title; intellectual pretension masquerading as profundity (half-baked references to Dante, Thomas Aquinas, the Bible, etc, etc); an oh-so-creaky plot full of holes - think on this once you've seen the movie, people: what if the killer had decided to BUY all his literature? Whither then, Mr Magic FBI guy? - and an extremely bleak outlook on just about everything that does nothing for me, at least, in the 'reasons to want to get out of bed tomorrow morning' stakes. The ending is, in a word, gross. (Not to mention able to be spotted coming from a million miles off.) Why are joyless, heartless movies like this made? Sure, it'd be no fun if every other flick was 'It's a Wonderful Life', but... it's not my cup"
"MovieAlien","Null","0","2","27 August 1999"," One of the worst movies ever made! Bar none!
","Nothing redeeming here. Just an endless hash of grizzly torture and murder scenes, all of which err from a very bad childhood nightmare. (And you could tell this was done as more of a shock value then for chill.) That's not the downer of this movie, there's so much more. It was poorly written, directed, acted. To explain it's betrayal of genre, there was no suspense in the movie. In order to have suspense, a character must be in peril in some way or something unpredictable and shocking must happen. Nope, not here. Scene after scene was just discoveries of these gory brutalities, all of which were boring just as they were unpleasant. An overrated movie is one thing; It's the hype and the style of a film's release. But here, I don't know why anyone would like this. It's a terrible movie!<br/><br/>Lets look at the perfomances. There was no momentum or sympathy in any of the characters. Brad Pitt was a young smartass cop who couldn't stop using four letter words, Gwyneth Paltow delivers one of the most empty performances of the 1990s (this is someone who got the Best Actress Oscar only a few years later!) and Morgan Freeman is sadly miscast. I'm surpised he still had his contract after this. And Kevin Spacey, as the killer, geez, what a joke!<br/><br/>Does Kevin Spacey scare you? Now, he was psychologically taunting in the Usual Suspects, but otherwise...no. If Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, or Donald Sutherland approached me on the street, I'd be terrified. If Kevin Spacey approached me, I'd feel as if a small kitten was begging me to feed it.Why? The three other actors often play characters that are errie and macabre, eventhough they're unfortunately typecast. Spacey is only a little calmer than neurotic. Do you see the difference there?<br/><br/>This movie was a mess. Imagine falling into a puddle of dog excrement and having the stench on you until you get home to wash it off. The after-feeling of watching ""Seven"" is similar to that, except it takes a long time (or maybe never, in some cases) to clean the filth off.<br/><br/>One of the worst movies ever made. Avoid it like the flu!"
