","In the case of this movie, the Oscar was well deserved. The film was nominated in the wrong category, though ('Best Foreign Language Film'). It should have been up for 'Best Picture', 'Best Original Screenplay', 'Best Director - and it should have won all of those. As far as I'm concerned, this may very well be the finest film on the subject of war - or conflict in general - that was ever made. I've never seen anything similar; this film manages to show so many aspects of war, of human nature; it somehow manages to capture the essence of something that is inexplicable. Truly one of a kind and a must-see. And don't think for one second that this is some pretentious drivel or slow art-house fare - this is very much the opposite. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","i hate it when reviews go over the plot in detail. some scenes are there just for the reason of creating ambiance, mood. they might build up a story for the next move by a certain character, etc.<br/><br/>This is why i despise the only review above.<br/><br/>The movie is not a romantic picture you'd take your date out on Feb 14. Well, neither Feb 15, 16, and so on.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is not ""overdone"" as Saving Private Ryan. As usual in life, it's got some humor, some drama, some mediocrity, some insanity. I'm not much of a critic, just a normal person, but i totally believed and ""lived the movie"" with the actors. They played beautifully. All of them. All three were outstanding by my standards ( again, which might be low for a critic )<br/><br/>What i can comment on with more understanding is camera work. 10 out of 10. Nothing extra to distract you from the main line. Even drama is in small doses, not to lose you in your own feelings.<br/><br/>It is not entertainment. It is more of an art. Watch it. Alone. And reflect on it."

","I'm glad the IMDb featured this flick as its movie of the day, it is a great film and one which I think a lot of people passed over because it has... (shudder) sub-titles. : ) I am always aghast at some people's reactions to ""foreign films"" (in other words not Hollywood-produced), much less if it actually requires you to READ the dialogue. If you like war movies (and I am talking about those war movies which have you contemplate the brutality and morality of armed conflict, not those that glorify it... although those can be fun too) then you will... well perhaps ""enjoy"" is too strong a word as I found parts truly horrifying, not in a ""look at the gore"" way but in a ""man is a terrible beast"" way... so let's say ""captivate"" you with its intensity and what I felt to be an honest assessment of war and this conflict in particular. Greatly acted and a great idea behind the movie, this film gets 10/10 from me, though as I mentioned it is not the same 10/10 a LOTR or Star Wars gets, this movie is not a popcorn muncher but one that will get you thinking and keep you thinking long after the credits finish."

","Three soldiers one Serb and two Bosnians are caught up in a countryside trench in no man's land between Serbian and Croatian lines, while the UN unwillingly gets involved in the situation because of media pressure.<br/><br/>This film is a critical satire of the meaningless of war and on how no one wants to get involved- but actually sit back (the UN) and watch or actually film the carnage (the media). It depicts the bleakness of the war, the UN's involvement and the intruding media presentation of it in black humour and sharp sarcasm, while still the suspense and the humanity of the situation doesn't get discarded- but makes it more fascinating and quite constructive.<br/><br/>The intelligent script and story are very fresh in portraying the madness of war and also building up the tension that never falters, as we see how much the two countries hate each other, with the soldiers continuously blaming each other for the war and the stupidity of the situation that they are in. It was definitely an unpredictable and confronting war story that didn't try to manipulate the circumstances for a change- but actually draws you into the mess.<br/><br/>The thing is at first you don't feel any for sorrow for the soldiers separately, as they are no worse than each other- but then after while we come to know them in detail and see their point of view. The main hatred you feel is towards the UN Leaders, as they sit back, unwilling to budge, while their soldiers sit around wanting to help... you would know what I mean especially at the end of the film, as the ending really does pack a punch and makes you question humanity.<br/><br/>Not only the UN's priorities and methods are questioned- but also the artful and shallow media that see this as good news scoop then actually coming across as caring for the welfare of the soldiers. There's one quote that provides that point from a news reporter that declines to film the bunker and explains that when you've seen one bunker, you've seen them all which is pretty ironic, well you'll what I mean when you see it.<br/><br/>The performances are impressive and truly absorbing from the three soldiers caught in this mess: Branko Djuric as Ciki, Rene Bitorajac as Nino and Filip Sovagovic as Cera . This film reminded very much of 'Three Kings' in the humour side of things, but also the grief you feel for those involved in the war- but 'No man's land' is far more involving and far less buoyant than 'Three Kings'.<br/><br/>What you get is a solid anti-war film that keeps you gripped to the end and when it finishes, it definitely leaves you pondering."

"Coventry","7","78","155","10 October 2004"," You started this war!... No, YOU started this war!!
","First of all, I think it's a shame that this film isn't listed under its Slovenian title 'Nikogarsnja zemlja'. Anyway, what we have here is quite an impressive piece of work. Danis Tanovic wrote and directed a debut that easily is one of the best films since the new Millennium. Seemly without trying, Tanovic succeeds in bringing what so many other directors desperately attempt and fail: namely a satirical attack on the absurdity and uselessness of war! But without losing grip on the suspenseful and credible story, an that's an extra achievement. The story is simple but efficient and stuffed with little ingenious findings and subtle sarcasm. No Man's Land involves three soldiers  two Bosnians and one Serb  trapped in a trench between the two fronts. One of the Bosnians is wounded and lying on a mine that will explode and kill everybody in a range of 50 metres. While he carefully tries not to move an inch, the other two soldiers are bickering about what side actually began the war. There's a group of UN soldiers trying to help them but these people are constantly facing obstacles, intrusive press people and obnoxious superiors that prevent them from saving the trapped soldiers. Tanovic sense of clever dialogue and his courage to openly condemn the situation in his homeland make this one of the most admirable films of the last few decades. I'm really really glad that this No Man's Land won the Academy Award for best foreign language film over that dreadfully over-hyped 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain'. One of the best choices the Academy ever made!"
"Danijela-B","10","41","77","6 January 2003"," A unique point of view
","If this film is anything it is a true bite of reality.  It does not preach or provide a drawn out moralizing conclusion.  It does not take sides or provide possible solutions to a well-publicized conflict.  What it does is that it provides a point of view of a director who has indeed seen it all and has been able to tell a story full of dark humor, satirical and comical, but most of all tragic.  It is rare for a director to succeed commercially and/or critically coming from ethnical background that he is without compromising the story that is not easy to tell. Furthermore, this is not a Hollywood commercial product; having an excuse to use the conflict as the background in order to show some exquisite fireworks of shooting, escapades and a whole row of already recognizable clichés. What makes this film worth more that one watch is that it takes human life at its most vulnerable, that it is about communication or lack of thereof, the excellent use of international cast and different languages adding to the confusion of an understanding the conflict that was truly not understood by anyone."
"mighty_pickman","9","36","68","10 August 2003"," One of the best war films of the past decade
","This is a great film & fully deserving of it's best foreign language film. No Man's Land never tries to follow the well-worn path of other films involving enemies both stuck in the same dangerous situation.  The two main combatants never become friends during their ordeal (as shown at the end of the film & little trust exist between the two (they are both only interested in their own interests, not the other).  Infact the most clear thinking & compassionate of the three soldiers caught in the trench is the one who can't get up because he is lying on a mine that could kill them all.<br/><br/>This film doesn't take sides in the conflict, it's more a human story than a war story, if any side is made to look bad, it's the UN.<br/><br/>Credit must be given to the Bosnian film industry on their handling of such a horrific part of their recent history in such a strong non-judgmental way. No Man's Land & another Bosnian co-production, Saviour, both stand as two of the best films on the subject of war made in the past decade.  Both films avoid making statements on how was right or wrong in the Yugoslav conflicts that rampaged throughout the 1990's but show the hatred & division they have caused throughout the region. 9/10"

","This is a deeply disturbing film that everyone should see. It brings home the true insanity of war and the total depravity of the human mind.

","The movie talks upon three soldiers , one Serbian and two Bosnian who are trapped in a trench amidst the contenders lines during Servia-Bosnia Herzegovina war in 1993 , at the time of the heaviest fighting between the two warring sides . One Bosnian finds himself unlucky hooked to a bomb that in movement case can cause blow-up . <br/><br/>It's a sour denounce facing the war realized with dark humor . There's a keen critic to the role of United Nations , ¨U.N.¨ , in which two soldiers from opposing sides in the conflict , become trapped in no man's land , whilst a third soldier becomes a living booby trap . The screenplay tackles issues about the war horror , morality and ethic but with notes of acute and sharp comedy developed in great sense of ductility and fairness . The story is nicely narrated in hight sensitivity and intelligence . It's a fascinating warlike film described in a serious-comic style . The flick obtained a well deserved Oscar winner for best foreign language picture . The film tries to remain neutral but appear Radovan Karazkic's images commanding the Sarajevo siege . The motion picture takes part of the Servian war subgenre , such as :¨Welcome to Sarajevo¨ or ¨Before the Rain¨ and other numerous films . The principal actors , although unknown , are excellent . The support cast is more known , thus shows up Katrin Aldridge who unfortunately dead recently by a stroke , she interprets an impulsive journalist . Simon Callow as an United Nations colonel is equally magnificent . The picture was finely directed by debuting Danis Tanovic (¨Tigers¨, ""An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker"" , ¨Triage¨) who also wrote the screenplay and even the music . Rating : Above average . Well catching."
"Gordon-11","Null","42","84","11 June 2003"," Excellent
","The story was set in the Yugoslavian civil war in the early 90's. One soldier from each side of the battle was trapped between the front lines of the two rivals. They cannot leave the trench because if they do, the army will fire and kill them. To make things worse, there was a third soldier who was placed on a landmine, which would explode when the pressure on the landmine is released (i.e. when he gets up from a lying down position).<br/><br/>
This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. It provokes people to think that there are so many ridiculous things that people do to each other during wars. People think that by killing each other the problem can be solved. This is a highly upsetting idea. It also revealed the terrible bureaucracy of some organisations, which gives little regard for human life.<br/><br/>Although it portrayed that the two rival soldiers had a lot of anger and distrust between them, there are times that it showed that they are also human. The two of them talked and found out that there was a girl that they both knew. I think that they were living in the same country, and they were just like any other civilians, just like you and me. They could have been living the same type of life, and suddenly friends became enemies.<br/><br/>In this film there were no large scale battle scenes like in `Saving Private Ryan' or `Gallipoli'. However, this film is just as sad and emotionally provoking like any other outstanding anti-war movie. It tells people the absurdity of war, and how crazy people can be during war. I was very shocked to know that the soldiers in Yugoslavia really put landmines beneath bodies, so that when the bodies are cleared away, the landmine would explode and kill the dead man's friends and relatives. This behaviour is extremely sickening. The inventor of such landmines is also very disgusting. I wonder, how can people create such a sophisticated device, and use it in such a ruthless way to kill? I have always thought that, if these people who invent killing machines go to invent some other machines instead, maybe we would be living in the `future world' portrayed in the film already. Our technology would be more advanced than it is now.<br/><br/>However, nowadays the weapons are getting more complicated, advanced, deadly and destructive every day. It saddens me a lot, because I never understood why a war has to start. The most ironic thing is that, the man who decides to wage a war against another country is always unharmed, because he sits in his office and has a large team of army to protect him. He does not die in the war. But because of his decision, millions of young men have to die.<br/><br/>Though there is such a grave message behind this film, there is also a lighter side to it. There were a lot of scenes which are funny, and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements. For example, when the two soldiers were trapped in the trench, they were discussing which side did more war crimes. The soldier who got the gun won the argument, and the possession of the gun changed a few times. There was another scene which a soldier searched the pockets of a soldier whom he just killed, and found a picture of a naked man.<br/><br/>Another scene which everyone laughed was that, a soldier asked the soldier lying on the landmine if he was OK. The poor soldier replied 'Of course I am OK, I got shot, and then I was unconscious, and then woke up and found there is a landmine beneath me, and then the whole world is watching me, and then I want to go to toilet, and now I was greeted by rubbish statements from my friend'.<br/><br/>I hope this film would make people understand that wars are completely vile and barbaric, and no one would start a war again."

","this is a great movie of a great director. Dani's tanovic shows a tragedy which is beyond the question: who started the war. its about the psychology of people who changed their mind because of brainwashing war and propaganda. but the simple similarities of the main characters ciki(branko djuric) and nino(Rene bitorajac) show a light , even a positive view on people who used to know each other (they had the same girl.).this movie is closely taken on one set: the trench. and is not a movie which is hard thrilling. its war stupidity and the only people who could help (the u.n.-soldiers) are not allowed to , because of rules and law. the world sees the stupidity of war on TV which is shown by katrin cartlidge (jane Livingston) (to see in: eat the rich, from hell) . makes a good figure. but the real anti-hero is the system, which doesn't allows the forces to help. Bosnians and Serbs act in this movie , mixed and also the other ethnicity (branko djuric is Serb and acts a Muslim! he did a great job movie, very passioned , romantic but hard till the end). the Serbian general is acted by a Bosnian, so its a multi-ethnic movie which is directed very lovely and sensibly because it doesn't care who started war. the spot is on the situation and what the people were and actually are. the tragic situation that the Bosnian soldier lies on a mine is nice directed. the fact that the UN-troops cant help in the end s sad and something to think about. i think this movie was edited very nice, it has heart, something to think about. excellent movie, thumbs up."

","In a trench in Bosnia-Herzegovina, two Serbs are looking for Bosnian soldiers. They find one of them apparently dead, and one of the Serbs puts a fragmentation mine under his body. Ciki (Branko Djuric), another Bosnian soldier hidden in the trench, shoots at them. In the end, the apparently dead Bosnian soldier Cera (Filip Sovagovic) is indeed alive with a mine under his body, and Bosnian Ciki and the Serb Nino (Rene Bitorajac) are hurt and equally armed in an even situation. They decide to ask for help in a very peculiar way. The French UN soldier Marchand (Georges Siatidis) tries to help the men and disobeys his superiors order, using the journalist Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) as a kind of scapegoat in a very uncommon situation. In the end, a circus is armed in the trench and nothing is resolved. Yesterday, I saw this excellent movie for the third time. In a surrealistic situation, the director Danis Tanovic offers the universe of this insane war using a few characters. It is very metaphoric and has a kind of black humor. We have two Bosnians and two Serbs, one of them having the sick idea of mining a dead body. The rage among the three survivors alternates with some dialogs about a common friend and who initiated the war. Indeed, they do not clearly know why they are fighting against each other, and the other soldiers are unable to identify who is who without wearing uniforms. The ridiculous, bureaucratic and hypocrite role of the UN in this war is explicitly demonstrated. Maybe this is the unique film that really touches the wound relative to the performance of UN in this war. The idealist soldier is unable to help whom needs and feels very frustrated when the situation is ended. The journalists trying to obtain a matter, but not taking care in investigating `the trench' a little further after achieving their objectives.  `No Man's Land' is another excellent movie about the Bosnian war, inclusive an Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001, and highly recommended for any audience. If the reader likes this theme, I would like to suggest the excellent `Harrison's Flowers', `Vukovar', `Pretty Village, Pretty Flame', `Shot Through the Heart', `Welcome to Sarajevo' and `Savior'. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Terra de Ninguém'  (`No Man's Land')"

","So much I have read, so much has been written about this academy award movie, but it's still somewhere in the dark. Any why is that? <br/><br/>Probably because it doesn't fit in the usual concept of a movie today. And that is: watch it, be amused and by tomorrow forget about it. Living in Croatia and understanding the war horror that occurred in former Yugoslavia isn't the only reason why I mark this film with a high grade. This film isn't just about tragedy in the Balcans. It's actually about human nature.<br/><br/>Although people that don't understand our language(s) might miss something that puts this movie in a special kind of humorous mood, the general concept always remains the same. It's a film about humanity. It's shows us how EVERY war is absurd, with only losers involved. Special feature of this movie is objectiveness...there is no usual bad guy-good guy classification..there are no pathetic tones we see everyday in a common war movie. the only thing present here is the reality of innocent people who were pushed to kill each other.<br/><br/>Remarkable! 9/10"

","No Man's Land is a powerful, compelling film about the futility of war.  The three major protagonists, two Bosnians and a Serb, are thrown together in a terrible situation, out of which it will be difficult to escape unscathed.<br/><br/>In addition to the warring factions, outside influences enter the picture in the form of a TV news reporter, and members of the UN forces in the  region.  <br/><br/>All three principals are excellent actors. In a supporting role, Katrin Cartlidge, as the TV reporter, is outstanding.  <br/><br/>The portrayal of the British colonel who commands the UN troops is over-the-top.  Other than that, I believe the script is excellent. This multinational production worked for me on both dramatic and historical grounds.

"Decko_koji_obecava","4","27","56","12 July 2002"," Watchable despite many flaws.
","This movie plays like a primary school lesson on ethnic strife in Bosnia. Parts of it could have been named ""Bosnian War for Dummies"". <br/><br/>It's made with uninformed and generally disinterested Western audience in mind and it's as if Tanovic is saying: ""Look, I know it's a drag to go out and look for serious material on ethnic groups you've barely heard of, fighting over a godforsaken piece of land you probably can't pick out on the map, so here's a condensed & simplified version that will make you think you now understand what went on in Bosnia during the early 1990s."" <br/><br/>With his way too broad a brush he attempts many things. Among them: <br/><br/><ul><li>touching on the seeds of conflict between Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims (who now days prefer to be called Bosniacks and in this movie are referred to as Bosnians), </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>explaining the role of international community through UN's UNPROFOR contingent,</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>conveying the hopelessness and chaos of war, etc, etc.. .</li></ul><br/><br/>With some of them he's more successful than with others. For example, in the beginning, chaos and confusion of an armed conflict are quite vividly and successfully laid out. In so many other war flicks soldiers shout orders, move troops on a whim and generally look firmly in control at every moment. Well, here, most aren't really sure what to do. They doubt their decisions and seem to re-evaluate their involvement in this mess with every new gruesome event. This definitely rings more true. Civil wars certainly don't come with rulebooks and how-to guides.<br/><br/>Other parts of the movie, however, can be viewed as personal political statements. I didn't exactly expect Tanovic, himself a Muslim and a soldier in the Bosnian Muslim Army during the war, to entirely stay clear of this, but even so, I thought he'd concentrate more on human stories and less on scoring points for his side. As it is, he portrays Serbs pretty cartoonishly and same goes for the portrayal of UNPROFOR and Western media. Dialogues invloving these 3 groups are so weak and one-dimensional they literally sound like something out of 'Full House' or other ""lets state the obvious since our audience is too stupid"" sitcoms.<br/><br/>Also, there's a whole lot of second layer, cheap and childish propaganda that's probably going to go unnoticed by most Western eyes, but it's most definitely present. Men on Serbian lines (played by Slovene extras) are shown as overweight, greasy, hateful, English-language-illiterate boorish pigs who seem to communicate through backslaps and inarticulate grunts, whereas Muslims are clean-cut, cheerful, fashionably retro polyglots who fight a war in 'Rolling Stones' T-shirt and Chuck Taylor All-Stars while quiping about global issues. No doubt who the beauty and who the beast is in Tanovic's eyes. <br/><br/>Nowhere is this more obvious than in a scene when Muslim soldier picks through pockets of a dead Serb troop whom he had just killed. Camera zooms in to show us that he found a photo of a naked guy striking a sexy pose in dead Serb's wallet! At first I thought there might be a payoff to this later on, but it never happened which left me wondering as to what exactly was Tanovic trying to say/imply? Since Serbs are implicitly presented as bad guys, I suppose he's delivering the final insult, which in his world means - showing their gayness!? <br/><br/>Still, most of Tanovic's wrath is saved for international community and its military arm - UNPROFOR. His thinly veiled position seems to be that the international community should have taken the Muslim side in Bosnia by helping them (not only in humanitarian aid, but in arms, too) fight the other two, better equipped sides (Croats were in this civil war as well, though the movie makes no mention of them). <br/><br/>That is definitely a first - an ""anti-war"" movie that advocates more armed involvement. <br/><br/>Tanovic again lets his emotions get the better of him and goes way over the top by portraying most of the official foreign element in Bosnia somewhere in the range between incompetent, clueless retards and amoral (bordering on sinister) worms.<br/><br/>I mention all this due to the fact that this film is being marketed as another ""Catch-22"" - supposedly showing all of the absurdity and senslesness of war. And while it does that in certain part, it is also much more of a soapbox for Tanovic to air his, obviously subjective, views on a conflict he took an active part in.<br/><br/>""No Man's Land"" possesses certain redeemable value but tries to be too many things at the same time, many of which ultimately dilute and diminish its anti-war message. <br/><br/>Srdjan Dragojevic's ""Pretty Village, Pretty Flame"" did a better job at this since Dragojevic didn't take part in the actual fighting, but was close enough to feel its gruesome effects. That meant his movie wasn't burdened and hindered by heavy personal baggage, which is something that can't be said for Tanovic."

It makes you see conflict, any conflict, in a whole new light.

","Having written a script in 1996 called SOLITUDE set in Bosnia in the early 1990s I`ve been interested in seeing how the Balkans conflict is featured in movies and I was really looking forward to seeing NO MANS LAND a multi national production that became the first movie featuring the Balkans conflict to win an Oscar . However I was very disappointed in it<br/><br/>
The movie gets of to a fairly effective opening and features some excellent cinematography as night turns into morning . There`s also a scene early in the movie that steals directly from PLATOON with a hardened veteran going through a raw recruits kit saying "" You don`t need that , dump this ..."" so my hopes were built up that this was going to be a compelling piece of cinema but when the movie concentrates on the story proper of having two men ( Or three depending how you look at it ) in a trench it doesn`t really go anywhere , instead it just concentrates on insults like :<br/><br/>"" You started this war you Serb pig "" <br/><br/>"" No you started this war you Muslim dog "" <br/><br/>There`s little information on the history of the Bosnian civil war to be gathered from from these exchanges , there`s little drama to these exchanges and to be blunt when watching NO MANS LAND it doesn`t actually feel like you`re experiencing cinema since you could easily adapt this screenplay for the stage with very little modification . <br/><br/>Another thing was I couldn`t believe in the characters as anything more than litery devices , Simon Callow`s caricture as a UN Protection Force officer especially bordered on the offensive with the only performance and role that anyway resembled a real person being the late Katrin Cartlidge as Jane Livingstone , a journalist who seems to be implicitly based on The Guardian`s Maggie O`Kane <br/><br/>NO MANS LAND isn`t the worst movie to have used the Balkans conflict as a backdrop , that unwanted accolade must surely go to BEHIND ENEMY LINES but it`s far from being the best either , in my humble opinion  PRETTY VILLAGE , PRETTY FLAME is the clear winner"

","This is a great movie, which pictures in a sinthetic way what the Balcan's conflict was: a group of not-so-innocent-but-not-guilty-at-all people trapped between interests that go beyond their understanding... and they die from it.<br/><br/>The way the problem is presented is very fresh, even when the one-on-one situation is not new in the film history. The situation has been presented in an island -""Hell in the Pacific""-, and in a lone planet -""Enemy Mine""- among other films: the two opposite-sided warriors that have to overcome common troubles to survive. In this film the island/planet is a trench in the middle of a warfield somewhere in the Balcans in which, because of the stupidity of their superiors, both soldiers get trapped.<br/><br/>Now, the interesting side of this story is that the characters are at shooting distance of both enemy armies, and therefore at risk of dying from friendly or enemy fire. As a further complication, the believed-dead friend of one of the soldiers has been booby-trapped with a mine by the other's friend, who is shot dead early in the movie. They cannot run, for they will be shot by the other army, and the soldier lying over the mine cannot move, or it will blow appart.<br/><br/>The situation develops fast into a major international matter, with the not-so-fortunate intervention of the UN soldiers and, off course the international press. How can it get worst? How can it get better? The film mirrors the ""well intended"" actions that a Worldwide peace organization with an internal ego-war, lack of credibility, and quite unclear agenda did in the Balcan's conflict. It presents the misguided reasons by which hate led to fraticide, in which nobody remembers the origin of the conflict, but the consequences are written in blood in the papers. And also portrays the roll of the media not only as wintnesses, but also as beholders of the Public Opinion.<br/><br/>The story goes on with very wise and satiric, even comic dialogs inserted among very serious situations, which lead the public lightly but reflexively into the tense and very likely ending.<br/><br/>A great film, which with a very low budget and a very inteligent and documented script, puts itself among the best war films of all times. Only thing I hope is that the story was not based on a real-life situation, which would be by far more terrifiyng that most fiction endings in film history."

","This Serbo-Croatian film (with English subtitles) was a somewhat interesting story of a couple of soldiers on opposite sides in the Bosnian war who wind up in the same trench (hence, ""No Man's Land"") and the United Nations officials who try to rescue them. (Have you noticed how the UN ""tries"" but rarely succeeds in anything?)<br/><br/>The film is a bit talky but there is some action and every time it borders on starting to bore it switches gears to keep the viewer's interest.....all the way to up to finding out what happens at the end. Saying that, I wouldn't recommend buying this, but it's worth a rental. One look is enough. I am glad it points out what I mentioned before: how sadly ineffective the United Nations is, a real farce of an organization which is a shame.<br/><br/>The movie isn't all Serbs and Muslims speaking in their tongue.

The only disadvantage is that you can't understand some parts of ""No Man's Land"" if you don't speak Bosnian. There are some expressions that cannot be translated into English. Here are the pictures those to tell you the story. Tanovic works with symbols, like the very last picture of the movie, where you see this Bosnian soldier lying on a land mine not being able to either move or stay there.

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","5","10","30 June 2002"," Effective, if flawed, war film.
","I checked out this movie based on its Best Foreign Film Oscar win. Having seen it I personally would have given it to Amelie, but what we have is a (relatively) hard hitting war drama set around the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.<br/><br/>The premise is pretty simple. A Bosnian and Serbian soldier are trapped between enemy lines, in no man's land. A third soldier, wounded, lies atop a mine unable to move for fear of triggering it. The balance of power is held by the man who has the gun  with the balance shifting intermittently as the story progresses. Thankfully this doesn't become an `Enemy Mine' scenario where the two end up hugging  instead it takes the more admirable, and less pontificating, approach of highlighting the hatreds embedded between the two sides that cannot be merely overcome by a few hours of conversation. The characters are actually quite clearly normal men  they even know people in common  but their irrational hatred of the other side is inexplicable and obviously meant to be so.<br/><br/>Unfortunately some of the dialog is a bit hammy. The screenplay suffers from being slightly clichéd and, while not taking the obvious route, the final resolution is still somewhat easily foreseen (although, to be fair, the inevitability is what helps make it effective). The actors help matters by imbuing their characters with emotions ranging from desperation, to hatred, all passed off without ever descending into melodrama. Director Tanovic shows an effective hand here, with camera work that never interferes with the storyline and yet brings across the quiet, and the loud, moments with enough passion to help the viewer emote with the scene.<br/><br/>`No Man's Land' is another, in a line of movies, that shows the horror-of-war. Thankfully it does this with the harder and more visceral of emotions rather than Hollywood sentimentality.  It's let down a bit by a somewhat weak script, but the direction and acting lend enough conviction to the movie to make it worth a view. 6.8/10."
"joaodelauraaurora","6","5","10","9 January 2002"," A noble cause for a flawed movie
","One can never overstate the absurdity of war, especially of a fratricidal ethnic conflict as the one that ravaged Bosnia. This is the merit of `No Man's Land', a movie about a group of Bosnians and Serbs stuck in a no man's land trench under the fire of both armies, a parable of the deadly stalemate that marked this war. But this underlying noble intention is in a way better than the movie itself, if we are to distinguish end and means. There are two main flaws in Danis Tanovic's film. The first is the fact that the movie's main conflict, between the Bosnian Chiki and the Serb Nino, is not entirely convincing (it is even childish sometimes) and therefore is not up to the hatred and grievances that oppose the two nations. That's why the tragic way this conflict finally unfolds seems a bit out of proportion with the story, as if artificially conceived in order to neutralize some satirical and farcical aspects of the movie that are at odds with the gravity of the war itself. The second flaw is, ironically, the movie's only attempt at analyzing the war. As a rule, there is no effort to explain the causes of the conflict (good, it's a movie, not a dissertation), but Tanovic's screenplay attributes to the United Nations peacekeeping mission a good deal of responsibility for the absurd continuation of the war, which is nonsense. The UN bureaucracy, as well as the international press, is portrayed as the movie's villain, as if the war had more to do with personal and institutional incompetence than with historical and complex disputes between nations (6/10)."

","The film is telling the dramatic story of three soldiers (one Serb and two Bosnians) caught between two front-lines during the Yugoslavian war. Some UN troop try to free them but their very bureaucratic hierarchy prevents them of doing so and they require the help of a British journalist.<br/><br/>The plot is very credible and shows perfectly the absurdity and cruelty of war and the influence of the TV press on the battlefield.<br/><br/>But I would not qualify this film as a masterpiece. I found the acting not that convincing. Watch Kirk Douglas in Paths of Glory! Moreover the story is quite melodramatic. Some effects (in particular the UN colonel and his sexy secretary) are not really welcome (the director should have chosen between the MASH style or the documentary style and not oscillated between both). I really felt the whole was too long and not deserving such eulogistic comments as you can read on IMDb.<br/><br/>This film can be compared with the BBC TV series Warriors (1999). I really believe Warriors was very much superior. The pace was faster. The acting was better. The plot was more credible and more informative. Of course this was only a TV series and the quality of the film direction cannot be compared but, all in all, Warriors touched me much deeper."
"Stokkolm","5","10","26","8 June 2011"," Not deserving it's reputation
","This movie has the same rating as Underground by Emir Kusturica and i expected it to be at least half as good, but in reality it's not even remotely close to that masterpiece. But some people praise it as a realistic take on war, maybe the most realistic ever. Well, if you want realistic take on war watch The Hurt Locker. No Man's Land is basically the Hollywood version of that. Even the first Rambo is more realistic and deeper in some ways. Why? Many thing happening in the movie make no sense, for example Ciki looks like a calm guy, he didn't lose his judgement when he was struck by a tank projectile, no he just went to search for a cigar to smoke. But after being saved, he makes the dumb decision of threatening a whole army with a pistol, what was he thinking? That action did not fit the character of Ciki we saw earlier. This is just a sign of amateurish plot design. And the french UN sergeant, he defied his superiors and risked his life just for a mission he didn't even knew what was about until he got there.<br/><br/>As a tragedy it was hard to feel bad for any of the main characters, they are not very sympathetic, and they don't show enough of their personality to make you care for them. If a situation like this was real maybe i would, but then again you hear stuff like this on TV often, and it's about innocent civilians. I only felt bad for the UN soldiers that wasted their time trying to save 2 people that didn't want their help.<br/><br/>It's not a that bad movie, but almost everything it shows has been done better somewhere else."

The Serb veteran put a self-made land mine under a seeming dead body of a Bosnian soldier in the trench. After brief exchanging fire, Ciki and Nino survived. Although Ciki wanted to save his wounded companion, how to remove the awesome land mine was a great challenge. Their situation also attracted the attention of UN peace troop.<br/><br/>The unexpected ending was really a huge satire. The war is always brutal.

In the case of 'Run Lola', it succeeds because the MTV style is only a frame.  Unfortunately, 'No Man's Land' makes the style its focus.  Since we've seen this style before on better movies (where 'Lola' had the edge), it doesn't last with us.<br/><br/>The subtexts don't create a major stir when superficially examined.  Two enemies stuck in a trench because of either side fighting for reasons no bigger than simple vendetta.  Doesn't sound that great, does it?  The two men arguing harkens to 'Conan' and the spawning of conflict-obsession, but it's as sophisticated as 'Batman'.<br/><br/>What makes this interesting?  The absence of Amerikaners.  If this was a true Hollywood or made-for-TV production (especially under Bruckheimer), there would be a plethora of American imagery.  'Behind Enemy Lines' and 'Hunted' tried this, no wonder they failed.

","(SPOILER) I hate movies in which the solution is so obvious to any member of the audience, but the whole thing plods on as it is a difficult problem, and even remains unresolved at the end. All one had to do was slide his hand under the guys body, locate the mine, and put his hand over the plunger so it doesn't detonate. It might be necessary to remove a couple of those small rocks. Then the body could get up and walk away while the plunger was held down, and the mine could then be jammed into the framework of the structure in such a way that would hold the plunger down. Tie a long cord to the mine, get a safe distance away, and jerk it out of the tight spot, allowing it to detonate harmlessly. It took me about two minutes to figure that out, and it embarrasses me that it took that long except that I was distracted by the other inanities of the film, which were numerous, including the keystone cops failure to secure other weapons lying around. Yet the whole picture revolves around everybody, including a famous German mine disposal expert, being baffled by this simple conundrum. Furthermore, there is no way on earth that the last guy to leave the scene would have done so, with a living person simply abandoned to his fate. Sorry, just a horribly, horribly contrived movie."

","I certainly recognised the film, and assumed it was all about the attacks on the infamous First World War land, but it was in fact a satirical black comedy. Based in the Bosnian was of 1993, two soldiers: Bosnian Ciki (Branko Djuric) and Bosnian Serb Nino (Rene Bitorajac) are caught in the middle of the No Man's Land trench because they are both avoiding fire from whichever side is out and about, and also Ciki's friend Cera (Filip Sovagovic) is lying on a bouncing mine, threatening the lives of everyone near the trench. News crews from many countries, including Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) reporting for Britain are around, and all the local military staff, including Englishman Soft (Simon Callow) are doing all they can to find a mine defusing expert. Ciki and Nino meanwhile are bickering and nearly trying to kill each other also, since they are both each others enemies, and they want answers as to who really started the war. In the end, it's no good, the mine can't be defused, and ends with Cera just lying there, so you can make your own mind up about what he does on his own, everyone else clearing the area, oh, and Ciki shot. Also starring Georges Siatidis as Sgt. Marchand, Serge-Henri Valcke as Capt. Dubois, Sacha Kremer as Michel and Alain Eloy as Pierre. It is interesting to see four or five languages being used in this film, and I especially wasn't expecting quite a bit of English, or a really talented character actor like Simon Callow to show up, so all in all, a very worth while foreign film.

Even when the characters communicate through a secondary language, they can't know what is being said, as they do not understand the history or culture of their presumed enemy or friend.

","""No Man's Land"" may be the first great post-Cold War anti-war film, where the root of war is shown as out and out irrational hatred, leaving civilized folks plotzing in the middle. <br/><br/>The first fiction film by a theater director- turned soldier- turned documentarian, the complicated Yugoslav situation feels completely authentic. The multi-national cast of craggy characters is mostly full-blooded individuals, with their varying languages and communication attempts an ongoing joke (""You speak English of course?"" the Frenchman continually asks sadly.)<br/><br/>This movie grimly brings to life the joke about how an EU conference can be good or bad -- good, if the food is catered by the French, organized by the Germans, etc. etc. or bad if the Brits do the food, the Italians organize it, etc. etc. There are strays into stereotypes -- the ineffectual public school British general representing the UN trailed by his leggy assistant and the Brit woman news reporter is a replay of Nora Dunn's role in ""Three Kings"" (though I liked her subtle flirting with the just-trying-to-do-the-right-thing French officer). The Serbian is the not the usual war criminal thug, which would have been easier, and the Serbians' aggressive role in the conflict is barely implied rather than blamed. <br/><br/>Amazingly, the movie is both very funny (like ""M.A.S.H"") and very tense with no easy ending or answers as no one wins. War is hell, even against bad guys. And for individual soldier pawns, futile. As I heard Norman Thomas say at the first anti-war rally I went to in 1965: ""These pawns bleed.""

Tanovic depicts the nature of men in war, nothing new, but the way it's done here is what's remarkable.  Here, a Bosnian (Djuric) hides out in a trench from Serbian fire, only to have 2 Serbians (one being Bitorajac) come into the trench to see if there are survivors. The bosnian kills one of them, and leaves Bitorajac in the trench with him. This causes a conflict with the men having to wait on the UN to get them out, and to help out Djuric's best friend (played with heartbreaking accuracy by Sovagovic) who is on a land mine that will explode if he moves off it.<br/><br/>A tad cliched, but when it's a satire, it might need to be a little cliched, especially with a war movie.

"paul2001sw-1","7","2","4","2 November 2008"," Stronger psychologically than politically
","The premise of 'No Man's Land' is simple: enemy soldiers stuck inside the same trench beneath their opposing lines. The setting is the Bosnian war, and the start of the film is vaguely reminiscent of the films of Emir Kusturica: less wild, but raw and to the point: I believed in the characters. But in the second half of the film, the movie turns it's attention from Serbs and Bosnians to the French and the British; and here I found it less successful. And this is not because western Europeans deserve no censure: in the real war, the U.N. did indeed stand aside while the massacre at Srebenica took place. But the pantomime general on display here does not help us understand how that happened; and the journalist is also an uncomfortable character. Put simply, the way that she reports the news, both inane and emotional, simply isn't how news is done in the real world. T.V. news reporting can be parodied - Chris Morris, among others, has done so superbly in the past - but mimicry is perhaps a prerequisite of good parody: the ability to replicate the tone is what buys the freedom to exaggerate. Although 'Welcome to Serejevo' was perhaps overly sympathetic to its journalistic protagonist, I felt it captured more of the essence of the truth of being a war reporter than this film. And after finding 'No Man's Land's portrayals of its English characters unconvincing, do I then have to ask myself, should I trust its portrayals of its Balkan protagonists? Even the film's final message seems confused, for having mocked the U.N. for not intervening, when it does intervene, things end in inevitable disaster, meaning that that paradoxically, it could almost be seen as an unintentional endorsement of realpolitik. I still enjoyed watching this movie; but its psychology is definitely stronger than its politics."

However, No Man's Land stands out as a war<br/><br/>movie that is objective, non-judgmental and immensely thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The fact that non of the actors are international movie stars heightens the<br/><br/>realism and allows the audience to view their plight with more objectivity.<br/><br/>(Sometimes, a movie star's off-screen persona can be too distracting.)<br/><br/>Ciki (a Bosnian) and Nino (a Serb) get stuck in no man's land together, and we see the futility in pointing fingers when amidst heavy bombing around them,<br/><br/>they argue that it is the other who started the war. It is even more ironic as we are struck by how similar Ciki and Nino are -- they share the same language,<br/><br/>share a common friend and could even be friends themselves. Despite this, they are suspicious of the other all the time, even after they leave the trench. This leads to tragic consequences and we are saddened by their blind hatred for the other and their overwhelming desire to 'have the final say'.<br/><br/>The film doesn't take sides, but if there is a losing side, it must be the UN. The UNPROFOR personifies the hypocrisy and ludicrous bureaucracy that add to<br/><br/>the tragedy of this war. Our spirits are temporarily lifted when the French<br/><br/>soldiers decide to go against orders to actually do something about the sticky situation. Yet any fragile hopes we might have are quickly shattered when they learn that there's absolutely nothing they can do for Cera, the soldier who's lying on a bouncing mine.<br/><br/>In the end, as the frame slowly moves away from Cera and pans to the horizon, we are filled with utter horror at the UN's deception. I accepted with devastation the fact that there is really no solution to Cera's problem. I was dumbstruck for a moment when the credits started to roll, and the haunting closing theme only<br/><br/>added to my pain when I realised the director is not only pointing out the<br/><br/>inaction of people who have the ability to help, but also the ignorance of the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I'm a little disheartened to learn that the film is even funnier in its native language, and that the translation did not do the dialogue any justice. This<br/><br/>means it is even better than I know it to be. Still, there is enough dark humour and poignant tragedy to make this a thought-provoking and memorable<br/><br/>experience."

","The story unfolds with enough intrigue to be absorbing.  This movie has good pacing, it doesn't lag.  It is chilling, and I felt disturbed by it afterwards.  I find a problem in that the sympathetic point of view is that of a supporting or minor character, Sgt. Marchand of the UN peacekeepers. If this movie was great, one would identify with a major character seeing the anti-war moral through his experiences.  That's not possible in this movie since the Serb and Bosnian soldiers trapped are new to combat and not horrified enough to lose their intense partisan feelings.  The major characters do not carry the thematic weight of this surprisingly very clinically detached movie.  The detachment gives this movie a sheen of objectivity, but it does not cause me to properly suspend my uncritical disbelief about some of its events.  For instance, when the two soldiers, Bosnian and Serb, are escorted from the dugout by the UN forces, neither is patted down for weapons, although in each previous encounter the UN has witnessed these two fighting.  For that reason one can imagine a plausible ending to this movie that deflates its drama.  That is unpleasing because the movie would lose its power to disturb us as it does about warfare."

","Eastern European writers seem to have a gift for the absurd; Checkov, Kafka, and others used this element in their works.  This movie uses the same elements to discuss the absurdity of war.  The plot revolves around three men.  One is a Serb soldier, two are Bosnians.  One of the men is lying on top of a ""bouncing mine"" that will kill everyone within a hundred yards if he moves.  The three of them are trapped in a trench between enemy lines. The film is beautifully done, tragic, sad, and... funny.  The humor of the situation is portrayed through the two soldiers arguing over who started the war and the attempts of UN officers to rectify the situation and get the men out of the trench.  Some people might be put off by the subtitles; the movie is in three different languages, but well worth the time."
"timmy_501","9","2","5","1 August 2009"," Symbolic war film skewers media
","No Man's Land offers an excellent metaphor for the situation that leads to war: there is a man in the film who is lying on top of a mine that will destroy everything in the area if his weight is removed. In spite of all the help that is offered to the man there is really nothing that can be done; even the experts are unable provide a solution. Without knowing a great deal about the military conflict this scenario is a part of I think it's safe to say that the situation the armies are battling over is no less complicated. It's apparently far too complicated for the soldiers to understand. When two opposing soldiers discuss the causes of the war neither can pinpoint when or how the war started. In fact each man gives the same reason for his own involvement in the conflict: they joined up because the other side was destroying villages in their home areas.<br/><br/>These two opposing soldiers have a very complex relationship. Each proves unwilling to murder an unarmed man in close quarters. Through some complicated maneuvering each man is put in a position to have mercy on the other. For a short time they are able to get along; they even realize they have a mutual acquaintance from before the war. Nonetheless, in the course of trying to resolve the mine situation the two come to desire the death of one another; if the man on the mine is a metaphor for the nation's problems then the attempts of these men to resolve the situation becomes a metaphor for the war itself. Of course, if each man just tried to understand the other's situation their own conflict could have been avoided.<br/><br/>The film's other concern is the outside world's involvement in the conflict. We see UN forces that are mostly well meaning but clueless to even the most basic issues involved; they don't even have a person who can speak the language of the soldiers. The media is no better: we see a journalist who only cares about having a good story. She is completely indifferent to the people involved beyond what they can do for her; this is shown clearly in her attempt to interview one of the three men. Her third question is, ""Did you place the mine under the other soldier?"" which shows how ready she is to place the blame on one person or another instead of understanding both sides. The soldier's contemptuous answer is thus well deserved. After this reporter gets the dramatic bloodshed she wants she is willing to believe any excuse that will allow her to get back to a safe area; indeed she doesn't want to look at the trench where the man has been trapped anymore than she would have wanted to visit the country if there was no war."

","This was the movie that I wanted to see because it had won the 2001 Best Oscar for Foreign Language Film during the same year an Indian movie called Lagaan was the top contender for the Oscars. Fortunately I got to see this movie after a period of six years.<br/><br/>The story is about the war between Serbia and Bosnia. Three soldiers are caught  2 Bosnians Muslims and one Serb in a no-man's land patch. All are injured and one Bosnian soldier is laid on a live land mine. UN comes to help, the TV and media land up, the Bosnian and Serbian soldier die and the one of the land mine is left to die by UN  because there is no way to rescue him.<br/><br/>It is a deeply moving story and a good exposure to the war in general. It has human drama, of hate between human beings who are no different and not born to hate and kill each other. Both Serbian and Bosnian soldiers blame each other of starting the war. But the main villains of the story emerge out to be the pathetic bureaucracy of UN Peace Keeping Force, and the media who are waiting as vultures.<br/><br/>The first time Director of a full length feature film - Danis Tanovic, does a good job in covering gamut of issues surrounding the Serb and Bosnia war. He shows guts in exposing the ineffective UN machinery. Danis worked for 2 years on the war zone, and his experience helped in making the fictional movie very authentic in looks.<br/><br/>The three main stars  Branko Djuric as Bosnian Ciki, Rene Bitorajac as Serb Nino and Filip Sovagovic as Bosnian Cera (lying down on the live land mine)  do a marvelous job in acting. The emotions and feelings are showcased raw.<br/><br/>The musical score is minimal but the beginning and ending title music is haunting. Did this movie deserve an Oscar above Lagaan? Was Lagaan a better movie than No Man's Land? It must have had been a tough call for the Oscar panel to choose between Lagaan and No Man's Land. Lagaan was a wholesome Indian entertainer. It has music, emotions, human triumph, joy, celebrations, contest, good  bad, morals and a happy ending feeling. Whereas No Man's Landing was more contemporary  more western in its images, more relevant to the war debates of US. I think the panel must have related to No Man's Land much more than Lagaan.<br/><br/>Surely if the panel of Oscar was universal  Lagaan would have bagged the Oscars. But America rules  they decide the panel and they award a movie. It remains a posterior history now! (Stars 7 out of 10)"

This is more than a dark comedy, but a realistic depiction. I guess life is often dark and amusing, I don't know. Anyway, it's one of the best scripts of the year, that's for sure.

It still manages to show the horror of war and the pointlessness of the whole situation.<br/><br/>It perfectly shows the involvement of both the Serbians and the Bosnians that are not really caring about the faith of the soldiers trapped in the trench in the middle of no man's land, while all they do in the trench is arguing about who's to blame for starting the war in the first place which takes a lot of pressure and tension with it. It also shows the involvement of the UNPROFOR soldiers and the hungry press and the power the press can have in a war situation these days. All is shown in a satirical way and basically it just tells the story of the whole war and the parties involved in 98 minutes.<br/><br/>Not sure about it deserving of winning the Oscar for best foreign film but still an enjoyable light war drama.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"ecmelton-186-105049","8","1","2","12 December 2015"," A Dynamic Film About War
","This movie was made by a Bosnian director and blames the Serbians for starting the war and acting as the aggressors. All of the military violence in the movie is carried out by the Serbians. Other than Ciki the Bosnian military is barely seen and none of their fighting or military actions are shown. When the UN appears later in the film, the primary UN peacekeeper explicitly blames the Serbians for starting the war, and since the UN is supposed to be neutral the film places the blame entirely with the Serbians. <br/><br/>Ciki, the Bosnian soldier, is a much more likable character than Nano, which makes sense given the film's negative attitude toward the Serbian army. Nano is shown to be dim-witted or at the very least inexperienced as a soldier. He tries to shake Ciki's hand after they had tried to kill each other, and he tries to leave even after Ciki tells him to stay where he is at gunpoint. In contrast to Nano, who is trying to be a soldier and failing, Ciki is depicted as being more of an individual that just happens to be in the military at that moment. This is reflected in their physical appearance. Despite his overall incompetence, Nano's appearance is very militant. Everything on his uniform is buttoned up and tucked in, and his hair isn't just closely cropped it is entirely shaved off. In a movie that has an anti-war message, having a militant appearance isn't treated as a virtue. Ciki's appearance is much different. There is little indication that he is in the military at all, except for his shirt. He has longer hair, is unshaven, and he's wearing his uniform unbuttoned with a Rolling Stones t-shirt and Chucks. Nothing suggest that he is actually a soldier, and within the context of this movie that is very critical of the military, that makes him the better man. Nano's certainly not depicted as being a villain, but if either of the two in the trench is the ""hero,"" it would be Ciki. Nano's limited likability is related to the fact that he's not a good representation of the Serbian army as a whole. Nano is trying to be a soldier, but his peers seem to dislike him and he has more humanity than them. He doesn't fit in with the group that is portrayed as the actual bad guys. This is illustrated when he refused to set booby traps using Bosnian bodies. This disconnect from the military makes him more endearing. The contrast between his appearance and his actual skill level demonstrates his lack of understanding about the reality of war. His uniform looks exactly the way it should according a training manual but he doesn't have any idea how to react in combat. Both characters are the protagonists but the Bosnian soldier is shown in a more flattering light for most of the movie. This contrast between the characters serves a purpose aside from making Bosnia look good; it gives them things to talk and argue about, contributing to the chemistry and banter they develop throughout the film.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't glorify any aspect of the military or warfare. Nothing is shown to be justified or heroic. It's just violent, and the violence has no nobility to it. Early on it seemed like Ciki and Nano were going to find common ground and part with a mutual respect for each other, or if one them did die if would have some meaning, a sacrificial death, probably to save the other. Instead they just kill each other. Nobody gets saved. This would seem to be illustrating both the futility of the war and the futility of trying to create peace between the two sides. <br/><br/>The movie also addresses the way the media covers war. They're depicted as being vultures descending on any tragedy they can find. They also end up unknowingly reporting a fake story that was manipulated by the UN to save face. This shows the media to be ineffective and that they can be easily tricked or manipulated. Likewise, the media is also shown manipulating the UN into taking action, so they do play an important role, it just isn't the role that's actual in their job description. The media in this movie has a lot of potential power because they offer a direct line from the event to the people, and even if they do a bad job, their presence is enough to keep people on their toes and make sure they don't make themselves or their organization look foolish in front of the world. This illustrates the ineffectiveness of the UN to act during a crisis. Despite the media's inaccurate reporting of the final story, the UN would have likely abandoned the people in the trench if it wasn't for the threat of bad press. The UN peacekeepers also don't make any attempts to remove guns from area around the trench even after they witnessed Ciki shoot Namo in the leg. This negligence seems to be just contrived way to allow Ciki to have a gun at the end. This is one of the only blaring problems with the movie, but because the UN is fairly worthless for the rest of the movie this fictionalized version could conceivably be that remiss. <br/><br/>Overall it's easy to see why this movie won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It plays with interesting ideas about the role of the individual, the media, and governments in war. It would unfair to call it just an anti-war movie or a pro-Bosnian movie. Those are certainly themes in it, and the movie has its prejudices, but they're not so heavy handed that a person couldn't make an argument for the other side. The movie doesn't tell you what to think. It provides a captivating narrative that raises questions for the audience to think about, and those question don't necessarily have easy answers."

","Sometimes the theme of the film has a more powerful impact on the audience, rather than the story or style. In the case of ""No Man's Land"", human morality which postulates the senselessness of war, was the successful driving force. <br/><br/>This film has a healthy dose of humor for a war flick. So much so that it seems that the director is trying to force the savagery of the bloody Bosnian Civil War through the filter of irony and hilarity. The effect is that the film draws you in from the very start as jittery soldiers crack jokes about pessimism, foggy weather and bald heads. <br/><br/>Additionally, The acting was brilliant throughout the flick which involves a pan-European cast. Most notable were the roles of Cici and Nino that were memorably played. What I really liked seeing was how Nino got more and more aggressive as the movies draws on, far from the the meek person we saw in the opening sequences. <br/><br/>All in all, NML is a fresh breath in war movies as the utilization of pathos and pyrotechnics is minimal. The movie instead utilizes the canvas of tragicomedy to paint a vivid, realistic picture of the effects of war. <br/><br/>Definitely deserved the Oscar it got. Amelie won't leave you pondering the way this movie does."

","""No Man's Land"" was the Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Language Picture back in 2002. Although it won this award and it has a rather high rating on IMDb, I avoided watching it because the description of the film seemed pretty depressing and miserable. However, after seeing it, I advise you consider watching the film despite the tough subject matter, as it really has a lot to say and is well worth your time.<br/><br/>The film is set in Bosnia-Herzegovina during their horrible war in the 1990s. Two soldiers take refuge in a small encampment in no-man's land- -not realizing that an enemy soldier is hiding there as well. As the enemy watches, one of the soldiers shows the other how to booby-trap a body belonging to an enemy soldier. In other words, when his own countrymen later come to bury him, when they pick him up it will detonate a mine! Well, the hiding soldier is enraged when he hears this and opens fire on the two soldiers--killing one and wounding the other. Soon, however, she shooter realizes that the booby-trapped man is actually still alive! Now there are three guys stuck in no-man's land and it looks very doubtful that they'll make it out alive.<br/><br/>This is pretty much the description I'd read about the film--and it didn't interest me very much. Fortunately, the movie doesn't end with this--there is much more to the film. Soon, the United Nations forces get pulled into this and the film becomes a searing indictment of the pathetic record of this 'peace-loving body'! The ending is darkly funny and sad--and is something you really should see.<br/><br/>The film is a wonderful microcosm of the entire Yugoslavian civil war. Summed up in these three soldiers is a story that pretty much explains the nihilistic nature of these wars. Writer/director Danis Tanovic did a wonderful job of creating an engaging and extremely intelligent film-- and I can see why it took home this prestigious award. Too bad, however, that the film really didn't matter all that much, as the war had long been over and the damage had been done...and the UN performed it's usual cracker jack job of remedying the situation!"
"GirishGowda","7","1","2","15 August 2013"," This Trench is Not Just Another Trench
","'No Man's Land' is a black comedy set amidst an ethnic cleansing war in a catch-22 situation. Set in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 1993 at the time of the heaviest fighting between the two warring sides. Two soldiers from opposing sides in the conflict, Nino and Ciki, become trapped in no man's land, whilst a third soldier becomes a living booby trap. A UN unit go against their orders to help them.<br/><br/>The opening night scene is powerful. The chaos, confusion and paranoia of conflict is quite realistic. The absurdity, intensity as well as the senselessness of war is shown well to an extent and there were times when the humor was very well done. I was surprised by the use of so much English in the movie, along with some French dialogues.<br/><br/>'No Man's Land' is almost undone by the director's (who fought in the war as well) obvious partiality towards the Bosnian Muslims. The UN and the Serbs are nothing more than caricatures. Serbs are trivialized (in his opinion) as men who prefer other men (I thought that scene would have had more meaning than that and hence was disappointed) while the Muslim, Ciki is a completely heterosexual man who prefers busty, long-legged lasses. Serbs are mainly portrayed as fat, lazy, hateful and incompetent, while the opposite is true for the Muslims. The movie also chides the UN for not butting in (in addition to providing humanitarian aid) and ending the war. The UNPROFOR officer is shown as an obnoxious pervert and I'd wager there were many like him in real-life. But, all these things point to just one thing and that's propaganda. It also falters in the end when the journalists don't check out the trench and it just doesn't fit in with the character, much like Ciki shooting Nino.<br/><br/>It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2002. While it certainly is a worthwhile movie, I cannot imagine how this won an Academy Award. It must be because of the topical issue of the twin tower blasts in the US at the time which had an enormous impact on Americans, since both Lagaan (that got lost in translation) and Amelie which were nominated that year were true masterpieces.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Shocking Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001 as this stole the Academy Award from the vastly popular French picture ""Amelie"". Excellent in most every way, ""No Man's Land"" is from Bosnia-Herzegovina and tells the story of the most intense fighting over there between the Bosnians and the Serbians. In 1993 a group of Bosnians get ambushed one dark, cold and foggy night and it appears that the entire group is dead. That is not the case though. Two have actually survived. One (Filip Sovagovic) was knocked out so severely that he appeared dead and a Serbian has put a land mine underneath his thought-to-be deceased body. The other (Branko Dujuric) is hiding and trying to find a way out of the trench. Soon the two Bosnians and green-Serb Rene Bitorajac are caught together in the trench, right between the two battling armies. Death is almost certain for all three as Sovagonic cannot move from the mine and the other two risk being killed if they to climb away. The United Nations Peace Army tries to find a way to get all three out, but inefficiency runs amok and it appears that the trio may never get out of the hot zone alive. A crazed media (that is apparently found all over the world) just adds to the heated situation with their usual exploitation antics. ""No Man's Land"" was quietly ignored for most of 2001, but hit fire at the right time mainly due to the critics saving the movie from obscurity. This is a rather simple film about very complex situations. Writer/director Danis Tanovic crafts a movie that teaches a somewhat ignorant world about some very terrible times in his native homeland (fighting continues almost non-stop over there it seems). The Bosnians and Serbians only seem to be separated by uniforms and different ideals. Failed diplomacy and war-like antics continue to dominate that part of the planet unfortunately. Thought-provoking, darkly funny, intense, smart and very intelligent, ""No Man's Land"" is one of the better foreign language pictures of recent memory. 5 stars out of 5."
"Mesi","Null","1","2","6 July 2002"," A weak film in a weaker genre
","The fact that this rather dull and clichéd phoned-in film is getting such positive response seems to me a reflection of how bad most war films are. Blackhawk Down for example was nearly unwatchable due to its lack of characters and flat droning moment by moment recitation story telling stlye; war without politics-imagine that! But No Man's Land aspires to be more, and largely fails. I suppose it feels good to look at Bosnian Muslims and Serb Nationalists and say (as many characters do in the film) that they are maniacs. While the film tries to stand ironically distant from the portrayed events, the sad result is twofold. First, on the political front, we have a paean to inaction. If all sides are mad then it is madness to become involved at all. What was supposed to come off as a critique of UN cynicism only ends as an endorsement of it due to the film's unwillingness to take sides. Like a teenager hating everything, the film's unfocused 360 degree critique creates no meaningful contrasts leaving the viewer no where to stand. Too bad, because there are real and important human stories to tell about Bosnia and Kosovo that the west particularly needs to hear. On the film front, we have a weak film that relies too heavily on the viewer to fill in the large gaps. All the characters are seen-em-before cutouts spewing out canned shopworn dialogue. Director Tanovic has chosen to rely on our knowledge of much better films like Catch-22 and Paths of Glory to make his film hold together. A lost opportunity, too bad."

No Man's Land portrays this kind of entanglement as well, but it does it in a way that is dignified while providing a stark social commentary. Little differences are often times the only things that create conflict, and this movie beautifully illustrates those sentiments.<br/><br/>It seemed rather fitting that this film won the Oscar for best foreign film, topping the widely popular Amelie. Often times, war is portrayed through one narrow perspective and rarely deviates from its aforementioned ideology. But this is one of those rare films that shows how we are all affected. This was a great film to watch, and in today's war-mongering world, it's sends quite a message."
"lawprof","Null","1","2","27 December 2001"," A View of the Crucible of Hatred
","War movies generally reflect a consistent and predictable filmmaker's view of his or her country.  American films often feature the expected bravery of the guy we all recognize and his defiance of stupid superiors.  The typical neighborhood types, whatever that really is depending on when the movie was made (a Jew is every platoon in WWII but no blacks, now blacks and Hispanics and Asians in high rank in every service), is engrafted on the action. British films offer the eternal class struggle and stiff upper lip (""Jennifer, dearest, if I don't make it back promise me you'll marry my brother, Rodney."").  French war films? Elan plus inevitable failure equals drama.  I'll forbear from discussing Italian warpics.<br/><br/>""No Man's Land"" stands on its own as a complex portrayal of several men caught up in a continuing conflict that few understand either as combatants or as outside observers.  An early interchange between the two key soldiers as to which side started the war illuminates, briefly but effectively, the fog that literally, not merely figuratively, engulfs the Balkans.<br/><br/>The most brilliant aspect of this fine film is the encapsulation of the wildly changing emotions of the two antagonists who share a desire to survive while trapped in a trench between the opposing forces.  The war becomes intensely, indeed exclusively, personal and whatever grasp of political, ethnic or ideological differences were held by the soldiers before their predicament are lost in the immediacy of their dilemma.<br/><br/>It would probably have been too much to expect the director to avoid all national stereotyping and the British colonel who is presumed to have some command authority over deployed UN assets will be familiar to many.  The French noncom, Sergeant Marchand, is a conflicted, smart, troubled soldier caught up in forces he can barely fully understand and certainly not tame. Many will be amused by the Chistianne Amanpour wannabe, Jane.<br/><br/>The power of this story goes beyond the Balkan conflagration but it also captures the blinding senselessness of a war that, tragically, has no true end in sight."

I think I got impressed by movies like ""Underground"" and expected more black humor or bitter critics, but I got neither. In general, the movie is a good realization, good fotography and average acting. The situation might be one to often depicted but no well resolved for my taste. All in all I ended dissatisacted with the movie."
"M_Guerin","Null","1","2","17 April 2002"," Excellent flick about the futility of hating the other, except...
","I watched this movie spellbound.  Especially now, with the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine, this movie really resonated with me.  I thought that most everything about this movie - from the acting, to the cinematography, to the direction, etc. - was uniformly excellent.  The international kudos it has received are well-earned.<br/><br/>Now for the major flaw in this film, which makes it, in my mind, absolutely hypocritical.  I can't believe I haven't heard this most-deserved criticism yet levelled against this film - IT IS HOMOPHOBIC.  The film takes great pains to show both sides of the story and treat most of the characters fairly, based on race or ethnic origin or gender, etc. - but the whole plot starts due to the sadistic and evil action of the gay Serbian general, who SPOILERS places the body of the Bosnian soldier overtop the land mine so that it will explode.  There are a few anti-Serbian slurs levelled by the Bosnian soldier for this action - but the only other Serbian character, the soldier stuck in the trench with him, is mostly a positive character and depicted as presumably heterosexual (in movies like this, if the character is not specifically denoted as gay, let's face it, he's straight.)  I'm not saying that gay men, particularly those in the army, can't be capable of some terrible things - the problem here lies in the fact that this is a movie - and when you depict the only representative from a minority as despicably evil and sadistic, you are making a statement about the entire minority.  A second gay character not depicted as such would negate the hatred of the first portrayal.  But no such luck in this film - we are left to believe that hating others because they are different is bad, except if they're a trouble-making gay man who, thank God, already got what he deserved.  <br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot about why the filmmakers decided to make this dead Serbian general gay - what point were they trying to make?  Were they worried that some Serbians might object to a heterosexual Serbian general doing something as terrible as placing a body over a land mine to do nothing except kill some more?  Did they think by making this general gay they would therefore eliminate any guilt felt by other Serbs, who would assume, ""well, he was a faggot so that's why he did this despicable thing, not because he's Serbian.""  You can bet a million dollars that's why the writers WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY to make sure we knew the general was gay.  This is offensive and this film deserves to be attacked for its hypocrisy.  This one major homophobic attack in this film completely ruined what should have been a fulfilling experience for me.  <br/><br/>Heterosexual male filmmakers have been doing this for years - whether in prison movies, or Nazi movies, or anywhere - eliminate heterosexual male guilt by making the chief antagonist gay - don't bother making the character a fully-rounded individual - just make him gay and this will be enough proof of why he's so despicable.  This tendency of using the gay villain has, thankfully, abated in North American cinema.  Unfortunately not in Bosnia."

","A group of Bosnian reinforcements gets lost in the fog at night. They wake up and get mowed down by the Serbs. Čiki finds himself alone. The Serbs send out an old veteran and newbie Nino to check. They find a body and the grizzled veteran places a bouncing mine under it. Čiki kills the veteran and takes Nino hostage. The body turns out to be Cera who isn't actually dead. The three struggle as the UNPROFOR comes to evacuate whoever is stranded in no man's land. Marchand tries to call in somebody to defuse the mine but his commander Soft insists that they leave immediately. TV reporter Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) hears the exchange on the radio and threatens to shine a light on the ineffective UN.<br/><br/>I really like the UN and the black comedy they do. The language barrier is always funny. The ridiculous nature of their work is good for a laugh. I'm not as enamored with the Serb and Bosnian soldiers. It bothers me that they keep not killing each other. It doesn't make any sense that the Bosnian doesn't kill Nino right away. He should kill Nino and try to sneak out during the night. After that, it seems the situation never gets right. I think it would be better to not see how they got into their situation. The movie could start with UN arriving at the checkpoint. There also has to be a better way to make a standoff situation. I wonder if the UN find the two man both stepping on a mine. They can't kill each other because the mines would blow. It would allow them to argue with no holds barred. I don't buy that these guys would take prisoners."

","This movie was up against ""Amélie"" in the 2002 Academy Awards and won. So I have to say this right up front: unduly. ""No Man's Land"" is a well-made movie about a very worthy subject. Amélie is a groundbreaking masterpiece.<br/><br/>Now that that's off my chest and I can sleep soundly again, to the movie itself. No Man's Land starts off with a small platoon of Bosniak replacements getting lost in no man's land, and being consequently viciously cut down by the Serb foes when the sun rises. Only two of the platoon survive badly wounded. One of them is being discovered a a Serb patrol, taken for dead, and placed on a live mine (in order to assault Bosniaks trying to salvage the body). The other Bosniak manages to take one Serb hostage. So now we have three wounded, inexperienced soldiers in the middle of mine-riddled nowhere. The movie takes on a parabolic, abstract note because the soldiers are all wounded, but are surprisingly active and talkative. The first half of the movie deals with the three inept, wounded soldiers confronting each other, without having the guts to gun each other down.<br/><br/>Then UNPROFOR gets wind of this conundrum and comes to the the rescue. This is when the movie takes on a satirical twist, and becomes more bearable than the realistically dire first half. But eventually there are no winners in this movie. The knights in white (the warring factions call them the smurfs due to their white uniforms and blue helmets) withdraw and leave a mess behind. We are stuck in Bosnia, a far sight away from cute Hollywood endings.<br/><br/>Overall a painful but memorable movie."

","A film can be made for a number of reasons. And it can do a lot of things, ranging from entertainment to boredom. But this film is one of the few that make you ashamed.<br/><br/>No matter how much or how little you noticed the inhumanity in Bosnia, no matter how hard you try to remember it or forget it, you must realize this sense of shame deep inside you. Naturally, I am counting on your being human.<br/><br/>Why ashamed? Why us? Because what we did, what ever it was, was not enough. Help we offered was insufficient, measures we took were short of purpose, actions we took were in-consequent.<br/><br/>That, in fact, was confirmed last week when world leaders gathered to express their remorse, saying they were ashamed. I sincerely hope they were. They really need to be. We all do.<br/><br/>We had the experience of two big and many small wars, all ignited, inflamed and fueled by racism, that evil of evils, disguised in one hideous form or other. Yet, all this happened amidst us and we let it happen before our openly closed eyes.<br/><br/>Danis Tanovic who made this memorable film must be a genius. I wonder what such an extra-ordinarily talented young director could not achieve, given the right opportunities and proper grooming.<br/><br/>Back to No Man's Land. It must be understood why this film can be embarrassing for so many because of its honesty. It is not an easy film to watch. It asks you constantly which side you are on. Not a simple matter to decide under the omniscient presence of our devils--hypocrisies we are fed by ""global"" media, bigot-ism that characterizes our leadership, dysfunctionalaity that we have institutionalized.<br/><br/>This film shows us all. Both the despair and hope in a situation ready to explode any moment. Both sides of war-makers. And of peacemakers.<br/><br/>We see individuals unfold, show us the way they were, and what war has changed them into. A war imposed upon all of them by the greatest racist next to Adolf Hitler himself. Yet a war they themselves choose to fight, hardly trying to reconcile, to overcome hatred against and fear of one another. They kill each other in the end because they are afraid. Afraid to be human.<br/><br/>We observe media concerned to make their day. We see organizations at work, organizations led by aristocrats paid ludicorously large pentions merely to do nothing. They overdo their jobs, by even not letting other do any thing either. Kipling's verse about camels comes to mind. Strange coincidence.<br/><br/>The film catalogs all these efforts, sincere or otherwise. And it makes its point. It shows their inadequacy. How can you help when you do not understand? Or even worse, if you will not understand? Or the worst scenario, if you can not understand. Simply because you are unable to do so. Because you lack empathy. That, precisely, is what this movie makes you realise.<br/><br/>This is one meaningful film. And it tries its best to convey that to you. Though, this does not mean it will be catering much food for your thought or whetting your insatiable appetite for half-truths. No sir, it simply employs a near forgotten technique: it tells the simple and whole truth. It takes you inside the world of discourse, shows you around, challenges you what you would do if you were the man in the trench, in the jeep, in the office.<br/><br/>In order to make you ashamed ""No Man's Land"" leaves no stone unturned. Except the one whose firmity, that bosnian, the man in question has to rely upon."

","In these days, most of the successful war films are mainly comprised of spectacular action sequences, bloody and most realistic scenes of war violence, disturbing picture and continuous thunderous sound effects. No Man's Land, a low-budget film from Bosnia, has practically none of these. Yet it should be considered one of the most spectacular war dramas ever made. Full credit to Tanovic for presenting us a magnificient story, superb direction and most important, the message the film carries.<br/><br/>What war actually is, we the common people who stay away, cannot understand. We take war as a hot topic to discuss, a set of stories to sell, a subject to argue about in the parliaments, a headline to adorn the first page of newspapers. We can never get the true spirit of war. Only soldiers, who suffered, who bore hardship, who lost everything, can only feel it. Others practically enjoy war as if it's a movie. So through Tanovic's lens, everyone is guilty, everyone..... politicians, media persons, journalists, peacekeepers from UN...... everyone who is related, but not directly involved. Why? because they don't think of the future of the soldiers, they only think about the future of the war.<br/><br/>This basic message is the heart and soul of the movie. And the superb, provocative ending.... it's just a satire meant for other commercial filmmakers. Tanovic really did a revolutionary job in this film. He was well assisted by the two main actors. Branko Djuric is excellent as Chiki and Rene Bitorajac has also performed quite well. I don't understand the language, but I saw it with English subtitles. So, for a movie which starts off with a four-letter-word, No Man's Land is certainly far beyond your expectations."

A few shots are fired, and a handful of people die, but that's it. There are no heroes here, just total confusion and chaos.<br/><br/>Deceptive in nature but utterly charming and compelling underneath, the film thrives on Danis Tanovic's humour which promotes silliness but never comes close to overstepping the boundaries of credibility.<br/><br/>The film is riveting from first minute to last, which is testament to Tanovic's Cannes-prize-winning screenplay, and although the inevitable conclusion is left unspoken, the 90 minutes that preceded it seemed so wholesome and refreshing that I have to award it full marks: 10 out of 10."

","War is Hell. Everyone knows adage. But, just as Dante asserts in the Divine Comedy, different Hells are reserved for different people depending on our sins. And while writer and director Denis Tanovic is vague about which sins of the past brought the Former Yugoslavian Republics to the Hell of the genocidal wars of the 1990's, he does a masterful job painting for a picture of the schizophrenic, absurdest hell which razed the bucolic towns and villages and raped the lush natural beauty of this troubled land for nearly a decade. He was rewarded for both his writing and directing with numerous awards, including the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film (2002) and a Palme d'Or nomination at the Cannes Film Festival. The film opens with a squad of Bosnians on an early patrol who suddenly find themselves in an exposed position when the fog lifts. A shell-burst from a Serbian tank kills all but one of them, Ciki (Branko Djuric) who hides in an abandon trench, and watches, wide eyed, in one of the most tension-riddled scenes from the movie, as two Serbian soldiers- one of whom is the green, nervous, new recruit Nino (Rene Bitorajac) come to inspect the kill. Through the course of the film, the two men, both wounded, must try to work together to survive and return to their own lines But, as their situation a microcosm for the larger conflict, just when it seems common ground is about to be reached, they take two steps backwards when real or perceived insults lead to a break-down in peace-talks, mainly in the form of petty, childlike recriminations as to ""who started it"". Eventually both men are shot in the ass by the other. As if things weren't bad enough, a mine under the ""body"" of a not-so-dead Bosnian soldier will kill them all should he move. Without revealing too much, it does not end happily, and many viewers will be left puzzled, trying to figure out who is to blame. Perhaps the militaristic Serbs, with their crisp uniforms and shiny equipment? Or decidedly un-military Bosnians, with their shaggy haircuts and civilian attire? Or perhaps maybe the do-nothing smurf-helmeted ""peace-keepers"" of the UN, under orders to stay out of harm's way? Or maybe even the grim, amorphous specter of War itself, that ever present Horseman of the Apocalypse, is ultimately at fault? Tonavic, a Bosnian, does place the blame at the feet of the Serbs, albeit in a somewhat subtle and sub-textual way. Even in their appearances, we are lead to favor the Bosnian,who, with his 40-something age, and Rolling Stones t-shirt, looks somewhat like everyone's favorite stoner uncle, while the person of Nino the Serb, with his shaved head, sharp nose, and wire-rimmed glasses, would look just as at home in an SS uniform as he does in Serbian military fatigues. However, Tanovic establishes that he is not the shock-troop we might think him to be based on his appearance; we have previously seen Nino try to introduce himself to the veteran with whom his is paired for his mission, only to be angrily informed that the crusty old soldier has no interest in learning his name, as newly conscripted soldiers die soon anyway. Thusly, we simultaneously are made to sympathize with both the Bosnian and the young Serb, as they are both terrified and vulnerable in the face of a pointless war not of their choosing. Many, including Stephen Holden of the New York Times, read the text as being neutral in regards to the righteousness of the belligerents, with the true villain being an apathetic UN peace keeping mission, embodied by morally corrupt British Col. Soft (Simon Callow), whose command decisions are aimed only at protecting the image of the UN."

From the point of view of three grievously injured soldiers from both sides stuck down a trench in the neutral zone, we experience their hatred for each other, and their forced truce in the face of pending death. One of them has been placed under a live grenade, which makes their situation even more precarious as he can't move an inch without blowing them all sky high. Also, we see the perspective of the media (Which is only after a big story) and the generals (Who are more concerned with saving face than saving lives). Put them all together, and you have an intoxicating political brew, which is as frenetic as it is interesting to watch.<br/><br/>The plot moves in unexpected ways, and because these are flawed people we're talking about here what could have been a quick and easy resolution is complicated by interests from many different parties, who end up just getting in getting in each others way with their separate agendas. While those poor troops are bleeding to death at the bottom of this pit, everyone who could assist them is too busy bickering about protocol and headlines to give them the support they need. Mind you... the soldiers aren't really helping matters either by engaging in petty squabbles and unnecessary violence, even in their predicament.

Slowly but surely, the news gets out, and the incident is the center of attention.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about the war as much as it's about how the world saw - or wanted to see - the events, and simply the inanity of everything that happened in Bosnia following its independence.

Not to mention what happens when UNPROFOR gets involved and the media starts covering it.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ""Ničija zemlja"" (the title in Bosnian) doesn't paint a pretty picture of international affairs: aside from the genocide itself, there was the helplessness of the foreign governments to do anything about it, and the ""human interest story"" approach that the press took, much like in Rwanda (which one character mentions). One could consider these the troika of tragedies in any tragic situation. But I definitely recommend the movie. The fact that things similar to the depicted events keep happening casts a sorry shadow on our world.<br/><br/>Also starring Katrin Cartlidge as a reporter and Simon Callow as a general."

","after a long time finally i managed to purchase a DVD of this film although i forgot all about it long time ago. I was recently looking for foreign movies then i got this one. It was very fine portrayal and depiction of war while also shows the amount of helplessness the U.N had possessed at that time. But another thing likable was the humor added into this film. The enemies were staying together caught in a desperate situation which was unavoidable while they also don't like each other they were also tired of the realities and mess of war they had to endure. I like to say you may watch this movie not by as an ethnic Albanian Muslim , a Croat or Serb , just as human and you will enjoy it and then you will probably enjoy it. My perception is that in most conflicts in the end only death , destruction , hatred and backwardness prevails. One can understand who has seen it all"
"stuka24","7","1","4","21 September 2006"," ""Comic drama"" about the eternal tragedy of war,
","Good film about the huge lack of communication that all kinds of war entails. <br/><br/>Great characters, from courageous Sgt Marchand to a killable US commander aptly called ""Soft"". Marchand ""I may be mad, but not stupid"" (!). Jane Livingstone was a great ""hysterical reporter"". While definitely not working for any cause but her own, she was perky enough to get her job done, and through the story one comes to realize she does hold on to some principles. <br/><br/>Of course ""Nino"", desperately wanting approval in a handshake, even from a Bosnian :). And the punctual German ""démineur"", specially his face when he's got to go back to the trench and act as if he worked :). So the matter-of-fact ways of ""Cera"". <br/><br/>When I originally saw this film I didn't like it much. Maybe the topic came by me as an ""Oscar grabber"", maybe ""Ciki"" was a bit too much of a ""hero"" to be honest. <br/><br/>I like the fact that Tanovic managed to include good ""comedy"" amidst this drama. Like the ineptitude of both sides, the hopeless way the French tried everybody to speak French :), the roughness of a fat Serb official & crew, and Simon Callow's pompous Brit accent and nice ""assistant"". And Cera's description of his situation. Ironical, very ""Balkanic"" indeed...<br/><br/>Jeffrey Leach (Omaha) on Amazon shows what a good reviewer can do. I am glad Amazon selects his ""spotlight reviews"" so well! Just one phrase sums it all: ""The film also transcends the peculiarities of the region to make a statement about the absurdities of war in the age of mass media"". Same goes for Linda Linguvic (New York City)'s first paragraph.<br/><br/>I agree with ""Coventry"" on IMDb that it having won over the stupid ""Amélie"" shows the Oscars are sometimes given to good movies. Well, then they gave everything to LOTR, so they ruined everything, but at least in the valuable ""Foreign film"" you will always get quality over marketing. Too with his ""Tanovic succeeds in bringing what so many other directors desperately attempt and fail"". And ""little ingenious findings and subtle sarcasm"".<br/><br/>I'd like to close this review with the valuable words of ""Jane Livingstone"": Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral"". Much like this famous phrase quoted in the end of ""Tears of the sun"": as English philosopher Edmund Burke said, 'The only thing necessary for the triumph -of evil- is for good men to do nothing.'<br/><br/>Sleep well."
"ssener","8","1","4","3 July 2006"," no man's land .. if you re looking for a different war film this is IT..
","No Man's Land is the term used by soldiers to describe the ground between the two opposing trenches. This film is shoot ed in a valley which is a no man's land between Serbian and Bosnian trenches. <br/><br/>The director of this film Danis Tanovic showed us that a perfect war film can be made without including large bombing scenes, flying bloody dead bodies, cut off heads or spread out intestines with special effects by this way this film brings in a new form of war films.<br/><br/>I think we can call this film as a satirical film because it shows us the uselessness of war. Also it criticizes the idleness of the bureaucracy. <br/><br/>The interesting side of this story is that two characters are at shooting distance of both enemy armies(they are at a no man's land between two lines) and therefore have the risk of dying from friendly or enemy fire. Also another Bosnian lies on a mine in the trench. They cannot run, for they will be shot by the other army, and the soldier lying over the mine cannot move, or it will blow and kill all. In this hard situation he two main combatants never become friends during their trouble. As we can see at the end of the film there is little trust existing between the two. They are both only interested in their own interests, not the other.<br/><br/>This film doesn't take sides in the conflict neither the Bosnian and Serbian. Rather, it's more a human story than a war story, in this film UN is shown bad because they seem careless in this situation. They just interfere the situation when media pressure comes to the scene. This also shows the power of media. It has huge affects even the war situations and even in the life's of people. <br/><br/>As we know this film is a Bosnian film, but we can say that even Bosnians had a very bad history with Serbians they showed the story in most non-judge mental way.<br/><br/>It is not entertainment film. The film is a drama but it also contains some funny scenes. I will give examples of these by using quotes. For instance here is a dramatic sentence; Jane Livingstone: Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral. And a funny conversation. A french UN soldier approaches the Serbian line and tries to communicate with a Serbian soldier: Sgt.Marchand: We came for people. Serb private: Yes. Sgt. Marchand: People between lines. Serb private: Yes, yes. Sgt. Marchand: Where are they? Serb private: Yes, yes, yes. Sgt. Marchand: OK, you don't understand a word of what I'm saying, right? Serb private: Yes. This conversation makes people laugh so they do not get completely bored of the dramatic situation. Also there is one more quote that took my attention the most: The cameramen asks the reporter that if she wants him to record the trench. And she answers by saying that there is no need, a trench is a trench, they are all the same. But as we see in this situation it is not the case, because the UN forces leave the man lying on the mine in the trench but tell the media that they saved him so if they had turned back and filmed the trench they would see that is not the case but she did not want. So we can interpret this as there are many many things going on in war situations that we are not even aware of."
"youroldpaljim","Null","1","4","20 February 2003"," A memorable film.
","Two soldiers, one a Bosnian, the other a Serbian find themselves together in a trench that lies between both sides of the opposing forces lines. To complicate matters further, there is a third man first thought dead who comes to and is lying on top of a mine. An attempt to move him would instantly activate the mine and result in, well....KABOOM! Then the ineffective UN peace keepers arrive to decide what to do.<br/><br/>
If I were a film studies teacher, the first rule I would instruct my students on how to judge a film is this; is this a film that one sits through with only mild interest and does it begin to fade from memory  hours after one has seen it? Or does the film grab your interest and the next day after seeing it does one reflect on it? In the latter case it can be for a variety of reasons: a good performance(s),  memorable photography or art direction, a frightening or exciting scene, or the events in the film are thought provoking. NO MANS LAND, while it has its faults, it is a thought provoking film. The film left me wondering what would I do in situation like this. The film also stands out because it is not afraid to slaughter sacred cows. The UN peace keeping force is accurately portrayed as an infective bureaucracy hindered operation more concerned about its public relations image then really doing something to bring peace to this war torn land. The film also takes a swipe at TV journalists in which a TV reporter named Jane Livingston projects an image as a crusading idealistic TV journalist but is only really interested in getting good footage to boost her networks ratings and career (much like most TV journalists in real life.)<br/><br/>NO MANS LAND has a few holes here and there (such as the two soldiers seem to recover from there wounds rather quickly) but is overall an effective and memorable film."
"turkam","9","1","4","16 December 2002"," If you know ethnic strife, then you know this film
","I am a Turkish-American. I think many Americans often wonder how these things occur. Alas, in my father's country, there have been such conflicts with Kurds, Greek and Armenians to name just a few! I must say the most disturbing thing about them- well, one of the most disturbing things, is that by the time so much blood has been spilled, the other side honestly begins to feel that there is something sinsiter or savage about the other side, and that each person from that race is one who should be shot dead in cold blood. This film illustrates how this atmosphere creates an authentic hatred and distrust, which can only be escalate- not alleviate- when outsiders step in, though admitedly, outsiders are overwhlemed with a moral obligation to try and stop the madness and it would be inhuman to just let people kill each other- though they will probably do that under any circumstance.If this sounds hypocritical, than you should visit a country torn up by such battles as I did when I went to the northern (Turkish) portion of Cyprus in 1991. I think this film captures the insanity as well any documentary could, and really it is perhaps the best film out of 'the Balkan region' since ""When My Father Was Away On Business."""

","No superstars, no $100million budgets, no pyrotechnics and no feel-good endings. But No Man's Land is still one of the most entrancing experience in recent years.<br/><br/>Perhaps its understated satiric humour and down-tempo ending screwed its chances for box office success(Or perhaps it was the subtitles). But justice did prevail(at least in real life), as this little known anti-war tragi-comedy quietly usurped the honors of 2001's best Foreign language film from the more obvious audience favourite, Amelie.<br/><br/>Without condescension or preaching, No Man's Land conveyed clear messages on humanity, the absurdity of war and the tragic repercussions of idealogical differences. All timely issues worth pondering in our war mongering era.<br/><br/>

","Danis Tanovic's movie about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The story is centered around three soldiers, one serb and two bosnians, who get caught up together in a trench in no man's land between the two fighting sides. To complicate matters, one of the bosnian soldiers is lying on top of a bouncing mine and cannot be moved without it exploding.<br/><br/>The movie won the Best Screenplay Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2001, in my opinion a great choice. At times this is a pretty lighthearted story with a lot of short lines and situations that make you laugh, but in the end, the feeling we are left with is still that war is never funny and is always meaningless.<br/><br/>I loved the portrayal of the U.N and their inability to really make a difference, overall the acting was good, and the camera and scenery makes this film great to see."

There are no heroes and no villains - only scared, tired people who are cast a hopeless lot.<br/><br/>The film doesn't dwell on being profound, it just tells the story and lets the truthfulness of the characters and their situations speak for themselves.

This is by far the most interesting part of the film as the situation allows to analyze a anti-nature collaboration : a classical confrontation along with a painting of the absurdity of war. Second, no man's land is a documentary in which the director posts a tough opinion against UN action during the war, and depicts journalists as progressists. This part, even though enhanced by the brilliant acting of the FORPRONU sergeant and a cynical end, is flawed for being not funded on a rigorous analysis of the facts.

Convincing battle stuff with mines and gun wounds that are quite chilling in their close-to-home feel, and the main characters maintaining the senseless enmity that seems so hard to understand from a distance of a Western country that is not torn apart by war.

Now I have a couple of words about story. ""What is really charming in the movie?"" if you asked, my answer is the story. Tanovic wrote a unique story which can be lived in any conflict area and draw charactheres who you can see anywhere even you can be one of them. But what makes his work excellent is he made an anti-war movie without using cliches and run down violence cheaply. Instead he used violence at place just as it should be. Ciki and Nino are looking at each other as soldiers which would probably be like that in real life. As they are soldiers, violence is a part of their life and Ciki uses it in the correct dose. The time that movie ended was the Ciki's lost of self control. In conclusion, great movie, I will wait for other productions from same director."

","This is the best insight into the Bosnian conflict ever pictured in a movie. For everyone with any interest and knowledge of the war, this movie will sum up the whole conflict.  It hits the international community and bureaucracy for its inaction and half measures.  The final scene is the final word on UN involvement and its effectiveness.  The absurdity of the whole conflict is main theme of the movie.<br/><br/>joaodelauraaurora in his review remarks that the conflict of the two characters is sometimes ""childish"" and ""not up to the hatred and grievances that oppose the two nations.""  That is not a flaw in the movie, that is how things really are.  In Bosnia Serbs and Bosnians and Croats were friends, neighbors, and even relatives.  The reason the director chose to have the characters conflict be ""childish"" is to show that the ancient hatreds that have been talked about by the politicians of the world are in fact not that deep and not that bitter as the extremists and nationalist would have you believe.  The reviewer also thinks that the UN bureaucracy is the villain in the movie, and yes this is true, but this does not deviate from the real true story of the war.  The UN was brought into Bosnia to show the world cares, but they did nothing but create an excuse for not lifting the arms embargo (also mentioned briefly in the movie) on the Bosnian government.  The UN distributed aid, but the Serb forces would often take at least half as a ""tariff"".  The media he says also plays a villain, but I think the view of the media is balanced.  It shows the media bringing the worlds attention to the war and the inaction of the UN, but it also shows the personal interest involved.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want a balanced well rounded view of the Bosnian conflict this is the movie for you.  If you want to pretend that the worlds leaders truly tried to do anything for Bosnia, or if you want a simple answer (even if its not totally true) to the cause of the war (ancient hatreds) then avoid this movie.  The truth about the conflict is in this movie, definitely go see it. P.S. Reviewers that mentioned a conflict between Croats and Serbs in this movie are also incorrect, there are no Croats portrayed in this movie. Also the song at the end of the movie has not subtitles, so the audience if they do not speak Serbo-Croatian/Bosnian will not realize that its a lullaby (song to put kids to sleep)."

"film-critic","Null","1","5","3 November 2004"," Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral.
","No Man's Land is an extremely social film about the absurdity of war and the lack of humanity that surrounds it. It takes a very recent conflict with the Bosnians and Serbs and translates it into a message that is very relevant in today's current Iraq conflict. While it begins as our normal, mundane and clichÃ© war film, it quickly changes 'when the fog lifts' and our two heroes are forced into a situation that they never chose to be in. Director Danis Tanovic uses a new trick of storytelling by eliminating the hordes of soldiers and limiting our interaction with just two people that are to represent their own country. This impressed me about this film. Each character in this film represents their own country. Nino is the Serbs, Ciki is the Bosnians, and the French officer tries to place the peacekeeping French. When you take the human away from the picture, you begin to see this as a battle between countries with a 'neutral' character standing in. It also reminded me of a boxing match. We had our two fighters whom never really became friends because they had to fight, and the referee called the UN who was there to blow the whistle if it was ever too rough. <br/><br/>After you begin to see that we have moved from a platoon war film to a simple two-person fight (worthy of the stage) of which each symbolize their own country, the rest of this film falls into place. Well, I was hoping that it would at least. I wasn't crazy about this film. I was expecting to see a tour de Force of imagery and triumph because it was able to beat out Amelie for best picture, but sadly I think the Academy went with this film because of the message that it sent throughout the picture. As I said before, this is a very social film. It dabbles in the idea that wars are sometimes fought for the wrong reasons and for forgotten times. There is a conversation between the Serb and Bosnian near the beginning of the film that I thought was interesting. They were talking about how this war started, and neither could remember who was the aggressor and who was the pacifist. Why was this war still happening? Nobody knew, but the anger and hatred was still in full demand. They each continue fighting over who caused this accident to happen to our man under the mine. Instead of helping and trying to save him, they fight. I saw this as yet another 'jab' against war. Most of the time the soldiers are so upset that being a savior comes second nature to fighting. We can definitely see this in our current battles overseas.<br/><br/>Another key element in this film was the lack of use in the media, and the way that the UN is portrayed. First, the role of the media in this film. While they were key in brining the UN to the site of the accident, they are not very forceful in knowing the truth. I found this to be shocking and very realistic at the same time. They got their story, they pulled their ratings out of the ground, but the need to know the truth and to be of some help was obviously lacking. This was a huge punch in the media's faces. They are portrayed as cold, heartless celebrities that use the camera as their weapon of choice. Let us not forget the UN as well. No Man's Land hugely knocks the role of the UN in this conflict. One of the quotes from this film, 'Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral' is a direct slam on to the policies of the UN. For most of these conflicts, troops are there to keep the peace, not to interfere. Therefore, the UN is asking their troops to ignore the violence, and allow the UN to be there just to say they were there. This is obviously the way that director Danis Tanovic wanted to portray the UN and it came out very clearly. It was a genuinely emotional scene that seemed to resonate from the director's heart. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a decent film. I was expecting much more than what was present due to the fact that it beat out Amelie for best Foreign Film at the Oscars, but it carried itself well. I felt it could have been more comical and a little less politically social commentary. By the first thirty minutes of this film I could see what the director wanted to accomplish and I needed something different. I wanted to be shocked and surprised, but instead I found a half-creative film that could have pushed the envelope a bit more to allow it to reach new heights. I think you should see it once, but a second viewing is right out of the question. Instead, spend more time seeing Amelie.<br/><br/>Grade: *** out of *****"

"marshallv-08999","6","0","1","9 May 2018"," Bosnian American Studies Student Review
","No Man's Land is a comedy/war film directed by Danis Tanovic about the very complicated situation in Bosnia involving the war. While this movie is comical, we felt it could offend someone of Bosnian culture who has any past ties with the war. Something as detrimental as the Bosnian War isn't something that necessarily you wanna make a joke about. While the movie had some decent comedy, I feel it doesn't touch on the important parts of the Bosnian War. 
 This movie starts off with a group of Bosnian soldiers as they're crossing a field and they stop to take a rest but are quickly ambushed by a group of Serbian soldiers camped upon a hill. One of the Bosnian soldiers escapes the area and rolls in a trench. He starts to bandage himself up after he was shot in the arm and he hears 2 Serbian soldiers looking in the area and they plant a bouncing betty under a dead body incase any Bosnian soldiers try to take the body away. The Bosnian soldier eventually comes out and shoots the captain then holds the other one at gunpoint. He's a bit of a awkward man, bald and his character is comedic because of just how outlandish he is in this war. Like how he is so, quirky unlike everyone else who has such a serious tone. It's quite the contrast of personalities between the Serbian soldier and the Bosnian Soldier. Shortly after, the Bosnian soldier makes the Serbian soldier take off his clothes for humiliation and wave a white flag as he ran across the field. The Serbians see him and don't recognize him so they try to mortar strike the area and they hide in this bunker together. After this, they have a serious argument about who started the war. Shortly after the argument, the guy who was presumed dead and placed on a bouncing betty, wakes up and they immediately warn him not to move as there is a bomb underneath him. They sit there arguing some more and they don't really do anything cause they really can't. They eventually call the UN for a bomb squad and they check but they basically say they can't do anything about it. This enrages the Bosnian guy and he shoots the Serbian guy but then the UN shoots the Bosnian guy and they peace the scene. The movie ends with them laying there. 
 The funny parts of this movie were in the interaction between the Serbian and Bosnian soldier. While it doesn't slander the horrors of the Bosnian War, it still makes it seem so fabricated in the arguments. I have a odd feeling that they wouldn't be that civil. Besides the interaction between the soldiers, I think the representation of the UN that they had were very accurate as they were portrayed as people who were in the middle and really didn't care about what was going on between both sides. Also the brutality of the war is showed vividly, more importantly in the scene where they are mortar striking the Serbian soldier even though they didn't even check to see if he was a comrade or a enemy."

","About halfway through No Man's Land (2001), a minor character reads a newspaper and vexes about the situation in Rwanda. We all know what he is talking about when he refers to the ""situation"" but we as the audience can't help but giggle at his comment. For this minor character, and in fact all the characters are trapped in a very similar situation; the Balkan conflict/genocide following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Yet through this singular comment, one can get a true sense of the caustic world director Danis Tanovic creates for us.<br/><br/>The film starts with a group of Bosnian soldiers traipsing through dense fog. They are on their way to the front but have gotten lost and decide to camp out for the night. The next morning they discover they are in the middle of no man's land, the space between two enemy lines. All but one (Branko Duric) manages to crawl into an abandoned trench. The rest are mowed down by friendly fire. Two Serbian soldiers are sent into the fray to see what had happened; one is killed, the other (Rene Bitorajac) injured and trapped along with the Bosnian in the middle of two fronts. Just as things are starting to calm down between the two, a second Bosnian survivor (Filip Sovagovic), previously thought to be dead, wakes up and discovers he is booby-trapped with a mine under his back, unable to move.<br/><br/>The central crisis isn't so much a tension fructifying experience that allows for character development and constructive dialogue, it's rather a story of wicked satire about modern warfare with the three in no man's land becoming pawns in a complex and lugubrious conflict. At first no one seems willing to help these men; not the Bosnians, not the Serbians and certainly not the United Nations. It is only through the rash decisions of U.N. peacekeeper Sergeant Marchand (Georges Siatidis) and intrepid reporter Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) that these soldiers' problem becomes a bit of a global fascination.<br/><br/>Remember the days when war was fought between two opposing forces who would duke it out in geometric formations? Noble men would sacrifice themselves for their country and charge heroically into the fray; ramparts, rockets red glare, star-spangled, all-American warmongering etc. Nowadays peacekeepers, humanitarian aid, nation building, and bureaucracy are permanent unavoidable realities of war. It's almost like the powers that be are trying to suck all the fun out of combat.<br/><br/>The film doesn't take sides in the Baltic conflict, nor does it truly admonish the motivations behind the war itself. No Man's Land is not that small of a movie. No Man's Land attempts and largely succeeds in showing the ridiculous exercise in futility that is war as a whole. Even in today's modern world where things have become more complicated, with leaders bloviating, armchair generals amassing forces through spreadsheets and memos, lazy lieutenants barking orders to their underlings, the actual act of war is ultimately barbaric and immoral. ""Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder."" says Sergeant Marchand ""Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral."" With those words Marchand makes the connection many fail to draw on their own, war no matter how justified is still an act of murder. And that is ultimately how No Man's Land finishes its darkly comedic story. It begins with a depiction of war and ends with a (spoiler alert) depiction of murder as the world shrugs in ignorance. <br/><br/>For the record, it has been 12 years, 1 month and 2 days since the beginning of the war in Afghanistan which is among a list of approximately 30 continuing armed conflicts all around the world. I say this not to be haughty or controversial but to maintain a larger point. In the ongoing conflict in Israel, 272 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in 2012. By comparison 504 Americans were murdered in Chicago and 386 were killed in Detroit that same year. What that means is if we were to define war by fatalities we have more than a few in our own country. Or to put it more responsibly, we have a lot of murder globally to answer for. <br/><br/>Just as the credits in No Man's Land are about to roll, the intrepid reporter we have come to admire is asked if she wants one last shot of the trench. A quote by Albert Einstein goes through my mind every time I watch that particular last scene; ""Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them! How vile and despicable war seems to me! I would rather be hacked in pieces than take part in such an abominable business."" Sadly, in the fashion that many of the disaffected would answer, she says ""No. A trench is a trench, they're all the same."" I guess it's easy to not ruminate over such things when you can just change the channel."

","""Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral."" This quote sounds good and contains a very impressive statement about the crime of inaction. As I watched the movie many years ago for the first time, this quote was my favourite and I was fascinated by the movie's strong critical stance against the Western world watching people killed on TV, as if it was a reality show. More or less the same approach was on another civil war themed movie, Hotel Rwanda (2004), where again peace forces were nothing but an incapacitated group of tourists serving only to visual aesthetics in their colourful uniforms. Having watched No Man's Land for a second time, I have different feelings about it. The course of events is actually in its natural civil war conditions: People speaking the same language kill each other and all are convinced that they defend their fatherlands, until a French officer, who questions himself about the goals, purposes and responsibilities of his military mission, violates his authority and with some luck finds himself in a disillusion of being able to intervene, make decisions and save lives as a neutral side, meaning on neither side but on the side of humanity. In the eyes of the audience this officer with only good intentions throughout his actions, even when he disobeys his commander, is a hero. The character Jane Livingstone appears also to be such a hero using her camera instead of a weapon, whose statement on news channel summarizes the critical approach of the movie towards inaction. But later on even this sympathetic, charming woman hero turns out to be one of those greedy press members insulting his cameraman by telling him not to think or saying that a trench is just a trench. On the other hand the ""evil guys"", like the captain threatening the press members with confiscating their yellow cards or the colonel, who only sits back at his office and flirting with his ""secretary"", become the wiser ones with the unexpected and tragic final. Of course one cannot deactivate a quality trap mine, made in EU, because the EU produces only good stuff, which gives it the right to have a say in other countries with its military presence, whose members at the end of the day only get shocked by the madness of the ""maniac Balkan people"", who even don't know how to speak French. The tragic end didn't make me happy and when I first saw the movie I had really hopes for Cera when Chiki told him he'll die of cancer. But the tragedy is reality and it is good that Tanović didn't try to avoid it. The war itself was a choice and the mine was only produced to kill people right at the beginning. Saying ""I'm neutral"" in this case should be translated as ""it is not personal"". The bomb is not produced to kill Cera but anyone, so it is not personal and in the eyes of the war persons are not really worth, contrary to what the French officer thought at the beginning. I'm sure if the movie continued we would see him back in his hut and learned not to question things anymore, because a soldier's duty is to do what is said, not to think, just like Livingstone's cameraman. Both have to shoot when it is ordered."

","No Man's Land (not to be confused with the other eleventy billion films also called No Man's Land), is set in the mind-boggling Serbian-Bosnian-Croatian conflict of the early 1990s, and immediately looks like it's going to be one of those didactic movies out to push the ""can't we all get along"" message. Fortunately, such is not the case. The action starts with a scenario not altogether unfamiliar (it was used, for instance, in the sci-fi film Enemy Mine), in which, by a series of unfortunate circumstances, two Bosnians (one of them immobilized) and a Serb find themselves trapped in a trench together in the middle of a battleground. Things proceed tensely, if somewhat predictably, until the United Nations and the press get involved. That's when things really begin to develop, and we find ourselves involved a truly brilliant movie about the absurdity of war. You won't know whether to laugh or be ridiculously depressed."

","Not many movies made about the war in Bosnia which ended back in 1995. For many people, that war is now ancient history and who understands what happened anyway? This independent film tackles all of the tough subjects - the human cost of war, the pointlessness of it (who started the war?), neighbor against neighbor.<br/><br/>There's a bit of M*A*S*H, Catch-22, political satire (at the expense of the United Nations), criticism of modern headline grabbing media. People who try to get involved and make a difference sometimes make things worse. It's a dark satire of war, not a action movie.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are not realistic - the wounded walk and talk around as if they had scratches. Some of the things they do are silly.

","This 2001 Oscar winner for best foreign film is basically a simple remonstration against the absurdities of war: two men caught between their sides on the Serbo-Bosnian conflict and a wounded soldier laid over a bouncing Betty are forced to deal with their own hatred and dehumanization of each other while their respective armed forces, the UN, and global media reporters prove entirely impotent to do anything to save them. It proves very effective at being both hilariously funny (the two men arguing over who ""started it"" like little children, having to constantly one-up each other with weapons, and running around half naked trying to grab attention so that they can get help) and darkly desperate (their inability to fully lay down arms, the lack of care by the higher ups of any of the potential saviors, the leaving of the prone soldier to his own fate upon the land mine).<br/><br/>The best part about it is that it presents its themes rather directly and earnestly without pounding it in too hard or lingering on it--even with an almost two-hour runtime, it actually breezes by never puts too fine a point on it; it knows when to end and it progresses fluidly through the plot the entire time. The pacing on this film is almost immaculate and the writing is really good, so that by the end it's really very satisfying even if it does provide a rather dark denouement.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","This comment contains my opinion on the movie as well as my feelings I had after seeing it.<br/><br/>""There is no point in becoming friends<br/><br/>if we are to kill each other soon..."" <br/><br/>War, sacrifice, death, suffering, grieving tears...are they remembered as the years pass? Who really cares for the people who died? In the most privileged cases, they are offered monuments, poems or songs. People continue to make war despite those sacrifices. But, there is a possibility to talk about those brave, make them remembered, but, most importantly, say how miserable war is: this is good cinema. Young director Danis Tanovic has made a brilliant film titled NO MAN'S LAND the action of which takes place in 1993 during the infamous Balkan Wars. However, is it a movie about war? Partly yes, but saying it's a war film would be a highly limited view.<br/><br/>NO MAN'S LAND is, foremost, a very powerful, well directed picture of the misery and absurd PEOPLE are exposed to when any war breaks out. The two characters, Nino and Chiki, from opposing sides get through moments of horror and unbelievable psycho suffering. They are totally torn apart: ""Who started the war?"" they quarrel. ""Does it matter...we are in the same s*** now."" is Chera's reaction. ""I have a gun and you don't"" (so I rule here) appears to be the resemblance of what war really is. Cera, the man put on the mine between them on ""no man's land"" depicts a real suffering while the world TALKS of help, of peace and of dignity. The three are symbolically the whole nation placed in desperate situations, in personal tragedies while media badly want the latest information and politicians sit on their comfortable chairs with delicious ladies on tables... it's always simple people who suffer and this film is really with them, talks on their behalf! The characters used to live similar lives, used to have similar dreams, used to have the same school mates but suddenly, they were to be enemies.<br/><br/>These thought provoking aspects of the content go in pairs with profound moments of symbolism. The opening 5 minute-scene in fog clearly depicts war proceedings - like foggy day - never clear. The man on the mine constitutes a kind of obstacle between the two - the acts of war never allow for normal human feelings, normal friend talk.<br/><br/>Is the film depressing? Partly yes since everyone of good will asks themselves such questions like ""Is there anything we can do to change it?"" But don't think that while watching the movie, you will have a gloomy face throughout and need several tissues. It's more reality rather than tearjerker. There are a number of originally funny moments that accurately improve the atmosphere. Consider, for instance, Nino observed by his people and found ""zombie"" Other moments that made me laugh were: ""Do you speak English?"" dialog, Chiki-Nino talk about a bombastic girl Sania they once knew at school and the hilarious questions of media reporter Jane Livingstone. In the latest, the contrast is put on reporters and people in need: how differently the two perceive the world! The former find the latter ""idiots"" ""savage"" while the latter are only exhausted and fed up with the absurd of the former...<br/><br/>But what amazed me here as a movie fan are the performances. Rene Bitorajac and Branko Djuric as Nino and Chiki do marvelous jobs that result in authenticity of acting. You, as a viewer and an observer, do not get a single impression that it is all played. What they do is just flawless and they are, unfortunately, not the top names of cinema... Filip Sovagovic has a difficult role: to keep lying on the mine and does well. Katrin Cartlidge also does a fine job as the reporter seeking for sensation, Jane Livingstone. There is no focus put on the rest of the characters but isn't it better to develop fewer than introduce many.<br/><br/>NO MAN'S LAND is a movie I saw twice and I am certain that when I see it again, I'll find yet something new, something I have not noticed before. It is a profoundly symbolic, thought provoking movie that can leave you breathless in reflections. Killing; new death machine production; hatred promotion; control over the politics in the spirit short of mutual goodness; no care for simple people, for their dreams, their lives; superior power of weapon...may it all constitute a WAR'S EXCUSE? I would rather say what the three heroes of NO MAN'S LAND would probably say with me: NOTHING MORE FOR THE SAKE OF WAR but EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF LIFE, FRIENDSHIP and DREAMS OF BETTER FUTURE. Then, there will be a point in becoming friends, then there will be a point in regarding the earth as the planet of life..."

The other two soldiers (one Bosnian one Serb) both come from the same village and scored with the same town beauty who has since emigrated.<br/><br/>Over the space of a few hours, the bunker becomes a ceasefire zone and the story of its inhabitants is blown up into an international media issue - thanks to a compassionate French UN soldier and an intrepid English war correspondent.<br/><br/>Funny, highly watchable and not at all preachy, No Man's Land gets its message on the absurdity of was across very effectively.

"goacher","8","0","1","5 April 2005"," An Honest Appraisal On The Absurdities Of War
","This is a very good film focused on the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the war surrounding it. It cleverly makes a point about the horror of war without having to go into gory detail. We often become desensitised to the effects of war - all we see is a newspaper headline or a 30 second news bulletin; this film goes some way to reveal the reality. But the movie is not just an intellectual exercise: the black humour will make you chuckle and you'll also be gripped by the storyline.<br/><br/>The film is based around two characters from opposing sides in the war who end up stuck in ""no mans land"" between the two warring factions. It creates a darkly comic situation of two enemy soldiers having to cooperate to get to safety. It's interesting to see that the characters are often unable to cooperate because of the blind nationalism and petty prejudices that armed conflicts create.<br/><br/>I have only one criticism: the second half of the film introduced numerous United Nations personnel and the media as additional characters (the UN trying to rescue the soldiers in ""no mans land"", the media reporting on it), and frankly I thought the film was poorer for it. It simply tried to cover too much ground and too many issues and the attention on the main characters became diluted. Perhaps the scriptwriter wanted to make a point, but showing that the media are like vultures in a wartime scenario seems an obvious statement to me and none of the media characters were in the least bit interesting. Their appearance became a tedious distraction from the intrigue. In my view, a better approach would have been just to script the UN's role in this war and its methodology (something which may surprise many people) and just have the media as peripheral figures. It is for this reason that I have given the film 8/10 rather than a higher rating.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I can say that investing your time and money in watching this film is well worth it. It is one of the best films I have seen in the last five years."

Although the subject is extremely tragic (grim warfare, death, the hopeless inability of the international community and the eternal arrogance of the French),the tone of the film is relatively light and has a lot of comedy in it. The movie shows that even in such bad times, people remain people with all their good and bad sides, who are able to love, laugh, hate, and be selfish or extremely human. Therefore it bothers me that the movie, although it won several prizes, including an academy award, is so much ignored, for i think that it is absolutely suitable for a larger public, if the right buzz was created.

","Danis Tanovic's No Man's Land is a particularly deep film. It takes some jabs at the UN's refusal to help Bosnian and Serb troops caught in some trenches in no man's land during the war between the two countries; the film also criticizes the story-hungry leeches that are the media. This is all done in an ultra-cartoonish style, making a UN superior (Simon Callow) a snobby fat-cat, making the soldiers in no man's land (Branko Djuric, Rene Bitorajac, and Filip Sovagovich) tough wisecrackers, and making a reporter on the scene your typical sleazebag. The film succeeds in criticizing UN's decisions but the film's criticisms of the media are weak. However, the main reason to see this film is its stunning recreation (and reinterpretation) of the atmosphere of a battlefield. No, the film is not shot in some documentary style with blood splashed all over the lens and guts draped on every shrub; the film is made on an open field on a sunny day. As the second scene begins, we think we are about to see a pleasant experience-that is, until soldiers covered in blood enter the cheery atmosphere. This reminds me of the scene in Alain Resnais's Night and Fog, where the Narrator points out that the most innocent looking areas can be near a death camp. Why does every war film have to make us feel like we are in the Seventh Circle of Hell? Tanovic carries the story along creatively, swiftly coming up with intense and exiting situations. And the film is worth seeing for the sake of the final shot, which is jaw-dropping."
"rbverhoef","8","0","2","16 October 2004"," Satire in the style of 'Wag the Dog'
","'No Man's Land' is the film that unexpectedly took home the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; most people thought it would go to the French 'Amélie'. The reason this did not happen has probably to do with the themes of both movies. 'Amélie' is a modern fairy tale about little things that make people happy, about love, about something we see in a lot of films. (Although almost never as good as in 'Amélie'.) 'No Man's Land' is a movie about the former-Yugoslavian conflict. It is a movie like 'Wag the Dog'. Both movies are about something that could happen, shown in an exaggerated story to make it a satire.<br/><br/>Both movies are equally entertaining, sad in different ways. 'No Man's Land' starts with a group of Bosnian soldiers. It is the middle of the night and the fog is the reason they have no idea where they are. Daytime. The men are between the Bosnian and Serbian frontline, not a hard target for the Serbs. The Bosnian soldiers are all killed but one, Ciki (Branko Djuric).He ends up in a trench in no man's land. The Serbs send two soldiers to check the situation. They arrive in the trench, put a mine underneath a dead Bosnian body (a surprise for those who will pick him up) and find out that there is a Bosnian survivor. One of the two Serbs is killed by Ciki, the other wounded. His name is Nino (Rene Bitorajac). Now both men are in the trench in no man's land, both men want to get out alive.<br/><br/>In a Hollywood film the two would become friends I guess. 'The Iron Triangle', set in the Vietnam-war, comes to mind. This is not what happens here. First the dead Bosnian on the mine turns out not to be dead at all. Cera (Filip Sovagovic) is his name. The three come up with a plan to get all out alive. This leads up to the arrival of the UN, a French delegation. They are ordered to leave the field by their superior (Simon Callow). A British news reporter (Katrin Cartlidge) catches that conversation and threatens the French UN soldiers to transmit this. This makes sure the UN has to do something. In the meanwhile the conflict in the trench is not over.<br/><br/>I must say no more about the story. Basically it is there to support the satire. The two men in the trench show us with their dialogue how both parties look at the conflict, we see how little the UN can do, we see how things always change into a media circus. The ending is the most like 'Wag the Dog', showing how the media and the world can be mislead by powerful people. Maybe the event in this movie is implausible, but I believe there are stories like this one that really did take place. 'No Man's Land' is a good movie and works as a satire, but it is no 'Amélie' that shows us the most important thins: love!"

The chances of another film winning in this category on this particular year were about as good as they were in 1999 when La Vita è bella, (Life is Beautiful), won the same award.<br/><br/>Needless to say, after hearing the announcement I was amazed even disturbed, but mostly I was curious. I rented the film without reading anything about it; I was skeptical to say the least. When the movie was over I was completely stunned.<br/><br/>Keep in mind the fact that these two pieces are from opposite ends of the cinematic spectrum. Amélie's tag line is ""She'll change your life"".<br/><br/>""No Man's Land"" may change your life as well, and the outcome may be similar, the method of transformation, however, will be distinctly different.<br/><br/>The most popular misconception about this film seems to revolve around its primary subject matter. This is not a movie about the war in Bosnia.<br/><br/>Yes, it's is centered around the conflict between the Bosnians and the Serbs, but is that the main topic? The actors don't debate any bureaucratic issues; there is no specific discussion of right or wrong from a political standpoint. In fact, when you're finished watching this film you won't know anymore about the core of this controversy than you did before it started. This is simply an intense dramatic look at humanity and our instinctive obsession to stay alive under any and all circumstances. It's about human beings learning to practice civilized behavior in a very uncivilized situation.<br/><br/>It eloquently depicts an extreme scenario and the extraordinary conduct of three individuals from two rival factions. The same story could've been told, no less effectively, about anyone, anywhere at anytime, provided the subjects were sworn enemies and were prepared to fight one another to the death. It could have revolved around two contemporary urban street gangs or two armies from the middle ages. The only major requirement, in terms of change, would be the environment in which they were trapped.<br/><br/>In closing, ""Amélie"" vs. ""No Man's Land""? At the very worst it's a toss up. Need I say more?"

","""No Man's Land"" is a brilliant war movie, combining tragedy and wit with a virtuosity that successfully holds the audiences through the 91 minutes of this great film! I cannot think of a better and more obvious way of expressing the futility of the conflict. I absolutely adored the conversations of the two soldiers trapped in 'No Man's Land', and how they just failed to see beyond 'Who started the war?' The satire in 'Who holds the gun dictates the terms' was hilarious. The setup, with the soldier trapped on a bouncing mine, is both deeply tragic and immensely comic at the same time. UN (non)-intervention in the entire issue, and the insidious role of the media couldn't be better portrayed."

","I was very curious about this movie, for i'd heard both good and bad comment on it before i finally decided to rent it. And i was surprised by the way the makers of the movie showed their horror of a completely useless war (i know, aren't they all useless?).<br/><br/>They make their point by showing a almost absurd coincidence, in which the characters end up and how the different characters react on this strange situation. The sour part of the whole thing is the fact that this could have happened for real... For me, that's what makes this movie so good. For any of you have followed the news around the Yugoslavian war in the early nineties a little bit, you must recognize what i mean: The scene in which the Bosnian and the Serbian soldier are in the trench arguing about who started the war and when they cannot agree, the Bosnian guy has a gun in his hands and asked the other guy ""who started the war?!"" so the Serbian guy has to say ""we did"", because he would get shot if he sticks to his own opinion. And then further on in the movie the two of them get in a situation in which the Serbian soldier has a gun and he asks the Bosnian who started the war; now he has to say they started it, because he has a gun pointed at him! The whole movie is about how stupid the whole situation is when you start thinking about the real reasons of a war. Also the position of the UNPROFOR soldiers was a very clear statement! In this movie it were the French, but it could also have been the Dutch, or the Germans, or any other country in this 'peace-keeping humanity-mission'. They are there, they could make a difference, but they aren't allowed to do anything by their superiors! The media and a disobeing sergeant are needed to bring attention to the scene in the trench, but when things get a little rough, the superior almost literally says:'they (the Serbs and the Bosnians) are all crazy, they will never agree, so why should we bother....'<br/><br/>When you are going for a fast movie, or war action, don't buy or rent it, but when you are looking for how a couple of individuals can behave in an unpredictable, almost unreal situation, it's a must!!! For me this movie was one which shows the absurd way of making war in these modern times, and the way we, 'civilised' Western people think we can solve them with UN-missions or whatever, without taking the risk of actually getting hurt ourselves... At the end everybody is only trying to save his own ass, just like in real life, so only the one who depends on the help of others is left alone, gets killed or runs away saying he has tried..."
"ThurstonHunger","7","0","1","24 April 2004"," that signpost up ahead...it's booby-trapped
","While a lot of films as of late have focused on the gritty ""reality"" of war, this one instead looks at the gritty unreality inherent in such conflicts. It sort of felt like a Twilight Zone, but it is up to us viewers to provide their own inner Rod Serling voice-overs.<br/><br/>The majority of the film takes place in a trench between the Bosnians and Serbs, but the emphasis is on the larger gulf between that trench and the remote realms of politicos and infotainers.<br/><br/>Other reviews indicate that the dialog had more top-level humor for native speakers. Going by the subtitles alone I picked up mostly the black humor. Little things like a soldier at the frontlines who has the amazing foresight to see beyond his few clicks and worry about Rwanda, comments about cigarettes and universal English even when all one soldier knows is the word ""yes.""<br/><br/>There is broader humor along the lines of buffonery, especially in the ranks of the UN. But for me at least, the tension of what was happening in our little dirty microcosm was never watered down by what I perceived as humor. <br/><br/>If anything that humor, made the scenes more human. To help sustain the tension, the actors in the trench performed above and beyond the call of duty.  Additionally the character of the French sergeant Marchand is vital, as he behaves how I suspect we would all hope to behave. At least initially.<br/><br/>While I don't think that all wars can be reduced down along such simple lines, I do think the hatred that feeds and feeds off such wars can be. This film has you wondering if one side can turn the other cheek or other shoulder or other left leg ad bloody nauseum.<br/><br/>If the gaping gulfs created by the media and the UN are apparently doomed to apathy and inept inaction, can a bridge be made between one man and another?<br/><br/>7/10"

"Euromutt","Null","0","1","14 November 2002"," A promising, but ultimately flawed, small-scale war drama
","No Man's Land starts out as a very promising war movie as three wounded soldiers, two Bosniaks and one Serb, find themselves stuck in an abandoned trench between their respective armies in 1994. The Bosniaks cannot leave because one of them, Cera, has had his body booby-trapped while unconscious; the Serb, Nino, cannot leave because the second Bosniak, Ciki, is holding him as protection against Serb artillery. Unable to come up with a solution, the commanding officers on both sides call on UNPROFOR to resolve the situation. It is at this point that the film starts to display its flaws, and a number of these must be laid at the door of Danis Tanovic, both director and author of the screenplay. Tanovic appears to harbour an - admittedly understandable - bitterness towards the international community, particularly the United Nations, for its role in the conflict, but in getting his message across, he takes a series of liberties with realism. Tanovic portrays the UNPROFOR personnel - with the exception of the French Sgt. Marchand - as too petty, incompetent, cowardly and callously apathetic to get risk getting involved, and while there may have been some truth to this, Tanovic lays it on so thick it becomes gratuitous. Symptomatic of this is a moment where Marchand's superior, Cpt. Dubois, berates the journalist Jane Livingstone for listening in on his company's radio frequency; those familiar with UN peacekeeping mandates know that the troops are explicitly required to broadcast ""in the clear"" so that anyone can listen in. In another scene, a British colonel flies in from Zagreb, bringing his overly blonde and leggy ""secretary"" with him - considering the colonel's supposed obsession with his media image, this is too much for the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief to take. In conclusion, what might have been an excellent war drama, with tension being periodically relieved by wry humour, is ultimately marred by Tanovic's rather heavy-handed axe-grinding."

And in the background lies Ciki's comrade, Cera, whose booby-trapped position creates an additional tension throughout the film. Tanovic further dramatizes the story with a group of clueless and confused French UN peacekeepers and a plainly obnoxious troupe of journalists.their very presence does profess more cynicism about the purpose of international involvement in the war.  Overall, this movie gives insights to, not only an ethnic war, but to the conflicting tensions that are caused by the press media and the UN, the soldiers and the peacekeepers.<br/><br/>Despite the seriousness and grimness of Tanovic's themes, this movie pumps up a great deal of humor.absolutely dark amidst the most tragic moments.

","First, let me state that this is one helluva good movie.  However, I've got a few bones to pick with how it was represented.  If you've seen the trailer, then you probably think this is one of those bittersweet military comedies like M*A*S*H, where through comedy, the stupidity of war is revealed.  Sorry, but the trailer lies!  This movie is closer to ""A Midnight Clear"", a WWII movie in which the stupidity and inhumanity of war is revealed brutally and surprisingly with a bit of humor in the mix to soften the viewer up for the gut-wrenching finale.  When I was 8 years old I saw ""Gallipoli"", where Mel Gibson dies for no good reason.  As I left the theatre, I cried tears of grief, but even more so of RAGE; that lives could be devalued so callously offended me at a level I didn't even know existed. Twenty years later, I feel like I'm 8 years old again!  If this movie doesn't make you feel P***ED, then I suggest you reevaluate your humanity. There are a few movies that made me ashamed to be human and compelled me to shower afterwards.  ""No Man's Land"" joins the ranks of ""Schindler's List"" and ""8mm"" on that count.  When a movie makes me feel so strongly, be it positive or negative, I can only bow my head before the scriptwriters, directors, actors, and crew who evoked such emotion.  After watching ""Schindler's List"", my father asked me what I thought.  My answer, which is certainly apropos of ""No Man's Land"", was:  ""What an incredibly moving movie!  I hope I never see it again!""  I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough, but be warned: It is not a ""date"" movie, you will not ""feel good"" afterwards, and be prepared for some deep conversation after it is over."

","A clever black comedy, Denis Tanovic's film about enemies trapped in a trench during the conflict in Bosnia has a lot on its mind, primarily its intention to showcase the global political impotence towards the conflict and the insidious influence of a corrupt media--it covers a lot of bases. Tanovic doesn't have a lot of use for his characters other than as caricatures and mouthpieces (though there are some nice performances by Branko Djuric and Rene Bitorajac as two of the adversaries and Georges Siatidis as a concerned French U.N. observer) but he does infuse his script with plenty of humanity and the point of the project is to express his outrage at needless, sadistic carnage. Though the film is always predictable in its irony (especially the hardly-surprising ending) it never ceases to carry a wallop and Tanovic's blunt, angry agenda has a powerful directness that comes as a result of a persevering personal vision.

","""No Man's Land"" appears to be a microcosm of the 1992-1995 Balkan conflict. There are many interesting, subtle hints at this--Cera lying on top of the live mine for instance seems to represent the Yugoslavia as it was after the fall of Communism, a bomb that will go off at the slightest disturbance.<br/><br/>
There's a prevailing trueness to the whole film. Ciki (the Bosnian Croat) and Nino (the Bosnian Serb) don't become best buds. There's no attempt to erase centuries of animosity between two cultures in one day. They do lower their guard enough to find the solution that gets both out alive (both have their opportunities to kill each other, but do not). This is another part of the microcosm the film represents. No one expects the Croats, Muslims, and Serbs to all get along instantly--they just want the killing to stop. Each man blames the other for 'starting the war.' The Muslim and Croat majority voted independence for Bosnia, leading most Bosnian Serbs, wishing to remain united with Serbia as Yugoslavia, to rebel against the new government. Each man believes he has a legitimate claim against the other.<br/><br/>
The UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) soldiers represent, well, the U.N.  The events that unfold once the French and British UN troops get involved in the trench between Serb and Croat/Muslim lines demonstrate what happens when a third party gets involved in someone else's battle. We see the futility of a ""protective force"" trying to stay out of the conflict. ""There can be no neutrality in the face of murder,"" says the French UN captain, who can never properly define his role. <br/><br/>Maybe the best thing ""No Man's Land"" has to offer is the way it puts you right there in the middle of the conflict. You get a real sense of the sociological texture of that time and place, and how out of place the horror of war is among these seemingly civilized, modern people. You wonder if the same people living together in a different place wouldn't be fighting at all. You get a sense that all that stands in the way of peace is history-or the unwillingness to let go of it."

I have seen most of the films on this topic, with the important exception of ""Saverseni Krug"" (The Perfect Circle), and ""No-Man's Land"" is, in my opinion, by far the most accurate depiction of the important elements of that conflict.<br/><br/>There have been thousands of movies about war and, in that narrow context, ""No-Man's Land"" is certainly not unique or particularly brilliant. However, the wars in the Balkans are themselves unique in that they are the first of what I call the ""Managed Mini-Wars,"" overseen by the civilized world in an attempt to keep things from getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Where ""No-Man's Land"" really excels is in the picture it gives us of modern ""Peacekeeping.""  More than any picture on this subject, it gives us an accurate and disturbing view of this noble concept, warts and all.<br/><br/>In this low budget microcosm of the Balkan conflict we are exposed to all the central issues of the larger phenomenon.  We are treated to ethnic hatred and human camaraderie; well-intended altruism and naked hypocrisy; the vigorous ""search for the truth"" and casual indifference when it is found.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who is even vaguely interested in ""what's really going on over there.""  It will certainly not answer all your questions, but it may help you understand why the situation is so difficult to fathom."

","Went to see a preview of this war movie, and it was very well done, and goes to prove that although people cannot get along, there is no benefit to war. This is a touching story of the struggle between two Yugoslavian factions, and how no one wins.  If you can take another war movie this should be added to your list."
"bsinc","7","0","2","12 February 2002"," A good movie, but nothing special
","Everybody has been praising this movie since it came out, but I find it to be rather mediocre. Nothing new (maybe the fact that the war was going on in , nothing breathtaking (except maybe for the ending when the Bosnian soldier is left to die). A movie made to please the audience, especially foreign, which in some cases don't quite know the whole truth. If you want a real portrait of atmosphere and life during the war go rent a movie called Rane. Now that's a shocker."

","The struggle in the former Yugoslavia in 1993 never looked clearer or more devastating than in this little morality play of a movie called `No Man's Land.' Serbs and Croats find themselves caught in a dilemma-a soldier lies on a bouncing bomb; when he moves, it will explode. In comes the UN to attempt to rescue everyone, spouting inanities about the peace process when peace is an absurdity put in relief by the current puzzle.<br/><br/>
The press is mercilessly savaged for being as self-serving as the warring factions. When the reporter asks, while the camera whirs away, how one of the 3 soldiers in the booby-trapped trench feels, he gives her a raised digit.  It's a mild rebuke considering she just exclaimed about the absurdity of war.<br/><br/>Cinematography and set design are subdued. For a film, it is surprisingly stagy, yet that effect heightens the real war of ideas like who started it all and who cares about just one man. The doomed soldier holds a family photo unaware that to do so in the movies is to invite danger. It's funny and harrowing at the same time. <br/><br/>`No Man's Land' is closer to `Three Kings' than it is to `Waiting for Godot' because its humor is purposely gallows-like and less existential. Yet when the camera pulls away at the end, you can be sure you have just watched the best film of the absurd for the 21st century.  `Behind Enemy Lines' or even `M*A*S*H pale next to this Cannes winner for best screenplay."
"crypticcrytic","Null","0","1","25 January 2002"," A Just War?
","War is absurd in this gripping film that can amuse, sadden and horrify anyone with an ounce of humanity. You might say that you have to be there to really appreciate the irony. I say I'm happy I'm not! <br/><br/>The tension is enormous as both sides try to negotiate escape. Intervention by the UN peacekeepers is as senseless as a US congressman on an Enron investigation hearing. <br/><br/>The humanity of both men is just below the surface preventing their ethnic animosity from taking its course.  Any loud, jarring noise threatens survival leaving the audience wondering if there is a solution to this conflict. Or is it more humane to let the two sides settle it in a fair fight.<br/><br/>Do you walk away with the feeling that this is  'a just war'? No - it's just a war. And war is hell.<br/><br/>See this one for yourself and email me."

","With just a few characters and very few moments of shooting or battle, No Man's Land depicts the human toll caused by war.  It's not just lives that are lost, but truly our humanity.  The struggle is represented by two soldiers trapped between lines desperate to return to their respective sides.  At times they are civil to one another, but the history of conflict continues to get between them.  Governmental and bureaucratic forces work only to further dehumanize the individuals, even when operating with good intentions.  The main theme would have to be the need for the individual to do the right thing, and it's final shot is an inspired and haunting image. Of the films I've seen lately, this is by far one of the best."
"Chap1","8","0","1","16 August 2001"," Best Screenplay Winner at Cannes?
","This is a story that begs to be told--a good representation of what has been a mysterious war halfway around the world--in Yugoslavia.  It is an immensely interesting film, dominated by the relationship between the Serb and Bosnian, and even more, their two sides.  The workings of the UN peacekeepers were also well-represented and very interesting.<br/><br/>The problem I had with the film, ironically, was with the script, which won Best Screenplay at Cannes.  The byplay between the Serb and Croat was great, and the portrayal of the several different nationalities of the UN (of which English is the only common language) is well represented.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film does dwell into cliches when introducing the media--the dialogue on the news reports is stale and uninvolving, I heard the same words in Three Kings.  Of course, one is limited when portraying live news reports, but there is always an opportunity to make it fresh--unfortunately, the screenwriter chose not to do that here.<br/><br/>But all in all, a pretty good film."
