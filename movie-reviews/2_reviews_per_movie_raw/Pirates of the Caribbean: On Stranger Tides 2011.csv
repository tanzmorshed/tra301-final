"dlrpsteve","5","155","197","19 May 2011"," Captain Jack showed flashes of brilliance but everyone else failed
","The Bad<br/><br/>I'm sure my surroundings had a lot to do with my enjoyment of the film, or lack thereof, but even without that it wasn't up to the high standard that I regard the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films. The plot was flaky and apart from Jack, the characters weren't that great.<br/><br/>After seeing Ian McShane in Deadwood I was convinced he'd make a fantastic Blackbeard, but I think his Lovejoy character was more evil than he was in On Stranger Tides. At the height of his devilishness (is that even a word?) he triggered his ship's flamethrower to kill a mutineer and gave us doubts over his true feelings to a daughter he'd only just found out about. He wasn't a patch on the Barbosa/Davey Jones/Lord Beckett trifecta of evil from the first three films. As someone once said, Luke Skywalker was only as good as Darth Vader was evil.<br/><br/>Speaking of the daughter, Penelope Cruz as Angelica was a character I felt very apathetic towards. The whole raison d'etre of her quest to find the Fountain of Youth was because it had been foretold that a one legged man would kill her father and she wanted to save him so she could have that father she never heard. I'm sorry but pass me the bucket - that sentimental dross deserves to be on Jeremy Kyle (Oprah Winfrey for anyone reading from the US) not as the main plot for the latest of one of the biggest film franchises of all time.<br/><br/>The dilemma at the end of the film sees both Blackbeard and Angelica about to die and only one can be saved by the Fountain of Youth. At that point I didn't care if either died and why should I? Blackbeard is an evil man, or so they tell us, and Angelica has used Jack to get to the Fountain of Youth. If I were Jack I'd have left them both to die and the film would have been better off if he had. At least then we'd have some of the darker side of Jack which never showed appeared in this film. Instead our scoundrel played a goody two shoes who seemed to be motivated by his concern for Angelica's safety. Please, this is Jack Sparrow we are talking about, like he really gives a damn about anyone apart from himself, a characteristic which made him so appealing in the previous films. Yes, he does have a softer side that we've seen before, but to not this whipped extent.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the Mermaids. They were great to start with, but as soon as it was just Syrena and her boring relationship with Philip the clergyman, all was lost as they gave us the dullest moments in Pirates of the Caribbean history, to date.<br/><br/>My last major moan is about the part where Jack left Angelica on the island. Remember, Angelica's whole motivation was to save her father, and Jack had just condemned him to death. So why in God's name, when his back was turned, did she try to attack him with a piece of wood and not shoot him in the back with the pistol he had just given her? Yes she had some feelings for Jack, but surely not enough for her to get over the fact that Jack had basically just killed her father and destroyed what she had spent the whole film trying to achieve? Don't give me the old 'he saved her life' spiel – Jack let Blackbeard , her father, die - end of story.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>Whilst nowhere near as funny as in the previous films Jack was still a great character, in spite of his wimpy attitude change. The scenes where he escaped from the King and the clutches of the Spanish were a reminder of how great Pirates of the Caribbean can be at its best. It was great to see Gibbs back alongside Jack as their chemistry is great and a nice link back my beloved first three films.<br/><br/>As always, the film looked and sounded great, though the 3D wasn't essential and I found myself taking the glasses off from time to time and it made little difference. In fact I'd go as far as to say that while you lose depth in 2D, you gain richness in colour.<br/><br/>I'm struggling to think of much else to compliment the film for and at the moment I'm stuck in my post viewing disappointment funk. I really need to watch it again but after my horrific cinema experience I'll wait until it comes out on Blu-ray."
"diac228","7","205","277","20 May 2011"," Frustratingly Entertaining
","Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don't spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>That being said, its still quite entertaining. On Stranger Tides follows a variety of people searching for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Unfortunately for us, its not just Jack Sparrow. We have Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British (led by Barbossa), Angelica, and more doing the same thing. Subplots pertaining to this quest include Jack's past with Angelica, Barbossa's questionable change in character, some random guy falling for some random girl (I am serious, this part was totally pointless), and the pointless Spanish people that flock in and out of the movie.<br/><br/>This is by far the weakest part of the movie, the script. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best---which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. It was the easiest to follow, and On Stranger Tides didn't learn from the previous two installments. To add to that, the script utterly separated everyone, even those with the best on-screen chemistry. Barbossa was barely with Jack Sparrow, Sparrow was rarely with his ex-lover, and worst of all reliable Gibbs spent minimal time with Sparrow. When they are together, the humor, the banter, tension, and the charm works well. When they aren't, well, the movie drags a bit.<br/><br/>Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.<br/><br/>Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low-lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two."
"Misagh","9","582","871","9 May 2011"," Our favorite pirate is back!
","Firstly, this review does not contain any spoilers whatsoever so read on. I had the privilege to watch this in the El Capitan theater advanced screening. Johnny Depp, the goofy pirate that we have grown to love, returns to his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow in an action-packed tale of truth, betrayal, youth and demise.<br/><br/>The plot is when Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love—or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.<br/><br/>By being a fan this franchise, I can happily confirm that YES, it is as good as the first one! Be ready for an adventure and half! Brings everything from the classic bizarre comedy to the nail biting action scenes.<br/><br/>The marketing for the movie have been intelligently subliminal like some other great film releases, like Avatar, or Blair Witch (the real vs fake) and the recent awesome film production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) and so on.<br/><br/>This is not a film to miss, does not matter if you are a die hard fan of Pirates, or new to the series! I might be in trouble for writing a review of the movie this early, so please click Yes on the ""is this review useful"" as a thank you ;)"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","151","237","18 May 2011"," Imperfect but worthy instalment
","As far as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies go, On Stranger Tides may be lacking in the rollicking fun of Curse of the Black Pearl, which I absolutely loved, though it's closer in spirit to it than those of the two movies before, but I think it is better than Dead Man's Chest, which had great effects and a brilliant Bill Nighy but felt overlong and ferentic sometimes, and At World's End, which had the cast giving their all, great visuals, score and final battle but rather convoluted and bloated on the whole.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides isn't perfect. I did feel it did have perhaps have too many moments of exposition and clichés, though the story if slightly rickety in places here is less bloated noticeably and better paced than the film released before it which is a good thing. I also felt the romantic subplot(s) felt underdeveloped and forced, and while there are some droll, bizarre and witty quips particularly with Depp, Rush and Cruz there is a bit of filler that could have been excised.<br/><br/>However, despite these complaints, On Stranger Tides is a worthy instalment. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and the effects are superb. The opening twenty minutes is an example of the writing being at its funniest and wittiest, and the scenes with the mermaids are beautifully shot and intriguing.<br/><br/>While not perhaps original, and not among his best, I did very much like Hans Zimmer's score, which was rousing and brought some much-needed energy. The characters are not the best developed, but they are fun and there aren't too many of them to interrupt the flow of the story, a big problem I found with At World's End, while the action sequences are both exciting and nail-biting on the whole.<br/><br/>I wasn't so sure about Rob Marshall as director, but he does a far better job than expected, and the film is livelier in pace than Dead Man's Chest and At World's End. The acting is good enough for what it was. Johnny Depp plays lovable rogue Jack Sparrow with a voluptuous swagger and sly humour and nails it again, while the idea to omit Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom here proved a good one, without them for my money the whole adventure carried less of a dead weight.<br/><br/>Instead we have Penelope Cruz, who proves a perfect match for Depp. She is feisty, beautiful, foxy and sexy, and also likable and fun. I was wondering what they would do for villains without Bill Nighy, but I needn't have worried. Ian McShane is a worthy addition as Blackbeard, who is charming in a grizzly way while committing acts of great evil. Geoffrey Rush is underused in a way, but he does have some great lines and a fun presence so he isn't a complete waste.<br/><br/>In conclusion, On Stranger Tides is not a perfect film, but as an instalment to a decent enough franchise it is a more than worthy one. And you know, what I've said about this movie was not something I thought I would be saying, because judging by what I'd seen of the advertising/trailers, it looked as though it was going be the worst of the series, but actually for me it wasn't. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Fairyangel24","7","197","317","6 May 2011"," Captain Jack is back...
","I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is that it was pretty darn good. By not having Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in it, the film didn't feel like just a rehash of all the other PotC films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane really added a lot to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. All in all, this has everything you'd expect from PotC: swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy; but the new cast members keep it feeling fresh."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","39","56","22 May 2011"," Same old ""Pirates"" with a new simpler focus and more Capt. Jack
","After a four-year hiatus to regroup and determine the future of the franchise, Disney and what was once its surprise mega-hit ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series have returned in ""On Stranger Tides."" Hard to believe that this franchise evolved from the once-lambasted concept of a theme park ride being turned into a successful motion-picture blockbuster. After exhausting the ""Pirates"" world with two back-to-back sequels of titanic and rather disappointing proportion in 2006 and 2007, a break in the action to recalibrate Captain Jack Sparrow's compass was much-needed. The ""new"" course set by ""On Stranger Tides"" uses worn sails, but with a fresh wind of characters and more importantly, a more direct purpose.<br/><br/>As promised in the end of ""At World's End,"" Jack's looking for the Fountain of Youth if for nothing more than ships and giggles. First, however, he must take a side trip to London to rescue his old pal Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and subsequently the palace of King George (Richard Griffiths in a lovely cameo). There, he learns that his old pal Barbossa (Rush) has lost The Black Pearl as well as his leg and sold out to His Majesty's Royal Navy. He is to help the English find the Fountain before the Spaniards do. Jack, of course, knows the way there, thus continuing his ongoing role as an indispensable pestilence.<br/><br/>After a familiar improvised escape, he crosses paths with an old lover, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who he once deflowered before she was to take her vows at a convent. She mentions she has a ship he can borrow, only it turns out that it's her father's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by none other than Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane), a feared and soulless scourge with a minor in black magic. So much for smooth sailing.<br/><br/>As overdone and cliché as the Fountain of Youth may be, it's perfect for the ""Pirates"" franchise and helps keep things very simple, something the last installment had more than a fair deal of trouble with. Only a few character subplots threaten to convolute the story, but all motivations lead to the Fountain regardless the reason. In fact, ""On Stranger Tides"" marks the first film to truly focus on Captain Jack. With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters out of the way, the franchise can keep the spotlight on the reason it's gotten four films deep. Depp has nothing new in store for us as the true center of attention, but by continuing to underplay the trademark quirks and mannerisms, he continues to prolong the deterioration of the Capt. Jack act. Some might disagree, but it depends how much you liked him the first place.<br/><br/>In terms of new faces, Ian McShane is impeccable as Blackbeard. Rush gave a wonderfully theatrical performance as the main villain in the first film, but McShane introduces the first true quantifiable force of evil the franchise has seen. Although his voodoo abilities and reputation for killing his men and bringing them back from the dead to serve as his zombie slaves are never entirely realized, he's the merciless villain this film needed. He never fully crosses into scare-your-children evil, but he could've at any instant and that feeling radiates from his performance. In general, this film aligns itself more with fantasy and traditional folklore than the supernatural like the previous film.<br/><br/>Among other new faces, Rob Marshall as the franchise's new director does serviceable work. The ""Chicago"" filmmaker chews the scenery well and creates effective moods and tones, but the action could have been a bit more inspired, especially considering the series' reputation for sword-fighting ingenuity.<br/><br/>Marshall's best work and the film's best sequence deals with mermaids, not the singing and seashell bra type, but seduce you with their looks and then try and devour you with fangs type. Quiet, suspenseful and culminating in a full-on action sequence, the mermaids constitute the one completely fresh element of the film. Their cove is the lone stop on the journey as well, so it's the only aspect of the plot that creates that classic seafaring adventure feeling akin to Homer's ""The Odyssey.""<br/><br/>Not much else deviates from the formula, so those hoping for a resurgence in the series or something as good as the first film, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" will remain wishful thinkers once again. It's hard to imagine where the series could go next without retreading over old ground or just introducing new characters for the sake of it, but Captain Jack Sparrow remains one of the few reliable comforts of blockbuster cinema, and any adventure with him at the wheel will struggle to be a total waste of time. ""On Stranger Tides"" makes just enough adjustments to the series to make for a successful installment.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","31","45","27 May 2011"," Swashbuckling fun! This Pirates made up for the last 2 sequels!
","Boy, the way some people are acting on the web, you would think that Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was the devil. I saw this movie opening day with pretty good expectations, because I love the Pirate movies, even if the third one is too complicated at times, I really enjoy these movies. Let's face it, we wouldn't have been brought back to the pirate genre if it wasn't for these movies. I agree that the plots should be more simple, but I don't mind a movie that challenges you along. I actually did love On Stranger Tides, even though it's not as good as the first one, I give much kudos for giving us something very fresh. Not to mention that it's shorter so I would think that more people would be pleased with that. But I think the cast still has it, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is always such a pleasure to watch on screen. He and Penelope Cruz really lit up the screen and brought life into the series. This is a fun summer blockbuster with scary moments, funny characters and a swash buckling good time.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow travels to London to locate a person who has been impersonating him. The imposter has been recruiting a crew to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. Jack is brought before King George, who wants him to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish find it. Heading the expedition is Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after having lost Jack's ship, the Black Pearl, as well as his leg. Jack escapes, and is found by his father, who warns Jack about the Fountain's tests. Jack's imposter is Angelica, his former lover and daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard , who possesses supernatural powers and practices voodoo magic. Jack is forced to join Blackbeard's crew and to lead them to the Fountain.<br/><br/>When I was a kid I absolutely adored the old movies, especially pirate movies like Captain Blood or Jason and the Argonauts. So these movies bring back the good ol' days and the magic of seeing these effects back on the big screen. While I do think that they are a little much for some children, I think any adult could get into these movies. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush have great chemistry and bring the pirates to life, I could only imagine the type of fun they have during these films.<br/><br/>I know that not everyone is a fan of pirates, I don't know if maybe it's due to the fact that the films were released so closely together that people got sick of it, I'm not sure. But I think if given the fair chance, you'll really enjoy this movie. This one has mermaids in it and the actual way that the myth is told, Disney had softened it up with The Little Mermaid and now brought it back to the truth. A warning in advance, that is a very scary scene I'm pretty sure most kids wouldn't be able to handle. But I thought it was extremely cool and very well done with the special effects. I'm also glad that they didn't go the safe route with the love story between Johnny and Penelope. However I really got bored easily with the Christian missionary and his love story with the mermaid was predictable and I think was their way of trying to replace Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. But I had a good time watching this movie and I'm pretty sure if you're looking for a good time going into it, you will have fun. I'm honestly looking forward to the next pirates movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Neil-King1125","5","129","214","20 May 2011"," A boring lackluster installment to a series that fell off the world's end.
","So after a 4 year hiatus Disney decides to bring back Captain Jack Sparrow. A huge fan of the first one and moderately enjoyed the second one and confused by the third one I was ready to see a fresh crew for the this new installment. <br/><br/>The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films. <br/><br/>The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film. <br/><br/>Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes. <br/><br/>The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.<br/><br/>Marshall did a mediocre job directing. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting. <br/><br/>Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.<br/><br/>On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10. <br/><br/>If they continue the series, which I am sure they will seeing as how this film will make bank over the weekend, they need to trim out the unnecessary sub plots that do nothing for the story except let it drag on and if anything bring back the gorgeous and creepy mermaids. Also have a little faith in the audience, you can make the plot a little bit more thought provoking instead of laying all the pieces in front of us and then watching you put them together after we already know how to do the puzzle in our head. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides 5/10 via The Reel King<br/><br/>Follow The Reel King on Tumblr for more reviews"

","Jack Sparrow, Barbossa and Mr. Gibbs are by far, the best combinations, they are the real comedians of this movie.

"josh-carrigan","7","59","98","25 May 2011"," Better than the third
","POTC-OST is not the best of the series, but it is a step in the right direction. If you, like me, were very disappointed with the third Pirates movie then I do not blame you for wanting to skip out on this one. In fact I was considering not seeing this one myself, especially when the critics reviews came out. I decided to give it a chance, primarily because I had seen the other ones. I was pleasantly surprised and ending up liking the movie. One of the major differences between this and the other Pirates movies (and it is one everyone is going to notice right off the bat) is that Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightely are not in this movie. I am not too disappointed, there story overtook the third Pirates movie, which is part of the reason I did not like it. I was also sick of Knightely terrible speech scenes (if you saw the third you know exactly what I mean). Furthermore a few other pirates who were franchise regulars were missing in this one. What is left from the original three is Jack, Barbosa, Gibbs and the monkey makes two brief cameo appearances.<br/><br/>There was a number of things wrong with the third Pirates movie, among them was the fact that it was long, or it felt long at least. This movie is the shortest of the Pirates films and it moves at a brisk pace. The third Pirates slowed down considerably in the middle, to the point it was almost unbearable to watch. This movie does not make that mistake. This movie is almost all action and because of this it did not feel long, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>As usual the effects were great. The action is almost nonstop and when there is no action there is enough going on to keep the audience interested. There is also plenty of signature Jack Sparrow humor. Since the previous two (especially the third) were focused almost entirely on the story of Will and Elizabeth Jack was almost forgotten. Another reason the third suffered. It was great to have that story out of the way, because this movie is focused on Jack and that is a strength.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it improved on a number of the things that made the third bad, this one still is not up to par with the original. It is a good movie all around. It is refreshing and reminds us why we liked these movies in the first place. I recommend giving it a shot, don't expect anything great, just know that this movie is superior in every way to the third."
"sayakboral-1","1","83","144","20 May 2011"," This is NOT DONE - I want my money and time back
","Jack Sparrow...I mean Captain Jack Sparrow, it's probably time to hang your boots and bury your sinking pirate career before dirt-storm wrecks whatever remains of my sweet memories of the original Jack Sparrow legend, the Curse of the Black Pearl. Although, I wasn't half as impressed with its sequels, somehow even in those movies the Pirate magic weaved its way into the hearts of loyal fans, many of whom I'm sure are as aggrieved and disappointed as I am, just choosing to remain silent out of respect and love for the Jack Sparrow we all knew and cared about. However it needs to be said, the current version achieves nothing apart from making you scratch your head in frustration. <br/><br/>Someone here commented this was supposed to be better than at least its last two predecessors -bollocks. After all, who can forget the inspiring ""Hoist the Colours"" speech by Elizabeth in ""At World's End"", and that opening execution scene did it not send shivers down your spine? About this version, I don't recollect ONE memorable scene worth talking about. There's nothing, absolutely nothing inspirational or redeemable. <br/><br/>Before watching this monstrous travesty of a pirate story, I read each and every review on IMDb and was confused whether or not to spend a lot of money on it. Finally I listened to my heart who cares about critics, being a loyal Pirate fan I knew at least Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush wouldn't disappoint. My, couldn't have been any wronger. In fact, I never felt so disappointed listening to my heart. With a straight face, I managed to sit through the entire screening, taking a while to realise how casually the sublime Pirate magic was fading away into an appalling doom of mediocrity, clichés and earthy innuendoes. <br/><br/>Plot aside, everything about the movie was repetitive and easily predictive, ""now comes the swordfight"", ""now comes the menacing Blackbeard"", ""the mermaid's about to bite"". If they paid me a dollar for each correct guess, I'm sure I would have been rich by now. Even the soundtrack failed to strike a chord. About Jack Sparrow and Barbossa, I could notice a deep sense of fatigue in dialogue delivery with such fine actors despite the fact no one else can take their roles. Was it like let's just take our money and get over with this nonsense. About Blackbeard, impressive introduction but for the remaining film, I don't think that character could have scared a two year old in a dark room. Angelica, that Latina lover of Jack Sparrow, well she could have been a breath of fresh air but the character lacked depth and dimensions. Speaking of Latins, why did they make the Spaniard Kings and soldiers speak English? I've read a lot of history about Spain's naval prowess in the olden days, for greater authenticity couldn't they have made them speak Castilian Spanish with sub- titles in English. It's tiny details like these which make you angry about the lack of research in putting together such a fabled story. The ""Fountain of Youth"", again a great plot element but I wanted a genuine SENSE OF HISTORY with that like its legendary connections with Ancient Greeks and the lost kingdom of Atlantis. Again, deja vu remember how Barbossa made an introduction of those Gold nuggets in Curse of the Black Pearl, connecting them with Aztec civilisation and the Conquistadores led by Hernan Cortes. Now, that's called RESEARCH. <br/><br/>The mermaids were neither beautiful nor significant enough. I think they should have casted blonde Russian chicks straight from Moscow and St.Petersburg for that look of vulnerability. The priest who fell in love with the mermaid was neither convincing in his religious fervour nor his romantic passion for the woman. <br/><br/>VERDICT: Let this Pirate of the Caribbean storyline end now already, and not be resurrected until another 50-100 years!<br/><br/>P.S.: In all fairness, I've seen far worse movies than POTC- On Stranger Tides. If it were simply another movie, I would have rated it a Three Point Five. But, since you have the legendary POTC appeal to bank upon, expectations will always be much higher, so you just can't afford to disappoint. Thus, there you are - One Star."

","Oh, Dear, I love Johnny Depp and the PotC movie experience, but this one is best left out... So sorry I bothered... The characters were so lackluster, I did not care about any of them... But the script was so poor, how can you expect the actors to salvage it??? Ian McShane: wasted, Penelope Cruz: looked as if she was struggling with pregnancy discomfort, Mermaids and the religious man: put me to sleep and pure filler... Filmed way too dark which made it difficult to see my several glances at my watch to see when I could leave... Tedious in all the darkness... Depp is reported to have earned $55,000,000 with this and actually had script input.... Get new writers! I wanted so bad to see a good PotC movie after the last (Land's End) rubbish, but I was disappointed once again... Depp and Cruz had zero chemistry between them... It was not a 'love interest'.... They appeared to barely know each other... At least O Bloom and K Knightly looked like they had feelings for each other... I don't think Capt Jack even needs a 'love interest', he's a rogue out for adventure and pirate booty (Ok, that does not mean 'women'!). Cruz did nothing for me and could have been left out entirely....<br/><br/>Where were the 'fun' characters that enhance the story? No laughs or even thrills... An incredible bore from start to finish.... I really, really wanted to like this movie, and I am easy to please, but I would have rather bought Lottery tickets for my money....<br/><br/>I did not view it in 3D because I did not see how it would add anything.... The production costs were scaled back, but 3D adds a reported $30,000,000 to filming, so it was wasted money... Get a good script via a good story! The 3rd PotC movie was written virtually on the beach as it was being filmed, and it showed.... This version suffered from a bad storyline and no plot.... I'm afraid the best is now behind us, and the 'make it fast, bring in the money' attitude has taken over....<br/><br/>I want another hilarious and unforgettable scene like the time Capt Jack appears walking onto the wharf as the boat he's on sinks into the depths...

"ferguson-6","8","6","7","21 May 2011"," A Pirate's Life for Me
","Greetings again from the darkness. I will make no apology for being a fan of the ""Pirates"" series. This is the fourth film and the best since the first. Though I liked them enough, I felt the second and third depended too much on special effects and the need to overwhelm, whereas this one concentrates more on the colorful characters. This latest entry is also directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") rather than Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three.<br/><br/>Of course, what really matters is that Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow. And in fine form, I might add. He comes across more clever, witty and less buffoonish than in the previous two. His character is much better as a worthy adversary than a clown prince. In this one, he alternates between matching wits and swords with no less than three characters. First, Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa. Only this time, he seems to have gone legit with the King's navy. Next we have Sparrow's long-lost love from Seville played by Penelope Cruz. They also match wits and swords (and facial hair). Lastly, we have the legendary pirate Blackbeard, played with full force by Ian McShane. Were it not a Disney movie, McShane could have made his Blackbeard one of the most frightening characters ever seen on screen. Even with the limitations, he performs exceedingly well.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" of the film involves the search for Ponce de Leon's ship and the much desired Fountain of Youth. The race is on between Sparrow, Blackbeard, the Spainiards and Barbossa who is acting on behalf of King George (a wonderful Richard Griffiths). As always, it's not always easy to tell which characters are partners and which are adversaries. That's half the fun! An interesting twist is that in order to have the desired results from the infamous fountain, one must drink from a specific chalice and include a single mermaid tear. Of course, everlasting youth shouldn't be too easy to achieve. The mermaid sequences are fascinating, though we really only get to know one of them - Syrena played with soulful eyes by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.<br/><br/>Thankfully, two long time characters are absent from this film - Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Both were dead-weight that caused major drag in the two most recent Pirates films. Cruz and McShane are infinitely more interesting and entertaining and play off of Captain Jack much better.<br/><br/>Speaking of Depp's Jack Sparrow, I would make the argument that this character has entered the rarefied air of film comedy icon. I would put him at or near the level of the all-time best recurring comic characters: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers, NOT Steve Martin), Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and the Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Of course, there are loads of others that have made a name for themselves but are a step below: Ernest (Jim Varney), Fletch (Chevy Chase), Wayne and Garth (Wayne's World), Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon), etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>As I have stated many times, comedy is such a personal choice that it's always difficult to review. What sets the Pirate's films apart (especially one and four) are the characters combined with action and witty banter. No, it's not for everyone, but if you like this style, it's difficult to beat."

","Just be entertaining. But, you couldn't even do that could you Pirates4. Oh well, you'll be too busy counting your money to care anyway, wont you. Nice job marketing department. <br/><br/>I went into this with the idea that they were going to strip it down a bit, compared to the last two, and maybe reel in the silliness a bit. It looked like they did try to do that, but they forgot to insert anything to take the silliness's place. <br/><br/>The acting, except for Stephen Graham (he was good so his role functioned well), was RIDICULOUSLY bad. Johnny Depp was as idiotic, if not more, in his attempt to portray a character than ever. And his character was as inconsistent throughout the movie as ever. There is no definition of character in Jack Sparrow. It's just a matter of catering to the audience scene by scene. Jack Sparrow isn't a multifaceted man (manly, funny, romantic, etc.) he is just a plot device used by over-payed scared writers to illicit whatever response from the audience that their research has proved will entire people to continue paying for this product. <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz's character, was never anything more than just Penelope Cruz reading cue cards looking hot trying to exude sex appeal to entire male viewers. Neither she nor Depp ever looked like they felt what they were saying or ever actually became their character. <br/><br/>Ian McShane was also just going through motions. <br/><br/>Stephen Graham though somehow managed to understand his character and he disappeared into it, adding something to it. Kudos to him. He must have ignored the director and just went on instinct. <br/><br/>I liked Thor a lot because it entertained me. Pirates4 didn't. It was predictable and not funny. Instead of being a convincing charade it was a transparent one. <br/><br/>The audience I was with wasn't laughing much either. This movie is a waste of time and I'm betting the great reviews it's gotten on IMDb are paid for written by plants. <br/><br/>Hopefully it's another 2 years at least before the Pirates of the Caribbean machine begins casting it's misleading spell over the world with it's slick, sophisticated, tricky, deceptive advertising methods that lead people to believe the product is more than it is. The marketing for THIS piece of junk was great at concealing just how empty and pointless this film is. <br/><br/>Every aspect of this movie, every scene of it is designed only to cater to the audience. No vision other than cashing in."

There is LITERALLY no story, so it is hard to comment about it, but it is Hollywood in a very bad state when crap like this gets churned out as an excuse for entertainment.<br/><br/>Special effects and 3D does not excuse having no character development/theme/intrigue etc... there just was nothing there other than 3D and FX trying to puff itself up into a worthwhile entity.

","The movie was fun and Captain Jack Sparrow was at his best. But even though I enjoyed the movie overall because of Captain Jack Sparrow and the fun adventure, I do see what people mean by it feels empty. There are times when it just carries on with no sense of adventure in it. The second one was too long the third too many sub plots with a a messy script and too long, but they both had a sense of fun and adventure with memorable parts in Dead Man's Chest with the Wheel fight on the island, Jack and the crew escaping the cannibals was a fun action scene, Davy Jones and the Kraken scenes and with At Worlds End the fight scene in Singapore, the adventure to Davy Jones locker with the ship going through a ice cave, flipping the ship upside down, scenes with Davy Jones, and the epic last battle with the Pearl and Flying Dutchman fighting around a maelstrom. Gore handled the action scenes perfectly but the fault in them was that if they trimmed parts out and worked harder if could have been a much better film, but as were, still good adventures with a sense of fun. The beginning action scene in On Stranger Tides, I thought was fun as when they where trying to mutiny Blackbeard, but I thought the action scenes with Gore were funner and more arousing, not that on stranger tides were embarrassingly bad but not as edge of my seat fun action scenes as with the first three. This movie also provided memorable scenes, when we first meet the mermaids is going to be one of the most memorable scenes of the series, and the jungle scenes and fountain of youth and Jack escaping in London scenes look very good and cool. And like I said earlier Captain Jack is funny and having a blast in this. Going back to On Stranger Tides not having as many memorable set pieces, it does fix in having a shorter less all over the place feel. Captain Jack and Barbossa when together were great. I was little upset and felt I was going to be disappointed because of the reviews, so this movie had to prove me wrong and make me like it and it did, cause Captain Jack was silly/ witty and having fun and so was I. Did some parts feel like they weren't leading to places, yes and I would hire new writers because besides the first one there were faults with the script, its like if thats the ideas in the movie you want, build around that and make a better, sharper script. It might have faults like in the script and writing like the other two sequels but like those two it still has a sense of fun, this one being with Captain Jack at his best."

","These Pirates films are all about entertainment and thankfully this latest adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow at the helm is back to basics, reminding me of the formula that made the very first one, Curse of the Black pearl so great. Don't worry I won't give anything away here but be aware that the opening 20 minutes is one funny sequence and quirky one liner after another. There is also a couple of hilarious cameos, one may be familiar but the other was a right royal shock. Depp walks through his lethargic swaying pirate character with ultimate ease, while new high seas bad boy Blackbeard is exceptional, but not as cool as Sparrows former flame played by Cruz. She is foxy, feisty and funny. The action is elevated by some wonderful 3D effects but I am sure the film would be just as rocking without it. Finally, the highlight is the Mermaid scenes. As dark as they are, they take the viewer into their web of intrigue. Australian Gemma Ward even sings during an evocative moment. Remember to stay on after the credits for an EXTRA scene. After the last two installments left me crying with disappointment, I Loved it."

","Here's a franchise that definitely needs to be put to bed and fast. Directed by Rob Marshall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides"" is mostly a bore and more rehash and retread than anything else. Depp and Rush are back at it as their characters, but the characters themselves have completely worn out their welcome. The story is over-long, and has a couple of fairly interesting sequences - one being Depp's initial escape from the King of England, and two a Mermaid ""battle"", but these last only a scant 20 min of the bloated 130 min runtime. I fast-forwarded through a good chunk of this movie. You'd think they'd figure it out that a movie needs a lot more than a new character and quest for it to be worth your viewing time.

","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) travels to London to locate a person who has been impersonating him. The imposter has been recruiting a crew to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. First Sparrow rescues his former first mate, Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), who is about to be hanged, though the two are captured. Jack is brought before King George II (Richard Griffiths), who wants him to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish find it. Heading the expedition is Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now a privateer in service to the British Navy after having lost Jack's ship, the Black Pearl, as well as his leg.<br/><br/>Jack escapes, and is found by his father, Captain Teague (Keith Richards), who warns Jack about the Fountain's tests. Jack then discovers that the imposter is Angelica (Penélope Cruz), his former lover and daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who possesses several magical powers, including the ability to shrink other ships down to miniature size and contain them within bottles (the fate of the Black Pearl). Blackbeard is also a master of voodoo, and has rendered his most trusted lieutenants into completely loyal, seemingly invulnerable zombies, in addition to being able to create working voodoo dolls. Finally, Blackbeard possesses a magical cutlass that gives him total control over the rigging of any ship, allowing him to easily subdue a crew by tying them up with the ropes. Blackbeard forces Jack to join his crew and lead them to the Fountain to circumvent a prophecy that a one-legged man will soon kill Blackbeard. Meanwhile, Gibbs, who memorized, then destroyed Sparrow's map, joins Barbossa's crew in order to beat Blackbeard and the Spanish to the Fountain.<br/><br/>Aboard Blackbeard's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, Angelica reveals that the Fountain's water must be drunk from silver chalices once belonging to Juan Ponce de León, and that one chalice must contain a mermaid's tear. Whoever drinks from the chalice without the tear will die; while the person drinking from the chalice with the tear will have their life magically extended, by ""all the years the other person has lived, and all they might have lived"". Blackbeard intends to use this magic to circumvent his fated encounter with the one-legged man, and so the Queen Anne's Revenge heads to Whitecap Bay, where he traps a mermaid that a captive missionary, Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), later names Syrena (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey). Blackbeard then sends Sparrow to steal the chalices from de León's grounded ship. Sparrow arrives finding only Barbossa: the Spanish have already taken the chalices.<br/><br/>Barbossa admits he only wants to kill Blackbeard for capturing the Black Pearl, forcing Barbossa to amputate his own leg to escape in the process. He and Jack devise a plan to defeat Blackbeard; they then steal the chalices from the Spanish camp nearby. Meanwhile, Angelica tricks Syrena, who has fallen in love with Philip (who returns those feelings), into shedding a tear, which Blackbeard collects, then leaves her to die while forcing Philip to go with him. Sparrow returns with the chalices and Gibbs, who he had reunited with while helping Barbossa. Jack blackmails Blackbeard to get back his confiscated magical compass (which points in the direction of whatever the person holding it desires most) and to free Gibbs in exchange for giving him the chalices and leading them to the Fountain. Blackbeard accepts Jack's terms and Jack continues to lead them, while Gibbs, who is let go, departs with Jack's compass.<br/><br/>At the Fountain, Blackbeard and his crew are attacked by Barbossa and the Spanish, who have been sent by the king to destroy the Fountain, believing its ability to grant eternal life to be an abomination against God. After a lengthy fight, Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a sword laced with lethal venom from a poison dart frog, but Angelica is also wounded by it. Barbossa then steals Blackbeard's magical sword and escapes alongside Blackbeard's former crew. Philip, mortally wounded, escapes and returns to Syrena and frees her. After finding the chalices and giving them to Sparrow, Syrena returns and takes the dying Phillip underwater to heal him.<br/><br/>Angelica intends to sacrifice her life so that her father will live, but Sparrow tricks Blackbeard into drinking from the chalice without the tear while Angelica drinks from the other, killing Blackbeard and saving Angelica. However, suspecting she may try to avenge her father's death, Sparrow strands her on an island, intending for a passing ship to find her. After much bantering, they both declare their love for each other, but Jack still leaves her on the island knowing she is untrustworthy. Jack then meets up with Gibbs, who used Sparrow's compass to find the Revenge and has retrieved all the shrunken ships, including the Black Pearl, before Barbossa sets sail. The two head off, hoping to find a way to return the Pearl to its original size.<br/><br/>In a post-credits scene, Angelica, still on the island, finds Blackbeard's voodoo doll of Sparrow which has washed ashore."
"FairlyAnonymous","4","15","23","22 July 2011"," The worst pirates yet, and really isn't a good movie in any way
","The Pirates of the Caribbean is (was) a great series. The first movie was ingenious in the way it mixed humor with serious threats and interesting characters. The second movie was a lot more epic, had a giant kraken, more CGI, and really lived up to the first. The third movie dragged out way too long and had so much going on that it was hard to follow. Well the fourth is here and everyone is expecting something epic and... it fails.<br/><br/>From the moment I heard the director of Chicago was making this movie I cringed, because I had no idea how this movie would turn out. The first rule about comedies, or any movie with a humorous main character is that you need a straight man (meaning serious, this has nothing to do with sexuality) but since Will Turner is not in this movie it is just Jack... and Jack alone doesn't really work. Jack was always our favorite character, but without a serious character to carry the plot Jack just feels off. To compensate for the lack of a straight character, Jack has to play a straight man and the comedian... at the same time. Also, Jack Sparrow in this movie doesn't seem as witty or clever as in the other movies, and the villain in this movie was laughable.<br/><br/>Black Beard is the main antagonist in this movie, and he utterly fails as a villain compared to Barbossa, or to Davy Jones. Black Beard doesn't really seem all that threatening, all he has is a ship that he can control, and when he controls his ship with his sword it actually looks kind of stupid. One of the problems in this movie is that everyone's character is changed. Barbossa is now sort of a good guy which really doesn't make sense at all, and Jack Sparrow actually cringes when he sees people dying. There is one scene that seemed rather silly where black beard kills someone by using flamethrowers on his ship, and Jack Sparrow and everyone act like they have never seen someone die. In all of the other movies Jack Sparrow couldn't care less if he let people die, in the second movie he was willing to sell 100 souls to Davy Jones. Either way all of the characters seems off.<br/><br/>There is this stupid love plot between a missionary and a mermaid which had absolutely, I MEAN ABSOLUTELY, nothing to do with the plot. It was just there and it made no sense. The missionary and the mermaid seemed to be there just for the sake of adding romance, but there is already some of that between Jack and Black Beard's daughter.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie is that action. This movie cannot compare to any of the other movies, and what made the other movies enjoyable were its humorous and unique battles. This movie has none, and there is this whole mermaid battle thing which seemed pretty weird. One of the biggest issues I had is that mermaid sunk a ship. THEY SUNK A SHIP! And they sunk it not by firepower, but by sheer weight... does anybody see a problem with that? There are no witty fights in this movie which is what we have come to expect from a pirates movie. Blackbeard has some zombie henchmen which have nothing to do with the story. Blackbeard also can apparently store ships in a bottle, and he has the black pearl... this makes no sense at all also, and it just seemed like it was thrown in at the last second. Besides wasn't the black pearl taken by Davy Jones, even though Davy Jones is dead.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is only enjoyable for the sake of seeing a few of the pirates characters... actually that would be only three. Jack's dad, Jack, and Barbossa oh and Gibbs. Other than that you do no have the original cast. This movie was a waste of a good franchise, and hopefully no more pirates movies will be made unless they actually know what they are doing... oh yeah this movie was filmed in Hawaii and it is pretty obvious because the scenery looks so off. And a slight problem for some people is that this movie portrays real historical figures but fictionalizing them... that's not a big complaint but it is a little odd seeing as how Black Beard was a real person."

","Ahoy, and so here we are in 2011 with another Pirate's adventure on the horizon. An adventure that contains fresh humor, intrigue, mystery and visuals, yet reminds us what we love so much about the original.<br/><br/>Many critics complained that P2 and P3 were bogged down with sub plots, interweaving stories, and that it became to heavy for some to handle. Well, if thats how you felt, then you are going to love On Stranger Tides. It is a return to form in a sense, without feeling rehashed. Jack is forever brilliant as he goes on his search for the fountain of youth. However, Jack isn't alone. Penelope is brilliant as well, her charm and wit fit in perfectly to the Pirate's world. Less not forget the menacing foe, Blackbeard, who's retchidness is so vile that not once do you think to yourself ""oh thats just Ian McShane"".<br/><br/>The Pirates themselves aren't only thing propelling this franchise to the next level. The visuals themselves are absolutely stunning. The water shots are a site to behold and the jungle scenes are lush and vibrant. These guys did 3D right! So, if you're looking for an adventure thats fresh and doesn't carry any of the same complaints as the last two, while still seeming charmingly similar, this should be your pick this summer!!!!"
"sim_robrs","5","3","3","16 February 2020"," Boring, plotless flop
","The film needlessly abandons the loveable characters of it's predecessors, and replaces them with boring, forgettable and downright bad new ones.
Angelica is played well by Penelope Cruz, but is a poorly written character overall.
Blackbeard is nowhere near as interesting as Davy Jones and his inclusion creates the glaring plot hole of why wasn't he mentioned in At Worlds End?
The cleric and the mermaid perfectly personify what is wrong with this film. They are completely forgettable and even after watching the film several times, I can't work out what good they bring to the story.
Jack is made the main 'hero' in this film which doesn't really work at all and he is far more suited to being the anti-hero. With that said, he is still very entertaining and Johnny Depp does the best he can.
Barbossa is excellent as always and Geoffrey Rush clearly has brilliant fun playing him. Not much different to the last films in his character, but the story does take him in an interesting new direction.
Overall On Stranger Tides is a poor film, with a wasted plot and incredibly boring new characters, despite a good effort by Depp and Rush."

","The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise takes the oddball, zany adventures of early Hollywood pirate movies (""The Black Pirate"", ""Captain Blood"", ""The Buccaneer"", ""The Sea Hawk"", ""The Black Swan"", ""Captain Kidd"", ""Hornblower"", ""Blackbeard"", ""The Crimson Pirate"", ""Fairwind to Java"") and spins them off into even wackier territory. Indeed, much of the joys of the first three films were in watching the various tales and characters veer off into increasingly mad, busy and nonsensical avenues. Unfortunately this excess quickly got out of hand, ""action sequences"" prolonged to boredom inducing lengths, dull subplots piled upon dull subplots. Eventually the franchise struggled to modulate its madness and started to take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", the fourth film in the franchise, has a shorter running time than its siblings. It's more light-footed, moves better and keeps the level of subplots and characters somewhat down, though its best madcap moments (mermaid attacks, Johnny Depp swinging from coconut trees, giant ships stuck in tiny bottles) never match the wacky highs, comedic power poses and ridiculous gags of the previous movies.<br/><br/>All actors love acting in pirate movies – it gives them a chance to chew scenery and munch on deliciously ridiculous dialogue – and so most of the cast is a delight to watch. The dull, straight faced Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are jettisoned for this instalment, leaving more room for tongue-in-cheek grandstanding and juicy dialogue chewing. The dialogue here is itself really good, witty and injected with a kind of deliberate theatricality (""Death is upon us as we sail for the Fountain of Youth!"", ""I support the missionary's position!"").<br/><br/>The plot is hokum, but the actual construction of the script is somewhat interesting. It revolves around a series of romances, each epitomising a different type of romantic love (love for one's self, unconditional love, selfish love, love for a father, love for one one cannot love, a love-hate romance etc). Director Rob Marshall is too much of a hack to make anything of this. The production belongs to its actors, set-designers and writers. Marshall's too prim and proper to properly marshal their madness. <br/><br/>7.9/10 – This is apparently the eight most profitable film ever made. Worth one viewing."
"moonmonday","Null","3","3","9 August 2011"," Aggressively Mediocre
","I enjoyed the first Pirates film, yawned through the second, and never saw the third. When this one came to the bargain cinema, the power was out and I was looking for something to occupy the time before the power company did their thing.<br/><br/>It was not two-plus hours well spent, but it was adequate to pass the time. There was some action to distract, a few laughs here and there, and some passable special effects, though they were sparing this run-through.<br/><br/>My main problem with it was that despite getting rid of the incredibly annoying characters of Will and Lizzy from the first three films, as well as most of the rest of the recurring cast, they still found a way to avoid Jack as much as possible. It wasn't really about him any more than the other films. The promises to explore his past were completely untrue, and we got little more than a few jokes about how he knew Angelica. He was always a treat when he was on-screen, but so much of the film centred around less interesting characters that it was at times off-putting.<br/><br/>Jack also seemed not to move the plot as he had in the previous films. In the first, he was always the driving impetus for movement. In this one, he seems to be swept up in everything else happening and never once actually drives anything. Instead of being a capable captain whose apparent buffoonery is often to get his enemies off-guard, he really does seem like just a very lucky idiot here, which isn't really fair to the character built through three films already.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa was well-acted, if frustrating, and Ian McShane's Blackbeard was full of personality and gravitas, if completely unsympathetic. Unfortunately Penelope Cruz, despite being a capable actress, has little to work with as Angelica, and she failed to be anything but irritating until her very last scene. Why couldn't we have had that interplay the whole film? Sam Claflin somehow manages to be more annoying than Orlando Bloom as the inane missionary Philip, but he at least fulfills his role as eye candy, inasmuch as he can. Astrid Berges-Frisbey is serviceable as the mermaid Syrena, but makes little impact. The rest of the cast is fine but not prominent.<br/><br/>The story is plodding and meandering, which is not surprising since it had nine screenwriters. It never seems to know what it's doing, and yet it manages to be rather unexciting. When the LEGO game released in tandem is more thrilling than your film, you know there's an issue.<br/><br/>The theme of redemption and faith, overwhelmed by clumsy religious leanings, was off-putting and interfered with most of the characters involved being in any way sympathetic or interesting. The two who seemed to embody the extremes of that faith -- Philip and the Spanish captain -- both came off as completely awful, with the first an ineffectual clod you wanted them to be rid of and the latter nothing more than an ignorant, disrespectful zealot. The Spanish also tended to be nothing but a deus ex machina, who never made any impact on the story and only did anything when the script needed a convoluted climax. It was tremendously unfulfilling that they received no consequences for any of their actions at all.<br/><br/>At least Jack's past with Angelica poked merciless fun at the seeming necessity for 'romance' in these films, even the pastiche between Philip and Syrena. Perhaps in the next film, they will dispense with the weak attempts at romance and concentrate on action and adventure, which is what people go to these films to see.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a film that was okay for wasting time, but nothing special. Not better than the first, although at least it didn't end like the second, and I hear it was far better than the third. It was just unfortunately rather dull and unexceptional, which is a shame since it is supposed to relaunch the series."

","Enjoyed the flick very much. Love Depp and Cruz and everyone in it. Great story and a lot of fun. But why pay extra for 3D if the possible effects were not utilized. Nearly 60 years ago one-eyed director Andre de Toth mapped out 3D in the Vincent Price House of Wax much more cleverly than is utilized in this Pirates. Old 3D movies showed very specific (if exaggerated) depth and did not hesitate to throw things out of the screen at the audience. I sometimes wonder if modern 3D movies are even shot in 3D as most scenes seem to lack that illusion of depth. Kudos to the film itself, a lot of fun. But be aware that the 3D claim is a rip off.

","Stranger Tides brings tidings from strangers in this extension of a  1-part turned 3-part franchise, now pitted to carry on into its sixth  instalment of the saga. Rob Marshall steps in to take the helm as  director, as Johnny Depp continues his reign as the titular Jack  Sparrow. No longer legend for his captaincy, we find Sparrow in London  amidst the largest collection of known British actors outside of Harry  Potter. After rescuing first mate Gibbs (he's the one who slept with  the pigs) from hanging under Sparrow's name, our swaggering  swashbuckler discovers there's a new Jack in town.  Meanwhile an arms race is taking place between the Brits (led by  Geoffrey Rush's now peg- legged Barbossa), the Spaniards, and big ol'  Blackbeard to find the Fountain of Youth. Pretty self-explanatory,  their motives and maps are laid out in a series of hops back and forth  from exposition to rehashed sword-fight and chase sequences through the  streets of London. While Jack's runaways are more Austin Powers than  Bond, the swift swish of metal is far preferable to Verbinski's  interminable distraction with ship battles in parts 2 and 3. It takes a  long time to get to the captain crossover and corrupt bargaining that  the first film did so well, with a race to the finish opposed to a  tactical playoff. But, warming up to a reunion between Sparrow and  Barbossa, it's the archival camaraderies that bring out the best in the  remaining key characters. It's in this unlikely union you'll find most  of the laughs.  Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane team up as Sparrow's ex-lover Angelica  and evil buccaneer Blackbeard, though her needy deception and his  one-note barbarism don't liven up proceedings as much as Will and  Elizabeth's foolish frivolities have in prequels past. In a despairing  attempt to plug the gap, too much is made of an attraction between a  random mercenary and mermaid - by the by, a depiction of the mythical  creatures is too close to a Lynx advert for comfort, and the key to a  center-piece so pointless that it's almost a relief that CG was  similarly cut and plugged with slow-searing 3D effects.  Hingeing heavily on Sparrow's well-documented improvisation, many of  the set-pieces are fun and nimble, though frustratingly hampered by  needless 3D which knocks the pace of the action sequences. Hans  Zimmer's ever-excellent score pulls together all the rogue threads,  keeping well within the range of the first film and injecting a  vigorous dose of fun. Restrained and keeping convention, Pirates 4 is  far from heading up the franchise, but remains a solid addition to the  fleet."

","What Rob Marshall did with Pirates series, no one else could have done with such finesse and panache. Dropping out two key protagonists without explanations and instead of picking on famous novels, he opted for rather under-rated Tim Power's On Stranger Tides to fit the characters.<br/><br/>Similarly, what Johnny Depp has been doing in all Pirates movies and what he did in this movie, no one else could have done it with such perfection. That's Johnny Depp(Jack Sparrow) for you.<br/><br/>Most of you must have seen Indian Jones and the Last Crusade, I guess. You're gonna have a feel of Deja Vu in many of the scenes. Following an appropriately pulpy prologue, the film opens on erstwhile Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) as he's marooned in London in search of a ship, and pursued by local authorities who he makes little serious effort to avoid. Hearing that an impostor Sparrow is auditioning pirate recruits at a seaside bar, he seeks out the interloper only to discover his spitfire former lover Angelica (Penelope Cruz), disguised as him After some requisite sword-clashing, Angelica kidnaps Sparrow and ferries him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, lorded over by Angelica's (maybe) father, Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Commanding a crew comprised of equal parts stray pirates and hulking zombies -- why he needs the former when he has the latter is never explained -- Blackbeard enlists Sparrow to help him locate the fountain of youth, which becomes an especially urgent task after a prophecy foretells Blackbeard's imminent death at the hands of a one-legged man.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sparrow's rival Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now conveniently one-legged, has bid farewell to his pirate's life, and seeks the fountain on behalf of the king of England, who is keen to find it before a rival crew sent by the king of Spain can claim it for themselves. As the three parties converge on the fountain's jungle location, they must also deal with a ravenous horde of vampiric mermaids, from whom a single tear must be procured to drink the fountain's waters.<br/><br/>In case any one of you haven't seen the previous movies, frequent recaps are provided through out and it doesn't matter too much anyway. Depp remains the face of the film. But a majority of his thunder is co-opted by an on-point Rush, who not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade. McShane, on the other hand, is underwhelming. Never appearing comfortable in his heavy pirate get-up, his tired Blackbeard is only menacing via other characters' testimonials to his evil, and his one on screen atrocity seems tossed in merely to stress that he is, in fact, the bad guy.<br/><br/>Cruz is a reliably welcome, gorgeous presence, though she too often falls back on the ""feisty Latina"" signifiers that have been the crutch of so much of her English-language work. Sam Claflin supplies some semi- risible gallantry as a super-studly priest, and Astrid Berges-Frisbey looks effectively terrified as a captive mermaid.<br/><br/>All in all, it is must watch for everybody who is a fan of Pirates series and Johnny Depp. Go for it and chances are less of you being disappointed.<br/><br/>Thanks & Regards,<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10"
"simonparker1990","7","53","101","20 May 2011"," The best since the original Pirates
","I would like to begin by saying that I very rarely review films anymore, but after reading many reviews for this film by various critics I felt compelled to give my own verdict. Purely because every review I have read has been unnecessarily venomous, and simply seemed to trash the film and its two predecessors at every given opportunity. I am a fan of the Pirates trilogy, the original is by far the best, and three may have some problems with its convoluted storyline, but there is nothing wrong with Dead Man's Chest and as a trilogy they all worked very well. This fourth instalment like the others is great fun, the storyline may not be Oscar worthy stuff but neither was the storyline in the others. It is an entertaining fantasy flick that you can sit back, relax and enjoy. The idea that Johnny Depp has become bored of the character of Jack Sparrow and plays him in this film as a shadow of his former self, is simply ludicrous. Depp is on top form in this movie, brilliant for me considering following the awful performance in Alice in Wonderland I had begun doubting him somewhat. On Stranger Tides is easily the best movie since the original, and I would be more than happy to sit through another two films.<br/><br/>Now onto the performances. As previously mentioned Depp is simply outstanding as Jack Sparrow. By putting him to the forefront means we get to spend more time with him, though thankfully the writers hold back on having him on screen too much. His one liners, especially one involving a Spanish Convent had me in stitches. His relationship with Angelica (Penelope Cruz) really adds that extra bit of spice to the film. It also helps that Cruz and Depp have outstanding chemistry together. While the character of Angelica can be a bit complicated at times, her motives are vague at best, this can be overshadowed by the fact Cruz plays her with some real gusto. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa for me really stole the show, and it seems the writers gave him quite a bit more storyline this time as well. The idea of moving him to the kings navy really played off, and his scenes for me were definitely a highlight of the film. Ian McShane is a great villain, while not as good as Davey Jones or Barbossa for that matter, he still has a great storyline and some really menacing moments to make him a worthy adversary.<br/><br/>My one major issue with this movie would be the storyline of the missionary and the mermaid. While thankfully it isn't given enough screen time to be a really annoyance, I do question its point in the first place. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not remotely missed, so why try a romance replacement which just isn't that good. The mermaid action scene however is a thing to behold. As said the storyline is not amazing, the quest for the fountain of youth is entertaining and it has less betrayals than the far too long At World's End, but it isn't a story that will be winning awards. Nevertheless it maintains your interest and never feels like an excuse to get to the next action scene as it was in something like Transformers 2. The fact it is a one story arc is also a nice breath of fresh air following the second and third movies. Overall this is a great Summer movie, the kids will love it, and if you're a pirates fan you will also love it. The trashing of this film to me is slightly irritating as this is genuinely a very good film that deserves recognition. I will stand by the Pirates films until I genuinely see one that is rubbish, this film is a great Summer blockbuster and anyone that looks at it otherwise must either be deluded or trashing on it because they no longer see Pirates as ""cool"". I cannot recommend this film quite enough, just go out, watch it and have a great laugh, I know I did."

","I watched the preview last Thursday.I cannot disagree more with one of the reviews which suggested the latest version is a bit dull.On stranger tides is not only better than the last two instalments but nearly as good as the the original.The storyline is lucid,plenty of jokes which made the first movie good,less use of nonsense CGI and absence of two characters actually gives a new lease of life particularly since Ian McShane is as expected just brilliant.Penelope Cruz appears to be hiding in long dresses to hide her obvious problem at that time.All in all the best movie outing for sheer fun since Inception.Its a popcorn movie and does a good job of what is expected!"
"tavm","7","9","13","24 May 2011"," Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is another enjoyable romp with Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz
","I had previously enjoyed the first and third of the Johnny Depp pirate movies though I was confused by some of the sequences. This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There's also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","25","44","21 May 2011"," Probably better than it should have been
","In movies, as in marriage, the fourth go-around can get a little tricky. As the fourth round approaches there's an apprehension of what has come before and what is new that is left to be discovered. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the third sequel in Disney's highly-successful series, is not a movie that I went into with much anticipation. Yet, as I always do, I allowed myself to be open minded (you never know when a movie will surprise you) and I found the movie quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>My apprehension comes from the experience of the previous films, which I complained were too long and so overwritten as to become convoluted. That's not good for what should be a simple pirate movie. Having left behind many of the familiar characters (Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly and Jonathan Price are absent this time), the movie is free to find new characters and a new arena to play in. With that, this is a kind of trimmed down POTC movie.<br/><br/>The movie finds the ever-plucky sea-going rascal Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) once again in trouble with the King's court and about to be executed. That is, until one of his crew produces a map to the fabled Fountain of Youth, rumored to have been found 200 years before by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León. Jack makes a spectacular escape and the race is on race to find the fountain, which is headed off first by the Spanish fleet and then by the British fleet. Trailing them are Jack and his nemesis Captain Barbossa (Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush), who is a privateer under the orders of King George II (Richard Griffiths). Then there is Angelica (Oscar winner Penelope Cruz), who is first mate on the ship captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane) - whose beard is actually gray, but never mind.<br/><br/>The plot to get to the fountain of youth is probably more complicated than it needs to be. Getting to the fountain is easy enough, but then we learn that it is not a simple matter of taking a dip and becoming younger, no. First, Jack learns, you must first get two goblets belonging to Ponce de León, then you have to mix it with the tears of a mermaid, then (I think I have this right), one person has to drink from one cup to become younger and then another person has to drink from the other and they will die. Something along those lines. As I said, it is more complicated than it needs to be.<br/><br/>The plot, as in the previous installments, is somewhat superfluous. There really isn't a need to get to the fountain of youth. There probably wasn't any need for mermaids that can suck your blood, nor, all that stuff about voodoo and shrinking massive ships until you can fit them into bottles. Yet, what I have learned about this series is that the plot really doesn't matter. These films are constructed more as a series of set pieces rather than a narrative plot. I appreciated the mermaids but, this being a Disney film, the all-out boob-fest that should have ensued sadly never materializes.<br/><br/>What keeps this series popular is quality control. Johnny Depp maintains the same swagger and slurry charm that he had in the previous films. He keeps from taking the film too seriously but avoids the temptation to make fun of the character. The first film got him his first Oscar nomination, and justifiably so. Eight years, and three sequels later, Depp maintains the fun spirit of the character and doesn't allow it to grow routine. Neither does Geoffrey Rush, in his third go-around as Captain Barbossa, which he plays with an evil wink and a pirate accent that he practically chews on. Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance here and proves - to me at least - that she should have been the female protagonist of the series all along instead of Kiera Knightly. Yet, I was surprisingly underwhelmed by Ian McShane's performance as Blackbeard. McShane is a wonderful actor but somehow Blackbeard seems subdued. He is pure evil, right down to the buckles on his boots but the character doesn't leap out with the lip-smacking vileness that I had hoped. The movie pins the character down as if they are introducing him to be in a future movie.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is probably the best of the series since the first one. That is thanks to a leaner script and, mercifully, a shorter running time (it is actually an hour shorter than the last one). I could complain about it all day long, but I would rather confess that I was more entertained by this film than I was by the previous two.<br/><br/>Disney has found a gold mine with this series. Convoluted as these movies are, they do have an audience and I am glad to see anything that gets movie fans excited. Yet, there is a feeling that this series may be wrapping up. Johnny Depp has said that he is growing tired of playing Jack Sparrow (although it does not come out in his performance) and that may bring about an end to this ""Pirates"" series. With that, I started thinking that maybe Disney would do well to move on to something else, maybe Treasure Island, Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Moby Dick. Maybe the same fun-loving spirit that made this series so popular could be given to those classics as well."

","I have to say I was really looking forward to Pirates of the Caribbean 4, I really enjoyed Curse of the Black Pearl.Then Dead Man's Chest and At World's End were good, but there was room for improvement.<br/><br/>POTC: On Stranger Tides was full of action. The beginning is quite good but I struggled to get to grips with where we were since the last film. I soon got into it and it was good to see familiar faces! Depp and Rush were amazing as always and there's some pretty good new faces too! However - I did feel there were too many action sequences, and there's so many different groups of people going after the Fountain of Youth it becomes very confusing. I also felt it was difficult to understand why each person/group of people were going after the fountain? It also lacked the humour of The Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>On the positive side again - we learn a lot more about Jack's character. But I perhaps feel he wasn't involved enough...But I would advise watching it. I will definitely buy the DVD and am looking forward to POTC 5!"
"tedg","Null","10","15","7 June 2011"," New Ships
","The franchise has shifted. The 'first trilogy' was visually-centered. It was quite literally a ride, allowing Depp room to creatively be silly. Some of the cinematic stretch was significant, and I still remember the Shackleford reference fondly. <br/><br/>This is something entirely different. Sure, it has busy sequences and characters from the same universe. But now we have something story- centric. Images are pasted onto the story rather than the other way around. <br/><br/>There's even an excess of story and excess within story with the excess being a character itself. <br/><br/>There are at least three love stories, one of them tender and conventional, all of them centered on Catalonian women.<br/><br/>There is something of an overarching battle between Christianity and the supernatural. The extreme irony is that the Spaniards are the token of the faith. In actual life, they were the ones who invented the notions of supernatural evil, the first continental faith-based genocide and New World slavery. <br/><br/>There is a nice little revenge story that references Moby Dick. And at the end two Peter Pan like affirmations of the (pirate's) life of adventure. <br/><br/>I liked it. I liked the gush and mix of narrative. I liked the appropriation of Almodovarian values. But I have to say that no one knew how to leverage Penelope the way Pedro can. She is not inventive like Johnny and Geoffrey. She is a vessel, a vulnerable vessel that can be filled with female assets. But she has to gather that from the environment. Making her into something even Geena Davis and her lover could not do is a sacrilege."

","I got a chance by a friend to watch this movie at the premier. And I am glad i did. On stranger Tides was just as good as the other pirates. Maybe even the best one yet.<br/><br/>One thing that you will Understand early in the film, is that it is very different compared to the others. at the start it may seem a bit slow, but as you go further into the film it gets better and better by the minute. Johnny Depp is as good as always. i can NOT imagine anyone else playing this Role but him, he truly nailed it as always.<br/><br/>A very good thing about this film is that there aren't many CG scenes, like At the world's End. it makes the films look and feel very natural. the performance by Geoffrey Rush and Penélope Cruz Are fantastic and would be very good if we see them in the future films. They are really lucky that the movie was rated PG-13. There are some mild Violence scenes which we never had in the pirates series. but I am not referring to that as a weakness. The mermaids were extremely Beautiful and nicely made, which i think was one of the best parts of the films.<br/><br/>On the other hand Ian McShane's performance didn't really grab me. he seemed that he hasn't fit into the role. And was not as scary and powerful as the Black Beard should be.<br/><br/>The Music fantastic as always by Hans Zimmer. it adds so much to the film's story and theme. <br/><br/>I personally Can not wait until the next one is ready. Because it will always be as good as the first one.thats whats special about this, that it Never Gets boring or Old. <br/><br/>Jack is Back,maybe not as powerful as ever, but with a new cast and new story and a new tide, brings a great deal of action to the series.<br/><br/>So this is a MUST-SEE film of the year so far. so if you have any plans for the weekend, drop them, and get to the nearest Cinema!!<br/><br/>Overall 9/10"

"DICK STEEL","7","12","19","19 May 2011"," A Nutshell Review: On Stranger Tides
","I thought this film would never have happened, since the first three films wrapped themselves up pretty nicely as a trilogy, but I suppose studios never say no to profits there for the taking, especially if the point man in Johnny Depp is game to don his eyeliner and pirates garb one more time, and possible more films lined up since the final scenes and the coda after the end credits blatantly teases and flirts with its audience and fan base.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) is back to charm one and all with this swagger and wit, and this time sans his Black Pearl as he goes on a mission, or at least it's one of those self fulfilling rumours, that he's assembling a crew to set sail on a quest to locate the proverbial Fountain of Youth. As with what's characteristic of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, there are always more than one party interested in either joining in or serving as competition, and here we have an English royalty keen on recruiting Jack amongst their ranks to led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now an English privateer, the Spanish Inquisition team who are narratively the weakest of the lot save for one pivotal scene, and a true blue pirates outfit led by the villainous Blackbeard (Ian McShane) aboard his Queen Anne's Revenge ship, with his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz) as his first mate and one time ex-fling of Jack's tasked with luring the latter out and joining their quest rather reluctantly.<br/><br/>But everyone has ulterior motives, and in true Jack Sparrow fashion, the character relationships all play out like the reality game show Survivor as in previous films, where deals are cut, some allegiances are strongly forged while others being temporarily serving mutual self-interests of the moment. Part of the fun is to witness how Sparrow navigates through sticky situations and almost always come up tops, with the nagging suspicion that Fate smiles on his side consistently, seemingly having no plan at all when he embarks on various mini quests in gathering artifacts all geared toward the primary mission, from the capture of mermaids (and they're of the nasty in attitude variety) to chalices all part of a strange ritual required to get to the secret fountain everyone is craving for.<br/><br/>Joining the fray this time round are old hands such as Geoffrey Rush in bringing a lot more to the Barbossa character, and Gibbs (Kevin McNally) as Jack Sparrow's loyal and trusty first mate. Penelope Cruz becomes one of two token female characters here, although her real life pregnancy created some complications during the shoot, and the credits had to thank her sister Monica Cruz for standing in for the long shots so that there wouldn't be a need to hide that bulge in the tummy - it's quite obvious which scenes these were as her character's hat had to be tipped downwards. You can also tell that the presence of Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as a priest and mermaid respectively were to counterbalance the loss of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabbeth Swann as the film's requisite lovebirds, which developed too fast too soon, and left it hanging, possibly to be explored in greater detail in subsequent films.<br/><br/>As an action adventure, the action sequences if compared to the previous installments, have all been toned down, and are the same old routine often seen in other action adventures. Do we need another escape on a chariot, or yet another big brawled sword fight sans blood (this is a Disney film after all) with nary a vulgar word spoken as they are cut off at the right moment? Too many one on one swordfights amongst various characters also made this quite repetitive to sit through, and I'd secretly enjoyed more of the dramatic wheelings and dealings more than the action in this film, despite the middle portion sagging under its own talkie weight.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski had given up the director's chair to allow for new blood to take over the helm and steer the franchise into a new direction, so enter Rob Marshall, whom I'd say has the unenviable task of continuing a very well loved, and profitable series of films. While the direction may be new and the storyline necessary to be branching off from where it left off, somehow On Stranger Tides failed to recreate the entire adventurous spirit that the original trilogy possessed. Perhaps it's the cutting down on funding that made the action sequences quite dull, also having to shoot those scenes in 2D before undergoing 3D conversion to keep costs down.<br/><br/>Sure the storyline is an adventure film for fans to follow up on the exploits of Jack Sparrow, but it sure felt more of the same with that air of familiarity not broken. Should another film be made, let's hope it has some of the swashbuckling cavalier feel to it rather than just another exercise of routine."
"helmutty","7","12","19","19 May 2011"," Pirates of the Carribbean 4 3D is simple-minded and fun
","I must say I enjoyed Gore's Pirates of the Carribbean trilogy very much. Although the third one is crammed with many characters and confusing story plots, I still had a great time watching ships being wrecked apart. When a forth movie is announced, I was wary of it as I thought Gore has already concluded his vision. I did not actually show much interest in watching it until I heard it is shot in 3D and I am a big 3D fan. Pirates of the Carribbean: On Stranger Tides is an entertaining ride and much more simpler than the bloated At World's End.<br/><br/>The story: Johnny Depp returns to his famous role, witty Captain Jack. His friend, Gibbs is back. Barbossa returns too. And these are the only characters that are back for a forth outing. Jack is still as witty as ever. Characters wise is okay. Some characters are under-used like the mermaids. Those action fans who expect Gore's visual and epic battles scenes will be a little bit disappointed in here. Rob Marshall goes for smaller yet still thrilling action set pieces. On the note of ships wrecking, there is none here. Story wise is alright. The pace moves decently. Critics and audience who complained that the previous movie is too bloated now do not need to wreck their brains with characters and confusing/long-winded side plots. Hans Zimmer is top-notch here again with the famous Pirates of the Caribbean music. As a 3D fan, I was a little disappointed with its usage of 3D. Shots of scenery are good but when it comes to the action, it lacks of the visual effects it is supposed to have and in your face moments. I have to admit that this is a bit too long for a 3D movie, struggling to keep the 3D glasses on top of my glasses and craning my neck like in Avatar. <br/><br/>Overall: It is another Pirates and blockbuster movie to whet movie-goers's appetite. Of course, it is not like the Gore's movies or even as big as his but this still stand up with Rob's different directions. This might start up another series as this will no doubt earn a lot in box office."
"briangcb","Null","6","8","28 May 2011"," Back to basics and a smart choice. Could it be studios are wising up?
","I will say that I am a fan of all the PotC movies, the second one is probably my favourite...but my reasons for liking sequels to action films or comic book movies is usually that while the first one is usually the best, it sets up the characters, they all meet, develop relationships, etc. so the second film leaves more room for action and advancing stories. Which is the case for PotC. The first one is definitely the best executed, but I enjoyed the second one for its action, effects, humour, etc. My complaints about Pirates 2 and 3 were that they became so complex and ridiculous that they were just wayyyy out there. I had no trouble following the plot but I couldn't help but think that younger audience members wouldn't know what the hell was going on at all. Also, in the first film we're not entirely sure if Jack Sparrow is trying to screw people over to secure his own gains, or if he's helping himself by helping others. It's clearly stated by the end of the film that he's actually a good man. Yet in Pirates 2 and 3 he's blatantly trying to screw people over who had helped save him previously.<br/><br/>So when I heard that a fourth pirates movie was in production, I wasn't thrilled. My main thought was ""Whatever, we'll see."" Once it was released I decided to go see it at the theatre and I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was straightforward, they're trying to find the fountain of youth and they list the steps needed to complete this. Jack is back to being the honestly dishonest (honestly) pirate we all came to love. There are mermaids, zombies (sort of) and of course the fountain of youth. But the plot never gets too complicated or completely ridiculous. My complaint about the film was the main villain Blackbeard wasn't fleshed out enough. He shows up fairly late into the film and he's never really shown to be the scariest pirate to sail the sea. Davy Jones and his crew were much more menacing.<br/><br/>All in all, if the series continues with this pattern of keeping the movies simple and fun then I'm all for more of them being made."

","With ""On Stranger Tides,"" the Pirates franchise gets to concentrate more on the character of Capt. Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp really has this character down pat, and obviously has fun with it. Old characters are still there, such as Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Gibbs and Jack's father, who are as we know them. But we also get to meet a woman from his past in the person of Angelica, who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Honestly, I thought Penelope Cruz could not possibly be convincing as a pirate, but I was glad to be wrong. She could swashbuckle with the rest of them pirates. <br/><br/>While the relationship between Sparrow and Angelica was more on the comedy level, a new romantic pair was also introduced in the characters of the compassionate missionary Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mysterious Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). While I read a lot of criticism about how useless this angle was to the film, I actually felt the scenes of these new characters were well-executed by new director Rob Marshall. I do not think they bog the storyline down at all.<br/><br/>""On Stranger Tides"" features a race to the Fountain of Youth which was a great concept. We watched in 3D and I was glad to see that these were not mere post-production effects, and they lasted the whole movie. The 3D was certainly not a rip-off in this one! Those fight and chase scenes in the palace of the mad King George were amazingly shot. The special effects of the pirates encounter with mermaids contribute well to the eerie and menace of those scenes. <br/><br/>This was the first Pirates movie that my two boys watched with me. After watching, I felt that indeed this film was the best way to introduce the Pirates to kids. It is shorter, lighter and faster-paced than the first three more ""serious"" films, which are more adult in orientation. This is not to mean that ""Tides"" is a lesser film quality though. I would think it could launch a trilogy of its own for its new fans."
"logoking10","8","6","8","24 May 2011"," A New Fresh Start
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides offers exactly what the title suggests, the universe of Pirates with new and exciting angles. This film departs from the Will x Elizabeth story line of the original trilogy, and instead explores the grand adventures that most fans of the original Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl knew that Sparrow had and must continue to have. Jack is as distracted and brilliant as he has always been, and the once villain Barbosa threatens to become far more likable and sympathetic than the original trilogy ever allowed him to. Not to say that he isn't still a ruthless, generally intolerably mannered pirate at heart. Then we have Blackbeard, terror of the seas. Ted Elliot and Terry Rosio certainly did their homework when creating the character and the dialog that surrounds him, and even play with various myths and legends that surrounded the man and myth. All in all the cast do a spectacular job, as has been standard for the series, and Cruz, playing Jack's dynamic love interest, works in brilliant accord with Depp to affect a watchable (if not at times a bit explicit) relationship. On Stranger Tides delivers a fantastic adventure and a solid several minutes of very pleasant escapism."
"bravo-super","6","6","8","24 May 2011"," Good and enjoyable
","I expected more spectacular and impressive film. Movie is good and enjoyable, is also completed, unlike other parts. Many helps 3D effect. The best moments are collected in advertising the film. However, it should be seen, one of the mandatory. Penelope stood not particularly well. Interestingly, once again, Depp is not presented as a leader, but the entire film rests on Depp. I do not see how the movie will be extended without losing the magic. In my opinion, should be scored another strong character. Depp to present itself as an adult who instructs his grandson Charlie Sheen:). The new target of the pirates may be to find Atlantis and come into collision with pirates from other planets."
"Aaron1375","8","6","8","23 May 2011"," Captain Jack is back and helps this pirate move float.
","I was not expecting this one to be quite as good as it turned out mainly because of the review I read of it that made it seem really bad. I have to disagree with that review, however, as I found it a good movie, better than the second and third installments of this film, but not as good as the still best first one. This one sort of picks up after the third one in that the object of everyone's desire is the fountain of youth as the pirate Blackbeard, the English and the Spaniards are after this most magical of places. For the waters of youth to work one most first get two silver chalices and a mermaids tears. Jack at the moment is in England, but he shall get around quite a lot in this one. His old nemesis and sometimes partner Barbossa is also back this time seemingly in league with the English. The action in this one is rather good and Captain Jack Sparrow is once again the best character, only this time he is the main guy with no others taking time away from him in bunches like the previous two installments. The scenery in areas of the film is just really gorgeous once they get to the area of the fountain of youth. There is also a very nice mermaid scene to be seen as well, just enjoyed most of the film. Granted there are questions one has while watching this film such as Blackbeard's mysterious powers that are not really explained and if it was I missed it, however I had questions like this one for all three of the other movies too. So a good movie, better than Pirates 2 and 3 for me and a nice ending to boot. I do not know this one just flowed better than the previous two pirate movies. At least for me, the one review made this film sound very slow and not all that entertaining aside from a couple of scenes. I guess I just enjoyed seeing Captain Jack Sparrow back sans Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly who I feel had to much screen time in parts two and three."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","16","27","19 May 2011"," Well, at least it's not as bad as the last one...
","Though that isn't really saying much, is it? Most people seem to agree that the first POTC movie was/is/and ever shall remain the best of the franchise. It took me repeated viewings, but over time the second film grew on me and I've since come to rather enjoy it. It was over-long, yes, but at least it was *fun*...unlike the third film, which was - to put it mildly - a mess. So where does this latest film rank? Well, as with the three films before it, On Stranger Tides runs for far too long...but then, we've come to expect that with these movies, haven't we? If only the filmmakers could learn that making the films run for an excessive amount of time does not automatically mean there is more joy to be had. Quite the opposite, in fact. This one has a rather long/slow beginning, and I didn't think things really picked up until the mermaid scene - which was quite a wonder to behold. It's easily the best/most memorable part of the movie. A shame that we took so long to get there.<br/><br/>As far as the actors go, Johnny Depp does his thing as Captain Jack Sparrow. Jack's still his usual old self, but appears to actually show concern for other people from time to time, which is nice. Depp *is* Captain Jack Sparrow, there's no doubt about it. Even when things get boring, he can always be relied upon to brighten up any scene that he's in (hell, even Jack loves himself so much so that he's willing to kiss himself...or, you know, someone pretending to be him - three guesses who that turns out to be). Penélope Cruz is good as Angelica (the maybe daughter of Blackbeard). She's sufficiently feisty and holds her own against Jack. The best exchanges between the two come at the end, when they seemingly part ways (though if you stay after the end credits, you will see possible set-up for how Angelica might find her way back into Jack's life again). <br/><br/>And what of Angelica's maybe father, Blackbeard? Well...at least they got the flaming beard part of him right. Other than that, I didn't find Ian McShane particularly menacing in the role. For a pirate who's supposedly so feared by all, he's really not that fearsome (though the writers try to make him so by having him at one point flambé someone with his ship. Yes, apparently it has flame-throwers in the front of it). Honestly, the most memorable thing about him was watching him meet his fate at the end. He just doesn't compare to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones.<br/><br/>With the Will & Elizabeth storyline pretty much wrapped up at the end of the last film, in place of Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley are newbies Sam Claflin & Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey as Philip and Syrena (he's a missionary man and she's a mermaid). Philip's main purpose seems to be getting slashed or stabbed. Whereas at least Syrena has an 'other-worldliness' about her and is interesting to watch, thanks to Bergès-Frisbey's portrayal of her. She's really quite something. Whilst spending most of her time in a water-filled box, her character *does* serve a purpose in the long run and helps Jack out (we also get to see her have an Ariel moment and gain legs on land). The 'love story' - if one can call it that - between the two characters is left open-ended. Sadly, the first and most fearsome of the mermaids who we meet - Tamara (played by Aussie Gemma Ward) - is only on screen for the briefest of times. I wish we could have seen more of her, as she really was entrancing. But, hey, at least we got to hear her pretty singing. Yes, like all the films before it, this one has singing (though nowhere near as lame/annoying as the gallows singing in the last film).<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa, though not as we remember him - he's now one of the ""King's men"" and has a peg leg. Rush is at his best when playing off of Depp, and there's a rare serious moment between Barbossa and Jack when they're tied to trees. Kevin McNally also returns as Gibbs. Frustratingly, he spends most of his time separated from Jack, but they're thankfully reunited at the very end. The rest of the secondary characters are all pretty much unmemorable and/or pointless. <br/><br/>The film looks great of course, and the score is what you've come to expect. While the main POTC theme is as memorable as ever, the new Blackbeard 'theme' is, like him, pretty forgettable. <br/><br/>If things had been trimmed out of the first half of the movie, it might have actually been really good, but there are long periods that appear to be massive wastes of time and numerous sword fights that seem ultimately pointless. The scene where we first see Jack encounter Angelica is memorable, but perhaps that's because it shares similarities to the scene from the first film where Jack met Will. Truly, the one stand-out scene from this new film is the mermaid attack. It's very nicely shot, and quite creepy/tense/exciting. One thing the filmmakers have reined in a bit is the over-use of CGI. It's used to better effect here - the mermaid's tails, for example - rather than just tossing in as much of it as they can like they did last time.<br/><br/>Where things end, yes, there's definitely room for a sequel...but really, is there much point at this stage? While this film is an improvement over the last one (and nowhere near as convoluted), it's still not what I'd class as 'great'. I much prefer the first two, but still, this one is worth seeing if you just can't get enough of pirates, Captain Jack or fang-y mermaids."
"NeHaud","7","7","10","23 May 2011"," My my....what a surprise...
","Now, we all have seen how fourth installments of a series can end (cough cough Star Wars...) and we have come to shrink away from such movies. The second sequel creates an air of wariness...the third sequel sends suspicions skyrocketing...yet a fourth? How are we, as the audience, to take this? I was unsure how to approach this movie, but I went with an open mind, subconsciously doubtful due to my (opinion of course...) recent disappointments with the second and third Pirate movies, but, to my surprise, this one rose to the same admiration in my eyes as the first one did. It downplayed the fantasy air as the first one did, cleverly mingling it in the the plot, and did not shove it in our faces as the second and third so rudely did. It even managed to throw in some history lessons for the kids, regarding the history of Ponce de Leon in his search for the Fountain. The only thing that really sticks out in my mind that I did not like was the death of Blackbeard. Mind you, that was some pretty amazing special effects with the skeleton and such, yet it troubled me. Blackbeard was a real life figure...and we know how he met his demise...and, trust me, it was not by the hand of a whirlwind of lethal water. I did not like the twisting of historical facts presented here...and another matter regarding this subject, why on earth would Angelica be willing to save him? Didn't she earlier scheme with Jack that she was going to betray him and perhaps use him as the sacrifice?* Perhaps I misunderstood, but this was what I gathered...however, all in all, this was a great movie.<br/><br/>*Edited version: I recently went to see the movie for a second time, and apparently I was mistaken...she never planned on harming her father. The scene she was discussing this was very confusing..."
"Jax0524","8","8","12","25 May 2011"," I heart Pirates
","I've been keeping up with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise since the beginning in 2003 with POTC:Curse of the Black Pearl. I loved Curse of the Black Pearl absolutely loved it.Soon after that Dead Mans Chest was released and I thought meh okay not as good as the last one but still a decent watch. Then came the bomb that was POTC: At Worlds End. At Worlds End was a big mess. There was too much going on and the plot was just all over the place.It got to a point where I didn't care about the plot anymore Im strictly watching for the effects now.<br/><br/>As for Stranger Tides I was impressed. This film reminded me why I fell in love with Curse of the Black Pearl. I wouldn't even call this movie a sequel it feels like a whole new beginning. Will and Elizabeth's story is over and now we get Jack and Angelica.Did I miss Will and Elizabeth? NOT AT ALL. I stopped caring for those two a long time ago. Im glad their story is over and IT IS OVER FOLKS. For a time their story was interesting and then I gradually started to get bored to tears with them. So yeah good riddance moving along.<br/><br/>The plot of this installment circles around the fountain of youth. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp)runs into Angelica(Penelope Cruz)a woman from his past. Its not entirely certain if its love and she wants to follow him to the fountain of youth, but then her intentions become clear when she forces him aboard the Queen Ann's Revenge, Black Beard's ship. Ian McShane's portrayal of black beard was pretty convincing I have no complaints about that. However my complaint lies within how the writers were trying to shove down the audience's throat the fact that Blackbeard was evil. For example there was a scene where Blackbeard, Jack, Angelica, and the crew are all standing over the edge of a cliff and Blackbeard orders Jack to jump. Jack refuses and Black beard says that if he doesn't he'll kill his own daughter, who just so happens to be Angelica by the way. It then cuts to an unnecessary scene of Black beard and Jack playing a game of ""pick a gun any gun"" Two of the guns contain a bullet whatever gun Jack picks Black beard will shoot Angelica with it just to prove a point.Why was this needed. At this point the audience pretty much knows that Black beard is a bad guy. Im sure it wouldn't surprise us if Blackbeard threatened to kill his own daughter.This wasn't necessary, it did nothing for the plot.Another complaint I have is that nothing is really explained about Blackbeard making people into zombies or the magic of his ship or why he has an interest voodoo.<br/><br/>The movie really picked up when the mermaids came. This was one of my favorite parts of the movie because it has a calm before the storm feel to it. You meet these beautiful captivating creatures that lure the pirates into false sense of security and in a way you yourself feel hypnotized as well. There's a lot of tension in this scene and you know something is going to happen, your just sitting there anxiously waiting for it to happen, and then comes the boom. They may look lovely but they are definitely deadly beauties. Which brings me to the whole Phillip and Syrena love story. It didn't bother me however it did feel a little forced.I wouldn't even call what they had ""love"" it was more so infatuation. The interest was there it just needed more time to develop and thats hard to squeeze in the last 30 to 45 minutes of film. If there's a POTC 5 I wouldn't mind seeing Philip and Syrena again just to know what became of him. But for the most part I think their story is finished. We may never know what happened to Philip. But I must say I would most definitely want to see more mermaids.<br/><br/>In conclusion I was satisfied with this movie. The beginning was pretty slow and boring but it began to pick up towards the middle and end. Its definitely a good reminder of why people like pirates."
"insomniac_rod","8","9","14","22 May 2011"," It's Jack's show.
","My expectations were low and I was surprisingly pleased by this movie. It's all about Jack. He interrupts in the most important moments with his wacky sense of humor.<br/><br/>The movie is overall entertaining and funny. My beef with it was some dumb character decisions, and solving important events with improvisations. But well it's Jack's style. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow carries the whole film on his back. Penelope Cruz was a great addition as her character is fierce, beautiful, and very angry towards Jack. Barbossa returns and wants to seek revenge against Blackbeard. So character wise, the movie is great.<br/><br/>The f/x are excellent although the 3D isn't at any point necessary but that's my opinion.<br/><br/>The score is also fantastic. <br/><br/>The production values are superb, the story gets you interested most of the time, the action sequences were just good (left something to desire); and the humor is fine. The highlights for me were the mermaids attack, the opening sequence, and the final match between Barbossa and Blackbeard.<br/><br/>Overall it's a popcorn movie that should please fans of the series. ."
"movieexplosion","6","9","14","21 May 2011"," If you like the other films you'll be happy with this one
","Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) is at it again in this grandiose pirate adventure in a quest to find the fabled fountain of youth. Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) is back too minus a leg. He has given up his pirate ways and is now in the pay of the British Navy as a privateer in the hopes that they will beat the Spanish to the fountain. Whilst this race is going on Captain Jack meets up with old flame Angelica(Penélope Cruz) hot as ever and is taken captive on her father Blackbeard's(Ian McShane) boat who is also on the hunt for said fountain.<br/><br/>This story is back to a basic plot after the more complicated 2&3 of the series and this has been a good move. Depp is as good as ever in what is now his most famous character and Rush is back in flying form. Gibbs, Captain Jack's crew master is back too and helps maintain the feel of the series. McShane is wonderfully cast as the villainous blackbeard and one is reminded of his character in 'Deadwood'.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the rest of the series you will be happy with this one and if you felt the 2nd and 3rd of the series got bogged down a bit with overcomplicated plots you will find this a refreshing change back to the form of the original."

","After the sequel duds, I can safely say Pirates of the Caribbean is back to its fun roots with On Stranger Tides. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I am not a PoTC geek. In fact, I have only managed to see the first one completely; the second and third one were too long, too boring, and too confusing to be worth my time.<br/><br/>Stranger Tides boasts of a tight script, stellar visuals, fantastic adventure and, of course, great performance from the entire cast, especially Captain Sparrow, Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>The movie does get a bit stretched, consequently drowning the tempo before relieving it with another fun sequence. I would say a trim of about 15-20mins would had made the movie even better.<br/><br/>Overall, Stranger Tides is an excellent movie. Even if you have not followed the previous story lines, and as long as you are aware of the characters, you will have no trouble following the story in this one."
"Richard-Nathan","1","21","39","4 June 2011"," What A Waste of a Good Novel
","I enjoyed Tim Powers' novel ""On Stranger Tides,"" and was hoping that Disney Studios would find a way to turn it into an decent ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film. I was horrendously disappointed. They scarcely used anything at all from the novel. The film had no virtually no plot (and for those of you who may confuse plot with action, they are NOT the same thing), no rooting interest, and the least chemistry between the two leads that I have ever seen in a film in my entire life. It wasn't just that Depp's character and Lopez's characters did not seem to care about each other, they barely seemed to have met. They managed to make Blackbeard the pirate dull and nonthreatening. They made the life of a pirate slightly less thrilling than the life of a certified public accountant."
"judywalker2","3","4","5","2 June 2011"," Please shoot me.
","I gave up on the Pirates after the second movie but my daughter wanted to see this and I wanted popcorn. I was hoping by the end that they would just kill everyone including me for sitting through this mess. Jack Sparrow was interesting in the first movie, with a kind of strangely intriguing but yet intelligent characterization. They left the character a mystery that we hoped would be explored in subsequent films to create an interesting story. We loved the love story between Elizabeth Swan and 'searching for his self worth' Will Turner. Though the second film was a mess, the third at least gave them a closure.<br/><br/>This film does nothing to enhance Jack's character it's just another meaningless quest of him to regain his ship again (so tired of this). Only Barbosa gets any kind of cohesive storyline and once again his character shines. Maybe he should be the3 star of the pirates instead of Jack Sparrow, then at least we might be entertained. I won't even begin to talk about how god awful all of the secondary characters were including Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane as boring Blackbeard. I also won't say anything about the pitiful secondary, poorly written so called love story between a mermaid and a member of Blackbeard's crew. It was laughable and not in a good way. I couldn't stop laughing when all I was thinking is that I wanted the poor lovesick boy to just die. Pitiful Pirates."
"dfranzen70","6","4","5","31 May 2011"," Exceeds low expectations
","Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.<br/><br/>This time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a cliché that happens to fit nicely here.<br/><br/>As for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to ""save"" him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 – and who are we kidding, of course there must be – I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.<br/><br/>So what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself – and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.<br/><br/>The stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs – like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles – then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie – and the franchise – owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs – Sparrow's first mate all these movies – memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves."

","When I first decided that I was going to go see this, I was kind of skeptical about it. Rob Marshall was the director and I knew he usually did musicals. That caused me to picture Jack Sparrow doing a dance while fighting with swords. As funny as that sounded, it just wasn't something I wanted to see on P4. Still, I decided to go see it anyways. Boy, was I glad I did! It was just as good as the original. There was an excellent balance of comedy and action. And all the actors were excellent too. Johnny Depp was excellent as always as Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush did an excellent job as Barbossa too. I have to say, however, I didn't like his look during most of the movie. He just looked to weird as a privateer. Thank goodness he changed back to his old look in the very end. Penelope Cruz did such a good job as Angelica. She made her seem like the type of woman you wouldn't want to get mad. Also, the actors Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey were great as Philip and Syrena. They really brought a spirit of youthfulness to the story. Finally, I have to say that Ian Mcshane did a great job as Blackbeard. I love how the brought in a real pirate as one of the characters. He gave the movie a sense of reality. Over all, I have to say that P4 is probably the best in the whole franchise. It is definitely worth going to see!"

","Thoroughly enjoyable! Although the plot could have been more substantial, it is worth 2 hours and 15 minutes of your time. Because there were so many sub-plots in P.O.C. At Worlds End, I had to go see that one twice to make sure I understood it all - but I still loved it. On Stranger Tides was perhaps a little *too* simple, I think....but again, I still enjoyed it. Note: Ian McShane should have been nastier & meaner. In the scheme of things, Cutler Beckett (from P.O.C. 2 & 3) was a more despicable and unlikable character than Blackbeard turned out to be. Just for perspective, I am a grandmother and I am happy to say that I am still a die-hard P.O.C. fan. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush might cringe if they saw this, but I could sit and listen to Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa read a dictionary for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Here's hoping for another P.O.C. in 4 or 5 years - and I am sure with a clever script they will get the formula just right. Forget the critics - it's a fun movie. Go see it. Now! Savvy?"

Even though Gore Verbinski is out of the director's chair, Rob Marshall keeps the film consistent with the previous films in terms of style and returning characters, including the great Captain Jack Sparrow. However, even though it is the shortest film in the series, it still felt very bloated like the previous films. 30 minutes could have been easily cut out in the film's first hour, which unfortunately dragged quite a bit. However, once the mermaids come in, everything starts to pick up fairly quickly, and the film ends up being a really enjoyable action-adventure, a feeling which was absent in POTC3.<br/><br/>And speaking of mermaids, they are one of the best and most unique parts of the film so much so that I wish they were in the story much longer than one 10-minute sequence. Still, the film doesn't suffer once they are gone. In fact, the second half of the film is just as entertaining with a climax that's just plain fun. Johnny Depp returns, playing the role that he's probably most well known for. Even the fourth time around, I still enjoy his antics and clever, funny lines. I don't think it'll ever get old. Geoffrey Rush also returns as Barbossa, although he seemed a little tired and old in here. There are some new members in the cast, most notably Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane. I thought Cruz brought some life in the film, and she made the story a little more interesting. I didn't find McShane to be any special, but he wasn't bad either. There's also Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges- Frisbey, who I thought had a sweet (albeit unnecessary) romance subplot.<br/><br/>As with any Pirates film, POTC4 has some great set pieces, although the action seems to happen in a much smaller scale than the previous films, which didn't bother me. The effects for the mermaids are really great as well. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is as loud and bombastic as ever, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just wasn't different or new. Overall, although POTC4 isn't the great return to form everyone was hoping for, it's still a huge improvement over POT3. The addition of Cruz is also a huge plus and seeing her and Depp's interplay is pretty great. If you wanna have a fun time at the theater, you can do a lot worse. Also, wait until the scene after the end credits if you want to see the inevitable open ending to POTC5. 6.5/10"

","If in 2007 Pirates of the Caribbean 'At Worlds End' left you at your 'wits end', then it's understandable that you may have reservations about seeing the fourth instalment of this hugely popular franchise.<br/><br/>The aptly named 'On Stranger Tides' certainly is in uncharted waters, as this chapter is the first Pirate movie not to star Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley and the first not to be Directed by Gore Verbinski also known for directing such films as 'The Ring' and more recently; 'Rango'.<br/><br/>The film starts with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in London on a mission to save the always entertaining Gibbs (Kevin McNally) from an appointment with the gallows. Whilst there Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), who ends up trapping him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, ship of the most feared pirate 'Blackbeard' (Ian McShane) on a quest to locate the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the notorious Blackbeard is very badly portrayed by McShane with no real terror brought to the character like the previous Davy Jones; and with a 'mystic' zombie sidekick that is as pointless to the movie as the witch in Robin Hood – Prince of Thieves; the film should really be walking the plank very early on.<br/><br/>However, thanks to the star performer Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie is surprisingly good. Sure the movie doesn't have the best plot compared to the first two movies, but with the introduction of Penelope Cruz as the beautiful Angelica; Sam Claflin as Philip the hunky clergyman; and Stephen Graham providing the comedy effect as Scrum; this movie will have audiences won over.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly one for all the family, and having just reached a staggering $256 million in its opening week, this franchise will probably return to continue another trilogy."

","In London, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escapes from the soldiers that are chasing him and learns that an impostor is recruiting a crew and a vessel using his name. He meets the impersonator and finds that she actually is Angelica (Penélope Cruz), a woman that he had seduced in a convent in Seville. Jack is abducted and when he awakes aboard, the ship is sailing, Angelica tells him that her father, the pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), is cursed and he needs to find the legendary Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth to save his life. They force Jack, who knows the location of the fountain, to guide them. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is hired by King George to lead the British crew and dispute against the Spaniards and Blackbeard who arrives first in the fountain. But along their dangerous quest, they need to find first two chalices that belonged to Ponce de Leon and a tear of mermaid. <br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a disappointed adventure of a washed up franchise. I have just watched this film with my wife and son on DVD and we three had taken naps along the 136 minutes running time. The film has good cast but without Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom; top-notch special effects but the problem is the boring and weak story. I hope the producers have the decency to stop this franchise.

I have not watched a lot of 3D movies, but this is easily the best I have seen. Instead of the layered 2D effects that they call 3D, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" has real 3D that gives you the feeling that you really are there at the scene, watching events unfold.<br/><br/>The plot is easily understandable, straightforward but very engaging. It's more action and adventure this time than previous instalments. It's also more funny, even adult humour finds its way into this Disney production (involving a comment on the viewpoint of a missionary). The mermaids are visually stunning, and I really thought the first mermaid is Amanda Seyfried, but it's a woman called Gemma Ward.<br/><br/>Of course, the ending paves way for a sequel.

","From the first 10 minutes you knew it was utter junk. A series of random actions which are poorly scripted with sub-standard humor and Jack at his worst. Part 1 was banging with action, and so was part 2. Part 3 started to meander into a plot so complex and unrewarding that it lost the viewer.<br/><br/>Good films are anchored in good objectives. i.e. What is the major objective of the antagonist. (Jack) what does he want. And this was very unresolved even 40 minutes into the film. But you keep bring up the old news - he doesn't have a ship. And over and over again the same tricks but poorly executed. The same capture and escape. Try something new. What worked for part 1 and 2 was because they were new. It is part 4 now, we want to see something different. And in both 1 and 2 the objectives and the mission was tight sequence after sequence, joke after joke. <br/><br/>Jack seems tired and less bouncy in 4, why? Maybe because the script is so weak and the objectives so forced. And even in fiction you need realism within the boundaries of the world the script makers cast. You cant just have people show up unexplained , undeveloped. Did the film truly explain the cast and their passion? No. Keira and Orlando made a very good choice to stay away - so should the audience. Had it been so good you would see them.

","Ok lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think ""Indiana Jones"", ""National Treasures"" like adventures (hell even ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.<br/><br/>There's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the vicious teasers they are.<br/><br/>Production is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Penélope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10"

","No devils, ghosts, or Davy Jones locker stuff to cheapen it. There are mermaids (which are awesome) and a better portion of the movie is somewhat realistic compared to the others. Sparrow isn't as funny... still is, but just not as. But that's okay because at least he's not drunk or completely useless like in one of the other movies. He has a role in the movie that MATTERS, and isn't just a stage prop. The story actually revolves around him (finally). Some may think it's a bad idea to make him star... but I think it's pretty fair. After all, for who else do we watch Pirates of the Caribbean?"

","Okay so from the beginning of the Pirates of the Caribbean showcase it seems that each film has slowly stepped down the ratings ladder everywhere. On Stranger Tides (2011), the 4th installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and sadly to say it's about the worst of them all. It seems that the movie tried to bring on too many new stars into the cast, and try to extend a story on the new characters that didn't seem to fit. I'm not saying this movie was bad, it just wasn't as good as the first 3 films. This film tends to be more in the mode of ""lets go over the top we will make enough money"" thought process versus ""lets make a great movie"". The action in ""On Stranger Tides"" is equivalent, the story-line is a bit ""oh well"", and not having Keira Knightley............. Well being that they brought in another female to be the star showcase that had the over loaded script and headshot scenes, sadly this didn't work out as well as they had hoped. This movie is a fairly good film, but I believe it let down the fans."

","Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Penelope Cruz as actors, Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott as screenwriters, Hans Zimmer as a composer, a book that is said to be totally okay as a base - what can go wrong in a movie like this? Well... everything. There was not a single moment at which I really connected with either the story or any of the characters. While I went out of ""At world's end"" after three hours feeling like it had been at most one and a half, I started looking at my watch twenty minutes into this movie, thinking ""When will this get really started?"" <br/><br/>This film was clearly aimed at a younger audience than the previous ones, and so were most of the jokes. All in all there's a definite feeling of having seen it all before, with a predictable plot and soulless acting. What hurt only a little in comparison to everything else: the secret heroine of the previous movies, the Black Pearl, almost didn't appear at all.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed by the music. Well, Hans Zimmer is always above average, but there's nothing new at all to this score, unlike in parts 2 and 3 that got new themes each.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you liked the previous films, stick to Gore Verbinski rather than the Pirates of the Caribbean. It seems to be only about the money now."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is now officially a tetralogy joining the ranks of Rambo, Dennis the Menace, Scream, and Indiana Jones. Much like Indiana Jones or any other movieseries that overstays its welcome, Pirates began to wear thin with me after the second installment. Slapped together plots with phoned in performances really ruined what could have been a simple, enjoyable series of films. I'm no fan of Bruckheimer, since he's been recently ruining every good thing ever thought up, but there seem to be bigger forces at work in this particular set of movies.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides is a complete reboot of the series – a few familiar faces, but really the original trilogy is a distant memory. While I am not the least bit sorry to see the old characters jettisoned, writers don't even pretend to explain Jack Sparrow's supposed ties to the Black Pearl and being out to sea for 10 years at a time in relation to the current storyline. What is it, 15 years in the future or so? They simply introduce new characters and do that annoying Star Wars: Episode 2 thing humorously reminiscing on scenes we will never have the displeasure of experiencing. Classic insult to the audience. I'd prefer a hazy, washed-out flashback, thankyouverymuch.<br/><br/>All that complaining aside, I rather enjoyed the film. It definitely did not leave anything for the audience to figure out and seemed to make up its own rules along the way (yeah, that's right, you need a mermaid tear, 2 goats, and a willing man and the fountain will give you 6 delicious plums that when baked into a flan will create a meal that will take 10 years off of your life. Also, you need a magic entrance to the fountain, but you can just walk on out of that thing through conventional means), but who cares. This series never pretended to be anything but popcorn shoveling fun. I just gagged a little bit admitting that.<br/><br/>Despite the CONSTANT chatter of the teenage population of Falmouth, Maine just an aside based on my sampling of the restaurants, Wal-Mart, and movie theater, I believe the median age of Falmouth to be around 14. Perhaps we should be looking for the fountain of youth there Where was I?<br/><br/>Despite the CONFUSED teenagers that needed to explain the plot of the movie to each other and wonder where Penelope Cruz was in the other films, I enjoyed the movie for what it was – expensively made cheap entertainment. I wonder if they can figure out how to make production cheaper to turn this into another Blondie or Django series."

"markdroulston","4","2","2","15 June 2011"," Sinking ship
","It's a funny thing about Johnny Depp. Perhaps more so than any other contemporary actor, people often view his presence in a movie as something of a mark of quality. I know many people who will see a film simply because he is the star, and until recently I might have understood why, even if I wouldn't go quite that far myself. However, since around the time of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film (2002's The Curse of the Black Pearl), I've found myself less and less impressed, or even interested at all, in almost anything he's done. I'm always willing to give a talented actor, particularly one with as many great performances under his belt as Depp, a chance to surprise me, and win back some credibility, and it was with this mindset that I went into On Stranger Tides. Unfortunately, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the latest entry in Disney's swashbuckling franchise is by far the worst yet, and my personal admiration for Johnny Depp has reached a new low.<br/><br/>There's no denying that the success of the first POTC film came as something of a shock to many people, both critically and commercially. Before it's release, the idea of adapting a theme-park ride to film was seen as a creative death knell by an admittedly cynical part of the movie-going public (myself included), but the film defied critics to become one of the more memorable action-adventure blockbusters of the new millennium, and introduced Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, one of modern cinema's most charming and appealing characters. On Stranger Tides works hard from the beginning to maintain the style and tone of the initial trilogy (all directed by Gore Verbinski), while simultaneously making it clear that this is a new story, albeit with a handful returning characters. The problem however, is that the new story is just too overloaded with new characters, vacuous action, and unnecessary, tedious subplots.<br/><br/>It's very hard to gauge Captain Jack's motives in this film. He swings wildly between the selfish yet lovable rogue from the earlier stories, to a newly considerate and almost emotional hero which doesn't seem to fit at all. Jack was always the best element of the POTC franchise, and the unfortunate use of his character harms the movie irreparably. Geoffrey Rush returns also as Barbossa, alongside new characters Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and Blackbeard (Ian McShane), all talented actors who do their best with the poorly written dialogue, with McShane in particular standing out as a worthwhile addition to the cast. And then, there's newcomers Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as the missionary Philip and mermaid Syrena. Where do I start with these two..<br/><br/>I guess there's a feeling in Hollywood that every story needs a romantic element to reach a wider audience, and indeed Verbinski's POTC films had the Will Turner/Elizabeth Swann thread successfully placed at the forefront of the narrative. Regrettably, new director Rob Marshall's (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) attempt to replace Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley with these new young lovers is On Stranger Tides' greatest flaw, and any time attention is paid to their story, what little amount of fun and humour the film has is sucked completely away. The story progression grinds to a halt as we're subjected to this highly implausible and somewhat disturbing (beastiality anyone?) romantic plot between two characters who have no significant ties to Captain Jack, only one of which has any purpose in the movie at all. It's all simply a ploy to appeal to the mythical 'four quadrant' audience, and in this case it is unforgivable.<br/><br/>That this movie will go on to make huge profits for Disney I have no doubt, and while there is a somewhat ambiguous ending in terms of further sequel prospects, I find it hard to believe that they will make the smart choice and retire Captain Jack and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise before further damage is done. This film is of such low quality that it has actually changed how I feel about the series as a whole, and the first film in particular (which I previously loved), but the most unfortunate casualty for me is Depp's reputation. Hopefully he'll think twice before applying the makeup and donning the dreadlocks again, and abandon this sinking ship."

","Basically most things I thought would be good about this movie were wrong. I had not planned on this being as good as the first, which I still think, but I had counted on Johnny Depp to carry the show. I hate to admit it but I think he really did nowhere near his best. All his jokes and mannerisms seemed severely overused and halfway through the film I honestly was tired of him, but to his credit he did keep it going through some dry points.<br/><br/>I also wasn't thrilled that there was going to be mermaids and another love story at first but I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought Sam Claffin was very good in his role as the missionary and so was Astrid Berges-Frisbey was brilliant in her role. These two had great chemistry and as the movie progressed I started caring more about their story than that of Jack and Blackbeard.<br/><br/>On the subject of Blackbeard, I was very disappointed and thought he was a very mediocre villain. Nothing about his story matched with legend and he somehow had unexplained mystical voodoo and control over strange ropes and could ""zombify"" his crew. His ""daughther"" Penelope Cruz was a bit underwhelming but she still did a decent job. <br/><br/>On a positive note I really like Geoffrey Rush, like always.<br/><br/>All in all, go see it. Don't take this review for anything if you don't agree and if you love the movie that's great for you. Just an honest opinion of the film."
"ArArArchStanton","6","2","2","29 May 2011"," Good! But it felt like we skipped a film?
","It did feel like Stanger Tides was actually part 5, and we skipped over part 4.<br/><br/>First off, I'll say the film was solid. The mermaid sequences were stunning, Blackbeard was stellar in every way, and I loved the twist ending with the surprise motivation of the Spanish.<br/><br/>But as for the rushed feeling, for one, there are a number of things we are just told to accept from the beginning of the film such as Barbossa having the peg leg and being in the British service,,,,, OK,,, perhaps not that big of a deal, but what about this, Cruz's character has come to accept Black Beard as her father. Fair enough, but wouldn't that have been much more powerful if we had gotten to know each character first and then in a ""Luke I am your father"" moment seen her learn that he was in fact her father. Instead, we're just told that she's learned this and any build up to the discovery is hacked off at the knees.<br/><br/>But more importantly perhaps was the lack of character development in some areas. Most specifically with our new priest. Why was he there again? It's not really clear. And for the love story between he and the mermaid, which was in effect taking the place of the displaced couple of previous films, the pair felt extremely underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Likewise was the back story of Cruz and Depp. I mean it was there, they did mention it, but it just didn't really resonate as significant.<br/><br/>NOW, those two issues can be resolved by a future film, and should a 5th film bulk up the characters of Cruz & the priest and their motivations and/or relationship with Depp, then this film will grow stronger in retrospect, but as it stands now, it just felt like either they were underdeveloped, or that their back story deserved more than an ""oh by the way"" and perhaps should have been explored previously, before embarking on this story itself."

","""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series has now elevated itself into rarefied company where the story itself is of lesser importance than the star turn and adherence to the conventions which the story embodies. It has become a Piratical James Bond. ""On Stranger Tides"" proves to be an enjoyable and entertaining instalment in this series without ever troubling classic status.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow and without Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley the focus is even more upon him this time. Neither of the latter two are missed, Penelope Cruz is an excellent new love interest as Angelica Malon, the only criticism is that we do not see enough of her, in both senses of the phrase. Her pregnancy during filming probably explains this.<br/><br/>The opening 15 minutes in London is by far the strongest sequence as Captain jack impersonates a Judge, is arrested himself, inevitably escapes and then tries to round up a crew and a ship to search for the Fountain of Eternal Youth. Richard Griffiths plays a wonderfully louche King George, and when Jack encounters his Dad, Captain Teague played by Keith Richards in an Inn, you are just begging one or the other to pick up a mandolin from one of the musicians! Geoffrey Rush has a rewarding part as Barbossa gone straight with a letter of Marque from the King, Ian McShane is a little reserved as Blackbeard. The CGI sequences are used more sparingly this time around, and the film is all the better for it, a ""mermaid attack"" being the highlight. Directed by Rob Marshall of ""nine"" fame this is the first instalment not directed by Gore Verbinski, and he acquits himself well.The climax, the race for the Fountain of Youth, is for me a bit of an anti-climax and lacks dramatic tension, and the running time at 2hr 20min is a little long, but Depp's performance keeps things alive and leaves us wanting more – as if there won't be!"
"shoobhayan","5","2","2","25 May 2011"," a disappointing end to a grande saga
","First things, first : the fourth installment of the epic Pirates of the Caribbean saga, was never meant to be one. The original story concluded, fair and square with At World's End, in 2007; but for Johnny Depp, the titular Captain Jack Sparrow, who wanted one last hurrah before it all ended.<br/><br/>And to be honest, the saga could have done without this. For one, Pirates was at its best where it ended : as a trilogy. What Rob Marshall has done is add a piece of camphor to the butt of a glowing cigarette, hoping that it will light up. Instead, it has turned out to be wet patch.<br/><br/>So with this movie, we find our beloved Jack Sparrow in the middle of London, searching for an impostor who has been impersonating him. A lot of swashbuckling heroics follow. He saves his erstwhile first mate Joshamee Gibbs from being hanged. While escaping he is captured by King George II 's men. The king has a conversation with him wherein he is asked to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth, headed by his former arch-rival Captain Hector Barbossa. He comes to know that the Spanish have already set sail in pursuit of the Fountain. Sparrow jeopardizes the conversation and escapes, only to meet his father Captain Teague who warns him about the Fountain's tests. Here, after a brief sword fight, the impostor is revealed and it turns out to be Sparrow's former lover, Angelica (Penélope Cruz), the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard. Following Angelica's ploy, Jack finds himself aboard Blackbeard's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, and after a failed attempt to mutiny, Jack is forced into Blackbeard's crew. And as it turns out, Blackbeard too, is headed for the Fountain. While en route, Angelica tells Jack how, in order to be effective, the Fountain's water must be drunk from chalices belonging to one Juan de León, one of which one must contain a tear drop of a mermaid. Legend had it, that the person who drinks from the chalice with the mermaid tear would absorb the remaining years of the person drinking from the other chalice.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gibbs, who had had Jack's map showing the path to the Fountain is taken captive by the king's men. As a desperate last resort to save himself, he memorizes the map before burning it in front of them. He is thus asked to guide them, and a race ensues.<br/><br/>What happens thereafter is nothing more than routine drama. Sparrow gets into brawls. A lot of sparks fly. Mermaids come in.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, I must elaborate on this.<br/><br/>Mermaids. Beautiful half human-female-form, half fish-form beings. Their depiction was throughly brilliant. Their attack on Blackbeard's men at Whitecap Bay was portrayed very well indeed, and it was possibly one of the few good heart-in-your-mouth scenes in the movie. The captured mermaid and later, her chemistry with the captive missionary, Phillip Swift formed an essential part in whatever little story there was.<br/><br/>All in all, not the kind of movie one would expect, to follow up on such a saga as Pirates. It certainly does not take your mind out for a ride, but then again, none of the Pirates ever did that. The question is, does it do what was expected of it? Was it the visual treat that PoTC has been synonymous with? Was it the surreal extravaganza that Gore Verbisnky had started out with, in The Curse of the Black Pearl?<br/><br/>Clearly, no. It only does, but half live up to the expectations that an ardent Pirates fan would harbor. Which is what happens when you do something that Marshall so incongruously did. Obliterate two protagonists entirely (did anybody else miss Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann?), take an unrelated and an underrated story, and try to chip it into a chronicle as grand as Pirates, and call it the Grand Finale.<br/><br/>So should you watch the movie? If A, you are a Pirates fan, then you would watch anyways. If B, you are not, and are hesitant on watching it because you haven't seen the earlier ones, then do. Because the story is almost completely unrelated to the first three movies. If C, you are just looking for a good movie to watch, I would half suggest this one. Not fully.<br/><br/>And if you do choose to watch, do not miss Jack Sparrow's dialogs and retorts. They are as witty, as snide, and as epic as ever. Also, do not miss the post-credits scenes. That is one and the only scene that actually makes you think.<br/><br/>For what it was, Pirates of the Caribbean IV : On Stranger Tides was only a swan's song. It was a graceful swan while it lived. But it sure died a very sad death."

","I'm a huge fan of Capt. Jack Sparrow and the Pirates Franchise. I saw the film today and must say I'm utterly disappointed with the storyline. First of all why the hell the Spanish people were there? Just to crush the Chalice in the end? its like nothing was suiting then lets introduce the Spanish. Then where's the enchanting crew of beloved sparrow. There's unwanted fighting sequences and unwanted cameos. It takes one fourth of the movie to finally put jacky on the stranger tides. Its like the script have been written by whole new writer whose doesn't know the very essence of pirates. Also there's no need of the mermaid love story although mermaid fighting scenes were very engrossing....<br/><br/>But none the less there were some upbeats too. Like ever gorgeous and enchanting Jack Sparrow(there must be Capt. in there somewhere). The performances from Rush, cruise and Mcshane were brilliant. The mermaids were beautiful and freaky too. I miss the black pearl but can sustain the fact that it wasn't required in the movie(the second part gonna be on this i guess). The freaky awesome crew of black pearl must return.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fairly decent film in terms of expectations. It met all my expectations from previous films and even exceeded them compared to POTC3.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple in the fact that it is made clear from the beginning where the story has to go. There are a few twists and deal changes which adds a little more depth to the story of the overall story arc. The special effects are often very good but in parts look a little cheap (the swords for one). I am not sure if this is just for the 3D aspect of the movie or if it will look the same in 2D.<br/><br/>The 3D is very heavy and intense at times in this movie and therefore can hinder the viewing at times because often characters would appear in the foreground and look blurry compared to those in the background of the shots.<br/><br/>Another thing which also did surprise me was the unnecessary use of sexual innuendos and moments which were quite surprising for a Disney film. Having said that it worked 9 times out of 10 and made the whole audience laugh.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are a fan of the POTC franchise then you will enjoy this because it is far better than the previous installment but does not quite top POTC2 in the opinion. The new characters are a breath of fresh air although I would have like to have seen more new characters throughout to keep the story from going stale which at times I felt it did.<br/><br/>Hopefully they will add more characters when the next film is released as I am sure there will be another.<br/><br/>8/10"
"theycallmemrglass","6","25","57","12 May 2011"," Jack Sparrow is back...but On Duller Tides I'm Afraid
","Just came back from a preview screening in London.<br/><br/>I love the first 2 movies, and I even like the overly ambitious messy third one. I thought this film will try go back to the more witty grass roots that made the first film so enjoyable. Well the story is not as incoherent as the last 2 films but sadly, it is mostly unexciting, dull and pointless. The dialogue lacks the wit of previous entries and the narrative lacked focus. There were sparks of fun here and there but these moments are all too few. It all seemed too trying and stale. The supporting characters were even more dull, apart from Shane's Blackbeard. The action scenes were uninspiring but for some flashes of invention.<br/><br/>Depp's Jack Sparrow has lost some magic but still maintains the spirit of the character that we love and is really the only thing that saves this movie.<br/><br/>One more thing, this movie is darkly lit most of the time, so I strongly advise you not to see this in 3D. It made my experience of watching the movie even worse as it darkens the visuals further, robbing us of what I suspect to be some fine visuals. Furthermore, the action scenes become blurred. It felt like I was watching a really bad pirate video. So this is what cinema has succumbed to? What a painful death for my number one destination for escapism.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, the atrocious 3D may have made me more cynical. Had I seen this in its 2D form, I might have enjoyed it more all round. So please consider watching in 2D so you are not put into a more cynical mood. I will watch it again in 2D and add a post edit to this review."
"Samiam3","4","14","29","20 May 2011"," Cutthroat Island 2
","Thar be a treasure in store for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and it be the Golden Raspberry.<br/><br/>After four entries, Sadly Pirates has lost its soul. This film may as well be marketed as Cutthroat Island 2. This is not THE Pirates of the Caribbean, it's just a pirate movie with no magic or charm. Convoluted as the second and third entries were, at least they had a sense of adventure, journey and spectacle. On Stranger Tides has none of the above. It is a scrappy walk in the park of a story, with bad plotting, poor cinematography, lazy acting, and it's over with so fast that it all feels pointless. In fact, I'd say it comes close to a rip-off. <br/><br/>It is bad enough that there is no life to anyone in the supporting cast, but with Jack Sparrow, it is unacceptable. He's lost his persona and his zing completely, and his box of mannerisms alone does not make him a chartacter. I was also disappointed with Ian McShane. Having turned in what may be the best dramatic performance in television (Deadwood) It hurts a little to see how useless his portrayal of Blackbeard is. In fairness, he wasn't given a whole lot to work with. <br/><br/>More than the actors, I blame the script. The once talented duo of screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio haven't even bothered to write anyone a part for this movie. Not only that but the dialogue is sloppy, full of needless exposition which doesn't end up explaining much.<br/><br/>Even as a source of mindless thrills and chills, On Stranger Tides is weak. The only time when it comes close to matching the scale of its predecessors is in one scene, which sets pirates against killer mermaids. I remember thinking to myself during that sequence, how much Disney has changed in twenty years. It would have been nice to see the cast of the Little Mermaid show up to do a song number, and considering Rob Marshall's skill with music, it might have helped the movie.<br/><br/>He is clearly in no position to direct this movie. He too is unable to bring much to the film, and I have a feeling he doesn't know what he's doing with 3-D photography either. Even in regular 2D, the film is quite dark, and grotesque. 3-D would be unwatchable I figure.<br/><br/>The movie ends in the style of setting up for another entry, which I now have little faith in. Pirates of the Caribbean, has become little more than an amateurish cash-grab."

The movie is about two hours long. In the middle of the movie, I was so bored I almost started surfing the internet on my cell phone. There just wasn't enough of a storyline to hold my attention. I missed Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Their absence is definitely felt. But Penelope Cruz was a nice addition to the cast. She's funny and adds personality to the movie. Aside from her, there weren't very many redeeming qualities.

"fcb-cruyff-9","1","5","8","6 June 2011"," not impressive
","This is a good movie, but some films just don't convince the audience and don't leave a mark in film history, I think they should have stopped at the third POC movie or let gore verbinski direct this 4th movie, with his special techniques that gave me a good view in the 1st trilogy, I like the idea of introducing mermaids and barbossa having a wooden leg which obviously contributes a lot to pirate films. The zombies could have worked out well but unfortunately they weren't displayed in a convincing way as we didn't learn much about them and I felt it was just a copy of Davy Jones and his crew but in a lame way...black beard was a great add 2 the series but its weird how they just suddenly added him as a ""pirate all pirates fear"" well where the heck was he when Davy Jones and Barbossa were considered lords of ocean? and angelica is a disappointment, her character was added to waste time and add more to the movie... Also Syrena and Sam were a fail at creating a replacement for will and Elizabeth, but if a 5th movie comes out, Sam and syrena will probably have stronger contribution to the movie...POC4 was a sort of rush, this movie seemed to have been made just to earn money, it was an obvious copy of the 1st movie (curse of black pearl), it was a quest to find something that brings u back to life as it was the same plot used by the Aztec treasure that removes the curse, and most the sword fights were very similar.. and black beard was a way to reprise Davy Jones' character...I also think its a little stupid how the Spaniards went looking for the fountain and then they stated that ""its not the fountain that gives u youth, youth comes from God,"" well then why the hell did u bother going to the fountain?. Another stupid thing is how the whole crew went to drink from the fountain to get youth and at the end only black beard and angelica drank from it, and one of them had 2 sacrifice..but overall this movie is good for entertainment, but if your a fan of the 1st trilogy I don't think you will like this 1...I really don't see why its called on stranger tides anyway, I know its a novel, but the name of the movie should have been ""pirates of the Caribbean: the fountain of youth"""
"druss44121-1","2","8","15","20 May 2011"," The worst Pirates film yet, truly awful
","So you know where I stand, I loved Pirates 1. It was ""fun"", it was epic, it was clever and funny. It might have had some pacing problems, but it's still the epitome of what an action/adventure should be - and it's still fun to watch 8 years later.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I thought Pirates 2 was epic. I actually think it's quite a bit underrated, and though it has about 20 minutes where it loses focus, otherwise it keeps taking you somewhere new. The cannibal island wasn't at all a waste either, it re-united all the characters and was a fun sequence. I thought it rivaled the first, and overall wasn't quite as clever as #1 but it was even bigger in scope. To me Pirates 2 is what a summer blockbuster should be.<br/><br/>Pirates 3, however, I thought was terrible, and almost unwatchable, though it had moments of brilliance, namely the ""at world's end"" scenes. I've only seen it twice, and will likely never watch it again in my life.<br/><br/>So here we are at Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. I wasn't expecting brilliance, but I was hoping for a fun summer pirates adventure. Something along the lines of the first, maybe not quite as clever, but still good fun.<br/><br/>Instead I got a laborious, muddy film with little joy or cleverness. It was a chore to sit through, much as I felt about At World's End, but unlike that film this one doesn't even have the occasional moments of brilliance (like the ""world's end"" scenes in 3 which were very zany and unique; here, you never really see any stranger tides).<br/><br/>What's worst is there's some cool ideas here. The ships in the bottles, Blackbeard, Barbossa working for the king, the whole idea of a ""race"" for the fountain of youth, hell, the FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. So many cool things and none of them go anywhere. There are no real characters or character arcs. Nothing happens with anyone, nobody ""changes"" or goes on a journey of any sort of their own.<br/><br/>I know character development might not have been the strong suit of the earlier films, but usually there were the basics, especially in the first: you knew what people wanted, and why, and understood why they were doing what they were doing to get it. And the character's had their own personalities, and were unique from one another.<br/><br/>But most of all this film just wasn't fun. There were very few clever or quotable lines. It was the smallest in scale of all 4 films, and the set pieces besides the mermaid attack were all underwhelming and occasionally even boring. The mermaid attack was cool, but there was some shoddy CGI and they never really went anywhere with it. You never really get the sense that it's a ""race"" for the fountain of youth, and the script could have done a lot more with its premise.<br/><br/>For starters, I'd say lose Barbossa, have Cruz be with the Spanish, but still the daughter of Blackbeard, and have it be a 3-way race between her, Jack and Blackbeard. Make the fountain of youth sequence more than a poor rip-off of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Do something new, perhaps give Jack a more serious dilemma to face in the 2nd act that makes him more than just a clown. This film has no pulse.<br/><br/>And I don't understand how anyone could dislike Dead Man's Chest and like this. On Stranger Tides was talkie, and all the double-triple cross stuff mainly didn't come in until #3. Dead Man's Chest was an easier to follow plot than this, and the characters had more complexity and clarity than here. The production design was also a marvel. On Stranger Tides, meanwhile, rarely feels like you're in the Caribbean, and the sets stick out like a sore thumb from the location stuff.<br/><br/>3/10... it'd be lower, except I know movies like Batman & Robin exist, so I have to adjust accordingly."

","I have to be honest, though I am a huge Pirates fan..I went in with low expectations. I hoped though, that somewhere within the depths of this movie that it would pull out some old feelings..everything that I had seen in terms of production just looked like a straight grab for cash. As I watched the first scene of the film...my face sank into my hands (so THIS is the kind of movie it is)...I don't know why they had to continue the series, especially because they had rounded it off so well. I mean, sure they could have continued it, the ending was set up that way. But the writers had obviously changed, it had a lack of depth..and the main character, the selling point of this convoluted attempt at a sequel..Had completely changed. Jack Sparrow's charm and befuddling narrow luck has been ground out to a muddled insignificant protagonist with no soul. Watching this movie...I hoped for a pause..some easy peace that I could take for the worth of the film..I was left with more plot holes and lazy writing than I thought could be allowed passable for even a B movie. I have NEVER wanted to walk out of a movie more. I went it with no expectations...knowing that if I did that, I'd walk out with something more..I shouldn't have seen it..Because not only did it not give me anything, it took a sharp and indifferent rip out my love for the show. Pirates is great, something that I'm excited to show my children one day...But I'm not ever going to tell them that this movie was made. I think we were all hoping for something amazing. This film is for suckers."

","I watched this film at the Cinema with very high hopes- Everyone knows the 2nd and 3rd instalments weren't as good as the Black Pearl and this certainly didn't improve anything. I sat through this with complete predictability- Purely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to stagger about doing his Captain Jack- and to be honest, this holds no novelty any more. A boring storyline that no-one cares about, Penelope Cruz attempting to take over from Keira Knightly, and Geoffrey Rush having no idea who's side he was on. The magic has well and truly gone- and sadly the Pirates legacy is one of being just a cash cow for Disney. A very Tired and uninspired attempt that would certainly put you off awaiting a fifth."
"beez-69-533935","8","3","4","6 June 2011"," A fantastic new addition to the pirates franchise
","This movie is a top movie to watch this summer and I highly recommend it for Pirates of the Caribbean fans and people who just want to see a kick ass movie this summer. It is a great much anticipated addition to the pirates franchise.<br/><br/>The reasons why this is so good is it follows a more Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl feel to it, which sat better with the people and the first movie was a classic, so smart move there.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had great dialog in this movie that was funny and delightful, bringing back the same old Jack we all know and love and he still maintained everything about Jack that makes him great and he also still managed to surprise me with new sides to his character. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)is also brought back in this film and this was very good because in the film he is a great ally to Jack even though he doesn't like him too much and he and jack had great bits of funny banter and friendship at points but he also managed to be quite unpredictable and intimidating at times and also I think bringing back Barbossa brought a lot of pirate spirit back to this fourth installment. <br/><br/>The addition of new characters such as Black-beard (Ian Mcshane) and Angelica (Penelope Cruz) was also a good move as Angelica, acting as Jack's love interest and almost his equal, made it more interesting to watch because Jack has not had a love interest and nobody has really been able to outwit Jack Sparrow (sorry Captain Jack Sparrow) and Black- beard was also a great character, being very villainous and having the uncaring aspect of a villain in that he would just kill anyone and also to add he is probably the best pirate villain I have ever seen in a film in my opinion. Other new characters are brought in like Phillip and Serena the mermaid, which added quite a bit more to the film and Scrum, being a sidekick to Jack and quite funny which was cool also, so all the actors and actresses acted very well. Great Job!.<br/><br/>Another reason why the film was awesome would be the addition of new creatures like Mermaids, which where something pirates really believed in at the time and the use of zombie crewman, which is cool because all the crewman in the franchise have been some form of skeleton or creature, so that maintains some iconography and it is also good to see them in 3D.<br/><br/>Lastly the 3D, which none of the other films have had, adds unique qualities to the film and the 3D was very good considering this is a pirate film and not a sci-fi film. The 3D effects showed swords coming out at you and at one point fire coming out at you and a Monkey in a glass bottle screaming in your face which rocked. Although it wasn't like animation 3D, which is amazing, this was very understandable because this is not an animated film. The 3D brought to life the action scenes a bit more which were really adrenaline pumping, although land based and I would have loved to have seen a ship battle or battles in 3D. However overall this is a highly recommended movie for all to enjoy."
"Joel-LaFlamme","3","3","4","27 May 2011"," Another 12.50$ sent to Davy Jones locker
","These movies have been trash for 6 years now. Rob Marshall proved that a new director isn't going to fix anything. I admit there is less CG then the last 2 films but the story is terrible and the characters are just as bad. The first 40 mins is spent reintroducing the characters. For some reason Jack has lost the Black pearl, no reason is ever given. Barbosa had command but lost the ship to Black beard, who keeps it as a prize in a bottle, with 30 other ships. We wait for an hour or so for Barbosa to explain why he lost the ship and instead of an amazing flashback to show Barbosa loosing his leg we simply have to listen to a horid story to sort things out. <br/><br/>Black beard the king of the pirates has been relaxing somewhere for the last 3 movies, never brought up before not even at the pirate council in part 3. He sails another ship with ripped sails because that makes ships go fast of course.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz pretends to be Jack Sparrow and somehow every Pirate in London believes her, even though she's about 5'1, 95lbs. The whole story is about the fountain of youth, of course it's located on the same island as th first movie. It's just a few days voyage from the Caribean and there are no dangers to pass along the way. Just a few days of sailing and Barbosa, Black beard and some Spanish ass holes just find their way there. Only Barbosa has the map but that doesn't matter. They meet at this island and now have to catch a mermaid and get her to cry. Seems simple enough until Cruz says ""we need her tears fresh, mermaid tears don't keep."" This means they need ro carry the mermaid in a glass coffin filled with water. <br/><br/>Then there is a scene where a rope bridge is broken and one of them will have to jump a gorge to make it to the other side. Penelope ants to go, Jack doesn't, so Black beard puts 2 bullets in 6 guns and has Jake pick which one to fire. Black beard then takes turns firing at Cruz. What this scene proves I'm still trying to figure out. Eventually Jack does it and I don't care.<br/><br/>He climbs a huge cliff, then another just to find the ship of ""Ponts de lion"" (spelling) waiting for him aboard the ship is barbosa, who has one leg, but somehow found his way up 2 cliff faces to get aboard this ship. <br/><br/>They mess about for a few mins while the ship teeters on the edge of the cliff. The scene ends without the ship falling, maybe the first time in history where they forgot to pay off the set piece. It's a teetering ship on a cliff, hmm what should we do with it? I've got an idea, how about nothing?<br/><br/>They get to the magic place, Jack says the magic words and a water elevator appears on the roof of a cave. Everyone take the elevator the the fountain of youth department, only to have the Spanish come and wreck everything because the temple is offensive to god. They smash everything then hit the road, never to be heard from again.<br/><br/>Jack saves Penelope and black beard dies and I don't care. <br/><br/>3 big Indiana Jones rips offs, Jack and Cruz meeting is a ripoff of raiders when Indiana meets Marion ravenwood. She was a young innocent girl when the 2 met in the past. Bu Indana wronged her. When they meet again they hate each other but you know that romance is going to build.<br/><br/>Voodoo doll from Temple of doom, this was so obvious it almost hurt.<br/><br/>The entire story was about a magic cup and the magic water that gives you eternal life, at the end of the movie, Black beard drinks from the wrong cups and he dies the same way as the bad guy in last crusade, evaporates into a skeleton.<br/><br/>This movie is just as bad as the last 2. I'm done, no part 5 for me. I've learnt my lesson.<br/><br/>Not one cannon ball is fired, no ships do battle. The movie cost 250 million and they don't fire a cannon ball."

","This is not Gore Verbiski's movie anymore, but I was very surprised to find out that the same writers of the previous parts wrote this pile of crap. To summarize, this is a collection of clichés, thin jokes and too clean pirates. Captain Jack is Captain Jack, but, yes, cleaner and much less inspired. Associating him with a forgotten love (Penelope Cruz), which is sassy and untamed, is a huge cliché. The plot, as a new adventure without any relation with previous stories but a map, is very poor crafted. The action sequences are just unreal, especially the escape from the court of King George. Everything feels artificial and crafted on commission. It's really an irony that this movie had the highest profits from the series. It shows that the public is really stupid or was unaware of how bad this is. Which is not an excuse, because I had the feeling this is going to be very bad from the first trailer I've saw( I watched the movie on HBO). Bad, bad, bad, worst corporate money making fast food type of a movie."
"I-am-Shellfish","2","6","11","24 May 2011"," A leap of faith cruelly abused
","When previews for the latest Pirates movies started showing in theaters, I noticed a general rumble around me and on at least three occasions heard someone comment to a fellow, ""Really? Again?"" For a long time I boycotted the sequels to the original Pirates, but I finally watched them and they weren't THAT bad. So with this one, I thought I'd give it a go.<br/><br/>Not awful, but certainly not up to the Pirates standard.<br/><br/>There were so many things about the first Pirates movie that made it spectacular. The music was exciting, the writing was subtle and effective, the humor was 100% on point and the action was new and entertaining. As the 'trilogy' went on, some of those things dwindled, but there was always intelligent writing (even if it did get convoluted at points) and there was a sense of the magnificent in them that I always really enjoyed.<br/><br/>The fourth Pirates did not manage to tap any of these great wells. The music was tired and in the background. At one point, early in the film, we get a rehash of the original score which livened things up for a good six seconds before the score just... stopped (apparently Jack is losing his finesse).<br/><br/>The writing that made the first movie so enjoyable is almost nonexistent here and it really hurts the development of new characters. Blackbeard, the replacement villain, is underwritten, under-motivated, and his 'powers' are unexplained. In the first movies at least when something out of the ordinary happened, it had SOME explanation! Cruz's character is a weak replacement of Elizabeth, who managed to have a strong background and base character that evolved over the course of the movie. We don't know where Cruz's character is from, what she would be doing on a day-to-day basis if this 'quest' weren't underway. We don't find anything out about her at all except ambiguous hints at a past with Jack. It's boring. Will Turner's replacement is a good looking religious-type who stands up against Blackbeard's brutality... with no real consequences. In the original there was a sense of danger for Will when he stood against Barbossa to save his lady fair. You actually *believed* Barbossa would kill him, or make Elizabeth walk the plank. In this, there is just no palpable danger.<br/><br/>Humor? Very little.<br/><br/>Action! I'm not usually critical of action sequences, but there was one fight scene in this film, taking up three to four minutes, that actually had me bored because it was almost a step-for-step rehash of the fight scene between Jack and Will Turner in the blacksmith's. Really?! The action in this film wasn't new or exciting or smooth. It was just... boring. Someone else described Jack's escapes as 'going from James Bond to Austin Powers' and I couldn't agree more. Jack doesn't really seem able to control his own destiny in this movie, more of a sufferer of others' will than an agent of his own and that's just sad.<br/><br/>The sense of the magnificent is totally absent in this movie. That may relieve some people who found an expanding goddess exploding into crabs or a ship-battle amidst a maelstrom too far, but it really detracts from the feel of the movie. It's not that incredible things don't happen... they just don't *feel* incredible. The mermaid scene, for example, would have been haunting in a previous film. For this one, it just seemed boring. (Possible spoiler, but nothing that affects the plot) There was a completely idiotic moment where Jack and Barbossa are trying to balance their weight in Ponce De Leon's ship (which looks as if it has somehow become embedded in the side of a cliff well above sea level... again, explanation writers?), but then you realize they're in the captain's quarters at one end of the ship and it wouldn't be teetering that way even if it wasn't already established that it's BURIED in a cliff! The whole movie was atmoshperically gloomy. There was no sunshine, no Caribbean blue waters, nothing to really excite the eye. No danger, no real excitement, no wonder. Just... unremarkable in every way. I really blame the writers for the majority of this failure, but the director had fault in some areas too. Put some heart into your work, people."
"Eternality","7","8","16","22 May 2011"," On Stranger Tides is one of those Hollywood movies that is not exactly bad, neither is it something that warrants a second look.
","Rob Marshall, the director of Memoirs of a Geisha (2005), Nine (2009), and most famously, the Oscar-winning Chicago (2002), takes over the directorial duties of Gore Verbinski in this fourth installment of the wildly popular Pirates of the Caribbean series. Some of the principle cast return with the addition of a new face, that of sultry Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, in this ""more of the same"" picture that will please fans who seek familiarity, but frustrate those who think that enough is enough.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides, as it is titled, follows Johnny Depp who reprises his colorful role as Jack Sparrow on a journey to find the mythical fountain of youth. Not surprisingly, a host of other characters, namely Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and villain Blackbeard (Ian McShane) are also after its magical healing powers. The adventure also sees Jack hooking up with old flame Angelica (Cruz) again as he becomes a pawn in a not so elaborate game to see who reaches the fountain of youth first.<br/><br/>Slavishly sticking to the style and conventions of its prequels, On Stranger Tides is no breakthrough despite the change of director. For a start though, Marshall's film is a full half-hour shorter than its direct prequel At World's End (2007), and this works in favor of the attempt to sustain the viewer's interest while still retaining the sense of epicness associated with the series, which more or less is due in part to Hans Zimmer's rousing score.<br/><br/>The action sequences are ordinary and not as exciting as expected, though a key act past the hour mark involving mermaids is at the very least interesting. The notion that mermaids are pretty girls with scales and fish tails who live under the sea is debunked in this film. Here they are seductive versions of human piranhas, desperate to lure men to their doom. One of them, named Syrena, is captured by Blackbeard's men because of a plot device, but is saved by a priest called Philip. Their relationship is surprisingly touching and well-developed despite it being a minor ""romantic"" subplot.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides is an above average summer blockbuster that is still watchable. Depp, as always, pulls us into the picture with a consistently hypnotic performance, though it must be said that the chemistry between him and Cruz is less sizzling than we would like it to be. The decision to offload key but tiresome characters from the prequels as played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley gives the franchise a much needed facelift. In a nutshell, On Stranger Tides is one of those Hollywood movies that is not exactly bad, neither is it something that warrants a second look.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."
"Thomasamills","3","9","19","18 May 2011"," Not Even Johnny Depp Could Save The Film From Sinking
","I remember when I first saw Pirates of the CarIbbean. I loved it. It was silly, but at the same time loads of fun from start to finish. I, like many fans of Curse of the Black Pearl highly anticipated the sequels. Again, like the first film I enjoyed them. Wonderful popcorn fun, full of funny characters and entertaining set pieces. Then the films ended and I was pleased with what I saw. Did we really need a fourth film? <br/><br/>On Stranger Tides reunites us with the crowd pleasing Jack Sparrow, portrayed by non other then Johnny Depp. But where is Orlando Bloom? What has happened to Keira Knightly? No need to worry pirate fans, the writers have given us a Orlando Bloom look a like who is a preacher. He will fall in love with a mermaid. Problem solved? Well, not really. Although the other three films where the Johnny Depp show, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were still part of it and are missed in this instalment. However, Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa and Kevin McNally returns as Gibbs. But these characters returning doesn't add anything to the film at all. Not even the talents of Penelope Cruz or Stephan Graham help, and Ian McShanes Blackbeard is such a boring villain. I couldn't help but appreciate the inventiveness of Davy Jones in the previous two instalments whilst watching him on screen.<br/><br/>The film hasn't got a plot or a point to it either. Different groups of characters are looking for the fountain of youth for different reasons. A bunch of stuff happens along the way and thats it. No, seriously, thats it. It's a film in which stuff is happening, but nothing actually happens. Although it can be argued that the same happened in the other three films, at least they were fun. This film is dull, tedious and very boring.<br/><br/>Rob Marshall, the director has given nothing new or exciting to the franchise. Its Johnny Depp doing Jack Sparrow for over two hours. Which was fine before, but this time I found myself becoming annoyed at the character. I think Johnny Depp gives a good performance, but after waiting all these years for a sequel to see him do the same thing, but only not as good or funny is just one huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the film, I was just so disappointed. There is no fun to be had in this dreary film at all. All you do is watch things happen, watch people talk, then things happen again, then people talk again, then things happen again and it just doesn't end. On Stranger Tides is lifeless, unexciting, tiresome and pointless. Captain Jack, enoughs enough. Lets just call it a day."

"chakflying","8","6","12","19 May 2011"," Classic style, but not so surprising
","I don't know how to write a good review, so I'll just start from nothing. The story is about Jack Sparrow, Blackbeard, Angelica, Barbossa, all looking for the Fountain of Youth, where you can take another person's years and extending you life, for different reasons. As usual, somebody wins and some body dies. <br/><br/>Here you can see some expected scenes, kisses, explosions, killing people, some strange looking guys, stuffs like those. There are roughly two story lines, and merged properly. The 3D effect is not so obvious in the middle part of the film, but clearly them have put some effort on making some of the scenes popping out of the screen, not just depth of field 3D. The ending is not surprising as you saw the bad guys are dead and everybody lives happily ever after, but it's acceptable in this movie.<br/><br/>One thing about Johnny Depp is that he switches brilliantly between different emotions, and the ""laughing points"" are quite well too, adding some more features to this film. Also, his ""non-lethal"" attacks are pleasing too.<br/><br/>almost forgot to mention about the CGs, just so natural that you could forget their existence, the effort they have put in should not be forgotten(speaking as a non-experienced 3D modeler).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that if you walk into the theater, you should walk out smiling(should), but don't look for big surprises."

","Let me set the record straight: I loved the first potc film, the second two were blatant cash-grabs but I kinda like the second one. This one I was unsure about, but hey? How bad can it be? At least its not like the third one and three hours and with only enough plot to fill one, right?<br/><br/>Well, after the usual first 33% of the film being run around until we're at the point where our plot can start (seriously, pirates films need to stop doing that, just start your movie already). And we get revealed that this film isn't going to be in the Caribbean or feature anyone originally from the Caribbean (false advertising in the title), we get shown that its Blackbeard searching for the fountain of youth because apparently it can make him be able to cheat death.<br/><br/>He can resurrect the dead <br/><br/>I know that may not sound like much except....well it does actually!! Seriously why has no one else noticed such a gapingly massive plot hole of which there are billions littered throughout this film. They think they explain it with Blackbeard saying ""fate has told that I will die at the hands of a one legged man"" (obviously rush, seriously from the opening Jack is the Judge, this film has no tension, just irony and making the audience feel superior that they know something the characters don't) wait but how does this reading fate thing that we never see and are never explained work? And how is this any different to when you were apparently beheaded three times before but came back? And if you're so ****ing powerful you can resurrect other people than surely you can make it so you won't die? Why does Blackbeard think the fountain's magic will cheat death and his magic won't? There are a billion more plot holes I don't have word count to list here, but seriously, character motivations people, there are rules to screen writing: Make your characters make sense before you make massive areas of the plot hinge on them.<br/><br/>Plus: why the f*** are we supposed to care about Phillip and mermaid? He barely speaks and we don't even learn his name till the end of the film cause no one says it and I was mostly reeling from how royally their plot hole had ****ed the movie. There's no depth to the new characters in this movie because we're focused on the tired one: Jack....do people really still give a s**t about him? <br/><br/>God this series is so tired"
"leplatypus","1","5","10","25 June 2011"," Exactly like the tour! Unfortunately, it's a movie! (Screen)
","As I went recently to Disneyland with my nephews, we took the tour and this movie is the same: dark, misty, with filthy pirates, great for the eyes but lacking of a story.<br/><br/>This was actually my first Pirates movie i saw (and the last, i think) and was taken aback at the start with the characters. They seem to know each other but nothing is explained.<br/><br/>The coming of Penelope is a waste because she does nothing here except walking. If she was so pregnant, why cast her? The story of the youth fountain is a rip-off from the ""Last Crusade"".<br/><br/>The character of Deep doesn't make me laugh. The only funny moment was with the swinging ship and it's not enough.<br/><br/>I even slept between the escape from London and the attack of the mermaid: what's the fun of being in the hold of a ship by night? At last, Hook has better taste and as it's another Spielberg reference, you can understand the difference of levels and vision between the two.

","Captain Jack Sparrow is an amazing character, and he is the only one who makes this film bearable. The other characters were pointless and irritating, the plot never went anywhere and the world could have done without this movie. <br/><br/>Long story short, this film is the most unguided, poorly entertaining and below average 2 and 1/2 hour thing you will ever see. There is NO point in this film.

"moviemanMA","3","3","5","31 May 2011"," Seriously, enough is enough.
","The one word I kept repeating as I watched Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was, ""Why?"" Why haven't they explained the disappearance of the characters from the previous films? Why are mermaids a complete ripoff of sirens? Why was this movie made???<br/><br/>All questions aside, let's go through the brief synopsis. The film opens with the Spanish discovering a book that leads to the fountain of youth. Jump to London, we find Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) in a tight bind (per usual). In an attempt to acquire a new ship, he runs into an old flame, Angelica (Penélope Cruz). Without giving away too much, Sparrow and Angelica wind up on Captain Blackbeard's boat (Ian McShane), who is also in search of the fountain.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), under orders of the King of England, is on a mission to beat the Spanish to the fountain. Though his pirate roots run deep, he uses the English for his own personal gain, the reason for which is revealed later.<br/><br/>To be honest, there isn't much to the story without revealing some marginally important plot points like relationships being revealed and character histories. Here's what you need to know, there are three main parties rushing towards the fountain of youth. They all cross each other's paths from time to time, and they each have their own motives for reaching the fountain. To use the fountain's powers they must perform a ritual that requires two silver cups from Ponce de Leon, a tear from a mermaid, and a human sacrifice.<br/><br/>Let's start with what works, as that list is the shortest. The special effects are decent. Nothing new from the previous films, just decent. Depp hasn't lost a step with Captain Jack, though he hasn't learned any new tricks. Not a good thing, not a bad thing. The same goes for Rush. To be honest, that's all I have to say as far as compliments go, and those weren't really compliments. More like aspects of the film that I didn't strongly dislike.<br/><br/>I'll begin with the action. Over the top is one way to describe it. Boring is another. I think it's best to call it pointless. There are chases and sword fights that seem to go on and on when there was really no need for it. There is a part where two opposing characters are about to face off, swords in hand, fire in their eyes. Just before they face off with their bands of troops behind them, Jack Sparrow steps in, noting that it is only the two men who have the conflict. A valid argument, but the men fight anyways. The fight is eerily similar to the one that took place at the end of the first Pirates movie. How interesting.<br/><br/>The story? Flawed. It comes off as if it were written to be made into a video game. There are small quests, puzzles, and sword fights galore. Every bit of which is predictable as the one before it. Accompanying this story is a cast of new characters, also predictable and uninteresting. For the fourth straight movie we meet a new pirate captain, one that is supposedly unbeatable, infamous for past battles. The writers are running out of pirate lore to exploit. Who is next? Captain Hook? Sandwich? Morgan?<br/><br/>This is by far the most violent Disney film ever. I'm not just talking about a few bad guys meeting their untimely end via a distant explosion. For those interested in preserving the shock, skip this paragraph. A MAN IS STRIPPED OF HIS FLESH! Yeah. Don't be fooled by the Disney logo at the beginning. There is some pretty wild stuff here. It's one thing to show living (sort of dead) pirates. It's a horse of a different color when a live pirate gets the arch of the covenant treatment. There are several others attacked by sea creatures while others just get capped. On the whole a lot of death.<br/><br/>So who is behind this? The blame could lie on Rob Marshall, whose previous work is primarily show-stopping musical pieces like Chicago and Nine. As easy as it is to blame him I don't think he has much to do with it. It has an almost identical look to the other films, which begs the question who has the bigger influence, Rob Marshall (Gore Verbinski for the previous three films) or producer Jerry Bruckheimer? I'm better on Bruck. This is his baby and I'm sure he has the final say.<br/><br/>Back to my original question of ""why?"" In short, the answer is money. The previous two sequels made a large, and I mean large, sum of cash. Although I highly doubt this one will be as successful, I'm sure they will get their money's worth and then some. Money aside I honestly can't see why this film was made. It completely abandons several key characters from the previous films and in the end, I'm sorry to say, takes us nowhere. It is a zero gain. At least in the other films there was some sort of terror or element that could potentially lead to the end of the world. Not here. Sorry. Nada.<br/><br/>Save you money for something worth while. And do not, DO NOT, see this in 3D. I saw this in standard definition and it was fine. With the money you spend on 3D you can have a couple of months worth of Netflix movies. That is a much better deal."
"jmanchak6","4","4","8","21 May 2011"," On Weaker Tides
","Most will agree that the ""Pirates"" series got weaker as it went on. ""Black Pearl"" was great because of the massively entertaining performance by Johnny Depp (everyone's said it), as well as a solid rescue story, a memorable villainous performance by Geoffrey Rush, and some great special effects. ""Dead Man's Chest"" was good for the groundbreaking effects, and more Captain Jack. ""At World's End"" was okay. It had a fitting conclusion to the story arc, the combination of the effects and storytelling made it an epic finale, and of course, Johnny Depp. It's spoiled by its almost 3-hour length which just wore audiences out.<br/><br/>The trilogy made over 2.5 billion dollars, but Disney needed more. Now we have the fourth movie. It's WEAK. They had four years to work on it, and they came up with this.<br/><br/>The film starts off in Spain, and here is where I encountered my first problem with this: they speak English. Its only 30 seconds, and they couldn't just subtitle it? ""Inglourious Basterds"" had most of its dialogue in a different language, and subtitled, and that film worked. I decided to just let that go and watch the rest, but thinking back, it's just one more thing that I didn't like about this film as a whole.<br/><br/>Let's break it down.<br/><br/>Things I liked: 1. Johnny Depp's performance was good as expected (I liked how Disney didn't wuss out and actually showed him doing pirate-y things) <br/><br/>2. One good action scene (at the beginning, so everything else went downhill from there), and one pretty good sword fight.<br/><br/>Thats it. 2 things that I genuinely liked. Now for the longer list.<br/><br/>1. TOO MUCH Jack. - The first three films showed him in bits and pieces. The story revolved around Will and Elizabeth, and Jack was just there to help, but he stole every scene that he was in, so it was exciting anytime he was on the screen. Now, the script made sure that he had all the attention. Also, early on he just loses it when he finds out that the Pearl had sunk. This was very out of character and it was just confusing to see Sparrow like that. But he was still the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>2. F/X not as spectacular- The effects in ""Dead Man's Chest"" were absolutely breathtaking. The Kraken attack scenes are a marvelous demonstration of what CGI can do, plus Davy Jones was a huge step forward for ""Avatar"". This film looks like it has less production value than it's predecessors. The mermaid effects were good, and the 'deconstruction' of Blackbeard was good, but there was nothing that will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>3. Action sucked- People going to see this movie want action, and they're better off renting one of the first three, or maybe they could see ""Fast Five"". The first chase scene was the best action scene in the movie. Angelica vs. Jack was pretty good, but the rest of the movie is talking, but I'll get to that later. Barbossa vs. Blackbeard: sounds cool, right? Its ruined by the rest of the crew fighting around them, it just distracts the viewer.<br/><br/>4. Blah, blah, blah- Cut out the BS dialogue, and this movie would have a hard time breaking the 20-minute barrier. Its the shortest of the series, but its actually the most boring.<br/><br/>5. Penelope Cruz- I recognize that she's beautiful, but I've never really cared for this actress. She did what the role required, no more, no less. Its not her performance, so much as her character, which really irritated me. I never cared what would happen to her. Keira Knightley may have had an annoying character, but because the story was better in the trilogy (which I'll get to next), I just cared more about her. We are told that we should like Anjelica, she does nothing to care about.<br/><br/>6. Story lacked emotion- Never did I care for what was going to happen to any character besides Depp's. It had sudden, confusing events that occurred. Mermaids tried to kill all of them, but because they're hot, this stupid, annoying guy falls in love with one. Twilight fans will find this romantic subplot to be the best part of this garbage, everyone else will find it irritating and unnecessary. Also, Blackbeard dies, I repeat, the VILLAIN dies, and the movie tries to make us feel bad by showing that Penelope Cruz is sad. When Barbossa died in the first one, it was jaw-dropping, when Davy Jones died in the third one, it felt like something was accomplished, but they added subtle sympathy to the character. Here, the audience is just left confused by the death of the VILLAIN.<br/><br/>7. Overuse of title theme, plus no memorable original music- ANYTIME ANYTHING HAPPENS, they cue the main theme. It's a good score, but used too often.<br/><br/>8. Most issues could be solved with Gore Verbinski back behind the camera- Verbinski and ""Pirates"" were a perfect mix. He managed to put so much emotion, humor, action and effects and stir them together to make it fun for the audience. He and Johnny Depp liked each other; they just did ""Rango"", and have another project coming. Verbinski said he was done with ""POTC"" after the pressure of ""At World's End"". Honestly, Rob Marshall has never made a film that I like. ""Chicago"" is one of the most overrated Best Picture winners of all time. ""Nine"" was just garbage (and was where he met Cruz), and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was very pretty, but weak storytelling. This guy is a near-perfect example of style-over-substance, but his style ain't too good either. Verbinski balanced style and story, and made you care. Disney should've just kept offering money until he buckled. But Disney likes to downsize.<br/><br/>The Final Word: 8 negatives over 2 positives, 'nuff said.<br/><br/>4/10"
"akopkin","3","4","8","21 May 2011"," Long and boring at times, all over the place at others, The first three were better!! 3D made the film worth watching.
","This one just didn't do it for me. This is one of those movies where the 3D was the best part about the movie. Jonny Depp was good and the acting wasn't all that bad. It was nice to see AL Capone from Board Walk Empire in there as a different role. Mermaids were cool and they entertained me enough to not completely close my eye lids. Some funny parts, but over all the movie is not a movie I could watch twice. It was long at times, everyone was glad when it was over, and when the movie ended, there wasn't any applause from people like most Friday nights of a new movie release. If your a die hard fan like me, you should enjoy some old things mentioned from previous films and the comedic genius of Johnny Depp, but this wasn't a good enough movie to watch again. I hope I was helpful and I hope ya take it for what it's worth."
"Ziya90","1","4","8","19 May 2011"," An uninspiring plot, pointless characters, poor places and so on!
","You may find me a bit weird, but if we look at my Pirates of the Caribbean history briefly, I have to do that to explain some things and to compare, I enjoyed ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", but I didn't love it as other people did. That's why I always think that it is overrated. If you remember, for a while, it was in IMDb Top 250. It was not epic or great for me (except the character Jack Sparrow) You know, you watch a movie, you like it, you are entertained, but that's all, it does not become one of your favorite movies. Then, ""Dead Man's Chest"" came! It was not your typical summer blockbuster for me. I found it excellent and people was laughing at me, when I said it is a kind of masterpiece! It was one of the sequels which surpassed the original like Spider Man 2. A lot of things were improved (including Jack Sparrow character), the weaknesses were made up. Dead Man's Chest was a sunny sea adventure with a brilliant direction, a real villain, a surprising story, some epic scenes such as the escape from the island or the ""wheel"" sword fight and great entertainment with some art as spice. ""At World's End"" was the weakest in the trilogy, because this time, it was not even entertaining and the movie itself was so disconnected/messy. Probably, people will agree with me on ""At World's End"". Now, let's talk about ""On Stranger Tides"". It is better than the third movie, but far from being great. It brings entertainment back after the third movie, especially the first half of the movie was fun and Penelope Cruz brings beauty, but some flaws prevent the movie from being good. The Black Beard character cannot be a villain like Davy Jones, how can I say?, he is weak and not threatening. It just doesn't make you excited like Davy Jones did. ""Zombies"" are ridiculous. Some other characters are pointless. The mermaids look like fashion models/the brides of Dracula from ""Van Helsing"" with cheesy CGI and without any nudity rather than natural, mesmerizing beauties. I didn't understand the relationship between one of them and Philip at all. What was that? There is no sea battle unfortunately as there is no sea creature, you find lots of sword fights instead, even if the editing is too close or too fast in some of the scenes. Generally, the movie is more dark than sunny, more ""land"" than ""sea"" and more reality than fantasy. Probably, this is because the producers tried to make the movie more like the first movie to meet the expectations of the audiences. And the movie does not include a climactic final like At World's End or a dramatic final like Dead Man's Chest, which disappointed me seriously. However, probably, the thing that disappointed me the most is fountain of youth. It was not that beautiful and it was not mesmerizing. The place looks more like the place in the first movie, which they do the sword fight! Therefore, all my dreams about fountain of youth ""fell in the drink."" As for the captain for the chair of direction, Rob Marshall, direction had not any identity this time!"
"supertrunks2","1","2","3","4 August 2016"," Horrible with no Will Turner, Elizabeth, or a proper villain
","Don't know where they got off making a cheap lame movie like this, but all the characters suck. Jack just looks like he's doing the same stuff from the first movie but more cheaply. Not to mention that what he does in this movie, is really not even cool. The stunts seemed lamer and his whole character is just poorly done. And even if, you can't focus a whole plot just around Jack, that's just STUPID.<br/><br/>And I know this counts as critique for the previous movie, the third one (At World's End)...but no Norrington or Governor Swann is really not the same movie. I never really liked Beckett's character too. So all that from the third and second movie screwed up this one. Leaving you with just a Jack Sparrow who doesn't even look like he's into the movie acting-wise. No Elizabeth? No Will? Sure the ending of the third one made it so you couldn't have more Will, but if it's saying the third one's ending sucks then so be it. Will should be in EVERY Pirates movie. Same with his little bonnie lass.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is annoying with Penelope Cruz, a highly unfit character for any big movie, she should just stay in the cheap Loreal commercials. Don't know how she got to be big. This director must be a real idiot. Blackbeard is lame too, the whole mermaid siren thing is kind of cool but just wasn't fun enough to sustain a plot. Blackbeard looked and functioned like a two year old's pirate character, like Captain Hook from Peter Pan or something (no offense to people who like Peter Pan). Where's the cool people like Bosun? Raggetti? Black Beard was annoying, boring, and HORRIBLE to watch on screen...nothing but a big embarrassment. The whole ""my father is mean"" Blackbeard plot is redundant and not Pirates material. Not to mention it's a cheap ripoff of other movies too.<br/><br/>You can't just bring Gibbs in, because honestly even Gibbs seemed off. The other members of the Black Pearl can't be just tagging along for the ride as well. I don't remember if Tia Dalma was in it. But everyone lacked the Pirates charm.<br/><br/>0/10"

The exotic locations are wonderfully captured by the camera but it fails to immerse the viewers into the narrative plus thanks to useless editing, its 137 minutes of runtime is severely felt, while the score by Hans Zimmer is inferior but still fitting for the most part.<br/><br/>Visual Effects also exhibit a downgrade when compared to its predecessors and on various occasions isn't convincing at all. Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Kevin McNally are the only ones reprising their roles from previous features while the new additions include Penélope Cruz & Ian McShane who play Angelica (Jack's former lover) & Blackbeard (the prime antagonist), and the performance by the entire cast is, in one word, terrible.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a sequel that shouldn't have been made in the first place. The previous three films by Gore Verbinski may not rank amongst the finest trilogies ever made but it had a wit & charm of its own plus was perfectly good in a way. Even Captain Jack Sparrow fails to keep the interest alive this time and is annoying for the most part. With nothing working in its favour, On Stranger Tides is definitely worth skipping."

","I loved the first Pirates, the 2nd was OK, third was bearable, the forth is just bad, bad, bad. <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz was awful in it, so much so I missed Kiera Knightly who I can't stand at the best of times. <br/><br/>I've given it a three just because I love Jack Sparrow's character and liked him in this, I think Johnny Depp plays him brilliantly but did show an element of boredom in Pirates 4. The energy just wasn't there. <br/><br/>There's no plot really, certainly not an interesting one. It's two hours of one sword fight after another. The acting is ridiculous. It's a waste of time.

","The main character is there, a couple of his old buddies and even the monkey, ""hate the monkey"", are there, but the charm, the wit, the tongue-in-cheek jokes and playfulness of the previous three movies are all gone. If the rum was gone by the end of the third movie, this installment is a hangover. I love all three previous movies, and I recommend all PoC fans to watch extra features on the DVD, there are interviews with the director and artists and actors, one really gets to know and appreciate how much talent went into making the series. Not the fourth movie, though. <br/><br/>The charm is gone. Everything is gone. I got bored after the first 5 minutes and remained bored until the end. There is no logic in haphazard fights, there is no rhythm, no humor. ""Between your sister and the dog I choose the dog"" - this passes for a joke here, the better one at that. The movie alternates between fake sentimentality and vulgarity, even Hans Zimmer's music seems too loud and pretentious. It's almost as if he tries to hang on to the main pirate theme too much because there is no development there, no breathing space for music because the plot goes nowhere. If only Rob Marshall had at least a sliver of the creative talent of Gore Verbinski. The material is fantastic, there is Blackbeard, the Spanish, the mermaids - and yet nothing works. What a shame. We watched it in 2D, and it became obvious that some of the scenes were made to look go-o-geous in 3D. They probably did for those watching this disaster in 3D, but a few 3D tricks cannot make a movie. <br/><br/>There is a handful of scenes which reminded us of what this movies could have been in more capable hands. Keith Richards has a few lines in the beginning, his acting career seems to be picking up :), the scene with the king is funny, and the last few minutes of the movie (with the monkey in the bottle) have the tempo and the feel of the real Pirates of the Caribbean. I mean the first three. This one is a fake."
"more_me","10","2","3","8 June 2011"," Jack's Talent
","A question that has been brought up in the other three movies, is how does Jack always manage to escape, Does he have a plan or does he improvise as he goes? The escape From the Palace answered my question and, I'm sure, many other viewer's. He is simply genius. Of course, he does have to improvise, but all his escapes are planned with a great deal of care. Thus making his captors always remember the day they ""almost caught Jack Sparrow"" I'm relieved that this movie had more of Jack than the previous 3. As he is the reason we run to theaters every time a new movie of the franchise is released. A breath of fresh air. Also, it is funny to see how time and time again, Barbosa cannot live without Sparrow. They hate each other but are always thrown together for whatever reason. I really enjoyed watching this film"

","I liked it better than the three other Pirates because the plot was better than the previous ones. Of course the famous Jack Sparrow was not so comic as the previous ones but really this is what drove away many viewers, actually this dosage of humor attracts more the female side of the population. So the humor balance was well placed. The plot for me was very nice. The duration of the battles was restricted to the necessary which I liked and disliked in the previous ones which lasted more than necessary. So this left place for acting. The love scenes were the necessary. The pace of the film was steady which was not the case for the previous ones, some scenes in the previous Pirates were too slow. Generally a 9/10. I highly recommend it."
"philippsfrt","4","2","3","22 May 2011"," What have you done???
","Upon watching the first trailer that was released of this a while back, I have to admit that I was excited, despite the fact that Gore Verbinski was not longer directing it (he directed the first 3) and that two of my favorite characters so far, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) would not be returning, I allowed myself to get somewhat excited and anticipate this movie. I was gravely disappointed.<br/><br/>My first thought half way through the movie was: OK, remove the Pirates of the Caribbean element and it could have been a decent film standing on its own, but the whole thing seems to be too forced and too stiff in the direction of Jack (Johnny Depp). It not that he plays his part badly, on the contrary, but I felt that the movie was now about Jack, rather than him being a character in the movie. I would have loved to see more of the new guy and the mermaid (you see! I don't even remember their names! Serena! That's it! And the guy? Hm.). I felt as if their story and the whole involvement of the Spanish in this went completely by everyone. They were there but the reasons to them being there were never really explained or explored. Instead we see Jack killing English soldiers by kicking plates of food at them. Seriously?<br/><br/>The idea was good, but somehow the execution was horrible. I would have liked to like this movie, but sorry, not like this. Also as a final word: I am surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer (the Producer) would put his name on something like this as I usually believe that he is very selective and perfectionistic with the projects he takes on. Well this was just bad.<br/><br/>OK, now this is really the final thing. In the end I felt that a sequel was somehow being set up. PLEASE don't do this. I really enjoyed the first three movies, so I hope they aren't going to turn this into one of those franchises that simply wont go away. Stop here, the damage is done, let it go."

","First of all, I'm not going to give anything away. Second, if you're a ""Will & Elizabeth"" fan, you may not like this one cause it's a WHOLE new storyline. They aren't even mentioned.

","Chronologically, it appears that as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise progressed, the IMDb rating accorded to each successive film was lower than the previous one. I guess that's to be expected, as for some folks, the novelty wears off and it's hard to match the originality of the first picture. For this viewer however, there's never been a 'Pirates' movie I didn't like and find enjoyable. A lot of the credit goes to Johnny Depp for making Captain Jack Sparrow such an amusing and engaging character. He uses his facial expressions exceeding well in a variety of situations and his dialog is humorously written with a lot of double entendre involved. I particularly got a kick out of a line he delivered here defending the cleric Philip (Sam Claflin) - ""I support the missionary's position"". It blows by very quickly but the nuance made me laugh after doing a double take. Very clever.<br/><br/>One of my favorite bad guys in movies ever since seeing him in the HBO series ""Deadwood"" has been Ian McShane. He was a well cast addition to this story involving the search for the Fountain of Youth. McShane has just the right look for a villainous pirate, and his portrayal of Blackbeard Edward Teach was noteworthy. The prophecy involving Blackbeard stated that he would meet his death at the hands of a one-legged man, which after some consideration, seemed to me a lot more feasible than dying at the legs of a one-armed man. With the recurring presence of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa, it was only a matter of time to see how that whole prediction would play out.<br/><br/>You know, it's hard to come up with unique and original situations in movie sequels, but I thought the mermaid battle was creatively done, and the first swordfight between Jack and Angelica (Penélope Cruz) was just about the best I've ever seen, second perhaps only to the masterful exchange between Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin in ""The Princess Bride"". The hanging of the mutineers aboard Queen Anne's Revenge by Blackbeard was also a skillful bit of business. All well done and resulting in some fine action sequences to keep the story moving. About the only thing I would have handled differently would have been to use Keith Richards in more scenes. Like Ian McShane and the rest of the pirate crew, he's got just the right look for a nasty buccaneer."

","'We're all back together again!' Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) tells the audience in a featurette. And it feels that the main purpose for this movie was some kind of reunion, because it was fun for them to make the first three.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski is not directing this anymore. And it shows. There is nothing particular memorable about this movie in style or direction. They kept the DOP from the previous movies and the movie is still beautifully shot. <br/><br/>When I went to the cinema expecting nothing of the movie (because every story finished nicely at the end of the third movie) I was still entertained. Upon re-watching it, boredom struck. The movie's basic structure is like this: Here you have characters, they need to do these things, okay let's do these things, movie end. It's narratively speaking quite straight forward and therefore the movie doesn't feel pretentious or bloated. What does bother me is that the characters are so uninteresting and what happens during the movie is also quite uninteresting. The movie lost the grandeur of the previous entries.<br/><br/>Hey Jerry! What did you say? 'Blackbeard is one of the most evil characters we have ever given you?' Nah, sorry to burst your bubble but the only positive thing about the Blackbeard character is that he is played by Ian McShane. McShane does everything to make the character interesting, because the script is lacking. Blackbeard is really boring and underdeveloped. The second and third movies had time to develop their villains, whereas this movie did not take it's time or tried to bother. Probably because this movie was meant to be the Johnny Depp Show! <br/><br/>I'm not even going to mention the forced love-couple in this movie, because that was laughable. The Penelope Cruz character was a nice addition though and she was OK. Johnny himself was not that memorable. He was more on repeat of what he did in previous entries, but now he was the main focus of the movie. <br/><br/>But, overall, the highlights of the movie were the Mermaid scene and Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. (he always looks like he's having fun with the character he plays) You can decide for yourself if that's worth your time to go see this movie. <br/><br/>Lower your expectations. It helps!"

","Now don't get me wrong, the latest film Disney churned out did have its moments. It tried hard to downplay the 'epicness' of the story and provide us with a simpler and more straight forward adventure, much like the original, and does it pretty well. However, this instalment doesn't leave you with that same feeling you get when watching the others – you don't really get the sense that you've just watched a Pirates of the Caribbean film. All the best elements from the first three films were hardly in use here. Heck, Blackbeard is one of the most feared real pirates there were, and he was so underused. The returning characters don't act same as you'd expect them to (Barbossa, really?) and I especially didn't like the fact that the main cast hardly share any screen time together, due to a limiting script. There were a couple of stand-out moments, nothing memorable though – the journey didn't really go anywhere, even forgetting the anti-climatic ending. Verbinski 'got' the POTC films, and this one just seemed to be lacking that something special. It was OK, but that was just its problem – it was OK."

","Captain Sparrow finds himself captured by black beard and his daughter on the way to find the fountain of youth. The fourth movie of the pirates of the Caribbean tries to deal with its loses, while keeping true to the well known recipe. Jack is resourcefully, reckless and entertaining, but nothing that we haven't seen before. The story is lucking from everywhere, and it has too many things going on. It gets confusing from time to time, boring and maybe the deja vu feeling gets tiring after a while. In the end, I found it incomplete and a little idiotic, even though there were some good bits here and there that were enjoyable. So I give this movie a 4 out of 10."

","I'm probably not the only one that groaned upon hearing that they were making a new ""Pirates"" movie (And more are planning to come), but is this one worth the watch? We'll begin with the definitive answer, No. I enjoyed a few moments where the movie excelled and as the series progressed, they had become more focused in tying loose ends and focusing on performances. However, this film continues to deliberately set up more impossible scenarios, and the slapstick levels of the previous entries is jacked up significantly this time around.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is reportedly getting tired of the Jack Sparrow character, and in a way so am I. He has only gotten worse since the second movie, and the star who shines the most now is Geoffrey Rush. When he plays eccentric, he delivers way beyond expectations. The newer cast members are somewhat the least likable. Gone are Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, in come Penelope Cruz (Well-casted enough) and Ian Mcshane as a terrific rendition of Blackbeard, yet they do nothing with the character. Forgive me when I say I don't know their names, but the actor and actress whose spontaneous romance as a priest and mermaid was so damn cringe worthy it felt like I jumped into ""Twilight"" (2008).<br/><br/>Well there's a quest for the fabled ""Fountain of Youth"". However, in order for the magic to work they must succeed in having two people drink from two identical magical chalices, whilst also acquiring a mermaids tear. If successful, one will inherited all the other persons previous and remaining years (Those are some pretty challenging guidelines). I never remembered any of this when hearing any fables of the Fountain, but that's a lot of tasks. Luckily our heroes will have a lot to do, yet all we must do to succeed is watch two hours of this tedious bore.<br/><br/>Okay, I understand sarcasm is finding its way into my review, but honestly when writing all that down wouldn't yours also? Anyone who has seen this must have felt gob smacked and in the wrong way. But for the bad things I've said, there are some good scenes and fun to be had. After putting up with a load of coral reef monsters in the previous instalments, it's good to at least know they calmed down on all that. There are a lot of scenes that really blew me away such as the chase scene through London, and when the characters finally get to where their going, the stylistic look of this movie gets a thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Good enough, but didn't really add anything new either. The 3-D sucks and this franchise just has to finish now, but as we know, it won't happen that easily. 5/10."

","Pirate Jack Sparrow is laying low in London when he runs into his old foe Barbossa, who has been engaged by King George II to find the legendary Fountain of Youth before the Spanish. Jack teams up with an old flame, Angelica, to try to beat them both to the prize, but little does he know that Angelica is the daughter of the dreaded Blackbeard ...<br/><br/>This is the fourth Pirates Of The Caribbean film, and inevitably the series becomes a bit too familiar as it proceeds but nevertheless it's still terrific fun all the way through, and is also a completely stand-alone adventure in its own right, with only Captain Jack, a now peg-legged Barbossa and Mr Gibbs (McNally) returning from the previous movies. Depp is as goofy good fun as always, if perhaps a little more restrained than in previous outings but then so is everybody, and there's a good balance between action, fantasy and comedy. The best thing in the movie for me though is the score by Hans Zimmer, which is a great old-fashioned charging orchestral symphony mixed with Spanish and choral influences to produce a terrific soundtrack which is constantly propelling the whole thing forward. The origins of the film are quite interesting - it's loosely based on Tim Powers' original 1987 novel On Stranger Tides (which also partly inspired the excellent LucasArts video game The Secret Of Monkey Island), mixed into the Disney pirate universe, the (real) historical figure of Edward Teach and the (mythological) conquistador stories of Bimini. It's also more than a little similar to one of my favourite pirate movies, The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad, which also involves a supernatural ship and a quest for the Fountain of Youth. It's maybe not a patch on the original Jack Sparrow movie, but it's great looking, very nicely made and quality entertainment throughout."
"phubbs","5","1","1","7 December 2013"," Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
","We all thought it had ended with the trilogy but no! as in this modern age there had to be a continuation, it had to be milked and a milked it shall be. New director, change of cast line up and a new myth to explore, this franchise has become the Indiana Jones of the era.<br/><br/>This film takes elements from actual real history this time and blends them with classic fantasy. The real bits involve the legendary English pirate Edward Teach and his flagship Queen Anne's Revenge and the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. Now this plot has relaxed a bit, its not a complicated mess of sub plots and tonnes of characters. 'Sparrow' is off to sea once again to find the fountain of youth, alongside him is 'Barbossa' who is now a privateer for the British Navy. At the same time 'Blackbeard' is also after the fountain along with the dastardly Spanish and their religious thoughts. Each party has their own reasons naturally which does as usual involve some double crossing and twists.<br/><br/>I must admit to liking the intergration of actual history into the plot this time. The franchise has slowly used various common old fables and sea myths to its advantage which has worked well, this time the inclusion of some real historic figures gives the whole thing a bit more class, credibility and a small sense of realism. Of course old Blackbeard has been given a slightly spruced up look with black leather top to bottom by the looks of it, aiming for the cool factor a bit too much methinks.<br/><br/>Gotta say I didn't really like the whole supernatural power thing Blackbeard had over his ship with the magic cutlass. That seemed pointless if you ask me, if he can control the ship like that then why use a crew?. His galleon has also been given a very fantasised appearance which makes it look like a unique ghost ride attraction in a fairground. Oh and his ship breaths fire out the front? really? did we need that silliness? they'd probably burn their own ship down with it.<br/><br/>Next to that we see mermaids which is about time really if you think about it. The fact they are actually fearsome creatures that kill innocent sailors was a nice touch if rather obvious. But that plot detail causes confusion with the main mermaid character who we are meant to feel for, but that's hard knowing her kind are merciless killers of the deep, plus the 'Splash' finale for her was too much cinematic deja vu.<br/><br/>I think the film in general is let down by totally unrealistic action sequences that just feel implausible when they are suppose to be reasonably plausible. The escape set piece at the start is a good example, its overly long and over the top in every sense. Sparrow is leaping around like an acrobat (clearly a stunt double) and doing things that just wouldn't work, the worst bit is seeing all the English soldiers prat falling about everywhere trying to catch him, its cringing. We all know the franchise is suppose to be fun fantasy but apart from the actual supernatural stuff you do expect a degree of slight realism with some stunts. If it becomes too outrageous then it ceases to be fun and simply becomes a joke, what's worse is the fact its not meant to be that kind of joke.<br/><br/>The film is full of these daft action sequences really, it looks bad because we all know Sparrow isn't that kind of character, we had 'Turner' in the trilogy for that. So now seeing the campy Sparrow mincing about doing these big hero stunts looks stupid as its actually taken semi seriously. As I said earlier the plot does also go down the route of old Indy with the chalices thing and especially the finale for Blackbeard which is pretty much a rip off from 'Raiders' and 'The Last Crusade'.<br/><br/>Altogether the adventure feels a bit flat to me, nothing much happens that we haven't seen before or made me go wow!. Most of the characters are running low on juice now accept for Barbossa who is always brilliantly played by Rush. Cruz was a bad casting choice and did nothing whilst McShane wasn't all that intimidating as Blackbeard if you ask me. Kudos to Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey for being gorgeously cute as the mermaid and Richard Griffiths in a small role as King George II at the start.<br/><br/>On the whole very very average in my opinion, hyper stunt laden action sequences can't divert from the fact the film is actually kinda dull. It all looks terrific and very atmospheric in that Monkey Island kinda way but you can tell the difference in direction with the film, it does stand out. I just feel they have now used up most avenues of pirate legend both real and fantasy, I can't see what they can do in the fifth film without it being a complete rehash, especially with this struggling for a fresh look. Who's left to utilize? 'Long John Silver'? 'Sinbad'? 'YellowBeard'? (lol!) what other old creatures and myths can they possibly crowbar in?? Atlantis?.<br/><br/>The fact they even squeezed in the minute unrelated hobby of ships in a bottle shows how far they were stretched to incorporate anything remotely olde worlde and piratey into the film. I think this film just about manages to be semi acceptable but that's now it, no more can or should be done. I think Sparrow has had his moment in the spotlight, time to retire in the sun matey."

","I love the Pirates of the Caribbean films, all three of them, though I occasionally notice the holes in them, and though they are not perfect, they're still a lot of fun in the good ol' classic adventure style. On Stranger Tides is maybe the weakest of the films. Ian McShane is great at Blackbeard, his look is great, but Blackbeard was notorious for killing anyone simply because he could. He only kills maybe 2 or 3 people in this movie. Bruckheimer states he's the most evil character we've ever given you, not true, he hangs sailors upside down, he does burn a guy, but that's it. Disney is afraid to be too scary or villainous even though Shan Yu in Mulan killed an entire village and they prove it. Disney is simply afraid to have villains be too evil. You can't have that for your film, it really downplays it.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, Philip and Syrena kiss and she drags him underwater...and that's it...they don't explain what happened to them or how he's able to breathe or anything. Also I don't think we cared for the fact that mermaids are actually underwater vampires. I though it was cool that the mermaids kill sailors, but that they turn into beasts seemed silly.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the opening of the man lost on the raft and then we're in Spain, with the rain, lying mainly on the plain. We want an opening with our favorite characters, something like the opening to Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Trek Into Darkness, where we catch Jack on an adventure that has nothing to do with the main one in the movie, this happens in every Indy film.<br/><br/>The cast is good, I don't have anything against Geoffrey Rush, he's my favorite character. Depp is always good as Jack.<br/><br/>That whole scene where they have to jump into the river is the worst scene in the movie. They drag out this scene for longer than absolutely necessary. We know hoe the scene is going to end; he jumps in regardless of how long you drag it out and he lives, the main character always lives through those jumps. Why are they dragging the scene out when we know what's going to happen already? They always survive the jump in adventure films, let's move on, why are they so worried he's gonna die? This is treating your audience like they haven't seen this kind of film before, insulting their intelligence.<br/><br/>There is not one cannon shot in the movie, only sword fights and pistols, which are cool, but still, no cannon fire which is one of the most exciting elements of pirate films.<br/><br/>The locations are great, classic adventure sets, good action scenes, like the sword fight between Jack and Angelica, I like the opening scenes, especially when Jack is caught in London. There's a good chase scene then and I like how Barbossa is on the same chase as Jack.<br/><br/>There's some good scenes, again but some stuff falls flat, even the end, which is essentially the ending of Last Crusade."

","The ""POTC"" franchise is slowly sinking. Although Cap'n Jack Sparrow and Barbosa were great, they couldn't carry the movie by themselves. Too many of the dynamic characters were missing and the choice of Penelope Cruz as the femme fatale was a disastrous decision; she lacks in every way and comparing her to Keira Knightley is like comparing a kitten fart to a hurricane. I have hope that there will be, at least, one more episode in which Rob Marshall realizes his 'error', loses Cruz (hopefully by killing her at the beginning of the next movie) and reunites the original cast. Once in a great while, there is perfect chemistry between actors, a terrific plot and incredible effects that enters your living room and takes you to where they are.""

","I love the ""POTC"" franchise, but ""On Stranger Tides"" failed on a lot of levels. Oh, Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow has his moments; he's cute, and clever, and silly in a lovable way/lovable in a silly way. But when all is said and done, at least for me he wasn't, in this movie, a character I was more than mildly amused by. And that wasn't enough to keep me invested in the movie.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz makes a fetching Pirate, but I just never bought into the back-story, which is that she's Blackbeard the arch-Pirate's daughter. She's pretty and she's fun to watch on screen, but there isn't enough plot/character to make me care about her.<br/><br/>There's a cute sub-plot involving a mermaid and a young male missionary, and as far as I was concerned, that was potentially the most interesting part of the movie. But it was a minor item, and the way it turned out was pre-ordained and obvious from the get-go.<br/><br/>Kevin McNally as Gibbs was actually the character that I felt was the most authentic, but he was just dragged along for the ride, as it were, and really didn't have a part in the action.<br/><br/>For the rest, there are Spaniards and British who swash buckle and flash swords at appropriate moments in the movie, but that's all they're really there for.<br/><br/>I know I'm swimming against the tide in saying this, but for me the movie just didn't work. In the climactic action sequence at the end, I found myself more concerned with how cramped and uncomfortable I was starting to feel in my theater seat than in how the movie was going to end.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I really can't recommend ""On Stranger Tides."" My suggestion: if you're hankering for a good action popcorn flick, skip this movie and watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" either of the first two Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movies, or check your cable channels for any other big-budget action movie of summers past."

Jack Sparrow's character, although amusing at times, has by now been well and truly worn out and he interacts poorly with a host of other new characters that have been thrown into the mix, (amongst some old ones).<br/><br/>The story is also poor and in no way links in with any of the other movies so by the end of the film I was both bored and confused. I wouldn't recommend it to any who haven't seen the previous films although I suppose it's worth seeing for a laugh... or two."
"imdb-239-40480","3","1","1","14 December 2011"," A waste
","If the bar hadn't been set so tremendously high with the first three installments of the POTC franchise, you wouldn't be so disappointed with this film.<br/><br/>Gone is the clever storyline that made the first three so interesting. Gone are the characters that made them so worth watching. Gone are the rich and clear settings, that made everything stand out so crisp and believable.<br/><br/>POTC is (was) simply one of the most breathtaking, entertaining, and masterful series of motion pictures EVER. The characters, imagination, storyline, plot lines, music, setting, photography, special effects, and overall, spine tingling INTEREST are completely missing from this latest installment.<br/><br/>The ENTIRE picture is shot in dreary, overcast settings that compel ZERO interest or imagination. In fact, when they get to the edge of the cliff, it suddenly brought back the last time Jack was faced with a situation in picture two, and the contrast was more than sharp. The fun, fantasy, imagination, and utter whimsy of the previous picture was completely robbed with the current situation, where Blackbeard threatens to shoot his daughter unless Jack jumps off the cliff. (Oh, so wonderful.) Barbarossa the pirate is no better. He looks more than 10 years older in this picture, and I couldn't get over his heavily lidded eyes and odd hair and beard treatment. It wasn't until the very last scene, where he becomes captain of Blackbeard's ship that a smidgen of the previous movies returns.<br/><br/>If this were a stand alone movie, made completely apart from the previous three, would it stand on its own. Barely, at best. But that's the point. This WASN'T made in a vacuum, and all the story-points from the previous movies were utterly missing from this dreary tale.<br/><br/>The original three movies were good productions made by professionals at the zenith of their craft. Virtually EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of those movies is flawless. The inventive story-lines, the tremendous special effects, the humorous character pairings, the masterful production values and thrilling musical score, all combined to achieve a cinematic accomplishment never seen before. Utterly masterful in every meaningful respect. Crisp, scintillating, compelling, and thoroughly watchable.<br/><br/>In comparison, this current picture was made by a completely different production team, and had NONE of the excellent qualities found in the first three. Jack Sparrow was really the only one who kept this movie together; all the others, including Barbarossa and Gibbs, were wooden and lackluster in comparison.<br/><br/>IMDb says the budget was a quarter of a BILLION dollars, and that it grossed a cool billion at the box office. That tells you how strong the previous three were; that fans would venture their money in hopes of seeing something from the originals even though initial reviews warned it was a dog. They went to see it anyway, (just like me.) Any positive review of this movie is given strictly in deference to the originals.<br/><br/>I'm not sorry I watched it, if only to see how the mighty can fall. No doubt, this movie was not poorly made, but it turned out poorly anyway. Depp made $30 million, I'm told. Not bad for three months work. Definitely produced as a cash cow, and on that level, it succeeded. Don't look for anymore, though. Only in a TV series could you get any more life out of this franchise. (I'm sorry they decided to make it.)"

","The very definition of the word ""pointless"". I would like to start by saying that I admire Disney for scaling down the film. In my opinion, the last two films were too concentrated on creating an engaging mythology to be any fun. However, they have gone too far in the wrong direction. This is just dull. The film is so simple you'd be forgiven for thinking this is the first in the series. The film starts with a number of overlong, but all very similar action sequences. These involve swinging around a lot. So much so, I think Jack may be part monkey. Next we see Jack as a superhero now. Before he was a bumbling fool that got lucky, this was where the comedy came from. Now he seems to have complex plans mapped out.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing is the lazy writing. Twice in this film, characters are saved by other characters that appear out of nowhere. There is no way for the characters that do the saving to know where those in danger are. They just walk out of dark shadows and allow the story to plod along. Blackbeard the pirate all pirates fear, is a useless bully. He isn't scary or interesting. Whereas before we've had skeletal and fish pirates, now we have a guy that can control ropes. Scary stuff. <br/><br/>There's also some bizarre love story between two new characters, a religious nut and a mermaid. I don't know why they are in the film. Probably for some misunderstood teenage romance crap ala Twilight. We also get some boring prophecy stuff. Why ruin so many movies/stories with prophecies? Very rarely do they not come true. <br/><br/>At least Cruz adds a new kind of female character to the franchise. One that is threatening, confused, and also a lot of fun. I really found nothing to enjoy in this movie. The first one made pirates cool, this one made pirates very, very bland."

","Will keep this brief as just about everyone jumps in for a complete film summary. So, the first film, brilliant, the second, OK it is a sequel and as such very watchable, the third should have been the last, they made a good trilogy....<br/><br/>First things, only two scenes worthy of recognition, the 'escape from the king' and the 'mermaid' scenes, reminiscent of the earlier films, great fun. The rest, limp wristed, failing to deliver on many levels and to add an extra dimension of failure about 80% of the film seems to be filmed in the dark. So all that fab scenery and great costume and effects were by and large wasted.<br/><br/>So not good, not memorable and very very lacklustre.... The performances from Depp, Cruz, McShane and Mr Rush, wasted by a second rate script and weak story, pity as they are without doubt talented. Fingers crossed they do not stretch the elastic on this one, please no more...."
"yiNXs","6","1","1","17 September 2011"," Visually stunning, but a messy and boring story.
","I didn't expect this to be the greatest of the series, because Dead man's chest was already showing signs of story stretching, but I hoped they would've been able to squeeze one more decent episode out of the franchise before all ideas about pirates and ships ran out.<br/><br/>But it seems it was already too late. The movie started with a short introduction to the basic plot, but quickly moved onto a chain of action sequences with short interruptions, most of which weren't even relevant to the story. That's what this movie leans on heavily: lots of action, not so much a well written story. Most of the things that happen are very random, as if the script was actually thrown together from a handful of brainstorm session blurts. The worst part is that Jack Sparrow hardly has any decent lines, or antics, while his character is what makes this series so great.<br/><br/>This means that even while the movie has loads of action, it's actually very boring. What kept me going was the eye candy, because it was definitely beautifully shot. Practically every scene was art, that's what kept the movie interesting for me, but that's it.<br/><br/>All in all it's beautiful, but disappointing final episode of a great series. That is, assuming part 5 is actually canceled, which I think was a wise choice."
"breakheartsmailbox","Null","1","1","19 July 2011"," A mix of frustration and fun.
","Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.<br/><br/>Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low- lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two."
"lucy-wainwright-827-448455","5","1","1","2 July 2011"," I never thought I'd miss Orlando Bloom...
","With this one, I think the POTC franchise has finally run out of steam. The Curse of the Black Pearl was a very novel film with some great characters and a lot of humour. Dead Man's Chest and At World's End felt a bit lazy because they didn't introduce much that was new character-wise, but they did at least have half-decent if slightly ""caper""-ish plots and - through a few good lines, good delivery and good chemistry - they did manage to be quite funny in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of either Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom, and before seeing On Stranger Tides I'd have said they didn't contribute a great deal and that the success of the POTC films rested with Johnny Depp. Good grief, I take it back - nondescript as he is, it turns out that Bloom is a useful and necessary straight man to Depp's character. I also discover that I have not been giving Knightley enough credit for the warmth she brought to the films, or the effortless chemistry she conveyed with both Depp and Bloom.<br/><br/>In On Stranger Tides, the absence of Bloom and Knightley is felt from the offset and the effort to wedge Penelope Cruz in there, far from compensating for their loss, simply accentuates the fact that Depp now has no one to bounce off. Honestly she's terrible, and I can't think of many other characters central to the plot line of their film that somehow manage to feel utterly unnecessary. Ian McShane as Blackbeard did about as good a job as could be expected with the pretty flat role and script handed to him, and the same could be said of Richard Griffiths as King George. I don't know, maybe we've just been spoiled by Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander but I don't think any of the new baddies had anything like the same depth and nastiness to them. The writers also apparently decided quite late on that they needed a nice character to lend interest, and grafted on a priest/vicar/generic holy guy who seemed to be there for no reason except to tear his shirt off at dramatic moments and moon over a mermaid (unnecessary as he was, though, he was still less gratuitous than Cruz and Keith Richards - yes, the man's a legend. But he can't act, he doesn't serve any purpose to the plot, and the novelty value's well and truly gone now. Please stop it.) It all just felt very disjointed, and suffered from that peculiar malady that seems to affect many films a the tail-end of a franchise in being at least forty minutes too long.<br/><br/>Look, it's not a terrible film and Johnny Depp is still - just - worth watching as Jack Sparrow, although even he and Geoffrey Rush, by this stage, give the impression that they're getting a bit sick of the whole thing. Just don't go in expecting it to equal the first film or even the second and third, because it doesn't."
"jonnyhavey","5","1","1","18 June 2011"," Incoherent Action: The Captain Is Back
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is everything a Pirates sequel should be, trumping the previous follow-up attempts. The plot is more over the top and muddled than ever with a plethora of pointless characters and incoherent nonstop action sequences, but Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) creates a film that will please fans and revive people's love for the series that was lost because of the previous two flops. Much of the success of the newest installment comes from the axing of Will and Elizabeth from the story finally being true to the real star of the series, Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. His previous nemesis Hector Barbosa is back (Academy Award Nominee Geoffrey Rush, The King's Speech), along with newcomers Ian McShane (Kung Fu Panda) as Black Beard and Academy Award Winner Penelope Cruz (Vicky Christina Barcelona) as Angelica, a long lost love interest of Jack. The plot is basically about Captain Jack trying his hardest to beat numerous other journeyers to the 'Fountain of Youth' with his deceptive tactics. On the way he has to deal with Black Beard, a reformed Barbosa, the Spanish (even though they only show up a couple times) and an obnoxious love story between a religious man and a Mermaid. The plot doesn't matter much in this Pirates attempt disregarding the development of a storyline completely replacing it with nonstop action. The fast pace is hard to grasp at first, but it never gets out of hand as the rum flows through its veins slowing it down to a comprehensible speed.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides is the best of the Pirates sequels even though it still fails to come close to The Curse of the Black Pearl. As long as Depp and Rush continue providing entertaining antics with their peculiar relationship the boat will stay afloat for many more installments.. McShane's Black Beard acts as the new and improved Davy Jones succeeding in adding a dark humor to the film. Even so, all that really matters is that it is a blockbuster completely overwhelmed with action commencing with the opening sequence and not taking a breathe until the end.<br/><br/>The most pointless and irritating part of the film is the awkward relationship that forms between a man named Phillip (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Bergés-Frisbey). The audience cannot connect to the relationship because Phillip comes off as a creepy nothing character and the only point of the relationship can be attributed to lazy scriptwriting, which becomes a major theme throughout the film. The cleverness is that used to be prevalent in the series is gone causing the predictable to set in.<br/><br/>Leave all high hopes at the door going into this one and you may just be as surprised as I was after seeing this film. Just remember the captain, the action, the rum and that it is nothing more and nothing less than a blockbuster sequel."

","Well, it seems that IMDb limits these reviews to only a 1000 characters and there's just no way I can say ALL that needs to be said about this movie in that short of a review. I will say that if you're considering the IMAX 3D version, don't waste your money...if you -have- to see Pirates 4, just see the traditional theater version instead as the 3D effects are pretty much non-existent (at least with the IMAX version).<br/><br/>The movie itself is also rather lacking...it's not a complete waste of time and there is -some- entertainment value there however this latest incarnation of Pirates is just really lacking compared with the past 3 movies...very bland to say the least (and that's about all I can write here...the least). There is some good action, the traditional special effects are up to par with the previous movies and even the story line seems plausible for a Pirates flick, but this one just lacks the punch of the previous three.<br/><br/>If you're not a POTC fan, then you'll likely enjoy this movie to some degree but if you already enjoy the off-beat swashbuckling adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, then prepare to be disappointed with this one. <br/><br/>For more info, please see my full review at; http://www.facebook.com/note.php?saved&&note_id=10150206918086861"

","While the tremendous success of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movies have led fans to expect another thrilling epic, the latest installment, On Stranger Tides, falls short of spectacular. <br/><br/>Whether you enjoy this movie or not depends entirely on whether you enjoyed the first three. If you loved the first three, you will find this movie very shallow and even slightly lame in comparison. It lacks the cutlass-sharp wit, panoramic sets, exhilarating fight scenes and jaw-dropping concepts that made the original trilogy so spectacular, and instead offers a sort of half-hearted attempt at fumbling with the impersonation of Jerry Buckheimer's masterpiece. The soundtrack is still that of the glorious Hanz Zimmer, but the drive is gone. Some scenes momentarily boosted the edge and intensity like that present in the original trilogy, but these moments are not terribly frequent. Although Johnny Depp is wonderful, he is not any where near as wonderful as he has been previously, and really the entire film misses a mark set far too high by the brilliant original trilogy."
"Just-Scott","6","1","1","10 June 2011"," Plain, simple, and boring film
","I'll start with what I DID like: <br/><br/>1) Jack Sparrow was back to the character I knew and loved in the original PotC. I never liked how different they made him in the 2nd and 3rd movies, he was just too loony and bizarre in those 2, whereas in the first, he was smarter and in control of situations, even when it didn't seem like it (but still silly and funny).<br/><br/>2) Jack and Angelica actually had good chemistry. It was nice for Jack to have a flame with some background story. Scenes with them together were some of the best.<br/><br/>3) Good humor, just like the first 3, it didn't disappoint in that area.<br/><br/>4) Jack's escape scene was pretty sweet.<br/><br/>Aaaaandd.....that's about it. Now on to the critiques, I have 4 major points:<br/><br/>5) It started painfully slow with the worst opening of the series. Things didn't pick up until Jack's escape scene, which was quite far into the movie. Then things slowed down again for a while. I didn't feel like the movie REALLY started until Jack woke up on Blackbeard's ship, which was at least 30 minutes into it.<br/><br/>6) The plot was extremely simple and straight-forward. The first 3 are famous for having complicated plots, with many entities participating and things constantly changing, such as people changing sides, unexpected things popping up, etc. This one didn't really have that, it was just a straight-forward story. Pretty much everything that you expected to happen, happened. There was no anxiousness wondering how a big mess or unfavorable odds were magically going to work out in the end. I found myself being very un-interested in the rest of the movie because they weren't really giving me anything to look forward to. The biggest switch they pulled was Angelica actually being Blackbeard's daughter, which was pointless. <br/><br/>7) The action was severely limited. Where were the huge sea battles? We didn't get a single one! In a PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie, there wasn't a single battle at sea! The first 3 took place mostly at sea and had huge sea battles, this one had none, how extremely disappointing. And where were the epic swordfights ? After all the buildup toward it, the Barbosa-Blackbeard fight was short, unexciting, and pathetic. The Jack-Angelica fight was pretty good though, I'll give them that, but 1 good fight can't redeem an entire PIRATES movie.<br/><br/>8) Finally, the ending was just terrible. No major twists aside from Jack switching the cups, which wasn't huge. The Spanish just showed up, everybody stopped fighting and stepped aside while they destroyed the Fountain. As I mentioned earlier, the Barbosa-Blackbeard fight was boring and uneventful, and ends with Barbosa stabbing him from behind, minutes after they had even fought, how cheap and tacky. Blackbeard dying didn't even seem like that big of a deal since he had no special power away from his ship, which wasn't even mentioned until the very end, and makes no sense. Syrena comes out of nowhere and hands the chalices to Jack, that was convenient, not to mention bizarre. She had no idea what was taking place at the fountain, yet, as soon as Philip frees her she goes straight there to help them out? Finally, Jack plays the switch and saves Angelica's life. That's great and all, and you expect Angelica to be appreciative, especially after seeing that Blackbeard was going to sacrifice her to save himself, but no, she's mad at Jack for killing her dad, seriously? Then Jack maroons her on an island?? Was that really necessary? Angelica should have just been appreciative, and Jack saving her life could have been what brought them back together. Them being a couple that actually gets along could have been cool to see in the next movie. Then, in the very end, Barbosa gets the nice ship again while Jack is left with a bunch of bottles. Couldn't they have at least given him the Black Pearl back? C'mon, give me something good to end on.<br/><br/>Those are my main points, but there's plenty of problems in between too. Mostly from them not explaining things. Where does Blackbeard get his power from? Why is the ship magical? Or is it the sword that's magical? How does he zombify people and put ships in bottles? Why didn't he lose control of his zombies at the fountain? How does Barbosa instantly know how to use the magical sword at the end? Finding the ship with the chalices was way too easy. Why were zombies and mermaids marketed so strongly for this movie and then barely even utilized? Philip and Syrena stories were pretty much pointless. It's funny, we were promised a Pirates movie with pirates, zombies, and mermaids, and got very little of the 3! What even happened in this movie? Looking back, there really wasn't much meat to it, how did they fill up 2 and a half hours??? Another big question I have: Where exactly was the Fountain in the end? They went down into a cave, then made a puddle appear in the roof of the cave, went through the puddle and popped up in some forest with the Fountain. Based on how they got there, I figured this was some magical area that could only be reached through that portal, but then Philip climbs some rocks, runs through the woods, and finds Syrena who was still tied up at the same spot in the island. So basically, the Fountain was reachable just by searching the island, the cave and water portal were completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>I could get past all the unanswered questions, the original 3 had plenty of unexplained things as well, but it's mainly my 4 points that I had a problem with, which encompass the entire film. All the rest of the nonsense is just icing on this crap-cake."
"ChipNoirD","6","1","1","6 June 2011"," Here Thar Be Pirate Tropes (Minor spoilers)
","Minor spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>After what was a suitable wrapped up trilogy, one kind of has to wonder what more the Pirates series could bring to the table. One got the feeling that the ending of the third film didn't really lend itself to a sequel, despite the notion of Barbossa and Jack competing for the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>So exactly does this film bring to the table? Pretty much every pirate theme that the past three movies didn't have time to cover, all shoehorned into a fast, but somewhat lacking film. Some of the references are eye-rolling obligatory, ships in bottles, pegged legs, voodoo zombies, and cross dressing pirates to name just a few on a long list. Points for an unexpected Monty Python nod.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp are the chief returners from the franchise, and immediately steal whatever scene they are in, which are always entertaining, especially when the two are in the same scene. But this also serves as a sad reminder that the original cast of the trilogy are what drove it, and the absence of the crew is sorely felt. What we get instead is a more or less forgettable bundle of misfits without the built up charm of the original Black Pearly crew, who I suppose all conveniently got hanged. Damian O'Hare returns as Gillete, the ever ignorable...I'm not even sure what his job was. Kevin McNally returns as the everlovable Gibbs, but is easily pushed aside, and not really put to much use, as the movie makes not attempt to tell any background lore. Penelope Cruize is amusing as the fiery, vivacious Anne Bonne, even if the history geek in me rebels against the utter inaccurate name drop. Ian McShane however has a rough time portraying the infamous Blackbeard. Following deliciously despicable acts of Lord Beckette and Davey Jones, Black Beard just doesn't seem all that threatening or even hate-able.<br/><br/>This fourth plot stands simple, solid, and direct: England and Spain are competing to arrive at the Fountain of Youth, which subsequently is the target of Blackbeard. Jack, as per usual, is mixed up in the entire mess. There's some Moby Dick type subplots between Blackbeard and Barbossa, and an utterly irrelevant romance between a mermaid and holy man who seems far too eager to get into the mermaid's shell to be so pious as he claims to be, and a lot of other fluff. In short, anything that doesn't immediately involve Geoffry or Johnny immediately drags. The scriptwriter seemed to have realized this even as he struggled to make a cohesive story because the larger majority of the screen time is given to these two.<br/><br/>Wrapped up, this movie pretty much makes no references to the original three. Watch it before, during, or after. If the budget hadn't been so big, you'd expect this to go direct to DVD. A mediocre, but still enjoyable installment, but a washed up shadow of what made the first three work so well."
"ben-1118","7","1","1","6 June 2011"," Better than pts 2 and 3, not as good as pt. 1
","This fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean sees the series improve again, after two increasingly hard to follow sequels.<br/><br/>The story opts to omit the characters of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to the movie's benefit: while other side-kicks for Jack Sparrow are introduced (notably Penélope Cruz and Sam Claflin), they don't tear the story apart as Keira and Orlando did. We get a much more understandable plot here, with clear motivations and goals for the protagonists.<br/><br/>While I like this pt. 4 better than pts 2 and 3, I think it's still not as good as pt. 1; for there are less surprising twists, less endearing details, e.g., in the battle or pursuit scenes. Those feel more like routine here, the writers and director probably straining to get back to safer grounds after the bizarre excesses of pt. 3 (does anyone remember that battle/pursuit scene with the giant rotating wheel rolling away in the jungle?).<br/><br/>Overall, a good and well-crafted if in parts a bit tired fourth part of the franchise."

"iReviewFilms","6","1","1","27 May 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
","The swashbuckling pirates return in their latest adventure as Disney tries to cash in on older once successful ideas rather than conjure up some new material for our viewing pleasure. On Stranger Tides sees us return to a time after that of the first three films. No longer is the focus on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan who aren't included in the cast (neither is the prison dog!!) and whose story is considered to be finished in the third instalment, At World's End. Instead the story follows Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in his race to find the Fountain of Youth along with several other interested parties.<br/><br/>Jack is joined in this race by Barbossa- (Geoffrey Rush) now a profiteer working for the British Crown, Blackbeard- (Ian McShane) the most feared pirate on the seas along with his first mate Angelica (Penélope Cruz) and the Spanish armada who all want the power of the fountain for themselves. Throughout the quest they overcome challenges, encounter each other, run into mermaids and generally do as pirates do.<br/><br/>The movie gives out a bit of a 'same old same old' vibe with Jack elaborately escaping from captivity once again and fighting whilst balancing on wooden beams (distinctly familiar). It may have impressed in the first few films and despite being well executed is becoming decidedly stale as a concept in this one. I also felt that the inclusion of some sub-plots didn't add anything to the story (the priest/mermaid plot?) but rather detracted from it instead.<br/><br/>Despite this, those who are fans of Captain Jack Sparrow will not be disappointed as it certainly is better than the second and third instalments. Despite this one running it closer, it's a shame that they've never lived up to the original all the while being impervious to becoming box office flops.<br/><br/>The acting was mostly very good with Depp obviously returning to steal the show with his eccentric Sparrow creation but Rush, McShane and even Cruz put in their fair share to make the story believable. Both the set and clothing design departments show off their talents with impressive visuals to lap up and Zimmer's score does just enough to keep the movie flowing forward.<br/><br/>Overall this will keep you entertained with some good action scenes, comedy and a couple of strong performances but I'm still waiting for the series to return back to the heights of the first film which I don't think it ever will. There is guaranteed to be a fifth film (with or without Depp) but I feel that this should finally be laid to Davy Jones' locker while it can still escape with some credibility. Savvy? Ps. Once again I stuck to 2D and the general consensus I've got seems to suggest 3D is not quite worth extra pennies yet.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","There was half of me thinking another film would be expected, but another half thinking it would remain a trilogy, but I guess this fourth film was a reasonable idea, from director Rob Marshall (Chicago). Basically rumour is going around that Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is looking for a ship and a crew to join him in the search for the Fountain of Youth, but he knows this is not the case. Someone is pretending to be him to carry out this journey, and he, while on the run from the authorities, crosses paths with the person, it is a woman from his past, ruthless con artist Angelica Malon (Penélope Cruz). He is forced aboard the ship in question, the Queen Anne's Revenge, headed by the for a little while unseen Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane), and with some ideas of the bearings they make their way to find the fountain. Meanwhile, also on the expedition, now with the British Navy having lost the Black Pearl and his leg, is Jack's old nemesis Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), taking directions from Gibbs (Kevin McNally). All on the journey know that the fountain water's power to heal wounds and give eternal life will not work without the teardrop from a mermaid, these creatures may be beautiful but they are really vicious predators. After catching one of the mermaids and having many more dangerous and high action things happen, they all eventually make it to the island where the fabled fountain lies. In the end, they all find it, and there is a big fight for the use of it, between the pirates and the ""authorities"", but in the end the right user drinks, the bad guys get what they deserve, Angelica is dumped on an island alone, and Jack and Gibbs go on to another adventure, with the shrunken Black Pearl. Also starring This Is England's Stephen Graham as Scrum, Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena, Sam Claflin as Philip, Keith Richards as Captain Teague, Richard Griffiths as King George and Dame Judi Dench as Society Lady. Depp still manages to make you giggle and adore his stumbling slurry character, Cruz is sassy, McShane could have been slightly more nasty, and Rush does well with his time, the special effects are as always reliably great, the story is okay, and the action, such as the chases and occasional fights are fun, it is certainly better than At World's End was, an alright fantasy action adventure. Worth watching!"

","Being the fourth part in the series the general setting of this film will not have to be explained. It more or less continues the story where the third film left of. Jack has the map that leads to the fountain of youth, and is in need of a ship and a crew.<br/><br/>Missing most of the original crew this film has to make do with a lot of new people. This isn't bad - most of the new ones come across as fitting and make for a new setting. Personally I am missing some of the comical characters of the previous films though - especially the guy with the prosthetic eye and his mate. The pair of them made for an extra bit of comedy with their constant bickering and his fooling with the eye.<br/><br/>The film starts with a bang and explains the situation as well as it must - it sets out the stage for the rest of the film. As the action starts rolling it looks rather promising. But then...<br/><br/>Then the film gets to its main part and it becomes clear that it is a clear attempt at rinse and repeat of the success of the previous ones with different characters. Some bits are flaky, some are rather good, but overall the film is on the dull end of the spectrum. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>Finally we get to the 3D layer that was added. Again it can be said that it doesn't add a single thing. The few scenes that really worked were the standard gimmicky scenes where a sword sticks into the audience - please stop doing that, it's been done, it's becoming a drag. Either make a film for 3D or keep it 2D. This one is clearly made for the 2D market and that is just fine, just don't try to sell it as 3D to make some extra money.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 bored pirates"

","Another disappointment and wasted opportunity in what could've been a fantastic rollicking adventure.<br/><br/>First of all, I must say that I've always had a love/hate attitude towards the series. I love it simply because of its genre, the excellent production values, character designs and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the scale still always tilts towards ""hate"" and this is why: The script for ""On Stranger Tides"" is horrible. It is pure Hollywood lazy/formulaic scriptwriting with zero inventiveness. Characters are put in place just to drive the plot along, like gears inside a clock. They are lifeless and evoke no emotion. It is reflected also in the acting, as you can see quite clearly that most of the actors are just hamming it up and going through the motions to get to the end. (Apparently, the focus is on the ""end"" and not the ""journey"" here.) Even though I like the character Jack Sparrow, I haven't seen him in an adventure that was worth his salt. In this installment, he downright feels like a side character, as there is really nothing at stake for him other than a failed attempt at creating a past love interest whose life needs saving for stupid reasons. (Daughter of Al Swearengen turned to pirating on the high seas? c'mon!) There are too many things wrong with ""On Stranger Tides"" on too many levels that if I go on it will just seem like pure whining - which isn't my motive at all. In short, nothing made any sense nor drew any of my feelings or even ""stirrings"" as Jack Sparrow would like to put it.<br/><br/>Sad to say, I wanted to like this movie. The ingredients are all there for a great adventure but somehow they messed it up. (for instance, if they had made the final minutes of the movie to be the introduction instead, it would give it much more energy and swagger.) Just my two gold coins."

","VERY glad that the Captain Sparrow is back front and center! POC 3 was a disappointment because of the lack of screen time for Mr. Depp. This time the magic was in Jack performing sleight-of-hand (or foot, actually) rather than the grand cg illusions of POC 3. The escape from the palace and through the London streets was vintage Pirates--fast funny and thrilling.<br/><br/>Too bad the story was slow, witless and dull. It was a mistake to try to mix ""real"" history (the story of Blackbeard) with the Pirates' wonderfully weird mythos of pirates and their laws and customs.<br/><br/>Mr. Bloom's swordplay was sorely missed. The hand-to-hand combat scenes were slow and clumsy. Once again, Mr. Depp's footwork in the palm trees almost saved the day.<br/><br/>He so elegantly threw away the funniest lines, as usual. Especially nice were his ""counting names and naming fingers,"" and quip about the Spanish convent. The rest of the cast, especially Ms. Cruz, should take a few lessons. Even Mr. Rush telegraphs most of his amusing lines.<br/><br/>Captain Sparrow is back in form, but the story and supporting cast were not shipshape.

","I throughly enjoyed Pirates 1 and 2, but felt three was drifting off too much.. this one is the worst yet.<br/><br/>It starts off OK, wonderful sets of 18th century London and has the typical Pirates action from the very beginning. The first 15 minutes or so are quite entertaining however it then drifts into a disconnected story (losely based on several factual characters) and the continuation of the Jack Sparrow story. Not wishing to spoil, but it becomes all a bit too supernatural and ridiculous, there are moments of humour but few and far between. The location is clearly Hawaii and does not look remotely Caribbean which was rather annoying, perhaps it should have been called pirates of the Pacific.<br/><br/>Anyway, all that aside this is a poor reflection of the first two films and honestly it was disappointing, somewhat laboured and one couldn't help feel it's A sour end to what should have remained a trilogy."

The 3D completely worthless, what one is losing in brightness, contrast and eyes comfort, few 3D effects don't compensate.

","With a new director (Rob Marshall replacing Gore Verbinski), a new villain (Ian McShane as Blackbeard) and sans two of its lead stars (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley), the POTC franchise is indeed sailing into Stranger Tides. In fact, after the Verbinski trilogy that ended At World's End, this fourth instalment looks like it could use some rejuvenation - hence its plot about a quest for the mythic Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>However, while the pace is supposed to build up to a climax, ""On Stranger Tides"" seems to start off fast and frivolous - but gradually slackens in pace and content right to its ending.<br/><br/>When the movie opens, we find Capt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) landlubbing in London - and in search of a ship to skipper. However, he learns that someone is impersonating him and is busy recruiting a crew in a race against the Spaniards to look for the fountain of youth. At one of these recruiting stations, Jack runs into his father (Keith Richards!) and old flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz).<br/><br/>After the requisite sword play, drinking, looting and chases, Jack finds himself on board Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge, with Angelica as first mate! Besides the Spanish, a certain one-legged captain (Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa) is also looking for the said fountain - on behalf of the king of England. However, before they can reach the fountain, they must face a bevy of mesmerising men-eating mermaids and procure a tear from one of them, so as to put into effect the power of everlasting youth.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous movies, which had heavily-computerised creatures like Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, this one is less of a monster show. However, Depp still wears heavy eye shadow and is back in his usual wacky self as Capt Sparrow, having an audience with King George (Richard Griffiths) and even smooching Judi Dench before setting out to sea. Yes, it is ho-ho-ho and a bottle of fun in Merry Ole England and the pace slackens when the narrative sets sail. Well, at least until we get to the part about the ravenous mermaids, anyway.<br/><br/>Cruz takes over from Knightley as female lead but while the senorita can be as feisty as they come, the romantic angle is undeveloped. Instead she keeps the audience guessing as to whether she is the real daughter of Blackbeard. The romance factor comes in a subplot about an earnest missionary (Sam Claflin) and a captured mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena). The swashbuckling department isn't that well stocked either.<br/><br/>The fights look contrived and the movie lacks tension and suspense. The most 'violent' sequences are those concerning the mermaids - and they don't seem as menacing as they are enigmatic and fetching (with their chests well out of view, of course).<br/><br/>Among the cast, Rush is the most entertaining as Barbossa; Cruz earns her keep as the delectable Angelica, but McShane seems to have little to do except look fierce and frightful and occasionally kill someone. On the whole, it's more like the Pirates on Shallow Tides. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"

Very predictable ending. Anyone associated with this movie should be ashamed. Don't waste your money on this.

"colinrgeorge","4","3","6","23 May 2011"," On Tamer Tides
","Pirates of the Caribbean debuted atop a cresting wave, but after a hat trick of subpar sequels, this rickety franchise is all but shipwrecked. The fourth installment, On Stranger Tides, cements a downward spiral of diminishing creativity with Captain Jack Sparrow's most shallow adventure yet. Gone is director Gore Verbinski, whose surrealist sensibilities were the saving grace of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End. His leftfield replacement is Rob Marshall, the man behind the Academy Award-winning musical, Chicago.<br/><br/>Action is obviously not Marshall's forte, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to have expected better choreography. Marred by shapeless large-scale skirmishes, On Stranger Tides lacks the series' signature spunk. To that effect, personality walked the plank prior to the opening titles.<br/><br/>Granted, the characters of the Pirates universe have always been archetypes enlivened by smart performances, but even the novelty of Johnny Depp as our ne'er-do-well antihero is wearing itself thin. Likewise, Geoffrey Rush trotting out his Barbossa doesn't deliver the same impact four times over. Other familiar faces appear throughout this overlong narrative, but On Stranger Tides is better defined by its absentees and new recruits.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are the most obvious examples. Axing their dull relationship is no great loss, nor is the omission of squid-faced antagonist Davy Jones. Pity their replacements are less interesting still. An aloof Penélope Cruz might be the most boring woman on the seven seas, and her romance with Sparrow is dead in the water. Don't even get me started on the courtship of the cleric and the mermaid, which sounds like the setup to a bad joke. Deadwood's Ian McShane turns in a compelling interpretation of the legendary pirate Black Beard, but is criminally underused.<br/><br/>Weaving a tale that involves three factions pulling anchor to find Ponce de Leon's fabled fountain of youth, On Stranger Tides plays out like the world's most expensive snail race. And the audience ain't getting any younger. No epic is as simple as point A to B, but Pirates revels in getting sidetracked. Silly business like voodoo dolls, mermaid tears, and magic compasses needlessly postpone the endgame; ""It's not the destination so much as the journey,"" Sparrow quips. I'd be inclined to agree if either were any fun.<br/><br/>Of course it wouldn't be a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without CGI sea creatures and mystical trinkets, but both serve merely to inflate the plot — it's like catching a glimpse of the director backstage gesturing 'stretch, stretch!' Or perhaps it's proof of weak characterization that the inanimate objects prove just as interesting as our heroes.<br/><br/>With a gray-brown pallet and precious few postcards to remember it by, On Stranger Tides is inconsequential even by popcorn standards. The franchise has become increasingly inaccessible, and while this fourth installment stands better alone than At World's End, there is little incentive for viewers not yet familiar with the wily charms of Jack Sparrow to care. Accordingly, attendance for the Pirates films continues to drop, though the 90 million Marshall raked in over opening weekend is nothing to sneeze at. Word is a fifth installment is already in the works.<br/><br/>Realistically, Pirates won't stop until Disney runs it aground or Depp says no — and like any good captain with a multi-million dollar check in hand, he's going down with the ship."

","As this film had received some poor reviews in the press, I wasn't expecting too much. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! The story got off to a romping good start, was well paced, lots of Pirate Action, good sword fights, swinging on chandeliers etc , just what you want from a Pirate movie! The mermaids were also excellent. I saw it in 3D - and my only gripe is some of the action sequences were cut too fast. Fast-edits can work well in 2D, but in 3D can be disorientating.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally were all on excellent form, as were new shipmates Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane. McShane's Blackbeard was a worthy foil for Jack Sparrow and Barbossa. Worth mentioning, this Edward Teach bore no similarity to the friendly cap'n in Disney's 1968 movie Blackbeard's Ghost. Good to see Keith Richards - and also Richard Griffiths as King George. Don't believe any poor reviews. Hoist the Jolly Roger!"
"clairy_belle","3","3","6","23 May 2011"," Lacked Depth and Reason to Invest
","The initial takeaway is that this was a good movie. It was very visually striking, had an OK storyline and of course the film score was epic. However, upon a closer look On Stranger Tides was not as well written, witty, or emotionally engaging as the first three movies. Overall it left something to be desired. The opening was appealing simply because rarely do we Captain Jack Sparrow on land, let alone such a civilized and formal place such as London. It is already apparent though that the witty dialogue between Jack and Gibbs is lacking and that Jack's uncanny knack for escaping has been taken over the top making it less realistic and more cartoonish. <br/><br/>Angelica, Jack's long lost something (it is never made quite clear what), had a few good moments, but in general she did not inspire the audience's loyalty or investment in her as a character. There was never a moment when you were worried whether she would live or die. Jack and Angelica's chemistry was awkward at best. Similarly, Ian McShane who is obviously a very talented actor, failed to be the antihero that Barbosa and Davy Jones were. Blackbeard simply was not the endearing bad-guy that post-moderns love. <br/><br/>There were so many loose ends and unexplained lucky turn of events. This film could have altogether done away with the Spanish fleet and the ""religious boy"" Philip who was obviously only there to coax shallow feelings out the audience and a tear from the mermaid. Also, where did Blackbeard's power come from? Obviously, the sword controlled the boat, but what about his ability to create zombie men, put ships in bottles and perform voodoo? The mermaid Syrena also brought with her a few sloppily taken care of details. Blackbeard ties her up to burn in the sun, but we'd previously already seen her being carried through the sun with no effect and later the sun simply melted away her fins revealing legs. Why does Syrena bring back the chalices to Jack, who she has not really interacted with up to this point? Seems like an easy fix. Finally, why does Jack leave Angelical stranded? In fact, who cares whether she is left there or not?<br/><br/>This film also had more religious elements to it than any of the other three movies. People of faith might be excited at the talk of souls being saved and not placing your trust in magic, but these values are shallow and short-lived. The most ridiculous character in the movie was Philip who developed little during the film and whose faith caved with the sight of the mythical mermaid. He was an insipid object of mockery. The Spanish fleet's destruction of the Fountain of Youth reeked of Crusade. The age ol' switch the cup trick forces Blackbeard's redemption upon him, and it is the magic that restores Angelica's life.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is always a crowd pleaser, but he even seemed to lack the lovable flair that usually lights up the screen. The ending was just as colorless as the rest of the movie. When asked by Gibbs why he didn't drink from the fountain and choose to live forever, Jack answers, ""But better to not know which moment may be your last, every morsel of your entire being alive to the infinite mystery of it all. And who's to say I won't live forever, eh? Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth. I have no saying it, Gibbs. It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy?"" Wouldn't it have been easier to have had this conversation in the beginning and skipped the rest? This film had no depth, no reason, no investment, no point."
"ced_yuen","Null","3","6","23 May 2011"," Surprisingly boring, and fails to salvage this soulless wreck of a franchise
","'Pirates Of The Caribbean' started off as a single, surprisingly good, film. With the addition of two poor sequels, it became an embarrassing franchise. Part 4 has a new story, mostly new characters, and barely a reference to parts 2 and 3. Clearly, it tries to distance itself from past mistakes – only it doesn't get very far.<br/><br/>'On Stranger Tides' sees Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) looking for the Fountain of Youth. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has the same idea - as do the English, the Spanish, and new villain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Oh, and Penelope Cruz. There is no real reason for all the sudden interest in this mystical fountain - it is merely an excuse to kick-start the Caribbean Wacky Races.<br/><br/>On paper, this film should have worked. It features the legendary Blackbeard. There are mermaids and zombies. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are nowhere to be seen, leaving more room for Depp and Rush to antagonise each other. Despite all of this, the experience is surprisingly boring.<br/><br/>One of the film's biggest problems is that it mistakes action for entertainment. Swords are unsheathed every few minutes, which leads to a gratuitous amount of swashbuckling. All of it is chaotic - none of it is memorable. There is never a sense of purpose or consequence, so there is never any tension. Boredom should never be an appropriate response to a sword-fight and yet, in Pirates 4, it is inevitable.<br/><br/>Slapstick humour is given the same more-is-better approach as the action and becomes just as much of a farce. In one scene, for example, several characters all try to capture a glass vial and it ends up as a painfully unfunny game of Pirates Hot Potato. After eight years, relying on this sort of gag is nothing short of desperate.<br/><br/>Do not expect Jack Sparrow to save this film. Johnny Depp does an impressive job, as always, but strangely there is not enough his of character. The film is more about Barbossa than it is about Jack. Barbossa has always been a deeper, more interesting character, but it is nonetheless disappointing that the star of the film becomes an accessory.<br/><br/>Then there are the newcomers. Ian McShane is great to watch as Blackbeard. He has great presence, and is menacing enough without resorting to saying ""arrrrrr"". Unfortunately, his character is severely underdeveloped. He is given no back-story and it is never explained how he possesses supernatural powers. He also doesn't have much to do, which undermines his reputation as ""the pirates that all pirates fear"".<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz plays Blackbeard's daughter in an entirely pointless role. Her cleavage, the main focus of several shots, has more presence than her character. As Jack Sparrow's old flame she has the potential to make him a deeper character, but nothing comes of this apart from a few laboured innuendos.<br/><br/>The mermaids are refreshingly creepy and their 10-minute segment is genuinely entertaining. Blackbeard's ship is very impressive; it is run by voodoo and can be remote-controlled by a sword. So it's not all bad, but when these are the film's highlights, something is seriously wrong.<br/><br/>It is difficult to say if the film is any worse than parts 2 and 3, but it is certainly no better. 'On Stranger Tides' is not as fun or as epic as it tries to be, and fails to salvage this soulless wreck of a franchise. Sadly, that won't stop Disney from trying to make another sequel. Please, don't encourage them."

Not much of that two hours is spent on dialog and story. Some people might not want that but then the rest just seems rather empty and distracting for the sole purpose of being distracting.<br/><br/>I loved the first film but all the mystery seems to be gone from this franchise.

","So if you thought Pirates 3 was overwrought and overwritten, bogged down by questions about eternal life and love, then maybe you'll like the new one. I found it underwritten, under-produced, and generally kinda lame. All the characters are underdeveloped. Geoffrey Rush pretty much took the movie, in my opinion, and was a welcome departure from the otherwise dialing-it-in aspect of the others. And yes, I include Johnny Depp in that. Love Penelope Cruz but her character had a huge amount of promise and not much depth. Same for Blackbeard. Actors can only go as far as the script lets them go, and while it needed a lot of tightening and editing that it didn't get, this script was chopped to the bone at every turn. If you're going to include several different intertwining stories, and they do, then you either have to go for the long movie or fail to develop much of anything. I'd far rather have a long movie that actually does something with the characters than a bare-bones plot that merely uses the characters as props. <br/><br/>The thing about Pirates 2 and 3 is that the movies started to take themselves a bit too seriously--but that added depth and atmosphere. Davy Jones really was kind of scary; the East India Trading Company really was pretty evil. There were religious and political overtones that added a bit of gravitas. If you didn't like that, you'll like the new one. If you did, you'll be disappointed. Even the religious references in Pirates 4 never get past the surface; there is no actual grappling by any character with issues of theology or redemption. <br/><br/>Visually, the movie had a strangely cramped effect. The characters spend a lot more time on land than in the other movies and there is very little of the feeling of actually being out on the open seas. The budget for cinematography obviously was a lot less generous than for the first three movies.<br/><br/>But if you just want some sword fights and a few explosions and a little bit of supernatural stuff, plus Johnny Depp having fun revisiting Captain Jack, go for it."

","'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' should effectively be renamed 'The Captain Jack Sparrow Show' as the fourth film in the always popular pirate franchise is nothing more than a two-hour vehicle for Johnny Depp to show off all his talent and charm, which eventually wears thin after the first hour of the film. Aside from the world on Depp's shoulders, the plot is disjointed and the rest of the crew are mere puppets to Depp's act.<br/><br/>While the first three films were concerned with the antagonist Davy Jones and Sparrow's one ship the Black Pearl, 'On Stranger Tides' is a more straight-forward, linear action-adventure film with Captain Jack Sparrow becoming involuntarily part of the heinous pirate Blackbeard's (Ian McShane) sailing staff to help them find the mythical 'fountain of youth'. Also on the ship is the empowered primary commander Angelica, who is the First Mate in charge of the Queen Anne's Revenge, while a few other characters from the previous films make their presence noted in the form of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Lieutenant Groves (Greg Ellis), Lieutenant Gillette (Damian O'Hare) and Captain Teague (Keith Richards).<br/><br/>The plot resonates throughout the film in a very stereotypical manner, Jack Sparrow makes a wise-cracking joke, this results in a chase or fight sequence, which is then promptly ended before the journey continues and the same sequence is repeated over and over again in a slightly different location. Until the final ten minutes of the film, nothing new is not attempted nor is nothing old expanded upon, Rob Marshall has certainly taken the safe route of throwing together a recognisable, albeit fragmented, formula and hoping the audience will jump on board for over two hours. For the fans of the film franchise this will most likely work, to ordinary cinema patrons; boredom ahoy!<br/><br/>Another flaw is in the form of introducing the missionary Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), unlike the previous three instalments in which Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) provide the crux of the film's morality and principles, in 'Stranger Tides' there is no character in the primary cast who can accomplish this, so Swift's story and subsequent relationship seems to have been hastily thrust into the plot with no regards for how undeniably boring and tedious it actually is. He therefore attempts to also add a bit of humility and humanity among the blood-thirsty pirates and the psychopathic Blackbeard, but with his little screen time and over-acting this is never accomplished and the promising English actor becomes nothing more than a kind religious zealot with a muscular abdomen.<br/><br/>Despite Depp's persistent and continual screen time, he does still provide adequate comedic relief, his best wisecracks seem to appear at the very moment when the plot and story seem to be slowing down, but neither the script, direction or rest of the cast and crew do anything else to keep this fourth film from being anything less than a cinematic sinking ship. It will no doubt quite easily gross it's estimated two-hundred million dollar budget back within the next four weeks, and subsequently facilitate a fifth film in the franchise, but 'On Stranger Tides' is definitely the weakest effort in the 'Pirates' series so far."

","Personally I have been a big fan of the POTC series and have seen the first and best many a time. You may think I am a big kid but being a 13 year old you are allowed these privileges without receiving too much ridicule .The new film 'On Stranger Tides' was a chance to redeem the series after what many saw as two below par sequels (I personally enjoyed them). The fourth instalment does not disappoint, with use of the dependable Johnny Depp and the classic POTC formula used in the first film to rescue its few faults. It also helps how it is a separate film to any other and gets all of the story done in one go. The effects are not as impressive as 1,2&3 yet it makes up for this with a witty script. The film does turn a bit Indiana Jones towards the end but there are enough twists and turns along the way to keep you guessing, although predictability does tend to set in every so often. Ian McShane and Geoffrey Rush put in solid performances as does Penelope Cruz, but it is Depp who steals the show again. We may have seen him 4 times now but I don't think that we will ever get tired of him."

"IllusionOfLife","4","4","10","20 May 2011"," All Jack and No Story Makes Pirates a Dull Film
","I really hate to say it, but Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is just boring. While the second and third films were derided for their muddled and overcomplicated plots, this film hardly has enough story to fill a napkin and a serious lack of solid direction. The characters are lifeless and hollow, and even in the midst of action scenes nothing terribly interesting ever happens. <br/><br/>The Curse of the Black Pearl is, of course, the best Pirates film to date, but after re-watching all three movies over the past couple of days, I've reaffirmed my opinion that Dead Man's Chest and At World's End are worthy, if flawed, followups to the original. Yes, the latter two films definitely suffered from the fact that they began production without a finished script; Dead Man's Chest tried to do too many different things without taking time to flesh any of them out all the way, and At World's End was left with the impossible task of properly tying up all these disparate plot threads. However, despite these flaws, they were still enjoyable movies from start to finish due to good characters, and great direction by Mr. Gore Verbinski. Verbinksi gave the series a solid direction and a life that this fourth installment is sorely lacking. <br/><br/>On Stranger Tides starts out loosely referencing the end of At World's End in which Jack had taken the map to find the legendary Fountain of Youth. We're quickly reintroduced to the only three returning cast members: Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Mr. Gibbs; there's some fun stuff in the beginning, but after the Fountain of Youth is introduced as a MacGuffin it quickly devolves into monotony. Part of the problem lies in just the structure of the story this time around, in On Stranger Tides they broke away from the structures of the previous films in order to tell an Indiana Jones-esque adventure film however, the characters and settings of Pirates of the Caribbean do not lend themselves well to that kind of movie. And speaking of characters, with the exception of the returning cast, they are all just completely one- dimensional and uninteresting. Black Beard, who is supposedly ""the pirate all pirates fear"" is particularly bad. It seems like they were trying to go for a villain somewhere between that of a Saturday morning cartoon and a silent psychopath, but in the end it just ended up feeling phoned in. There's also a half-baked side story between two characters seemingly trying to fill the role of Will and Elizabeth's characters from the previous films, but again, the acting is completely cardboard and it isn't effective. <br/><br/>As I said, this film is just tragically boring, you can't empathize with the characters, you don't feel compelled to ponder any of the mystery, and even the action sequences aren't enough to make you sit forward in your seats. It's a meandering, poorly directed, boring mess. Disney is apparently planning a fifth and sixth film for the series, and if that's the case, I beg, and I plead: please bring back Gore Verbinski. On Stranger Tides is proof that the heart of the series lies not in the action, the locations, or even Jack Sparrow himself; Verbinski was the heart and soul of Pirates of the Caribbean, and without him the franchise has been left hopelessly adrift. <br/><br/>Rating: Zzzzzzzz..."
"robastyk","3","3","7","23 May 2011"," Wanted to Buy: Competent Writers
","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has always been fluff. After all, what can one expect from movies derived from an amusement park ride? Given that genesis the first two movies were a rather entertaining ride. The over-long sequence of Jack in the bleached out desert from which he must be rescued in the third film served as an extended metaphor for the life that was visibly draining out of the series. Now we are into a ""walking dead"" continuation of Capt. Jack Sparrow's biography as it moves from bang to whimper to bleached skeleton.<br/><br/>As a filmed amusement park ride the basic premise of the Pirates films is stringing together fights and chases like (black) pearls on a slim filament of plot. Unfortunately for On Stranger Tides the filament is absent. What we get is a disjunct pile of, to be kind, faux pearls. Each action sequence is brief fun but they all seem to be rolling around independently. First Mate Gibbs is back but only as a creaky plot device. The same is true of the male half of what becomes the couple in love sub-uh-plot that vestigially fills the gap left by the absence of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>Rob Marshall's direction isn't much to write home about but it sometimes serves which is far, far more than I can say for the script, that missing filament. It starts out promisingly enough with picking up the teaser from the end of At World's End about the Fountain of Youth and even manages to end on the same theme for the most part. In between though we have hackneyed cliché after hackneyed cliché and nothing near as imaginative as the ""fruit kebab"" or water wheel sequences of past films. In the course of this attempt to construct a coherent movie the writers senselessly rip off past literature and movies from The Odyssey to Hans Christian Andersen to Moby Dick and even Splash. I searched in vain for a writer involved in the script who had a single original idea. In fact, even the the 3-D seems tacked on and the Spaniards who open the movie seem like an accidental afterthought.<br/><br/>Take, for example, poor Ian McShane's Blackbeard. He appears to have some magical control over his ship through the cutlass he carries at his side. We don't get any explanation even in exposition for this power. Does this power belong to Blackbeard? To the sword? Is it imparted by the ship to is captain? We never know. There's a reference to Blackbeard having been beheaded at some point in the past. It's there in the movie but it's one more loose...ah...pearl rolling around the pitching deck without a filament to make anything coherent of it. And Ian McShane is no Bill Nighy. There's as little energy in his Blackbeard as there is in the script itself.<br/><br/>Though the direction is pedestrian - deadly for an amusement park ride - and the script an incoherent mess that doesn't stop the actors from trying to inject some life. Johnny Depp minces around and tries mightily to extract some wit from the not-quite dialogue with which the alleged writers have afflicted him. Geoffrey Rush is a wonderful, delightful, talented actor despite the fact that he's been shamelessly ripping off Robert Newton from the first film in this series onward. Had there been some real point to his presence in this movie I'm sure that he could have delivered the kind of performance that made us so glad he'd returned in for At World's End. Penelope Cruz, besides being beautiful, is also a wonderful actress, just watch her in her films with Pedro Almodovar to confirm my opinion. In this movie she's mostly window dressing and the main attempt to replace Keira Knightley. Ian McShane is the actor for whom I feel both the most and least sympathy. He does what he can with the script pages he's given but I couldn't help wishing that he too had more of a chance to break out of the prison to which the lack of a script condemned him. Then I think that he could have made more of an effort. Perhaps it's McShane's fault but I think he could have done much better.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides is worth the price of a matinée on a rainy afternoon. Johnny Depp is fun. Geoffrey Rush is fun too though less so. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and delivers the line which will undoubtedly become the quest and McGuffin for the inevitable fifth film. Still, unless Disney can find a good writer(s) for the next script and an imaginative director, I'll wait for Pirates of the Caribbean: To No Real Purpose to show up on cable before I watch it."
"skorzeni","10","2","4","4 June 2011"," Another great adventure!
","I'm also weary of people trashing the Pirates of the Carribbean movies. I thought they were imaginative and great fun. The latest, ""On Stranger Tides"" was excellently done. I've seen the movie twice, both times in 3-D. The first time, I thought the movie probably wasn't as good as the first three, as Captain Jack Sparrow wasn't as many steps ahead of me as he was in the first three movies. However, after seeing it a second time, I think Captain Sparrow did a great job of planning things out, given the circumstances. Not as many betrayals going on in this movies as in the second two in which he can strut his stuff.<br/><br/>I just love how the supernatural is reintroduced in these movies. Not especially gory, just exquisitely spooky. White Camp Bay would now give me the frights as it did the sailors in that movie. Excellent! A lot of people put in a lot of work in order to make this movie, and they did a spectacular job. They deserve our praise and our support. Unfortunately, I'm now addicted and am eagerly waiting the next movie. I sure hope there is another one."
"lisamba","9","2","4","29 May 2011"," Good movie
","I took 6 teens to this movie and we all enjoyed it. I was a little weary when they had a preacher character in it whether there was going to be some cursing against God but it was all done in good taste. They have a little voodoo in it, but not bad. And of course they have skeletons and Zombie type of people but they just have a lot of scares on the face. This was not too scary for me(I get scared easy). The mermaids could be a little scary to kids with vampire like fangs. This was a fun movie to watch and not to scary. They film part in England and most of it in Hawaii. I wish I knew how they did some of the trick on the screen because some are really cool."
"DonFishies","7","2","4","29 May 2011"," Enjoyable, but not as extraordinary as it could have been
","Although it provided an absurd amount of fun and adventure, not to mention one of the most iconic film characters of the past decade, I kind of wish Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl failed miserably and just became a cult hit. Despite enjoying both of the cash-grabbing sequels that followed the first time, rewatching and further recollections of the events that transpire have proved the films to be miserable, messy and often times inanely silly attempts at trying to recreate the magic of the first film, but failing on almost all counts. So you can immediately see where the skepticism comes in when preparing to watch On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in the franchise. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back in London, where he finds out about an impending trip to find the previously teased Fountain of Youth. While he is not really prepared to go on a quest to find it for the King of England like Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is, he does get roped into coming alongside former flame Angelica (Penélope Cruz) who is also searching for it. And her father, the captain of her ship, just happens to be the notorious pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane). <br/><br/>Even though it may not sound like much (especially after the unbearable amount of subplots that seem to describe this franchise), On Stranger Tides still manages to dedicate plenty of time to a few story lines and each of the main characters. But this is not nearly as terrible as it may sound. Rather wisely, this is the shortest film in the series by a long shot, and it never feels nearly as stretched out as the rest. The majority of fat has been trimmed, and the story follows as straight a path as it can as these pirates journey to find the mythical fountain. There are no silly anecdotes and minuscule character scenes devised to pad out the running time and in turn, make the film obscenely lengthy. There are no useless supporting characters designed merely to provide some sort of wacky comedic effect using their fake body parts, asinine methods of speech or general stupidity. In fact, outside of Depp and Rush, the only returning non-cameo character is Kevin McNally's Gibbs, who is even more downplayed than I thought he would be. <br/><br/>As wonderful as this may sound, it comes at a price – there are no real standout characters in the film at all, and this includes returning characters. Blackbeard is built up to be an evil dictator and heinous villain, but they barely give McShane any time to let us see that side of his character. He gets a pretty awesome introduction, then sits back and looks bored for the rest of the film. The addition of Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as an unconventional lovestruck pair may remind audiences of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but they lack chemistry and come off more annoying and forced than anything else. Rush seems to have been toned down and held back from stealing any scenes or time from anyone. Cruz looks like she is enjoying herself, and seems to be getting the most enjoyment out of what her character says and does. But even with the conflicting emotions Angelica displays at every turn, we never really get the opportunity to feel for her as a character. <br/><br/>Which leaves us with the former Captain Jack. Depp has been wisely dialed back, and is more conventional in his zany, over-the-top antics. He is more in tune with his Oscar-nominated performance in Black Pearl than he is with his amped up, overcooked roles in the films that followed. He is the best part about On Stranger Tides, and it is because he actually looks like he is attempting to act, as opposed to doing his very best to make a complete ass of himself. He has a lot of great lines and even better character moments, and these help bring back that initial sense of fun we had when we were first introduced to him eight years ago. <br/><br/>The special effects are just as great as always, even though there are no show stopping additions like Davy Jones and his crew. It actually felt more realistic than I imagined it would, and a whole lot less fantastical. I can say I appreciated the more minimalistic approach, and liked that the film did not really overdo it in any specific instance. A scene involving the attempted procuring of a mermaid is of particular note, not just because it is the lengthiest and most significant action scene in the film, but because it is done incredibly well and effectively. The 3D offers very little to the film, but rather surprisingly does not get in the way of any of its visuals. <br/><br/>For all that works and fails in On Stranger Tides, I found that the film provided a light amount of entertainment and mild enjoyment, but not much else. They just could have done so much more with this film than what ended up in the final product. It certainly made up for the past two entries in the series, but it feels like it has come much too late. The franchise is dead, and this last hurrah is simply that. It may set up for future sequels, but could easily just be content at going out with a finale that was satisfying enough. I know we inevitably have not seen the end of Jack Sparrow, but I can only hope with a bit more effort, they can make another movie that feels like it could reside on the same plain as the original film. <br/><br/>7/10.<br/><br/>(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"mitchelldentalcare","2","2","4","25 May 2011"," The bottom of the Rum Barrel
","What we are missing here is a decent story, characters we feel a connection with, humor and an actual villain. The 3D effects were decent and the Mermaids were the best part IMO. The characters are weak at best, including everyone's beloved Captain Jack Sparrow. Poor performances abound in this picture. The most disappointing is how they portrayed the most feared pirate in maritime history... Blackbeard. Here's where the director really drops the ball. Also some of the newly introduced characters seem like filler and never add to the film. As excited as I was after seeing the first movie, I'm equally utterly disappointed in this installment. Seeing how this series has become a cash cow I'm sure we can expect more mindless dibble packaged as a summer blockbuster."

","I wasn't all that excited about another ""Pirates"" movie, having liked the first one but not really remembering it all too well, seeing the second one but not remembering what happens in it at all, and not even seeing number three after the royal slating it got from most.<br/><br/>I Have too admit though that I enjoyed number 4. These sort off action movies make a nice change from all the super hero ones we are force fed these days, even if it reeks off self importance, and expects us too cheer in our dozens at all the hundreds off times Johnny Depps ""Jack Sparrow"" is mentioned.<br/><br/>I Liked the story too. Which sees Sparrow join forces with a new crew (which is awesome considering I missed the last flick) led but an always great Ian McShane, and a great looking Penelope Cruz. Even Stephen Graham was in there. So I was loving the cast.<br/><br/>Film has ships and sword fights so what else would you want from a pirate movie? How about some mermaids? These creatures made the film differ enough from previous efforts even if there could off been more off an effort from Depp (whose now just sailing along in the part off Sparrow) or more action or laughs in the movie. I enjoyed it reasonably enough though. It was a decent sequel really that stands on its own."
"adamddodson","3","2","4","24 May 2011"," Poor.
","The worst of the lot in my opinion. Even though they tried to cram as many things as possible into the film, I was completely and utterly bored, leading me to fall asleep at one point.<br/><br/>It was like they took all the dull parts from 2 and 3 and mashed them all together to create this film.<br/><br/>The script was very poor, Depp was not funny, more irritating. Blackbeard is supposed to be a pirate that all pirates fear, I saw nothing of this, I just saw a man pointing his sword a lot.<br/><br/>Another thing that really bugged me, is the fact that pretty much all the fight scenes happened at night. There are probably 3 occasions where this film is set in the daytime which leads to you not being able to see much at all, I just don't see the point.<br/><br/>Disney should have called it a day after Curse of the Black Pearl as it has all gone down hill from there. I'm really annoyed that I wasted my money on this film, if this film spawns another trilogy then it will be a sad day, I am sick of money grabbing awful films."

Except for the mermaids, it is a straight forward pirate adventure as distinguished from the Zombie, monster laden things that made up much of Pirates 2.<br/><br/>Unless you are a die-hard Pirates fan you can save the IMAX 3D up charge. Many of the scenes are night scenes that come off dark. Most of the 3D effects are swords coming at you. The movie is a tad too long. Perhaps too much time was devoted to religion. The after credits scene is not worth the wait if you're in need of a restroom.<br/><br/>Pirates IV meets the requirements of a summer blockbuster. It is brash, loud and a lot of fun.

With the endless funny jokes, to the scary and hair raising mermaids, to the awesome action, This is one Pirates that you should not miss! Believe me when I say it, Its all that good! Johnny Depp was amazing as normal, no matter how many critics said he was toned down. Penelope Cruz was good enough to fit right into the cast, without being annoying. Ian McShane was, as he puts it ""I'm a Bad man!"", very evil. But the best actor award goes to Geoffrey Rush! Even with his peg leg, He was the best by far! His lines and actions made the movie!

","The Pirates franchise has always been a perfect blend of action, visuals, and comedy. As for the 4th installment, these three things are not only still part of the major experience but more powerful than ever.<br/><br/>For starters, there is way too much going on in front of the camera for you to be easily distracted with a text or people entering and leaving the theater(which I highly doubt there will be much exiting). Secondly, if there is ever what seems to be a dull moment then Hans Zimmer's fantastic as usual score will zap you right back in to the movie. Finally, the scenery alone is worth the time and at least a matinée priced ticket. So, in the end Pirates does not require a long list of the good and the bad in the movie. These movies are meant for the shier pleasure of being entertained with a more than sufficient amount of eye candy and great scripts with the right touch of family/adult comedy.<br/><br/>As for Depp, he has pleasured the screen with many great performances, but Captain Jack Sparrow will never walk the plank on the ship of his most memorable."

"dvc5159","6","2","4","20 May 2011"," The funniest of the ""Pirates"" films.
","Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow and here he gets the bulk of this fourth entry in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series. This is a great thing, because I was honestly getting tired of Will and Elizabeth's predicament in the previous two movies... and not enough Jack. I guess the producers thought so too, so we have more Jack Sparrow now in this movie that any other ""Pirates"" before.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine anyone other than Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's become sort of an iconic movie character, the heroic outlaw who can crack a joke in a time of danger or peril, that everyone loves and wants to be (sort of). He fights and moves in situations that Jackie Chan would be proud of. In short, he's a classic movie hero, and it's no different in this installment. Depp still gives his all despite the previous two movies colossal scale potentially tiring him of the role.<br/><br/>However, Sparrow isn't the only one to crack a one-liner. Almost every major character, even the villains, have at least one very funny line. It's as if the screenwriters were having a breeze writing this installment. The beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz joins the franchise as Angelica, an old flame from Jack's past who seems to still want to either kill him or love him - it's nice to see Cruz lightening up from all those grueling dramas and have some fun on an adventure like this. Ian McShane as the villain Captian Blackbeard has a menacing atmosphere around him that makes him quite unsettling. And Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa, looking not too good since the last time we saw him, but nevertheless still as wily as ever. It seems his and Jacks' characters were reduced from mortal enemies from the first film to bickering rivals here. The chemistry between all of the actors are great.<br/><br/>""Chicago"" director Rob Marshall takes over Gore Verbinski for this installment. It's made clear during the sword-fighting sequences - they are well-choreographed and well-filmed as if it's some sort of musical. Marshall does his job well, as per the lavish production design, great camera work, good special effects (at times really pushing the PG-13 rating and Disney's family-friendly reputation at once) and grand music score by Hans Zimmer (who else?)<br/><br/>However, the film suffers for three problems - One, the lack of character development for some of the characters who, admittedly, serve little purpose to the story whatsoever apart from making them potential comebacks for the next installment. Two, too choppy editing during the sword-fights. They are nearly incomprehensible to watch due to the fast cuts, and it ruins the good camera work and choreography and strips their adrenaline factor away. Three - said sword-fights and other action sequences were filmed too dark during the night scenes, something the 3D viewers will not appreciate (understatement). I saw this in 2D and that's good enough, you don't need an extra dimension to bring you into Jack's world.<br/><br/>I found this more enjoyable than ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End"". The most lighthearted of the ""Pirates"" films, this one was on a smaller scale, and had tons more humor than the previous two, and most notably more Captain Jack than ever before. See it for the laughs and Depp. Grab the popcorn and enjoy.<br/><br/>I hope the action sequences are improved in the next installment, however.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 68/100"
"gautam_devs","6","2","4","23 May 2011"," For Jacky's fans only.
","This time even Cap. Jack Sparrow couldn't save the sinking ship. This movie is just for hardcore fans of Johnny Depp and his mesmerizing avatar as Cap. Jack Sparrow. As long as he is on the screen everything is good otherwise its all boredom. But even he has nothing much to play with this fourth time around though he is the center of the story. What I missed dearly was his ROYAL ENTRY that he had made in all the previous three outings. One thing everyone has said about this movie that this shortest movie in the series feels the longest is also true. They have dragged the story (for me there was no story they just linked some events after events). A lot of new characters are introduced apart from bringing back the old friend-foe-ally Cap. Hector Barbossa and Gibbs. Both are in their usual elements but it hurts to see the lead villain of ""the curse of the black pearl"" in nothing kind of role. Penelope Cruz as Angelica, Sparrow's ex, looks stunning but I never found that chemistry between them. The chemistry between Jack and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) had much more spark than this one. Ian McShane as Blackbeard doesn't create the effect that Geoffrey Rush had created with Barbossa in the first one and Bill Nighy in the later two installments. The action choreography is wasted as the most scenes are too dark. Rest like cinematography, visual effects, special effects, BG score are as usual. And in direction Rob Marshall has given nothing new to the movie. To be fair the matter provided was not of that quality for any director. Its amazing that when I watched it, I didn't find it that bad but as I m writing all this I realize that I haven't written anything good about it. Whatever money this movie makes (sure it will make a lot) and the last two have made is only due to Johnny Depp. So final words: ""If you are a die-hard fan of the amazing CAP. JACK SPARROW like me then you are going to watch it anyways but if u r not then wait for the DVD mate!""<br/><br/>Savvvvyyyyyyy ???"

It seems to me that Jack Sparrow got smarter in the beginning.<br/><br/>It began with him finding out that someone was impersonating him. In the bar scene, he finally found out who it was. It was his old love Angelica (Cruz). The last few lines at the end of last conversation between Jack and Angelica was something that I wasn't expecting to hear This movie had a lot of action in it. The final battle scene was thrilling.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie did just fine without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly.

","It's Jack and he's back! Captain Jack Sparrow! Getting an upgrade from the last three pirate films, On Stranger Tides to most Pirate fans was questionable from the beginning. That is however when it came to the call of what the script would look like, it would seem Jack Sparrow's character would be getting a face-lift. The film is loosely based on a book by the same subtitle name, which included the historical pirate character, Blackbeard. Since several characters from the last three films did not return to the casting call, the script had to change. There are honorable nods to the original film, Curse of the Black Pearl, yet script writers pushed it back farther to tell a little bit of Jack's personal life, of which gave us a new character, Angelica, who in term has a very important role in the film. It may not measure up to the original 2003 summer blockbuster, but it certainly has some exciting twists in swords and in plot. The film even suggests that it could have easily been a better sequel than Dead Man's Chest in the writers had known better. However, Pirate fans or not, this should not be missed for any movie goer! It rocks!"

This lacks a good story, there was nothing unique in this movie, it was bit dragging and boring. 3D has no effect on the movie, sometimes I watched it without glasses and there was no difference.<br/><br/>There are some good scneries in the movie.<br/><br/>Over all this is not an entertaining one. I think Jony Depp shouldn't have signed this.<br/><br/>Major disappointment was that I had expected a lot from this movie and I was a great fan of Pirates of the Caribbean series.<br/><br/>After watching this I felt I just wasted my money and time.<br/><br/>many thanks,"

","If you're like me, a huge fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and an even bigger fan of Johnny Depp, you are very excited to see the latest installment. I had the honor of seeing On Stranger Tides last night and I am very pleased to say that it met every expectation that I had. The humor was definitely at it's highest point since the first movie. The new characters kept the story fresh and interesting. Although Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are missing from this film, there is no void that they left, and if you love the 'young love' aspect that they brought to the screen, two of the new characters will provide a different romance story that will keep you just as happy.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is, as always, the star. He shines in this latest movie in every way. He keeps things exciting and steals every scene that he's in. His relationship with Angelica is a great way to see a new side to our beloved character while still keeping his care-free, charming personality we all fell in love with.<br/><br/>When I read critic reviews for this film, I was nervous. But fans, fear not. Critics seem to overlook the magic of these movies. If you loved the first three, the new one will be a movie you enjoy.<br/><br/>CAPTAIN JACK IS BACK!"
"hotspur75","8","2","4","20 May 2011"," A Terrific Theme Park Ride
","It still amazes me that all of this came out of a theme park ride. That said, the action should be like a roller coaster and this didn't not always happen in the first three films. In the words of Steve Urkle, fret not my pet. Such is not the case here.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp finally displayed a sense of knowing he's a bada-- as Captain Jack Sparrow. He always came off a bit too aloof in the previous films, but here he is in fine form with attitude, swagger, and a glint in his eye that belies his tomfoolery. He knows what he's doing even when it doesn't look like he knows what he's doing, and he knows it.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz has rarely shown me anything interesting, even in her serious roles. She has a few pouty scenes here, but action seems to suit her well. There is nothing she does that strikes me as fake or hard to believe. I can be sucked into this world and believe for two hours she is the character doing all of these things, not an actor who gets replaced by a stunt-woman from time to time. She's charming, deadly, and then charming again. A true daughter of Blackbeard and worthy adversary for our beloved captain.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is always awesome. If he did it, he's good. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>Ian McShane is getting some bad raps. Apparently some people don't find him mean enough or evil enough. Perhaps they want a drunk man stumbling around firing a gun in randoms directions. What they have missed is the perfectly understated, confident captain of all that is evil. Not only does McShane nail Blackbeard, he comes across so disarming that by the time you realize how evil he is and that you are about to die it is too late. Undoubtedly the performance of the movie. He rarely loses his temper, always thinks of himself first, and is in complete control of the situation at all times. Oh yeah, and don't look at him cross-eyed or he'll kill you. Perfect.<br/><br/>The story itself is exactly what you want from a summer blockbuster. It is a great popcorn flick with some meaningful moments and dialog mixed in for those who actually pay attention to words in a swashbuckling film. There is a clear first act, second act, and third act, and they progress in a linear path that leads to X rather than a dramedic complicating action, reaction to complicating action, and resolution of complicating action. The only drawback, and thus the reason for 8 stars instead of 10, is the presence of some stunts that are outside the realm of human, rational possibility. Kind of like Indian Jones and the Refirigerator of Steel. Well, anything in that Indy flick, actually. That said, for the most part it is wonderfully free of CGI and filled with lush scenery and an amazing take on the beauty of mermaids. Rob Marshall does not disappoint.<br/><br/>There are some difficult scenes for children in this one. Make sure you see it first before letting your pre-teens take in some of this violent death and destruction.<br/><br/>I believe this film will satisfy your taste-buds as you wait for the progression of the summer blockbusters of Transformers, some dude named Harry, and that guy with the bullseye on his shield."
"MartynGryphon","10","2","4","20 May 2011"," Sparrow takes flight yet again.
","As long as Johnny Depp continues to don the tri-cornered hat and banadana, it would seem the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise has a lot of life left in it. After all it is a cash cow that Disney will milk until it's udders fall off.<br/><br/>I've noticed in the past that franchise renewals,(Star Wars being a perfect example), seem contrived and somewhat straw clutching in their plots as film makers struggle blindly if not enthusiastically to take their old characters to new levels of excitement. POTC - On Stranger Tides is a welcome exception.<br/><br/>I for one was thrilled with this new installment. I found that making the original films a trilogy bloated them slightly so I'm glad that the new movie, can be pretty much classed as a stand alone adventure as the original Movie was before the sequels were made. I also feel that the future of the franchise should lie in these stand alone adventures where you can watch them in any order you want like the James Bond movies and not watch them in any semblance of order just to keep track of the plot.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is without doubt the best anti-hero the screen has had since Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' in the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's and it is a part that Depp will always be best remembered for. It would be a shame if they ruin the franchise by bloating it with a further interlinking trilogy.<br/><br/>It has been a few years since Jack Sparrow graced our screens and it's as if he hasn't been away and everything you expect Jack to be is wonderfully still there. No plot spoilers here I'm glad to say as I do not want to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this magnificent film and you should see it without prior influencing opinions<br/><br/>The only gripe I have is the 3D version which although is very good fails to capitalise on certain situations that would have been great had the 3D been used more effectively, so I feel that they've missed a trick or two on that score. Hollywood studios have been playing about with 3D now for the better part of 60 years and only in that last 10 years or so have nailed it into a viable art form. We now have the technology but it's the technicians that have let this one down slightly.<br/><br/>Don't be upset that there is no Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann in this adventure as that's no bad thing as I feel that their story had gone as far as it could have. As I said earlier, the POTC franchise begins and ends with Jack Sparrow and most importantly, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. As long as he's there, then I'm sure that they'll be many more of these movies to come and thrill us."

","What i missed in this motion picture is story and of course the Pearle. They should have kept with the pirates and the old characters. I'm a nostalgic and love to see the good old guys show up, it gives me a more secure feeling about the movie. Jack was more of a fetish for the lady's and Penelope tried to hard to be one for the male audience. The only guy i felt safe with was Barbossa and he developed a good curve in his story and was by far the most interesting one. What johnny was doing in the first two Pirates of The Caribbean was to make Jack like a drunk pirate who was always in the wrong place to the right time, now he was just a guy walking around doing obvious thing and predictable.<br/><br/>The 3D effects was mildly good, unfortunately i was put one third to the side of the theater so i did not feel the 3D as good as i would from the center. But it did not live up to my favorite 3D movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""TRON:LEGACY"".<br/><br/>Short summary:<br/><br/>I was not satisfied by this movie, far from it. The most disappointing was Jack Sparrow, i put eight hours in a marathon this weekend to charge mi pirate mood. I missed the many fun and good characters but left with a good hope for the next part of this epic franchise."

"dilipbts","7","0","0","10 June 2020"," Pirates of the Caribbean on stranger tides
","I would like to begin by saying that I very rarely review films anymore, but after reading many reviews for this film by various critics I felt compelled to give my own verdict. Purely because every review I have read has been unnecessarily venomous, and simply seemed to trash the film and its two predecessors at every given opportunity. I am a fan of the Pirates trilogy, the original is by far the best, and three may have some problems with its convoluted storyline, but there is nothing wrong with Dead Man's Chest and as a trilogy they all worked very well. This fourth instalment like the others is great fun, the storyline may not be Oscar worthy stuff but neither was the storyline in the others. It is an entertaining fantasy flick that you can sit back, relax and enjoy. The idea that Johnny Depp has become bored of the character of Jack Sparrow and plays him in this film as a shadow of his former self, is simply ludicrous. Depp is on top form in this movie, brilliant for me considering following the awful performance in Alice in Wonderland I had begun doubting him somewhat. On Stranger Tides is easily the best movie since the original, and I would be more than happy to sit through another two films.<br/><br/>Now onto the performances. As previously mentioned Depp is simply outstanding as Jack Sparrow. By putting him to the forefront means we get to spend more time with him, though thankfully the writers hold back on having him on screen too much. His one liners, especially one involving a Spanish Convent had me in stitches. His relationship with Angelica (Penelope Cruz) really adds that extra bit of spice to the film. It also helps that Cruz and Depp have outstanding chemistry together. While the character of Angelica can be a bit complicated at times, her motives are vague at best, this can be overshadowed by the fact Cruz plays her with some real gusto. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa for me really stole the show, and it seems the writers gave him quite a bit more storyline this time as well. The idea of moving him to the kings navy really played off, and his scenes for me were definitely a highlight of the film. Ian McShane is a great villain, while not as good as Davey Jones or Barbossa for that matter, he still has a great storyline and some really menacing moments to make him a worthy adversary.<br/><br/>My one major issue with this movie would be the storyline of the missionary and the mermaid. While thankfully it isn't given enough screen time to be a really annoyance, I do question its point in the first place. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not remotely missed, so why try a romance replacement which just isn't that good. The mermaid action scene however is a thing to behold. As said the storyline is not amazing, the quest for the fountain of youth is entertaining and it has less betrayals than the far too long At World's End, but it isn't a story that will be winning awards. Nevertheless it maintains your interest and never feels like an excuse to get to the next action scene as it was in something like Transformers 2. The fact it is a one story arc is also a nice breath of fresh air following the second and third movies. Overall this is a great Summer movie, the kids will love it, and if you're a pirates fan you will also love it. The trashing of this film to me is slightly irritating as this is genuinely a very good film that deserves recognition. I will stand by the Pirates films until I genuinely see one that is rubbish, this film is a great Summer blockbuster and anyone that looks at it otherwise must either be deluded or trashing on it because they no longer see Pirates as ""cool"". I cannot recommend this film quite enough, just go out, watch it and have a great laugh, I know I did."

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","0","29 May 2020"," ""On Stranger Tides"" ends up configuring itself as a completely forgettable film, which wastes the base material, sounding like a repetition of what we have seen previously
","With the end of the initial trilogy that was widely applauded by critics and audiences, it was time for Disney to take new directions and explore other legendary characters from the seven seas, in addition to being able to focus more on its great star, Captain Jack Sparrow. Unlike previous films, which were filmed on locations in the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides was filmed on location in Hawaii. Its plot is inspired by the book ""On Stranger Tides"", by Tim Powers - which had already inspired LucasArts' game The Secret of Monkey Island - and features Captain Jack Sparrow looking for the Fountain of Youth and confronting the legendary pirate Blackbeard. It is the first film in the series to be directed by Rob Marshall, and not by Gore Verbinski. He is also the first to show fictional versions of historical figures, such as Blackbeard, George II of Great Britain, Henry Pelham and Fernando VI of Spain.<br/><br/>Even keeping the writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the loss of some characteristics of the previous films is notorious, however, also positive points can be observed. During the simultaneous recordings of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Chest of Death"" and ""At the End of the World"", the duo of screenwriters from the franchise found out about Tim Powers' book and, from now on, began planning for another film in the series, something that has already been made clear by the outcome of the third feature film, which showed us Jack Sparrow interested in the Fountain of Youth. Despite the overwhelming success of the first three films, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was already dead and buried in 2011, already having its ideal outcome in At the End of the World. It is evident that money speaks louder and that one more sequence would be produced. Although it works apart from its predecessors, we feel as if the work simply repeats the old formula, which is already exhausted, bringing absolutely nothing new, however much it seeks to portray another legend of the sea.<br/><br/>Although Johnny Depp remains great on paper, there is nothing else he can offer, tiring the viewer with his adventures that already sound like a joke told a thousand times. It is not known exactly why the writers are reluctant to develop Sparrow. He is gradually becoming a redundant and predictable character and this destroys the innovative spirit he had in the original trilogy. In this film, they had the perfect opportunity to evolve Jack's emotionality with Barbossa's condition, the reunion with Angelica, and the friendship with Mr. Gibbs - this has a very important role for the narrative.<br/><br/>We also have the excellent Ian McShane who gives life to the infamous and feared Captain Blackbeard, a recurring character in many legends involving the seven seas. McShane shows his talent and gives us another excellent antagonist for the confused Captain Jack Sparrow. Penélope Cruz has a good chemistry with Depp, as an ex-novice and disillusioned ex-girlfriend of Sparrow, but nothing that is memorable and that makes us believe that our dear Captain Jack Sparrow can even be tied by some woman in this world. However, Geoffrey Rush, like Barbossa, has lost much of its luster, even though it is characterized in a completely different way, something that could work to bring a sense of novelty, but that does not reach that point. The degree of repetition is such that some duels, such as that of Sparrow against Angelica, seem to have been copied and pasted from other films, this one, specifically, is almost equal to that of Will and Jack at the beginning of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".
In an attempt to avoid the confusion of the third Pirates of the Caribbean, each of the details of this new plot is explained in its details. A bet was made here for certain. Thus, the fourth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean series goes around, goes up, down, jumps off cliffs, plays very lightly with the supernatural and makes fun of it, but ends up in the same place. So we learn that Blackbeard and Angelica want to get there to cheat death; Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wants revenge on the one who left him one-legged; and the Spaniards and English have an unimportant religious feud that adds nothing to the plot and could have been left out without prejudice. In order not to miss the possibility of a little romance in the story, now that Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) have agreed, the religious Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mermaid Syrena (Astrid Bergés-Frisbey) are on the scene. The presence of the two is much more ornamental than that of the previous couple, who made the plot move. Here, more than ever, the protagonist is Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>One of the many negative points of the story is to leave the Pearl aside, which is by far the most iconic ship in the franchise, and bet on the Blackbeard ship. Locked inside his large collection of bottled vessels, Ian McShane's character holds the Pearl as an asset to one of his many won battles. Queen Anna's Revenge is a cursed ship, as in the past Sparrow's former ship was, and from the orders of its captain, who wields a kind of magical sword, the vessel comes to life and annihilates potential enemies. We also have the debut of countless other characters, such as ""The Spanish"", a service of the European country of the same name with a religious fervor, which states that only God can give someone the gift of eternal life. The Spanish antagonizes all the other characters in the film, and also seeks the Source, but with the intention of destroying it.<br/><br/>Director Rob Marshall also demonstrates that he does not have the same control as Verbisnki, wasting all the exquisite production design of the franchise, employing shorter and more closed plans, which remove all the sense of wonder and grandeur that we felt in the first three features. The director clearly has difficulty in making the action scenes with different characters and simultaneously, one of the marks of the series, as is the case of the final climax at Fonte da Juventude. Marshall is sometimes too exaggerated and fails to give actors accurate comic times; however, it makes correct action scenes, although they do not reach the feet of the grandeur of the previous three features (this may be deliberate, since this plot is much less complicated than the others, and is translated in a much more episodic way). The journey shown in the film is quite interesting, but the script unfortunately bets on a difficult path along the way, putting several extra things unnecessarily. What is seen, given Marshall's ability, is disappointing. Little has changed in relation to the visual work shown in the last film and in some points it is not rash to say that there was a significant loss of quality. The epic battles, which gave rhythm to the script, have now not been well planned and carried out, and many of them lack agility. Even the soul of the series, which was the explosive barriers between ships, were left out. In fact, the entire film lacks memorable action scenes that make it into the series. Among many other mistakes in the script, there are also shallow, easy and light solutions to various conflicts. For example, the unpredictable climax of the film that is resolved very quickly without the slightest development.<br/><br/>But it is worth mentioning that we have some very interesting scenes. The entire initial sequence set in the English capital is well-crafted, fun, action-packed and beautifully choreographed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine), the new director of the franchise. The escape plan improvised by Jack serves to remind the public of the genius that his ever-drunken style hides. The mermaid segment is the most interesting in the film - absurdly fantastic. The dialogues between Barbossa and Sparrow enrich the quality of the film. The few revelations of Sparrow's past also satisfy the viewer's curiosity. The select action scenes (such as obtaining chalices on the ship or even the final climax at the Fountain of Youth) are exciting and references to previous films are a gift for attentive viewers. Other than that, the marriage of the fictional narrative with the historical period is very well accomplished. There is also the hilarious transformation of Barbossa from pirate to privateer.
The special effects, like all the other chapters, are excellent. The photography of Dariusz Wolski, a professional who worked on the previous features, again impresses and gives personality to this universe. The CGI of the film is exceptional, especially in relation to the mermaids, giving a credible aspect to many things that happen during the course of the story. Again the soundtrack is spectacular. Hans Zimmer innovates a lot and makes the little more than two hours of film worth more for his majestic tracks than anything else. Blackbeard has one of the best themes of the franchise, Blackbeard (the character's name in English), and creatures like the mermaids and the locations where the coveted Fountain of Youth is also found, with tracks like Mermaids, Mutiny and On Stranger Tides. The themes used in the locations of Queen Anna's Revenge are equally great, and songs like The Pirate That Should Not Be and South of Heaven's Chanting Mermaids are used to delve deeper into the old relationship between Angelica and Jack.<br/><br/>""On Stranger Tides"" ends up configuring itself as a completely forgettable film, which wastes the base material, sounding like a great repetition of what we have seen previously. As much as it is of considerably shorter duration than the previous ones, the work seems to extend for much longer. It doesn't reinvent the franchise and deepen characters, but anyway, it's always interesting to revisit this universe. For those who liked the initial trilogy, they'll be fully satisfied and have fun."

","All the pirate's films so far have been Brilliant & i mean BRILLIANT!!! The production design is outstanding, costumes, sets, acting, music & directing all excellent & best of the best & this 4th entry is still full of that quality filmmaking.<br/><br/>Although ""On Stranger Tides"" is not directed by the legendary Gore Verbinski it's still greatly directed by Rob Marshall. The beautiful attention to detail is there & the gorgeous old fashioned sets are all here full of textured detail & realism, really these films are works of Art!!!
I have yet to see the 5th pirates movie yet & probably my favourite of the franchise so far is ""Dead Man's chest"" because i loved the Davey Jones charactor & Mythology & all the sea creatures crew & it's really dark Horror-Gothic look & atmosphere.
Now here with ""On Stranger Tides"" we follow Captain Jack Sparrow on his own personal adventure as he searches for the legendary fountain of youth & is accompanied by his old enemy Captain Barbossa played brilliantly by the great Geoffrey Rush, who i absolutely love in this role. Now Elizabeth & Will are not in this film & it's still a great film. We have new characters joining this adventure with Captain BlackBeard played by Ian Mcshane, another great performance, also the beautiful Penelope Cruz as Sparrows true love & an equally cunning & savvy pirate as himself, named Angelica.
The special effects are fantastic as always in this outstanding franchise & one big sequence stands out as the best part of this film & that's the incredible Mermaid scene!!! These Mermaids are the best ever put on screen in my opinion & show the darker mythology of those beautiful singing sirens. The sequence is Amazing, exciting & creepy. All in all this 4th entry is just as much fun & exciting & thrilling as the one's that came before.
ANOTHER great movie in the fantastic franchise & just a whole lot of entertaining fun.
9/10 as i still think that Gore Verbinski is a better director."

","'Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)' is much simpler than its two predecessors, a stand-alone adventure that wraps up all its arcs by the time it's over. It feels of a smaller scale, reminiscent of adventure movies like 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)', and it benefits from it. It isn't confusing or bloated like 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End (2007)', but it also isn't quite as well-conceived. There's just a sense that the thing is sort of sub-par compared to the three films before it. Still, that doesn't mean it isn't a ton of fun. It's about as enjoyable as 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)' and its aforementioned 'part two', becoming a swashbuckling roller-coaster ride once it gets underway. It looks great, with a unique aesthetic and plenty of not-too-CG extravaganza, and its writing is on point, familiar but fresh. The flick's returning characters are as good as ever, given slightly new spins to blow the off their cobwebs, and the new introductions are as compelling and scene-chewing as is expected (well, most of them, anyway). The piece feels kind of like an odd extension to the trilogy and it isn't as memorable as any of its predecessors, but it's very entertaining nevertheless. 7/10"

","This film took me awhile to finally watch. It had been on DVD for some time and I really liked the original trilogy that it was continuing on the story with. I also really like some of the actors here so that helped as well. This review was also written quite a while go, probably 6 years and I'm just now posting it. The synopsis is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) embark on a quest to find the elusive fountain of youth, only to discover that Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter are after it too.<br/><br/>We begin with some fishermen bringing their net in. When they do, they find a man in it. They take him to the Spanish king. They are looking for the Fountain of Youth and this man seems to know where it is. The king sends Óscar Jaenada after it.<br/><br/>We then shift to a man in a cell who everyone believes to be Captain Jack Sparrow. He's removed and taken into a courtroom. It turns out that it is really Gibbs (Kevin McNally). He is on trial for piracy. When the chief justice comes in, this turns out to be Jack Sparrow. He convicts Gibbs of not being him and orders him to serve the rest of his life in the Tower of London. Jack gets in with Gibbs as they head for the Tower. On the way there, he learns that Jack is getting a crew together, but he doesn't even have a ship.<br/><br/>Things don't work out as he plans. Jack is taken to a room where he is chained to a chair. He is then given an audience with King George (Richard Griffiths). He wants to find the Fountain of Youth, much like his Spanish counterparts. He has heard that Jack has a map to it and that he is getting a crew ready to go. When this rumor doesn't seem to be true, King George believes him to be an imposter. He then calls in a privateer that he is sending after it, who turns out to be Barbossa. Jack has been removed from his chains and Barbossa tells the king that he needs to be back in them. King George of course doesn't think he's capable of escape. He is wrong and that is what Jack does. We also learn that Barbossa works for the crown due to losing the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Jack has to be creative to get away and with the help of his father, Captain Teague (Keith Richards). He takes Jack to the crew that he is supposed to be getting ready and hints about the Fountain of Youth needing two chalices to make work. He then disappears.<br/><br/>Jack then has a run in with someone that turns out to be Angelica (Penélope Cruz). During this he is also hiring a crew that already seems to be hired by him. Jack gets knocked out and wakes up on the Queen Anne's Revenge, the dreaded ship of the pirate Blackbeard.<br/><br/>I have to say that I did enjoy this film. I was a little leery coming in, because I really like the original trilogy and didn't know how they could go on. Something strikes me in how they been able to continue, is the ability to continue to add mythology of the sea into their movies. I don't know a lot, but I do recognize certain names like Blackbeard, Queen Anne's Revenge and this also is using a classic myth in the Fountain of Youth. Here they did come up with a few ideas and brought them together which works.<br/><br/>Playing on that as well, I liked that this film plays up the lore of the mythic Fountain of Youth. I don't know much about mermaids, which are something that appears in the film. One of which Syrena (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) and if they are supposed to be like they are in the film, but I liked the idea of them being monsters. I also liked that Blackbeard used 'zombies' as his officers. He uses voodoo to create them so he can control them. There are other things with voodoo in this as well.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is solid. Depp and Rush are just two actors that really become these roles. I know that Depp has talent, but we don't always necessarily see it. Rush on the other hand is just great in everything I've ever seen him in. I also liked adding Cruz here. It's smart to have a solid female lead like her and being that they're incorporating the Spanish, that makes a lot of sense. I really liked McShane as Blackbeard. He played the notorious pirate well and I think a lot of that just goes to his screen presence. Plus we have McNally, Stephen Graham, Richards and Griffiths among others to round this out for what was needed.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is that this is a Disney film and concept. Since it all started with a ride at their amusement parks. I would really have loved to see what could be made of this if it wasn't restricted with being teenager friendly. With that said though, I digress. It is still paced in a way that despite its 136 hour runtime, it never really gets boring. It is just entertaining.<br/><br/>This film is being added to the horror film research due to a lot of the elements. Pirates, voodoo zombies and mermaids that kill men to drink the blood are all things that can be scary. Actually the mermaids reminded me a lot of vampires to be honest. The Pirates of the Caribbean films have used horror film elements throughout, which I like and they are still family friendly even with using them.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this film if you like The Pirates of the Caribbean films. This one just continues to add to the storyline and this one is quite enjoyable. It has really good acting across the board, the story is solid and the only drawback is that it is done by Disney. This does make it friendly for families. It is a fun film with horror film aspects that isn't scary at all."

","The film starts out with ominous music. An old sailor is discovered who was once on a ship that was looking for the Fountain of Youth...200 years ago! This sets off a frenzy to look for the Fountain. You would think without Orlando and Keira, the movie would be a bust. What I missed more than those two stars were the minor actors who played the crew. They were colorful characters who we have come to know. Alas, except for a few, they're gone. The action is the same: sword fights, impossible escapes, humorous dialogue, and unexpected turns. We get to meet Jack's father and Angelica Malon (Penélope Cruz) the later of which Jack supposedly deflowered right before she was getting ready to take her vowels in a Spanish convent. No surprise there.<br/><br/>Now in order to use the Fountain of Youth, there must be a ritual. We discover early on the ritual requires two silver chalices and a mermaid's tear. We also discover that the Black Pearl has been sunk and Hector is working for the crown. Through a series of events, Jack becomes Shanghaied on Black Beard's (Ian McShane) ship. We have 3 groups after the Fountain, the Spanish, the English who have Gibbs who has memorized the map, and Blackbeard. While Jack is in the hold, Angelica is Black Beard's first mate having convinced him she is his long lost daughter. As always in these movies everyone has their own ideas, desires, and shifting alliances.<br/><br/>The group must go on these quests to gather the items before going to the Fountain. (I see an RPG in the making.)<br/><br/>The silver chalices are not just any 2 silver chalices but the ones that belonged to Ponce De Leon.<br/><br/>The mermaids have the beauty and allure of a Siren, but when they attack they have super-human strength and vampire teeth, making their capture a bit tricky and deadly. I fell in love with the doll face of the first mermaid (Gemma Ward who actually plays a character called Dollface in ""The Strangers"".) I know this is a Disney movie and this should go without saying...The mermaids are indeed topless, but the camera angles, hair and arm placements prevent any kind of ""R"" view. There might be a parent or two concerned due to some of the photos that are out there.<br/><br/>One piece of dialouge:<br/><br/>Jack: ""You lied to me by telling me the truth?""<br/><br/>Angelica: ""Yes.""<br/><br/>Jack: ""That's very good. I'll have to use that.""<br/><br/>Good View on the big screen. Lacks the ornate special effects of the other 3 movies as well as many of the characters. It appears they did this on less of a budget in order to get a larger net return."
"dineshaishu","7","0","0","19 May 2019"," Pirates of the Caribbean:on strange tides
","Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.<br/><br/>This time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a cliché that happens to fit nicely here.<br/><br/>As for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to ""save"" him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 - and who are we kidding, of course there must be - I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.<br/><br/>So what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself - and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.<br/><br/>The stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs - like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles - then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie - and the franchise - owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs - Sparrow's first mate all these movies - memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves."

","20 May 2011. The dialogue and that plot in the beginning and throughout the movie seems to ooze with a scriptwriter under pressure to create a blockbuster movie and the dialogue and plot seemed strained to do so. The first half of the movie seemed to drag interspersed with the requisite action scenes which have particular merit in their captivating novelty. There are sparkled throughout a few one-liner gems that sometimes though seem to be thrown out to help carry the rest of the movie. By the last half, a fascinating dynamic and relational subplot occurs that at times seem to overshadow the main storyline. Nevertheless, the original discovery towards the end of the movie and the role of Spanish are tweaked in a way that makes for a more substantive movie. Overall, the movie is decent, but at times strained by the need to compete with its predecessor's success."

They all go on the hunt for the fountain, cross paths with a flock of mermaids, of which they need to capture a single tear from one of them, when mixed into a special chalice will allow the fountain of youth to work as they hope.

","Of all the sequels to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, this was the most meh. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. But it might be a bit of a stretch to call it a good one. So this film finds itself stuck in the middle.<br/><br/>Acting, once again, was fantastic, the music was great, and the effects were beautiful. The plot, once again, though, is what killed it.<br/><br/>The main flaw of the movie is that it doesn't feel like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and more like a spin off adventure. This probably happens because it lacks several characters who had major roles in the last movie. <br/><br/>Case in point: Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan, Pintel, and Ragetti. These are the characters who seemed to be missing from the movie. Of course, there were others, such as Davy Jones, but most of those characters are dead, and even though that didn't stop Barbosa, bringing back Davy Jones would be flat out illogical. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie was pretty good, but the fact that it remained so unfaithful to the other movies makes this one feel less like a proper movie, and more like a Netflix spin off."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Pirates Of The Carribean: On Stranger Tides.<br/><br/>Due to his good relationship with Walt Disney's chairman of 38 years, Dick Cook Johnny Depp agreed in pricipal to star in this film before ""there was a script or anything in place."" After Cook was fired, Depp said his enthusiasm for the fourth Pirates movie had reduced after Cook left the project. He said, the only reason he agreed to it was because he trusted Cook, who supported him while ""others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from the first moment. He trusted me."" He regained his enthusiasm by recieving a paycheck with a lot of zeroes in front of the decimal point. <br/><br/>It is about what you'd expect. It is over long (a very long-winded 137 minutes) and totally over the top. It starts off well enough as Captain Jack Sparrow impersonates a British judge, is chased through London, makes out with Dame Judy Dench and discovers someone is attempting to impersonate him, while recruiting the crew needed to man a ship. The movie is ok until they set sail. Then it all gets a bit dull. <br/><br/>Blackbeard played by Ian McShane is ok, but is not really threatening, Penelope Cruz is fine and has good chemistry with Depp, which we knew from Blow. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) do not return (Instead of Will and Elizabeth, we get a love subplot involving a priest and a mermaid.) but Captain Barbossa does, but he is bland and timid here. In fact he is pretty pointless, and only returns so audiences know more than two returning characters (Captain Jack's right-hand man, Gibbs is also back) Keith Richards turns up again, playing Captain Jack Sparrow's father too.<br/><br/>Rob Marshall's direction is competent and, from a technical standpoint, there's nothing wrong with the various action sequences but it is just so blah!! The fight sequences are all impossible leaping and fast cutting, its confusing and uninvolving. The story does not engage, the characters are bland and the whole thing reeks of being a money-grab. Yet, I didn't hate it. It was watchable but nothing more!! <br/><br/>POTC: On Stranger Tides grossed $241 million at the domestic box office to become the 5th highest-grossing movie of 2009. Whilst it was the lowest grossing Pirates movie, it was the third Depp movie to cross 1 billion dollars worldwide<br/><br/>While filming in London in October 2010, Johnny Depp received a letter from a local nine-year old schoolgirl, telling him her classmates needed help to ""mutiny"" against her teachers. He turned up with no warning at the school in full Sparrow outfit."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the fourth installment in the Pirates franchise and one of the most interesting. Based on Tim Powers novel ""On Stranger Tides"" this fourth movie of Pirates brings some adventure and weirdness to the series. <br/><br/>Many years after the events of ""At Worlds End"" I am told this story happens 13 years after At Worlds end and Five before Dead Men Tell No Tales in the time line of the series. Captain Jack Sparrow is looking for the Fountain of Youth, his search takes him to London England where he meets Captain Barbossa who is now a Privateer in the Kings Navy (We assume that) and a lover from his past, Angelica. Angelica convinces Jack to help her look for the Fountain of Youth, albeit some poison dart convincing. Jack is suddenly brought into the search on board captain Blackbeard's ship The Queen Anne's Revenge. There Jack discovers Angelica is Blackbeard's lost daughter (or is she?) and his crew is made up of Zombies. <br/><br/>I feel this pirates is more of an exploration movie then a straight out pirates film, I feel it's like an Indiana Jones movie combined with Pirates of the Caribbean. The Scenery which was mostly filmed on the Hawaiian Islands is beautiful. All of the Pirates movies have some sort of supernatural theme to them, this one in my view has the most supernatural element of them all. It follows Tim Powers book pretty well, but not so well it's a cinematic copy. What I like about this pirates is they bring the fabled Fountain of Youth into the story, along with voodooism, Zombies, and I really liked the Mermaids in this, the film portrays them as what legend truly makes them out to be, monsters that eat unsuspecting sailors. I like how it's also sort of a race between three groups Blackbeard's crew and Jack, Barbossa's English Navy Crew, and The Spanish Crew. <br/><br/>This story focuses more on Jack, don't get me wrong I love Will and Elizabeth and I loved how they brought them back in the fifth installment. But it's cool how they made a story based just on Jack, he is after all the main character of the series. I also liked how they brought a former woman from his past into the picture, that being said, I wish they would have explained more about Jack's and Angelica's past together, why he left her? And why she bears him a hateful grudge? It does explain some of that here but not so much to make it more interesting. <br/><br/>Blackbeard, he is an alright villain, he ranks number 4 on my pirates villain's list above Lord Beckett who is the worst on my list and after Barbossa in the first film. What I got out of Blackbeard was his ruthlessness and wickedness and he possesses a magical sword that can control his ship, which is cool. Other then that he seems to plain to me, and I don't see why Angelica wanted him as a father, maybe to do her dirty work? I really liked his Zombie crew though. <br/><br/>Jack, Barbossa, and Gibbs are the only returning characters from the three previous films, all the rest are new. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fun adventurous film, it isn't my favorite of the pirates films but I do like it and enjoy it. Watching it you get this feeling of exploration and discovery just like an Indiana Jones movie. <br/><br/>10/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.

Finally, the biggest flaw, in my opinion, of this film is that in the title ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" there is the word ""Pirate"", so it should happen at sea but however, 70 percent of the film happens on the ground and without the Black Pearl.

","A waste of a movie that solely exists to make money, On Stranger Tides may not be as bad as its reputation would suggest, but nonetheless does a poor job at validating its existence.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is as good as ever as Captain Jack, and returning actors Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa and Kevin McNally as Gibbs are fun to see alongside Jack yet again. Some of the action sequences are decent, but lack the impressive scale or inventiveness of its predecessors.<br/><br/>For the most part its well paced, wisely clocking in at a shorter runtime than the previous films. The costume design is still impressive and the script still manages to generate a few laughs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story is nowhere near as interesting as the original films. The middle act of the movie tends to drag at times. Though there were some implausible action scenes in the original trilogy, this one goes a bit far, turning Jack into a literal superhero. The stakes don't feel as high either, as Rob Marshall's direction is quite poor.<br/><br/>Though I praised the returning characters, the new ones just aren't up to the mark. Penelope Cruz plays Jack's love interest, and she is honestly a very boring and rather annoying character. Ian McShane's Blackbeard comes as a huge disappointment, as he receives quite a build up but ends up being anything but intimidating. There is a forced and unnecessary romance between a priest and a mermaid that just wastes time.<br/><br/>Following a very predictable path and never rising above being a mediocre film, On Stranger Tides isn't terrible but does not justify its existence. Marshall has no real style, and the grandeur of Gore Verbinski's original trilogy is sorely lacking, along with many of the lovable characters from the originals. In short, it's entirely watchable but extremely forgettable."
"jaredpahl","7","0","0","4 June 2017"," On Familiar Tides. Pirates 4 Is A Standard But Entertaining Bonus Adventure
","When Gore Verbinski wrapped up his Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy with the massive, climactic epic, At World's End, it felt like the end of an era. The history built up between the characters was brought to a head and completely resolved by the closing credits. And yet, with more money to be had, a fourth movie was commisioned. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides suffers mightily in comparison to Gore Verbinski's iconic trilogy. It is lacking in energy and style, and the new cast of characters are uninspired. Still, On Stranger Tides gets the job done competently. This is a serviceably entertaining comic adventure with some fun set-pieces and beautiful scenery. Taken on it's own merits, it works as a nice bonus adventure for the series.<br/><br/>The story is the antithesis to At World's End's sprawling complexity. Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, The English, The Spanish, Blackbeard (Ian McShane), and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz), are on the trail of the Fountain of Youth, all with their own motivations for getting there. The rules and regulations of the fountain's mystical powers require a good bit of side quests (finding two silver chalices, capturing a mermaid's tear, etc.), but On Stranger Tides' story is dramatically slimmed down from all three previous movies.<br/><br/>On the one hand, I liked the decision to shed the extra narrative weight. It would have been impossible to try to top the epic richness of At World's End, so scaling down makes perfect sense. However, what On Stranger Tides loses in narrative fat, it also loses in charm, personality, and energy. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann may have seemed like dead weight at times in the first three movies, but their exclusion here makes you appreciate what they brought to the series. They were the straight men among the colorful ensemble cast, directing the story forward and allowing Jack Sparrow and the rest to find that sweet spot on the peripheries of the story. With On Stranger Tides, most of the characters from the previous entries are gone, and the show is run by Jack Sparrow in as close to a standard ""hero"" role as he's had in the series. There is no getting around it, things just feel lonely without that crew we grew to love over the trilogy. The cast around Captain Jack lacks the personality of the first three films. Everybody fulfills a standard archetype, nothing more, nothing less. Aside from Cruz's Angelica, who has a great sultry chemistry with Depp, the cast is forgettable. Even Ian McShane's Blackbeard seems like a discount Barbossa from the first movie. His ship, The Queen Anne's Revenge is a beautifully designed set, but it's big hook is that Blackbeard's magic sword can control its ropes and shoot fire from the hull. Compared to The Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman, it's pretty lame. <br/><br/>That feeling seems to extend to the production design and action as well. Where this series used to savor the opportunities for unique creature designs and action set-pieces, On Stranger Tides coasts along well worn territory. There's nothing wrong with zombies or carriage chases or any of the other adventure clichés that are trotted out in the film, but nothing is particularly inspired. The mermaids are the most unique of the new additions in the creature department, and they're well-rendered, but like the rest of On Stranger Tides' design elements, they don't add up to much. Everything looks nice individually, but I can't say I was swept up in the world the same way I was in Verbinski's Trilogy.<br/><br/>Rob Marshall, as director, proves that not just anybody can bring to these stories the type of crowd-pleasing excitement that Gore Verbinski brought to his trilogy. The action scenes are fun, but the rhythm and cadence is somehow off. Verbinski seamlessly merged humor with action and he filmed his action scenes with a palpable sense of zest for filmmaking. Marshall's action scenes move along jauntily from beat to beat, but the humor therein lurches forward and back when it should blend with the thrills. I liked the opening chase and the first swordfight between Angelica and Jack, and the rest of the set-pieces are functional, but none of the action quite reaches Verbinski-level excitement. The climactic final fight in the Fountain of Youth in particular is deficient. Compare it to the similar finale of Curse of the Black Pearl. That scene was so full of life, with sweeping camera moves, a roaring score, and the enthusiastic vigor of the cast. It was heaven for an adventure enthusiast like myself. Tides' scene is dead in comparison. It boasts a beautiful set and good fight choreography, but that alone is not enough to bring an action scene to life. <br/><br/>As disappointing as Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides can be, I still found myself satisfied with it as a straightforward adventure. I was particularly impressed with the tropical locations, which are often jaw-droppingly beautiful. The jungles, beaches, and caves are bright and vibrant and alluring. If you get nothing else from On Stranger Tides, at the very least, you get to see some very pretty landscapes. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a smaller, less exciting movie than the first three, and I can't believe that this relatively low energy romp was directed by the same man who gave us the vivaciously dynamic Chicago, but if you think of this movie as a sort of side quest in the Pirates series, it does the job. The simple tale of the voyage to the Fountain of Youth provides ample amounts of what makes adventure movies fun: lush scenery, polished production design, humor, and thrills. Held against Verbinski's brilliant trilogy, it doesn't hold up, but as a kind of Pirates DLC, it's comfortably satisfying. <br/><br/>72/100"

","I don't understand why so many people hate this movie because in my opinion it's very good. It's well made, well preformed (especially Jack Sparrow if you compare his performance in his latest movie) and it has an interesting story and just because there aren't so many connections with the previous movies it doesn't mean it has to suck. It's one of the best in the franchise and i absolutely love it and am glad they made this movie. I suggest this movie to everybody and don't listen to the haters just make your own opinion about it."

","After the original trilogy, there wasn't much story left to tell with Will and Elizabeth, so Disney wished to continue the franchise putting a heavier focus on Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. On Stranger Tides featured Sparrow at the center of everything, which can be a good and bad thing.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily think it was the best idea to make Sparrow the only character with significant depth, but I also don't think having the story involve mermaids and an overly powerful supernatural villain either. The Pirates films at their best when the stakes are high but are also grounded with some realism. One of the reasons At World's End is a much better film is because there are stakes in that film. William's sacrifice feels earned because we've been with these characters for a few films. I never connected to anyone in On Stranger Tides because the writing never makes a considerable effort to flesh out the characters. The efforts that are made aren't very committed.<br/><br/>As a standalone sequel, which is essentially what this film is, On Stranger Tides is far from awful. It has plenty of fun swashbuckling action scenes that the franchise has always presented. Ian McShane is pretty good as Blackbeard, though he doesn't really compare to anything Bill Nighy or Geoffrey Rush did in the original trilogy. But the film itself presents a far goofier tone than any of those films. Sparrow is even more over the top (believe it or not) and thus removing any human connection to the characters.<br/><br/>I think it's best to treat this entry as a distant cousin people choose not to acknowledge at a party, because it has next to nothing to do with any of the other films (even the most recent film, Dead Men Tell No Tales). There are flashes of the Pirates we know and love but it's nowhere near as grandiose or as magical as its predecessors.<br/><br/>+Flashes of greatness<br/><br/>-Forgettable<br/><br/>-Characters are getting a little too over the top<br/><br/>5.6/10"
"MaximumMadness","6","0","0","26 May 2017"," ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides""- An entertaining but middling installment in the beloved franchise.
","Few franchises in the past twenty years have taken the world by storm quite like Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" which is of course based on the famous theme park attraction. With a grand sense of adventure and a great deal of heart behind it, the original 2004 release ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a surprise hit and quickly became a modern classic thanks to a remarkable lead performance by Johnny Depp and original director Gore Verbinski's suitably dark but also entertaining eye for composition. It was a cultural phenomena, eventually spawning a two-part follow-up with 2006 and 2007's ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End."" Though the sequels were even bigger hits and were generally well-received, you could tell that the effects of ""sequelitis"" were starting to rear their head. Both films were well-made on an aesthetic level and boasted strong performances, but the storyline started to become convoluted and the focus became disjointed.<br/><br/>There was a prolonged wait before any news of a fourth film was finally unveiled. And when the news hit, it was both exciting but also worrying. Verbinski jumped ship to work on other projects while Rob Marshall took his place at the helm. Also gone were a great deal of the co-stars from previous installments. But the writing team of Ted Elliot and Terry Rosio were on board and so was the franchise star Depp. We eagerly awaited the release of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" with optimism.<br/><br/>And while far from the series best, there certainly is some fun to be had with the film. Yes, ""On Stranger Tides"" is absolutely a middling and slightly disappointing follow-up. That much I must admit. But giving it the benefit of repeated viewings has softened my initial negative views on the film, and allowed me to see the many things it does right. It's still a ""Pirates"" adventure through-and-through... it's just not quite as fresh as it once was.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (Depp) is caught in a new adventure when he escapes the clutches of arrest and is shanghaied aboard the dreaded vessel ""Queen Anne's Revenge"", under the command of the devious Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter (and Jack's former lover) Angelica. (Penélope Cruz) Blackbeard is seeking out the mythical ""Fountain of Youth"", which he hopes to use to escape his death, which is prophesied to come at the hands of Jack's former rival and accomplice Barbossa. (Geoffrey Rush) Soon, it becomes a race against time as Jack, Blackbeard, Barbossa and a fleet of Spanish ships all try to reach the Fountain before anyone else, each for their own selfish reasons.<br/><br/>The problems I have with the film really fall into two major issues. The first being that the film itself feels too much like a one-off adventure, and therefore contributes very little to the franchise as a whole. It's a blast seeing Jack Sparrow and his shipmates once again, but its in the service of a tale that has little dramatic impact. I appreciated that both of the previous follow-ups developed the story and the characters in the grand scheme of the ""world"" that had been created. ""On Stranger Tides"" might as well be called ""On Another Tuesday Afternoon for Jack Sparrow."" While it does tie into the other films in a few ways I will not spoil... it's clear from the opening act that the film is merely here to entertain and nothing more.<br/><br/>And the second problem I have is our replacement director Rob Marshall. Don't get me wrong, he's a fine storyteller. But he's not the right fit. His visual guidance is too slick and manufactured for this type of film, and it lacks the grit and grime of Verbinski's down-and-dirty storytelling. It just doesn't quite capture that same delightful ""Pirates"" feel that the other film films excelled in. It instead feels more like we're watching a slightly tamed down and well-photographed ""Pirates""-themed stage- show. It's just all a bit too clean. A bit too squeaky.<br/><br/>Those major complaints aside, I do quite enjoy the film for what it does well. And I think what it does well most certainly outweighs the bad. To start, the cast is as magnificent as always, with Depp easily stealing the show for the fourth time in his now-legendary role as Sparrow. He's as quirky, treacherous and charming as ever, and I couldn't even imagine another actor in the part. Depp simply is Jack. Rush and other returning actors such as Kevin McNally are great fun in their roles and are their appropriate moments to shine. And the new cast is a blast and a half. Particularly McShane, who makes for a wonderfully vile villain in Blackbeard. Just perfect casting.<br/><br/>The film is also quite adventurous and is filled to burst with stand-out action set-pieces and plenty of bits of good-natured humor. It's an audience-pleaser to say the least. From a wonderful opening chase sequence through the streets of London to a genuinely startling Mermaid-attack (Yes, ""mermaid attack"") to sword-clashes aplenty, the film is completely loaded with eye-candy that will tickle that child inside of all of us. All the while, there's a constant layer of banter, bickering and gags that are sure to get some pretty consistent chuckles and laughs out of anyone. It's pure dumb-fun at its core, and its in these moments that the film excels.<br/><br/>Your enjoyment of the film is going to come down to how much you are willing to forgive it for its faults. It's just another adventure for these characters and it's a bit too over-produced for its own good... but this is balanced out with a quick pace and a nonstop onslaught of action and humor. If you go in expecting a great film, you'll be disappointed. But if you just wanna spend another two hours in this universe, you'll have yourself a good time. I give it a slightly above average 6 out of 10."

","A voodoo doll Jack Sparrow, a disappointing Penelope Cruz character, a forced romance between a mermaid and a religious man and a villain claiming to be Blackbeard that has the ability to control rope. All of those things add up to the worst Pirates of the Caribbean movie to date.<br/><br/>While the idea looked good on paper, the execution of the film was misguided. Jack Sparrow is actually more bearable in this film than he was in Dead Man's Chest or At World's End and Barbossa is always a good addition, but it's the new cast that are lacking. Penelope Cruz's Angelica lacks depth, Ian McShane's Blackbeard is a far cry from the great Davy Jones, and Philip, the religious man is nothing more than fodder for a bad romance between him and a mermaid. Also, this prospect of the Jack Sparrow voodoo doll is so out of nowhere and preposterous that I'm not surprised that they completely ignored this plot point in Dead Men Tell No Tales."
"cody-phillipsphotography","8","0","0","12 May 2017"," Nostalgic, but not the quality of the originals
","Definitely the weakest of the series, On Stranger Tides adds more supernatural elements to the mythology of the series. Mermaids and zombies are new additions that weren't necessarily needed, but were very interesting additions. Without a majority of the original main characters, the film did feel off, like it wasn't a part of the original series. This film rather seemed to be more of a spin-off of Jack Sparrow, rather than be a film included in the series. It wasn't a boring film at all, with the action sequences still being just as good as those in the original films. The plot was the biggest problem with the film, with the ending having resolution for the story, but still leaving a hole in the plot with the ending of At World's End. Rob Marshall was an interesting director, especially with Chicago being one of my favorite films, where it just felt like he was out of place to direct an epic pirate adventure tale. Altogether, On Stranger Tides is a decent addition to the franchise, but really offers nothing much to the original story, which was believed to have been a direct sequel to the original series. It is an entertaining film, but is much more flawed than the original series was."

","I love the ""POTC"" franchise, but ""On Stranger Tides"" failed on a lot of levels. Oh, Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow has his moments; he's cute, and clever, and silly in a lovable way/lovable in a silly way. But when all is said and done, at least for me he wasn't, in this movie, a character I was more than mildly amused by. And that wasn't enough to keep me invested in the movie.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz makes a fetching Pirate, but I just never bought into the back-story, which is that she's Blackbeard the arch-Pirate's daughter. She's pretty and she's fun to watch on screen, but there isn't enough plot/character to make me care about her.<br/><br/>There's a cute sub-plot involving a mermaid and a young male missionary, and as far as I was concerned, that was potentially the most interesting part of the movie. But it was a minor item, and the way it turned out was pre-ordained and obvious from the get-go.<br/><br/>Kevin McNally as Gibbs was actually the character that I felt was the most authentic, but he was just dragged along for the ride, as it were, and really didn't have a part in the action.<br/><br/>For the rest, there are Spaniards and British who swash buckle and flash swords at appropriate moments in the movie, but that's all they're really there for.<br/><br/>I know I'm swimming against the tide in saying this, but for me the movie just didn't work. In the climactic action sequence at the end, I found myself more concerned with how cramped and uncomfortable I was starting to feel in my theater seat than in how the movie was going to end.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I really can't recommend ""On Stranger Tides."" My suggestion: if you're hankering for a good action popcorn flick, skip this movie and watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" either of the first two Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movies, or check your cable channels for any other big-budget action movie of summers past."

","I love the Pirates movie just because they are fast action, fun movies, and belly laughs when it occurs. The fourth movie brings back our favorite pirate who just happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and gets in a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>This trouble now comes in the form of Blackbeard which I was really hoping for a really dark villain with some heart, but we got a shallow character out of him. Another was Penélope Cruz which was supposed to be Jack's love interest with a lot of potential, all wasted. The preacher kid there too along with some of the characters.<br/><br/>All the visuals are basically the same quality we expect from the Lucas Studio on CGI and the ships were build from scratch or retrofitted.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the fourth movie is pretty much just a filler episode in the adventures of Jack Sparrow. Hopefully the next one will have character development, villains that aren't one dimension, and some characters like Orlando Bloom's character will be a different darker personality."

","I'm not sure why Disney wanted to make a fourth entry in the 'Pirates' series, outside of the obvious financial gains involved with exploiting one of the best cinematic characters ever created. On Stranger Tides is the most departed from the original films, and most would agree that it is best viewed as a stand-alone movie, and separate from the originals.<br/><br/>This film wipes the slate clean and gets rid of nearly every character from the original trilogy except for Jack, Barbossa, and for some reason they kept sailor Gibbs (Kevin McNally). Here we find Jack chasing after the Fountain of Youth, and it is unknown how much time has passed between the events between the third and fourth films. He is still running amok, perhaps without as much drive and direction as before, but we find him in England on the other side of the ocean up to his old antics. There are a lot of new characters introduced into the story, an old flame of Jack's named Angelica (Penelope Cruz), and a new anti-hero pirate Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane with his steely grey eyes).<br/><br/>As the Spanish Navy sets sail to find the Fountain of Youth before anyone else does, the main crew go after it searching with the infamous 'Compass that points to the thing you want most' plot device. I didn't feel as though this movie really brought anything new to the series as a whole, despite being the most modern adaptation of the Disney classic. It kind of just goes through the motions, and although it looks fantastic, is a bit boring in places. The quest is still there and some fantastic settings, yet it feels kind of static for an adventure film. I thought this one was probably the most boring out of all them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this one is just a cash grab from the Disney corporation, and that makes it decidedly the worst of the series and I think most would agree that it was generally uninspired from start.

When I first saw it, I thought it was great.<br/><br/>But now that I think about it, I realizeit was kind of underwhelming.<br/><br/>What made the first three great (in my opinion, at least) was the spectaclea bombast of action, humor, adventure, mythology, and horror, all shot with Verbinski's trademark visual flair, with particular emphasis on colors, detail, and shading. <br/><br/>How does OST compare?<br/><br/>If the first three were a bottle of rum, OST is a wine cooler. Not really meaning it's bad, but it's really dilutedjust very underwhelming after three huge movies.<br/><br/>The action scenes ranged from mediocre to slightly above average. Sure, they had their epic moments, but those moments just didn't make up for the majority of the film. <br/><br/>What really got on my nerves most about this movie was the lack of originality. The plot is an adaptation of Tim Powers's novel On Stranger Tides, only with some Pirates of the Caribbean elements thrown in there. The zombie pirate crewmen could have been cool, but they resembled angry sunburned bikers more than zombie pirates. Throw some decomposing flesh, some stitched-up mouths, glowing eyes, and a body bedecked with voodoo tattoos in there, and make them walk like actual zombies! The mermaids were pretty cool, but the ""nice"" mermaid Syrena and her relationship with the clergyman Philip (is that his name) was just.silly.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011): Dir: Rob Marshall / Cast: Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Ian McShane, Geoffrey Rush, Astrid Berges-Frisbey: Fourth and weakest entry in the franchise is still an entertaining adventure regarding a past relationship for Captain Jack Sparrow. This time the search is on for the Fountain of Youth but two chalices are needed as well as tears from a mermaid. That is about as preposterous as a plot can get and it nearly sinks this ship. Director Rob Marshall previously made Chicago and Memoirs of Geisha and here he delivers a compelling scene involving a mermaid attack in open waters. The scene is the best in the film but the actors must carry the rest. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is still charmingly funny as he escapes the law only to be thrown into an idiot plot. Penelope Cruz is a nice edition as Black Beard's daughter and past lover of Sparrow. His dealing of her in the conclusion is a hilarious take on lovers spats. Ian McShane is also superb as Black Beard whose wicked ways knows no limits but he earns his own downfall through selfish motives. Only Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is disappointing in a role that seems terribly reduced compared to other films. Astrid Berges-Frisbey is a fetching steal playing a mermaid with enchanting spellbinding poisonous intentions for those locked in her trance. The production is massive as the voyage takes them to mysterious places including the location of the Fountain of Youth. Die hard fans of the earlier films will no doubt enjoy its spectacle but others may wish to dock their attention elsewhere. Score: 5 ½ / 10"
"user-196-766417","6","0","0","9 April 2015"," not as good as the original trilogy
","In comparison to the original trilogy, ""On Stranger Tides"" is less inventive, less funny and less impressive. However it still has a few strengths that makes it worth watching.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>The plot, as always, is great - simple enough to understand, but complex enough to be fascinating. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is conscripted onto the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane), where he meets his past love Angelica (Penélope Cruz). They sail for the Fountain of Youth in a race against Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), as well as the Spanish. There's plenty of action, with which the mythology and legends are interwoven wonderfully.<br/><br/>The cinematography, special effects, costuming and design elements are beautiful, just like the original trilogy. They make ""On Stranger Tides"" a cohesive movie, and ensure that the world of the movie is rich, deep and convincing. Hans Zimmer, again, delivers an amazing soundtrack that complements the story perfectly.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The movie takes itself too seriously at times, especially with the romance between Philip (Sam Claflin) the clergyman and Syrena (Astrid Bergès- Frisbey) the mermaid. It seems forced and superficial, and the lines exchanged between them are always over-dramatic. Also, Barbossa's super- serious revenge story is boring, washed-out and clichéd. This comes as a great disappointment because Barbossa's character was hilariously outrageous in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point. The humour in this movie was really lacking. There were many moments in the original trilogy where I laughed so hard I cried - Jack's experiences on the cannibal island, the fight on the wheel, Jack and Barbossa arguing over captaincy - but there were no really memorable moments in this instalment. The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise has always been special because of its absurdity, but this movie just doesn't live up to it.<br/><br/>I wish I could say that Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow carried the movie for me, but it really didn't. Depp is a great actor but his lines just lack the wit and cleverness that really characterised Jack in the first three movies, and he also lacks swagger. In the original trilogy, Jack's brilliance always came from the way he played everyone for his own benefit, and we don't really see much of that in ""On Stranger Tides"". His willingness to sacrifice for Angelica undermines his every-man-for-himself nature that made him so likable.<br/><br/>Blackbeard and Angelica's stories lack conviction. She wants to save him because she wants a father figure she's never had - this seems like a very pathetic excuse for sailing to the Fountain of Youth. The best villains are either the ones you love, hate or fear, and Blackbeard fits into none of those categories. In the end I felt nothing towards either of them.<br/><br/>The plot twists in this movie are quite predictable. There was not one surprising moment. The original trilogy was ridiculous and unpredictable and left me wondering what was going to happen next, but ""On Stranger Tides"" is filled with clichés and shoddy writing that made it lack suspense.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a mediocre movie that is nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, but is still worth watching because of its interesting premise, the nice action scenes, and Richard Griffiths's cameo as King George."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","0","0","15 March 2015"," It still entertains but now the writers are getting sloppy
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) was one of those rare films that was made all with the right people on board (no pun intended) and managed to become a title worthy of a franchise. The cast was talented, the music was memorable, the action was energetic, the writing was clever and it was filmed beautifully. Wistfully, like every popular franchise that becomes mainstream, there comes a point where the series begins to show its age. Audiences try not to accept it and go in hoping for the best but there always seems to be something out of place when the next chapter is made. Disney's Pirates has been subjected to that unfortunately but noticeably on a slower decline than many of its other counterpart strains. For this passage, the story is continued but shows that its writers are beginning to lose their grip on its mythology.<br/><br/>After Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had taken the map that lead to the fountain of youth. While on his way, he learns that he's not the only one. Turns out that the Spanish, the English (currently headed by Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)) and the infamous Blackbeard (Ian McShane) are all headed to find it as well. Sparrow also runs into an old flame named Angelica (Penélope Cruz) who thinks Jack owes her a debt. The writing is developed once more by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (the duo that started it all). Delightfully the story doesn't contain as many confusing character threads as the previous film. However in spite of that, they managed to sloppily write a different aspect and that belongs to the character traits and disappearances. A big question that comes to mind is Blackbeard's ship and the powers that he has, which are controlled by a single sword.<br/><br/>So how exactly did he get these powers? No real reason is given as to why he has these powers other than waving around the magic sword but even that isn't explained. Along side that is Blackbeard's henchmen who are apparently mentioned as being ""zombified"" (which again isn't explained), can't be killed. In Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), Hector Barbossa and his crew had a reason to why they couldn't be killed. That reason was the curse; yes the logic wasn't factual but the idea was based on fantasy. Here, Elliot and Rossio wrote in Blackbeard and his crew with invulnerability without giving a proper understanding. What would Blackbeard's henchmen need the fountain of youth for if they can get stabbed and still live? Another character trait that isn't elaborated on is the mermaid mythology. When a mermaid touches dry land, why does their tale disappear forming legs and when they touch the ocean their tale returns? Perhaps there's a rule to this but nothing was said in the film and doing a little outside research didn't shed light on much either. So was it just made up?<br/><br/>The other issue the story suffers from is absence of clarity on its previous cast members. The only returning main supporting cast member from the past trilogy is Gibbs (Kevin McNally). There was a clear ending for Elizabeth and Will Turner from Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) but everyone else rather just vanished. What happened to the crew Gibbs worked with? It's not like the writers needed to film a scene explaining what happened but a transparent justification is all. There is a scene which involves the Black Pearl and where it ended up but does that mean the previous crew is there too? Nothing's said about it. Gratefully not much else has changed. Although directed by Rob Marshall this time, he's still able to keep the film moving. The pacing is still even with no lagging in between. The special effects remain well mixed with its live-action counterparts. The only element some audiences may find less of is the action sequences, which still are energetic but is more sparse than usual (it could be me). This could also be because of the toning down in scale prior to the last entry.<br/><br/>The main actors to this story also continue to entertain. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow remains unchanged which is totally fine because he is what made Sparrow. Kevin McNally as Gibbs and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa also remain the same, which is great. The new additions are acceptable too. The best addition is Ian McShane as Blackbeard. McShane's menacing presence feels very close to that of Davy Jones (not as dangerous personally, but just as threatening). Penélope Cruz as Angelica performed decently too and her chemistry with Johnny Depp was commendable. The last two additions belong to Sam Claflin (a missionary) and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey (a mermaid). The relationship between these two actors is predictable but alright in most regards because with Elizabeth and Will Turner out, there kind of needed to be romance somewhere. The cinematography is again headed by Dariusz Wolski who hasn't disappointed yet in this series; with beautiful wide screen shots of tropical scenery. Enough said. Hans Zimmer also returns to score the music and also retains the main theme for Sparrow while including new themes such that belongs to Angelica, Blackbeard and the mermaids. It's still enjoyable, just slowly losing its grip.<br/><br/>The production quality of special effects, music, action, camera-work and talented main cast all continue to do the work that is required to keep this franchise afloat. Unfortunately, the screenwriters are beginning to get clumsy in their storytelling by not explaining a number of character traits, mythology to certain creatures and leaving out information of what happened to prior characters."

","Well, here we have the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean and said by the way, the worst of all. <br/><br/>I am a true fan of this series, but I can not defend this disaster sequel too. <br/><br/>After the original trilogy, and now turn to independent adventures of Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is not. Well, I do not dislike the character and the actor, but neither will get to have really missed. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is not. Well sorry, but at this if I miss a lot. For me this girl is immensely more beautiful, sweet and best actress Penelope Cruz very overrated. <br/><br/>The original crew, except Mr. Gibbs, disappears along with the Black Pearl. Neither Mr. Cotton, and the sympathetic bald dwarf, or those two pirates with you were your initial case in the three movies, nothing. <br/><br/>So we find in this new film? <br/><br/>Johny Deep as Jack Sparrow if he returns. Well, unsurprisingly, not the movie directly there. Keep up a good performance and is once again the best of the film, as it should be. <br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush. Essential. This character really should not be missing in any sequel because with Deep, who is unable to start more laughter and sympathy among the public. May this great actor last and last to delight us with his talent. <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz. No disappoints. The truth is that their performance is quite correct. What I do not understand is why his character seems at first that you will have an important role and then be slowly reduced. Her character is interesting and half the writers have failed to draw with too much confidence. <br/><br/>Ian Mcshane. Disappointing. So clear. I was expecting a really scary and imposing Blackbeard but has not. The dubbing is terrible to start putting a ridiculous voice that did not hit anything with the character. Then there is the performance Mcshane, great actor by the way, just as he convinces that scenes, while others are low intensity seen on their part. Davy Jones was cool in every scene and every sentence he said, was memorable, but this does not convince really terrified. Very disappointing. <br/><br/>Kevin McNally as Mr. Gibbs. I must say that this character is the prettiest and funniest of the series, and for me it has become imperative. I hope to continue in the following parts. <br/><br/>The other actors are largely untapped. Uncle Vernon in Harry Potter appears as King George, only very briefly, in spite of being quite comical. completely wasted. <br/><br/>The legendary Judi Dench only makes a cameo, so there's nothing to say. Oscar Jaenada only appears briefly at the beginning and end, as the Spanish ¨ ¨ without much to say the truth. <br/><br/>Keith Richards is also very sporadic although it irremediably sympathetic dad Jackie. <br/><br/>The film as a whole? <br/><br/>For very loose truth. Nothing impresses nor really surprised, sometimes it is boring and uninteresting, and only wins when Deep Rush and appear together on screen. The subplot between the missionary and the mermaid is revolting and not interested or god. <br/><br/>The sequences in Blackbeard's ship look promising, but ultimately nothing happens remarkable, except a fight shot with very little skill. <br/><br/>Rob Marshall is not a bad director, but has failed to make us forget Gore Verbinski, especially its lack of energy when providing strength, humor and interest to the film, something not seen in previous. <br/><br/>Interestingly photography becomes as in the first, bright and colorful, leaving aside the greyness and more off of the two sequels. <br/><br/>The soundtrack becomes the same, with additions of Spanish guitar. <br/><br/>Finally, a fourth part, which I was quite disappointed, despite having a good start, and more or less correct outcome, lacks true epic visual spectacle as were his predecessors, and the lack of previous cast members make it less attractive to the viewer. <br/><br/>A sequel that's actually not such, but a spin-off of Jack Sparrow for the moment has not convinced me or fun as I expected. <br/><br/>We will have to wait for the fifth, ¨ Dead Men Tell Tales ¨, to see if this was just a little bump unimportant, or notice of an inevitable decline. <br/><br/>I really hope it's the former. Thank you."
"alindsay-al","6","0","0","7 July 2014"," A film that reminds us the pirates films are not all great
","The return of Captain Jack for a few years and is it terrible no but is it great no, it fits somewhere in the middle ground of just good. This film shows Jack Sparrow, his old love Angelica, her Father the notorious Blackbeard, the British led by former pirate Captain Barbossa and the Spanish Armada all searching for the fountain of youth for their own reasons. Now even though in my opinion the character of Jack Sparrow has ruined Johnny Depp's acting career but he is great at it and you can tell how much fun he has being Jack Sparrow and his performance in this film is great. Now even though some didn't like Keira Knightley in the other films I believe that she is so much better then Penelope Cruz in this film and I believe her performance to be one of the big negatives in this film. However, Ian Mcshane as Blackbeard was an inspired choice and he is truly evil and menacing in this film continuing the tradition of great pirate villains. The return of Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is fantastic and just like Depp you can tell how much fun he has in this role and his chemistry with Depp continues their tradition of being fantastic. The secondary character of the missionary and the story of him and the mermaid was terrible in this film and was just such a huge distraction that I hated. For the story, it is not good at all, it is in fact all over the place. There is just too many people going after the fountain and some are not even in depth also as I mentioned before the secondary story of the missionary and Mermaid is terrible. The script is pretty decent with Sparrow, Blackbeard and Barbossa all have great lines but there is some weak dialogue especially by Cruz. Just like the rest of the pirates films the style is fantastic, the cinematography is great and the soundtrack is awesome. This film is a mixed bag and I hope the next one is better."
"Dfschohr-532-549658","4","0","0","17 November 2013"," Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
","""On Stranger Tides"" marks the fourth film in the Pirates saga. Except this one does not star Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightly. It is Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush reprising their roles as the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow and the now peg-legged Barbossa. New comers to the film are Ian McShane as Blackbeard, and Penelope Curz as his daughter Angelica. Personally I was sick and tired of the Pirate movies after the third installment, but when I saw the trailer for ""On Stranger Tides"" I was very curious to see it. Then the trailer played over and over again and I could already tell that the film was going to be awful. But I still went to see it. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (Depp) is in possession of a map that leads the way to the Fountain of Youth. Barbossa (Rush) accompanies Sparrow for the journey, but with just the intention of killing Blackbeard (McShane). On the way they meet beautiful, yet insanely vicious mermaids. A few invulnerable zombies, who make voodoo dolls that really work, and the Spanish Monarch.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does nothing special with his character, he does tone down the drunken walk, and slur but he does all the same facial features, and wise-cracking jokes. Depp has been disappointing me with his movie choices lately. I enjoyed Rango, but ""Alice in Wonderland"" was just an awful movie with a big cast, and the Gothic touch of Tim Burton, and it failed miserably. Then he made ""The Tourist"" and how that movie got nominated for any award is beyond me. ""The Tourist"" is the perfect example of a movie not to make. The cast helped in no way to pull the story through, it is extremely boring during their monologues, and whoever wrote the film made the twist ending extraordinary stupid. Yeah thats the word to use, STUPID! Come on Johnny step up your game. <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz adds nothing special to the screen besides her beautifulness, and every time she spoke I wanted her to stop talking. I have not seen a lot of Penelope Cruz films that I personally took a liking to, but I thought she was truly exceptional in Vanilla Sky, which is on my top ten favorite films. Ian McShane was dreadful as Blackbeard, it seemed like he was always yelling. Mcshane showed is comedic talent in ""Hot Rod"" which is a funny movie just over the top at some points. I heard he is amazing in HBO's ""Deadwood"". I also enjoyed him in ""Agent Cody Banks"". But when we got to the finale of this film I could not have been happier to see these characters off the screen. I was just kidding about ""Agent Cody Banks"".<br/><br/>How could I forget Geoffrey Rush, who has just come off of the Oscar winning film ""The Kings Speech"", and decides to put back on the pirate costume for a fourth time. He is peg-legged in this one, and has aged drastically. Rush was inexplicably untalented this time around. Which sucks because he is what drove most of the films for me. Barbossa's cameo at the end of the second film is probably one of the best parts to me of that film. But none of his scene were done well in this one. That brings me to the director Rob Marshall, who was way off the mark with this film. His pervious movies include ""Memoir's of a Geisha"", ""Chicago"", and ""Nine"" so its safe to say he was trying something new, but failed with the whole two hours and fifteen minutes of the film. The best of the series is ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and continues in order to get progressively worse. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides a 4 out of 10."

","This is one of those movies that I believe really did not need to be made, and the fact that it was, and grabbed onto the tail-coats of a reasonably successful franchise, suggests to me that at this stage the producers are pretty much scrapping at the bottom of the barrel. When it became clear that the original trilogy was supposed to have been made as a trilogy (and it is much more difficult to create a movie trilogy than it is to write a trilogy of novels) I did look forward to the final movie, but when I discovered that they had written a forth movie, I simply rolled my eyes.<br/><br/>I expected that this movie was not going to be anywhere near as good as the earlier movies (and I would not hold the original trilogy to any high regard) and when I did end up watching it I quite disappointment. Personally, I found it quite boring and unoriginal. While some of the original characters had returned (such as Captain Jack Sparrow), many of the heroes from the original movies had vanished. The new character that they introduced (namely Blackbeard) I just did not consider at all original, and neither did I consider the quest (looking for the Fountain of Youth) to be all that enthralling.<br/><br/>Personally, I really do not want to write much more on this film, so I will leave it at that."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" meant closure to the franchise for director Gore Verbinski, who successfully entered the animation genre afterward. The one who took over four years later was Rob Marshall, the director of Best Picture winner ""Chicago"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""Nine"". While the general perception of the franchise is that they got pretty much worse as they progressed, I have to disagree. I don't think any of the four films are really great movie magic, but all make for a decent watch. It's just that the fresh and new factor decreased with every movie.<br/><br/>In any case, with Verbinski's, Bloom's and Knightley's leaving, it was also a bit of a fresh start for the fourth film. Sam Claflin and the mysterious Astrid Bergès-Frisbey sort of replace Bloom and Knightley and show us a human-mermaid love story, while Ian McShane joined the cast as the voodoo-loving main antagonist and Penélope Cruz enters the scene as his daughter and a former love interest to Captain Sparrow. Back on board are some of the old names such as Kevin McNally and, of course, Geoffrey Rush as that old rotten pirate bastard who's clearly still having a time as great as the one I had watching him. This man's always a delight and gives his characters a special and unique note.<br/><br/>Storywise, everybody's on the hunt for the mystical Fountain of Youth this time and as we witness their pursuit, we see all the factors we liked in the previous films: the pompous costumes, the well-crafted makeup, the spectacular special effects, the great deal of sword fighting and here and there an actually funny one-liner from Mr. Depp. If you're willing to enjoy all of these and can accept a story that has its holes here and there, this is one to watch. The films have risen in running time constantly since the first, but this one takes a huge step back and is even shorter than ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" 10 years ago. Nonetheless it started dragging occasionally from the 60-minute mark onwards and they could have cut it down to the 2-hour mark without hurting the film at all, possibly even improving it.<br/><br/>The fifth installment of the series will be directed by the Norwegian duo which brought us Max Manus and, recently, Oscar nominated foreign language film Kon-Tiki centered on Thor Heyerdahl, which was probably the main reason behind casting them. It's still another three years until it comes out, but I'm already curious about the approach they'll be giving it. My guess is it will be quality-wise similar to films 1 to 4."
"pjvanes69","7","0","0","9 October 2012"," Pirates 4 sails on safer tides rather than stranger ones
","No one expected Pirates of the Caribbean 4 to live up to the originality of the first film but it does manage to bring some of the frivolous fun back into the series that went missing in the third film with a simpler story aimed purely to entertain. <br/><br/>A new director (Rob Marshall) helps to inject some enthusiasm back into the franchise and the inclusion of fresh bunch of supporting characters, led by Penelope Cruz, was a wise choice given the characters portrayed by Knightly and Bloom had pretty much run their course. Let's face it as far as characters go Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is the real draw card for the series and has been since day one. <br/><br/>The opening action sequence has been criticized as being overly choreographed and while I agree it does come off a little too staged at times I thought it was a lot of fun to watch and given the director is best known for musicals such as Nine and Chicago you'd expect the action sequences to have a dance like rhythmic quality to them.<br/><br/>There are no undead pirates or mutated sea creatures in this chapter. Instead we have have to make do with a brief scene involving Mermaids to satisfy the 'supernatural' aspect and while the sequence was engaging I found I was left wanting for some ghosts of pirates past. <br/><br/>McShane's Blackbeard has drawn criticism for not being menacing enough while Rush is applauded for almost stealing the show and while I'd agree on both counts I felt it was a tough ask for McShane to maintain the menace level expected for the duration of his screen- time especially given the tone of the film. Keith Richards has an all too brief cameo reprising his role as Jack's father, so brief and oddly placed that you wonder why they bothered but I'm guessing director Marshall is a fan... personally I'd like to see Aerosmith's Steven Tyler play Jack's uncle in the 5th film, if there is to be one. Tyler dresses like a pirate anyway so if nothing else he'd save the production by supplying his own wardrobe.<br/><br/>While Pirates 4 might have failed to set the franchise sailing again I found it rather enjoyable and better than expected."

","On Stranger Tides is not as well written as the first of the series. I did like some of the settings, such as the tavern where Jack talks to his father. I enjoy seeing the recreations of the time period. The dialog was good enough to keep things interesting. The mermaid attack was done in a very threatening way, although it doesn't feel as epic as the giant squid. There were a few things that weren't really explained that left me unsatisfied, like the ship in the bottle, and the relationship between the clergyman and the mermaid. Johnny Depp is still fun as Jack Sparrow. As long as the rest of the series is good enough, he will be remembered as one of the greatest movie characters ever."

","This is the best Pirates so far. It brought numerous occasions down to lower levels such as action sequences, murderous moments, length and plot; but darker than the previous films. The story is much easier to follow than the last sequel (At World's End). Captain Jack Sparrow and Mr. Gibbs go on a hunt to find the Fountain of Youth. But it's not just them that are hunting for it alone: Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica are after it too. Brimming with swashbuckling special effects and thrilling moments, this film gives another cinematic experience of pirates, treasure hunting, scary stuff and sword fighting. A franchise and film that could carry on to do more sequels but wait until you've watched it to agree."
"Buddy-51","6","0","0","6 June 2012"," Less chaotic and confusing than some of the earlier entries in the series
","Currently a captain without a ship - the Black Pearl having been shrunk and placed inside a sealed bottle, at least for the time being - the inimitable Jack Sparrow finds himself impressed on a vessel, captained by the Spanish pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), that is hot on the trail of Ponce de Leon's famed but ever elusive Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, a British contingent, led by peg-legged ""privateer, not pirate"" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), is on the same mission, though he claims to be doing it not for personal enrichment but for king and country.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" with a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rosio and direction by Rob Marshall, keeps the storyline fairly simple and streamlined this time out, avoiding the overstuffed, convoluted plotting that often made the earlier installments all but impossible to follow. Even Johnny Depp himself, in the spirit of the enterprise, seems to have toned down some of the more flamboyant qualities of his earlier performances and appears to be relishing playing a pirate who is less in charge of his own fate and more at the mercy of the other characters this time around. Yet, he's still able to land a sharp-tongued barb with the best of them, whether it be against Blackbeard, Barbossa or Angelica, the feisty love interest played by the beautiful Penelope Cruz.<br/><br/>As is par for the course, the movie runs on far too long, padding out its length with a sappy romance between a preacher-man and a mermaid and a few too many distended swordfights for the movie's (and the audience's) good, but, overall, this turns out to be one of the less top-heavy and heavy-handed of the ""Pirates"" films."

"slokes","4","0","0","1 April 2012"," Spectacle Over Sense
","Watching ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" in the theater was an oppressive experience, with its bombastic score, overripe performances, and hyper-long running time. Watching it at home on my new Blu-Ray and high-def TV presented a more entertaining experience.<br/><br/>There the film's signature strengths blossom forth, especially John Myrhe's stellar production design as it re-imagines the streets of London in the 18th century or the forecastle of the ""Queen Anne's Revenge"" lined with bony balusters taken from Blackbeard's victims. The sound is plenty good, too.<br/><br/>I still think the film plods along hopelessly, in service of a barely-there plot that takes too long to pay off. Still, it makes for a nice demonstration disc. That's about does it for raves from me, but it was more than I expected going in.<br/><br/>The previous entry in the ""Pirates"" series, ""At World's End,"" wrapped up what became a trilogy of ""Pirates"" movies and, in so doing, carried a lot of baggage to be worked out over three long, convoluted hours. It was the only ""Pirates"" film I saw before this one, and I can say the fourth film makes for a slightly better experience. It starts fresh.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) opens the film as a captain without a ship or crew. He does have something to help him get his sea-legs back, an idea of where to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. He soon finds himself a prisoner of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his convent-raised daughter Angelica (Penélope Cruz), in a race with the peg-legged privateer Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and three Spanish vessels. All seek the prize, albeit for very different motives.<br/><br/>""On Stranger Tides"" lacks for something I'll call ""motive force,"" a reason for people acting the way they do. The Fountain is a bit of a MacGuffin, though it serves a purpose in an engaging climax that takes too long to arrive. For the most part, what you get is a lot of Depp's fruity overacting as the verbose Sparrow, along with some mild comedy and action scenes that strain for spectacle while leaving you at a loss as to what is being accomplished or how.<br/><br/>Director Rob Marshall comes to this movie having helmed successful musicals, and his choreography background is too much in evidence. So is a subplot involving a missionary and a mermaid that is shoehorned for obvious chick appeal and slows down the already-overladen plot at many turns. (I admit I can stare at mermaid Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey as long as they let me, but I don't think they gave her much to do.)<br/><br/>Depp can be entertaining; he's thoroughly committed to getting more out of the material than a paycheck. ""I'm just as bent as ever! Hellishly so!"" he tells his faithful sidekick Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally). I just wish Marshall had told his star to take it down a couple of notches, instead of following Depp along for the ride.<br/><br/>Well, ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" was a ride, before it was anything else. I guess he felt Depp knew what he was doing, and I suppose a billion in theatrical revenue bears that up. I just don't think this film merits lasting interest. It pushes everything to eleven without explaining much of what is going on, expecting the audience to be swept along. I suspect more than a few were shaking their heads about it a bit later.<br/><br/>Zombies? Fire-breathing ships controlled by a sword? The movie seems written to accommodate its special effects, which aren't so much special as loud. Still, the film does generate something positive from its last hour. McShane is a welcome addition to the cast, glowering effectively as the one true villain of the piece, and gives the ending needed panache.<br/><br/>Will I want to see another ""Pirates""? Well, this was better seeing cold than #3 was. There are definite signs of the series losing steam. While diverting in short bursts, Sparrow and company have become leaden, unengaging caricatures. With the money this made, there's no reason for the producers to rein in the excesses any further than they already did. But one can hope. ""On Stranger Tides"", for all its weaknesses, offers intermittent fun and a sense of possibilities to be explored."

"spacemandc","3","0","0","17 February 2012"," What a HUGE disappointment!
","Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)"" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, ""Curse of the Black Pearl,"" way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride.<br/><br/>And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in – an inconsequential ""pretty boy"" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a ""pretty bit of fluff"" who was ""force fed"" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., ""we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly ""updated"" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..."" Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character – and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a ""love interest"" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in ""Captain Blood"" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in ""Against All Flags"" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely)....<br/><br/>Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that ""things would get better,"" i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride – and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel – BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the ""perfect woman of his dreams"" become the ""the nightmare hag from hell"""

","Having seen all the previous films in the series and despite being woefully disappointed by the third instalment, I decided to give this one a go anyway. The critics tell me it's better than ""At Worlds End"" and I am prepared (on this occasion) to believe them. Fortunately (for them), they were indeed correct and while not as good as the first two, it is an improvement. I will give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>This time Jack Sparrow is on the trail of the Fountain of Youth. Teaming up with an old flame, Angelica, who turns out to be the daughter of the notorious pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself aboard Blackbeard's ship and on route to the island where the Fountain can be found. Also on their trail there is Barbossa who, having lost his leg to Blackbeard is out for revenge. Throw in the might of the Spanish fleet and there's more than enough competition for the prize. Certain items have to be collected before the Fountain can be used, not least of which is the tear of a mermaid and this proves very difficult to obtain. I don't want to say too much, but needless to say a perilous journey is about to culminate in the mother of all showdowns! I had better not say any more of the Spoiler Police (Pirates Division) will have me clapped in irons and keel-hauled.<br/><br/>Very well made with some excellent CGI and stunt work; these are the hallmarks of these films. Performance wise; Johnny Depp did his usual comic turn as Jack Sparrow, Penélope Cruz did a decent job as Angelica Teach, Geoffrey Rush was good (as ever) as Barbossa and Ian McShane I felt did a decent job as Blackbeard. Honourable mentions must also go to; Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Sam Claflin as Philip, Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as Syrina, Stephen Graham as Scrum, Keith Richards as Captain Teague and Richard Griffiths as King George.<br/><br/>Although I did find it entertaining to a point, I did feel it got a little tedious and predictable towards the end. The trouble is, with three previous films, we have seen it all before and it does all get a little repetitive. I also felt it was way too long! I guess the films are still making large amounts of cash for the Disney machine and so they will continue to make them (sadly). I think, if you haven't seen a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film before then I can recommend it to you; if you have, then be prepared for more of the same.<br/><br/>My score: 6.3/10 IMDb Score: 6.6/10 (based on 111,001 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 33/100 (based on 245 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 61/100 (based on 145,528 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides returns Johnny Depp to his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow. After four films, the comfort with which he plays Captain Jack is easily reflected on-screen. After Gore Verbinski, director of the prior three films, declined to return, Rob Marshall ('Chicago') stepped in to direct his first Pirates movie. Marshall, bringing a fresh perspective, improves upon what went wrong with the last two films: walking sea monsters/humanoids, excessive CGI, substandard stories, and poor editing.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides begins with the finding of a man's body. Suddenly the man awakens, rambling of Ponce De Leon and the Fountain of Youth. Elsewhere, Jack is attempting to help his shipmate, Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) from an impending hanging. During the daunted rescue attempt, Jack is captured by the British. King George II (Richard Griffiths) interrogates Jack on his knowledge of the Fountain of Youth. It is alternately revealed that the King had previously procured the services of Captain Barbosa, played once again by the great Geoffrey Rush, to find the Fountain. Spectacularly, Jack escapes his predicament and soon finds himself in a vulnerable position when he meets Angelica (Penẻlope Cruz). Angelica, a past lover, has need of Jack's assistance in locating the Fountain. He soon finds himself, along with her, aboard the ""Queen Anne's Revenge"", the famous pirating vessel belonging to the notorious Blackbeard, Angelica's father. Blackbeard is superbly played by Ian McShane, who seems quite comfortable in the role of the villain and provides a standout performance. In searching for the Fountain, a scavenger hunt ensues between all the key characters.<br/><br/>The Fourth Pirates movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters! No matter how disappointed you were by the second and/or third movie, this one has an actual story. Aside from a pointless subplot, with a reluctant member of Blackbeard's crew and a mermaid, the rest of the movie flows nicely. Jack is as entertaining as ever, and although some of the jokes may seem old or repetitive, it still works. Keith Richards returns as Jack's dad and has the best line in the movie. I look forward to appearances from him in future movies. Yes, you can be certain that there will be additional Pirates of the Caribbean films made. Considering the amount of money each movie makes, and in this case the addition of a quality story, Disney would be foolish not to continue. As is the new trend, there's an additional scene, post credits .save yourself the time, and don't bother. Considering the length of time it takes to watch all the credits, you will leave disappointed that you stayed for such a small reveal.<br/><br/>Summer Movie Grade: B-<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

","I'll try to make this short. First of all I loved the character of Jack Sparrow. I feel Johnny Depp's greatest character portrayal to date is that of Capt Jack Sparrow. I was saddened when the last of the trilogy ended. By accident one day I was commenting on such and by accident found that he had just announced that the would be a fourth. I waited anxiously for the movie to come out and one the first day we went to see it. I was so happy to see Capt Jack. I waited to see the Jack that I had come to love and then the movie ended. I was very disappointed. It was as if the director held Johnny Depp back from bringing out his famous character. I believe that if the old Johnny doesn't come back in number 5 there will not be a number 6. I hope the old Jack Sparrow comes back!"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","13 December 2011"," Captain Jack Sparrow Is Back With A More Exciting Adventure
","Thanks to Johnny Depp, Jack Sparrow has become an international icon and he continues to draw viewers into his exciting adventures. The first film that came out in 2003, brought back the genre that was forgotten. I mean, before that, what was the last exciting adventure film that has voyages, pirates, treasure hunt, babe, and loads of energy? Perhaps 'Indiana Jones' was the last of such films.<br/><br/>Then a couple of years later came the second 'Pirates' film which did not live up to the first but still managed to be entertaining to an extent. The third movie was a major disappointment in comparison as things got more absurd. As such, I wasn't expecting much from this film. But then again, Jack Sparrow is such an awesome character and now without the tiresome Elizabeth Swann angel perhaps this may be worth a view.<br/><br/>After seeing it, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is back on track. Jack Sparrow's new adventure is much better than the second and third movie. The pacing is a tad slow in the beginning but picks up after the first half hour. The new storyline and characters fit together brilliantly. The deadly mermaid sequence was a fun addition.<br/><br/>The special effects and art direction are good enough and the cinematography is superb. The soundtrack almost exactly the same as in the prequels with the exception of the guitar pieces which were a refreshing change.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush reprises his role, this time as Sparrow's rival Barbossa, and he is just as wickedly hilarious as he was in the first film. Ian McShane is an excellent villainous rival. Kevin McNally is amusing as the sidekick who switches sides. Fiercely sexy Penelope Cruz is feisty, fiery and very funny. She draws more laughter than Knightley did. But, this is easily Depp's film. It is solid proof that 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is carried by Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>If there is going to be another 'Pirates' movie (I suspect so) then I hope it continues to be just as much enjoyable. On a last note, don't miss the hilarious cameo by Judi Dench."

","I'm not a huge fan of the series... I remember loving the first Pirates. I saw that one at the theater with my now wife. I remember sleepwalking through the second one. I caught bits and pieces of the third, but have still never really sat through the whole thing in one setting.<br/><br/>Enough time had passed by to let me give this series a new chance last night. I was committed to going in without reading too much about it, and watching the film in its' entirety. <br/><br/>There were many strengths and weaknesses here - so it might be best if I break it down that way.<br/><br/>Strengths: Johnny Depp is still charming and witty, and Jack Sparrow has little to nothing to do with this series' decline.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz wasn't nearly as annoying as I usually find her to be.<br/><br/>The set-up was decent.<br/><br/>The film did showcase some nice visuals, and it had some really good ideas. The one that stands out is the first Mermaid sequence. It was a fresh take, and easily the most exciting scene in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Weaknesses: I love Geoffrey Rush, but Barbossa as a character here is poorly written and has completely lost his backbone.<br/><br/>Blackbeard is also poorly written and also seems a bit weak.<br/><br/>While this isn't as long as some previous entries - it still seems overlong.<br/><br/>Too many characters that are under-developed.<br/><br/>The film suffers from some of the same, extremely unrealistic fantasy stuff, and I'm not talking about ""the Fountain of Youth"". I'm talking about Ropes that move on there own etc. These types of issues have seemed to get worse as the series moves on. I know it's a fantasy film, but Pirate lore is based in fact and I wish the entire series would have been a little more realistic. It could have still been fun.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>The good news is I made it through it. More good news is I won't again. The bad news is they'll make another. The really bad news is that many of us will pay to see it. I won't. I'm done with the series. Even though I missed much of the third installment - I think I can say with confidence that this thing hasn't been right since the original.<br/><br/>44/100"

","This is the fourth time our cinemas have been graced with Captain Jack Sparrow and his swashbuckling gang of inept pirates, and I have to say I hope that it is the last. The next instalment is just another carbon copy of everything we have seen before only less thrilling and without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>If you have seen the other films you will know that Jack is on a quest for something mystical but is kidnapped by a fearsome Captain and his haunted ship. He must escape; get to the end of his quest before them and also before another mysterious third party. Oh and also throw in Captain Barbossa somewhere. Basically like every other film in the franchise.<br/><br/>In this one Jack begins in custody of the King who demands the where about of the Fountain of Youth. Jack claims he doesn't know and escapes their clutches. He then has a talk with his Dad before being told that another 'Jack Sparrow' is recruiting for his ship. He investigates and finds it to be his long lost love Angelica (Cruz), only disguised as him. She then kidnaps Jack and he ends up captured on the ship of Blackbeard (McShane), Angelica's father. They are on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth as Blackbeard's fate suggests that he will die if he doesn't find it and drink from it. To use the Fountain however they must acquire two chalices and the tear of a mermaid. So off they set in search of this.<br/><br/>Also the King of England has sent his own ship of pioneers after the Fountain lead by Captain Barbossa (Rush) who seems to have deflected and changed sides, but secretly he has a hidden agenda and is in fact after Blackbeard for being the reason he lost his leg and his beloved Black Pearl. Alongside that is a random Spanish fleet also after the Fountain but they are mentioned at the beginning and shown at the end, they are just completely pointless. We finish up with all three parties arriving at the Fountain and fighting to the bitter end, as usual. You get all that? If you've seen the others you may be able to understand some pointless, confusing plot lines. <br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this film. I will start with a couple of positives though. The opening thirty minutes are entertaining, and the introduction of Jack is great. Barbossa's deflection is a decent plot twist and casting Penelope Cruz is a nice touch as without Knightley there would be no eye-candy. Of course Johnny Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow as always but this is where my negative assessments begin, we've seen it. We have seen this pirate do the same things in different places time and time again and in this one he seems to have more feelings than in previous films and he has become less selfish, that is not the Jack Sparrow we know and love. To continue, the villain Blackbeard is one of the weakest villains I have watched. He is not a patch on the original Barbossa or Davy Jones, hell even Lord Beckett was more fearsome. For Blackbeard to be classed as the nastiest pirate is ludicrous as he does nothing other than shout. The addition of the Spanish is pointless as they have no input into the story and seem to be there to add the political edge like Lord Beckett did in the previous ones. The story as a whole has just completely run out of ideas. The writing is appalling. Things just seem to turn up half way through so that they can be used in the climax. If these things were bought to our attention at the beginning than I may buy into them but they were just placed there to tie the story up.<br/><br/>I could go on for ages moaning about this film, but I won't as there are some parts I liked, such as the fight scenes, although they have all been seen before they still do entertain. I also like the idea of using mermaids and of Blackbeard shrinking ships into bottles; this is something I think should have been more explored.<br/><br/>The thing is I loved the initial Pirates of the Caribbean so I hate to be slating this one but I'm sorry they need to nip these stories in the bud and fast. Mr Depp I also think it is time you broke away from Mr Sparrow and proved that you don't just play eccentric roles. The majorly disappointing thing is that this will be the first time I have said that a film would benefit from keeping Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley in it. Now you should be able to imagine how bad this film really is."

","Almost two years ago when I wrote my comments for 'Pirates #3' I said, ""Is this really the final installment."" It seems that it wasn't, but I hope now that it is. I know, I don't HAVE to watch them, but I feel an obligation. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is back as Jack Sparrow, the pirate always looking for a ship. His strange slurring speech was novel the first time but frankly is getting a bit tiresome. <br/><br/>His love interest is a new character, Penélope Cruz as Angelica Teach, who we eventually find out is the long lost daughter of Blackbeard. It seems that Jack and Angelica had some sort of relationship some years back, and are reuniting, not sure if there are feelings.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is Barbossa and veteran Ian McShane at almost 70 makes a fine Blackbeard.<br/><br/>The story is essentially three teams going for the same 'treasure', the mythical 'fountain of youth', one from Britain, one from Spain, and the pirates. As legend goes they must retrieve two silver chalices and with the help of one teardrop from a mermaid as the catalyst one person can gain the years from another.<br/><br/>This of course requires a mermaid and that is filled by the exotic looking Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as Syrena, carried through the jungle in a container half filled with water for much of the second half of the movie. <br/><br/>Since most of this is no longer novel, some of the scenes moved a bit slowly, and I some times became tired of just another sword fight between pirates. Not to say I wasn't entertained, because I was, but it was a bit long at just over two hours. <br/><br/>The critic Ebert has what I consider a very fair and accurate review. <br/><br/>It was fun to see rocker Keith Richards in the movie, in the role of Captain Teague."
"Antagonisten","Null","0","0","15 November 2011"," The boredom of sequels
","It's not news that Hollywood has serious writing problems these days. Most of what comes out is tedious rehashes of things we've seen a million times before. Especially this is true of sequels where the previous movies often seem to be a heavy luggage that drags the movie down, rather than a legacy to build on.<br/><br/>I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean-movie, I still think it's one of the best adventure movies in a very long time. It's got a near-perfect mix of adventure, action and comedy without ever becoming too silly or too violent. Of course it also had great actors to match. The second movie was slightly less entertaining but still good. The third one I remember seeing at the theater, but I can't for the life of me remember anything from it. Probably that's not a very good sign.<br/><br/>This fourth installment has all the elements that made the first movie great. It has the adventurous music, good actors (Depp, Rush, McShane etc.) and a fairly suitable mix between action and comedy. Still, it does nothing to excite me. I just sat there feeling like I had seen it all before, and nothing really came as a surprise. There is just no creativity here, like everyone is just going through the motions. Quite frankly, half-an-hour in I was beginning to get pretty bored. And of course it didn't help that each and every movie these days has to drag on for almost 2,5 hours even though there is script for about 1,5. Is there some hidden premium when you make long movies? Wouldn't it be cheaper to shoot a movie that's 90 minutes instead of 200? Many of the problems I experience with a lot of movies today could be solved by slashing 20-30 minutes from the running-time and adjusting the script accordingly.<br/><br/>In the end watching this is like watching Pirates of the Caribbean for the fourth time. Nothing new, nothing fresh and I found it incredibly hard to care about anything that happened. If you really like all of previous movies I guess you will like this too, since it's more of the same. But honestly, for the rest of us it's not worth the trouble. It's not as bad as the latest Transformers-movie, but seeing both of them in a short space of time I'm about fed up with Hollywood-sequels for a while. I want to see something fresh, and this corpse has been floating for a while."

"commanderblue","Null","0","0","14 October 2011"," ""Stranger certainly describes it""
","""Stranger"" certainly describes it, this being the latest outing of the swashbuckling adventures of the nefarious Captain Jack Sparrow (played for the umpteenth time by Johnny Depp). Four years ago, this overblown franchise thankfully ended on a horrid note. Now, Jerry Bruckheimer (Disney's favorite producer) returned to give us another epic debacle about seafaring pirates in a fantastical misadventure. Between the last film and this current one, a few good things have happened: 1. Bloom and Knightley's absence is hardly missed, and the film ran better without their melodrama. 2. The 'tour de force' was toned down. Quite a bit. In fact, On Stranger Tides is even lackluster; tepid at best. <br/><br/>The story kicks off in an undisclosed year where Jack Sparrow is rescuing Joshamee Gibbs in London from the gallows. We get an homage to Indiana-Jones style action and then the film arrives promptly to the premise: Sparrow must sail to the Fountain of Youth...which he may or may not have seen before (we can't really imply anything because it's too damn vague). After meeting up with an ex-lover named Angelica (played like a James Bond girl by Penelope Cruz), the two embark on the quest, in league with Spaniards, the British (lead by the converted Commodore Barbossa), and the evil, diabolical, motorcycle-junkie Blackbeard. Unfortunately, there's nothing more to describe about the plot, unless you find interesting a melodramatic subplot involving a soulless preacher and a shallow mermaid. And that's really all the movie is, sorry to say. For a painstaking 137 minutes, I was subjected to Hollywood ""movie playtime"" with these three groups (Spaniards, Brits, and Pirates) interchanging in sword fights, testing their fate, and other maritime conundrums. And sadly, the ensemble cast has nothing new to offer. While Depp and Rush continue to perform impeccably in their longstanding characters (from 2003), it's the plot in which they're pitted that ultimately creates their cinematic downfall. What of the rest? Cruz, who yields some surprising chemistry with Depp, is also downtrodden by her looming offscreen pregnancy (LITERALLY offscreen. The filmmakers had to use body doubles in some shots). I'm sure Ian McShane on the other hand is just happy to get his paycheck so long as he assumes that ""bad guy"" attitude in what I believe is the blandest pirate ever to sail the shallow seas.<br/><br/>Characterization aside, the film did boast some impressive cinematography (albeit, a few aerial shots were stolen from George of the Jungle)--but it's nonetheless superior to all of that CGI bullshit we saw from the last two films. (Scratch that, CGI and water). <br/><br/>Overall, On Stranger Tides is a popcorn flick hailing tired, A-list stars and ecstatic producers. It's definitely a finer film than the last two outings--still pending two lawsuits for ripping off Lord of the Rings--and if you're looking for mindless movie madness to accompany that voracious popcorn munching, look no further. Or, you can always board the Disneyland ride (or youtube it) and get the same experience in under two hours. THAT cannot be bargained with"
"chaos-rampant","Null","0","0","21 August 2011"," The place from where tides flow
","Most viewers will find this a bloated, stuffy mess, with good reason I think, and will be able to easily write off as yet another unnecessary sequel, with mechanical reworkings.<br/><br/>But let's take a look at the stage of the film. Center stage is Jack Sparrow with his gallery of quirky mannerisms, the off-beat charm that has sustained the series from the get go. The wrap-around is a disposable pageant, with every now and then a different backdrop. Shepherded next to him are two of the best 'elephants' in the acting biz right now - Rush and McShane. They both understand what it is all about, so they relish their part with grandiloquent pantomime. They inhabit costumes, not people.<br/><br/>So, yes, no one is going to think twice about Tides. Viewers who have learned to distinguish between Malick as 'high art' and Hollywood as a roadshow of cheap entertainments will likely turn it off after thirty minutes. We've seen elsewhere Captain Sparrow evade hanging, be marshalled into an impossible journey, and the series of ironic twists that eventually resolve it.<br/><br/>But if, on the other hand, we are not merely passing through cinema and have, instead, invested ourselves in a certain worldview and are looking for its representation, that is to say we're not looking at image for its technical accomplishment but as space for contemplation; then, with the right implications, every movie becomes a potential support for meditation.<br/><br/>So, let's take a look at the stage again. We'll need to improvise a little because the design is not by the hand of a master filmmaker, the metaphor is topsy turvy but there nonetheless.<br/><br/>First, the twist within the narrative given to us as a charade of deception, whereupon the players disguise themselves into what they intend to invoke in the stage of the film. Hitchcock was a cosummate master of this, the ball masque, moreover so because we became so engrossed into the surface of the thrilling escapade that, perhaps, it didn't register until later. Each objective to be accomplished - what was called the McGuffin - was merely the ritual trinket around which the players wrapped themselves.<br/><br/>Into this, the foreshadowing that things are not what they seem, the very meaning to contemplate. There is all the talk about fate between the participants, do we write our own, consign to the narrative above, or occasionally cheat as best we can. So, here is fashioned a narrative about these narratives, as an attempt to surmise the metaphysical blueprint from which they flow - the one tide that gives rise to all the rest. At this point it's merely wordplay, but notice how it's visualized inside.<br/><br/>The clue laid out with regards to this, in spite of everything else, is a stunning conceit. A closet full of miniature ships in bottles, each its own bubble of a universe.<br/><br/>So, the journey to discover the Fountain of Youth becomes this journey to the place where narratives are formed, where the tides that govern the soul flow from. This is not random stuff. Notice the threshold that separates the two worlds; the waters now reversed, flowing backwards, upwards.<br/><br/>Oh, the Catholic Spaniards show up there to destroy this temple of ancient, secret knowledge, which is its own off-hand comment on destructive religion. But the movie doesn't end there.<br/><br/>It ends with two scenes set in unspecificed beaches. In the first, Sparrow disentangles himself from the narrative we have been watching, at the promise of love from Penelope Cruz the music in the background, about to swell into tricly crescendo, is abruptly cut off as he saunters off. In the next and final one, Sparrow, who could have obtained the secret knowledge - the eternal incarnate - has instead settled for a bottle with a miniature ship, the bottle that contains his own reality. He will not go on - just yet, at least- to join a fictional pantheon of heroes, but the possibilities to write his own narrative remain limitless.<br/><br/>Raoul Ruiz died yesterday. I'd like to think he would have found merit here. He could have made the movie into what it has promise to be. Wojciech Has. Peter Greenaway; any of these people with their notions about sailing inwards. But alas, it's a Bruckheimer/Disney project, and we'll have to improvise our way through the noisy attractions."

"hazel-752-685975","Null","0","0","15 July 2011"," Most of this review is a spoiler: BEWARE
","Having absolutely loved the previous three movies in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy I was looking forward to the fourth one, hoping it wouldn't be a cheesy let down that all series seem to achieve at some point. I was a bit unnerved by the fact that in one of the posters I mistook the new female lead Penelope Cruz for Keira Knightley. Not a good start. Anyways, I walked into the cinema with reasonably high expectations and was thoroughly let down.<br/><br/>Okay, bad points, let's start from the beginning. After the introduction informing us that the Spanish are after the Fountain of Youth (the name says it all really) it cuts to Captain Jack Sparrow who is running away as per usual. This time he's stuck with Gibbs in a carriage heading to god knows where. This is the first of the explanatory scenes that really annoyed me. They are discussing what Jack's latest goal is other than the obvious retrieval of the black pearl which has plagued him since the first film. They are talking about what Jack plans to do with himself and are generally catching up with each other. I prefer things to be shown through actions rather than sitting and having a nice chat when it comes to well-known action films like this. However they do manage to pique our interest with the mention of a Captain Jack imposter recruiting people. <br/><br/>They progress to their mysterious destination and Jack is forced to talk to the English King (Harry Potter fans will recognise Uncle Vernon at this point) who wants him to go to the Fountain of Youth for him to stop the Spanish claiming the land and glory before the English. It is at this alarming point that Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) comes into the scene and reveals that he's switched sides. Barbossa is no longer a pirate, it's rather disturbing to see his rough, scarred face and peg leg in the uniform of an honest sailor. Jack, who seems extra tipsy throughout the entire film, manages his amusing yet dramatic escape and the soundtrack kicks in with the music we all love, or at least recognise. Saved from a gunshot by his father who randomely turns up in the streets they go inside the pub for a drink. His dad warns him that the Fountain will test Jack before disappearing. Jack continues to go about his business starting with the imposter impersonating him. <br/><br/>A brilliantly choreographed fight then takes place in the back of the pub with Jack fighting himself. They even got up onto the struts in the ceiling. The whole scene is a bit too reminiscent of his fight with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in the first film for my liking however. Eventually he realises that his imposter is his old love Angelica (what kind of a name is that!?) who he later discovers is the daughter of ruthless Blackbeard: a fearsome, pirate who owns a magical sword. As the rest of the film progresses you realise it's all about Jack and Angelica in the midst of the search for the Fountain of Youth , plus a mermaid and Christian who are needed as part of the ritual to get to it. <br/><br/>Overall it is every bit as fun as the previous three films but it goes for the drama of the various couples. I couldn't envision Jack ever getting involved with someone who he has real feelings for, or as he calls them: ""stirrings"". His only love interest has been the Black Pearl as far as I'm concerned so that spoilt the majority of the film for me. The Christian and the mermaid seemed sweet but in comparison to Will and Elizabeth's romance in the previous three films it simply wasn't strong or angsty enough to keep your interest. The plot was ever present and brilliant of course and it's difficult to go wrong with Barbossa but I just don't think it was anywhere near as good as it could've been. However everyone has a different opinion, go see it and decide yourself."

","The first pirates movie introduced us to something new that we haven't seen before and a great adventure set sail, the second got us off course of where we wanted to be taken and the third somehow lost its way along the strong tides of what audiences demanded. Now we are given this new pirates film that has some new things introduced, but falls off the edge of the world on its journey, killing the franchise and destroying the hope of something more in this series. This film lacks the fresh story like we were given in the first movie (likable characters, new story, and something that doesn't lose your interest). This movie is the complete opposite and it becomes a bore because the audience has seen all this before and becomes old real quick. The new cast brings nothing to the film to help its cause of being successful; very forgettable roles that are out shined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. The first 30 to 60 minutes of this movie was OK, but after that it got confusing and started to lose its way during the story line jumping all over the place. Pointless scenes that serve no purpose, flat moments that lack Jack Sparrows presence, and not enough action/story to carry this movie along. It almost feels like some of the same pirates cast with new faces, but not the same likable pirates movie. It's also hard to realize that Disney wants to make two more of these. Disney just seems to want the name of the Pirates movie to become their cash cow without caring if the audience will be entertained or not. Disney is great at making animation movies that bring feeling to the audience, but when it comes to real life movies they make, they seem to always fall short of something enjoyable. This franchise had its day in the sun now it will be walking the plank if it continues."

","I admit, when I first got word that another Pirates movie was in the making, I thought it was just another attempt to make more money off an aging franchise. Honestly, the only really good movie in the series is Black Pearl. Deadman's Chest was OK, but it contained a plot too complex for me to fully understand. At World's End was a disappointment (I fell asleep within the first 30 minutes of it). So the idea of a fourth Pirates didn't appeal to me since the third movie convinced me that the series was due.<br/><br/>However, after seeing On Stranger Tides with a group that invited me to come see it with them, I must say that I totally misjudged it. The filmmakers were smart in their choice to cut down the time of the movie and abandon Will and Elizabeth in favor of a storyline centered around our favorite pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Instead of a continuation of the plot unfolded in the previous two movies, we are presented with an entirely different plot that is much easier to follow and less complex. The acting is good, most notably Johnny Depp who propels the entire movie as Jack. The action sequences, like in previous Pirates movies, are smooth and well choreographed. And we are left with an ending that is satisfying and somewhat humorous (you would have to see it to know what I'm talking about...).<br/><br/>Overall, On Stranger Tides was a good way to make up for At World's End and gives us a movie centered around Captain Jack Sparrow, whose character is responsible for the popular interest people have in the series. Definitely go see it, despite what some critics have been saying. It was a breath of fresh air..."

","If you've never seen a Pirates film before, this will probably seem pretty darn good. It keeps a fast pace, never seems to get dull. There's a few new inclusions to the story - Blackbeard being one, and Ian McShane does a pretty fair job of being someone you don't really want to mess with (in a Disney sort of way!). The mermaids are a nice touch too. The story and plot flow pretty well and most of the actors do a pretty good job. Except for Geoffry. I don't know why, because I think he's a great actor, but he's just not as convincing in this. I always felt like I was watching Geoffry Rush and not his character.<br/><br/>The other slightly disappointing thing with this movie is that it felt a little 'formula' driven, like it was a bit too well thought out or over rehearsed and too slick. In the end, while there was nothing to complain about, I just wasn't engaged by the movie and have spent almost no time thinking about it once it finished. Towards the end I was resisting the temptation to look at my watch....and we all know THAT feeling.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, my wife and I looked at each other and just sort of shrugged.....aw yeah...it was alright sort of thing.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth a watch, but it's nothing you haven't already seen."

","This film is well produced. It has great looks. The plot is simple and easy to follow compared with the last installment. Penelope Cruz is a good addition to replace Keira. So why isn't the movie great? It's because there is no new ground broken here. Almost everything that is done in this installment has been done before. There are very few surprises and nothing in action or humor that makes this movie a unique one in the series.<br/><br/>There is one thing, at the end Cruz gets a Voodoo doll of Sparrow. Is this a thing she is going to stick pins in it and end this series?

","4 movies into the series, it is clear that the flair and hype from the first film is wearing off. True, Jack Sparrow is as enjoyable to watch as he was in the first film, but On Stranger Tides fails to bring anything truly new and exciting to the screen. The overused themes of trickery, mutiny, and overall deception is beginning to show its age, and the large collection of new characters does little to draw us into the film. As well, there are simply a few to many things to keep track of this time, whether it be about Jack's personal goals, Angelica's relation with her father, Blackbeard's obsession with the fountain, Barbarossa's obsession with killing Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British, the mermaids, zombies, and the troubles of the stalwart missionary, Phillip Swift. That said however, the film still manages to nail a few key points that we've all come to love from the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The short, funny punchlines from the character still manage to put a smile on our face, and the fantasy world of the pirates is captivating enough for us to stay interested for the full 2 hours. There isn't much in the form of depth and big picture or message, but there is definitely a lot of entertainment value. In conclusion though, it might be wise for the crew of this movie to finally throw in the towel, and close of with, what is overall, an enjoyable and lovable film, despite being a bit stretched from the previous instalments."
"WellaBlack","7","0","0","11 June 2011"," Stranger Tides...a good spice added to the main course made of the first three movies
","I am writing this as a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean in hope that other fans will trust me: This movie was good, but it wasn't GREAT. It of course wasn't as good as the first three movies were. It had an entirely different taste. It began in a very fast temp, but later lost it. It did not have the balance the third movie had, and neither was it as active as the second one.<br/><br/>From time to time I found myself really missing Keira Knightley(and this surprises me because I've never been particularly fond of her presence in the movies.) Angelica is cool, and a pirate, and has a nice body and all...but Elizabeth was much better(actually Elizabeth was a better fighter than Angelica, which surprised me.) <br/><br/>Blackbeard? He's fine, but not awesome. Sometimes looking at him I felt like I was looking at an ordinary old man clinging to his vain beliefs. He is just too dull next to the colourful villains of the previous movies(even Beckett was more colourful.) He did not have the effect Davy Jones had, but still he is a to-be-adored character. I had the feeling that he had a tremendous back-story to himself that was not given(and yet still supposed to be given.) <br/><br/>I really liked the mermaids. They were CREEPY,but I loved them. Jack as usual is a pleasure to have on white screen.Johnny Depp did a good job there, but I should say that sometimes the screenplay leaned too hard on Jack and the jokes started getting lame.To me the best thing in the movie was Barbossa. He was the only character that preserved his taste...<br/><br/>In the end, yes movie had many faults, but still it was one of those movies you could watch forever. Continuous adventure is fun. And seeing Jack and Gibbs under the sunset, and Barbossa finding his fancy hat and giving his usual ""blaaah"" laugh made me forgive and forget everything else. :) So, go and see it- while it's still on the big screen (and by the way, I watched it in 2D and I don't think I missed anything- I'm anti-3D for movies.) It is very fun and you definitely should see it. Don't worry: It is not as bad as it seemed in the trailer, but still know that this movie has an entirely different taste. In the end, I'm sure you'll be very happy too when you see Barbossa wearing his old hat ;)"

","On the way to hopefully finding the fountain of youth, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) finds himself in a dire predicament when he is captured by his ex-lover Angelica (Penélope Cruz )and the nefarious Blackbeard (Ian McShane). They require Jack's help in finding the fountain in order to save Blackbeard while trying to avoid the clutches of Barbossa (Gerofery Rush).<br/><br/>As a sequel to the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, On Stranger Tides attempts to refresh the series by concentrating on an uncomplicated narrative. Instead, the film takes a page out of the original film in the series but not quite as successfully. There are a few plots being weaved together but they all come up short in execution which ultimately threatens the potential of various associated characters. The core reason is due to the lack of detailed exposition. The most problematic of these is the love story between Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) which is evidently undeveloped and unimportant to the overall narrative. Their growing love lacks tangibility and it becomes frustrating when their conclusion becomes a guessing game for the audience. There are various plots developed but they are underwhelming and this hurts the film as the action sequences alone cannot stop the odd scene from dragging along. For the most part the film is a fun watch but just not a particularly great one.<br/><br/>The acting is passable enough as Depp and Rush convey their characters in a similar fashion to older films. Cruz and McShane add positively to the cast with the former bringing some zest to the film while the latter does bring the expected arrogance to Blackbeard. Claflin and Berges-Frisbey are not able to be quite as convincing. However, this is mostly due to their limited capacity in the film, which comes from the limited nature of their respective plot on the overall narrative of the film. On Stranger Tides also sports a far less noticeable and capable supporting cast when compared to the original trilogy which is disappointing, so the chance to offset the major situations in the film to the lesser cast is next to impossible.<br/><br/>There is an extensive use of CG throughout the film and predominately with good results. What is a strange decision is to have a large portion of the film shrouded in darkness. A lot of the film deals with enlightenment, either by faith or common humanity, but the filmmakers attempt to ensure you do not feel the same way as the lack of visibility can, at times, hinder the viewing experience.<br/><br/>The film contains no sex though the mermaids are clearly naked even though nothing explicit is shown. Language is mild at best as it is more in the name-calling variant. Violence comes in a variety of forms but deaths are mostly tame.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides appears as a semi-reboot of the series, being more in liking with the original film and therefore losing the unnecessary scale At Worlds End attempted to provide. But the simplification has gone perhaps a little too far with a thin narrative and a thin cast of characters that ultimately fail to ignite. At its best, On Stranger Tides has everything that made the franchise good, but these moments are never frequent enough or long lasting making the film like spotting a mermaid: if you blink it will most likely be gone; and that just may well be a good thing."

","It's been a few years since we last saw Jack, and many including myself have missed these films. But alas, Pirates of the Caribbean has returned in a fourth instalment! The last two films were not exactly hugely popular when compared to the masterpiece of the original film, so naturally this film had a job to do in order to win the hearts of thousands of fans. Personally I liked the first and second films equally, the third film a little too dark for my taste. As for film number 4? Not bad at all.<br/><br/>In case you are new to the franchise this film picks up where 'At World's End' ended, with Captain Jack in search of the Fountain of Youth, but this film can easily appeal to the casual viewer, after all it is based on a book. In terms of the film's connection to the last three, the story is a continuation, but very few characters return. Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Mr. Gibbs are the only characters to actually return with Teague making a brief cameo. On the plus side, the film introduces many brilliant new characters, including new antagonist Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and love interest Angelica (Penelope Cruz) who are far better than the bitterly annoying Will and Elizabeth.<br/><br/>On the acting front the film was flawless, with Johnny Depp giving his usual outstanding performance as Jack Sparrow and Ian McShane giving an original, non-eccentric and fantastic performance as Blackbeard.<br/><br/>As for the plot, the film was not flawless, with the story taking second place this time around with the main focus being on the characters. This isn't a bad thing, however the film did suffer for it. The main story-arc focuses on the characters Jack and Barbossa in search of the Fountain of Youth. During Jack's journey he soon discovers that Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica are also in search of it, though the reasons for this are not memorable nor will audiences care come the end of the film. As for Barbossa's motives in this film, you do find out, but not until the third half of the film making his journey a little pointless from the perspective of the audience. And as for the ending? Well, my lips are sealed, but it felt like a bit of a cop out to me. These few flaws aside, the film takes some interesting tolls, introducing us to Zombie Pirates, Mermaids, a wild chase through London Town and a rum-fuelled ride on the whole. It's a fun journey while it lasts, but at times a bit of a boring one and the film did drag on a bit come the final act.<br/><br/>All I can say, to the casual viewer this film deserves no more than a 6/10. But, being a generous and loyal fan of the 'Pirates' franchise, I'm giving this a decent 7/10. Entertaining stuff if a little shallow."

","Memorial Day Weekend is usually when the Summer of Blockbusters truly kicks off. Recently the ""summer"" calendar has been bleeding towards easter, but Pirates marks this years first true mega movie event. The reviews have not been kind to the Disney franchise, nor was I too fond of the previous instalment. I was looking forward to a ""reboot"" with a few new characters, plots, adventures and an overall lack of the painful-to-watch Bloom-Knightly combo. After all, this entire franchise is built upon Johnny Depp and his portrayal of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow. My internal Hype-O-Meter had been inching towards insane from the moment I found out Ian McShane (of the fabulous Deadwood) would be portraying the dread pirate Blackbeard. Pair him with the terminally underrated Geofry Rush returning as Captain Barbosa, and you had me at ""Argh!"". 2 hours and some minutes later I left the theater happy and entertained. A 4th installment had potential to feel played out, and that happened in a few small spots, but overall, it was a fresh take on a great set of characters. Gone was the CGI hilarity of ""Worlds End"". In its place was the character development, enthralling action and witty banter we have yearned for since ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". I can honestly ""On Stranger Tides"" is my second favorite of the series. Can it maintain this pace for the entire second trilogy? I doubt it. But it left me wanting more. I was less than enthralled with Penelope Cruz' character, but there was no where to go but up from the tiresome ""Elizabeth"" portrayed by the vapid Knightly in all previous versions. We will discus my active hatred for 3D later, but ugly glasses aside, this movie is well worth the price of admission. It lives up to everything you would expect in a summer movie."

There are memorable moments, but in a film longer than two hours that's not much of a recommendation. What I absolutely hated is something I don't think would bother most people: Penelope's hat.<br/><br/>Now I'm no fashionista but for some reason, I found her hat distracting, if not downright annoying. Not sure why but think a simple scarf around her head would have been a vast improvement. She just looked too modern when the film called for a rough and tumble sort. I cannot imagine anyone seriously suggesting the hat was right for the job, but if they did they should be fired immediately."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, is an adventure fantasy film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. In the film, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is joined by Angelica (Penélope Cruz). I am not a huge fan of part 4s and was skeptical about the movie and expected it to stink.<br/><br/>This movie packs a lot of action and reminds us why we liked the 1st Pirates of the Caribbean: curse of the black pearl. This to me is the second best of the series as the writers take us back to the old Jack Sparrowoh! Sorry, he prefers to be called by his full name Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Also in this movie we have Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) return with a lot of arggh, and a lost leg. You won't even miss Will and Elizabeth Turner as Angelica (Penelope Cruz) does a good job as a female role to replace the two.<br/><br/>The plot to me was pointless and lacks all sense at all, and yet the director still found a way to keep me glued. The movie did have lumps, as Jack Sparrow's swag was a little tuned down and we get to see him look serious at some time, the length of the movie to me was also unreasonable, some dialogue were let me say foolish and while some achieved the purpose of making you laugh.<br/><br/>The plot is centered and continues from the previous movie, as we watch a three way chase The Fountain of Youth, by The Spanish, The English led by Babossa and Blackbeard (Ian McShane). The movie has a subplot that involves a mermaid (French actress Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). Ian McShane, did well in the role of Blackbeard as he had the voice that can make any character look like the devil.<br/><br/>The romance between Jack and Angelica, was just cool as we see them fall in and out of the love thingy.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of the first pirates film you will love this one, if not please stay away. All in all, Johnny Depp put in a fantastic performance and although i believe the writers could have done a better Job with the plot, i still give the movie a seven as it is a funny, good, not for young kids as the rating 13 says movie. all sense at all, and that's how we love it. The Spanish have found a way to get to the fountain of youth and the English we see King George II (Richard Griffiths), captures Jack and his first mate Dibbs with the help of Babossa and ask him to lead them to the fountain of youth before the Spanish get there. Jack escapes and gets captured by Blackbeard and his first mate and daughter Angelica. So he leads Blackbeard to the fountain Babossa leads the English and the Spanish who already know the way are also heading there, so we are watching a three way race to the fountain. The movie has a subplot that involves a mermaid (lovely French actress Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). And we also have to find the requirements to drink of the fountain, two silver chalices, a mermaid's tear from what we discover that this mermaids are the stone hearts of the oceans, so getting a tear from them will well go watch and find out how they did it and oh! Yes off to the Fountain of Youth. Aargh!!!."

","The main story strangely revolves around the duel between Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Blackbeard (Ian McShane) building anticipation for the final stage of their on-going battle. Captain Barbossa, now a one legged man, is sent in the name of King George of England to find the two silver cups which are to be found on Ponce De Leon's ship. On the other hand, Blackbeard wants to reach the Fountain of Youth where he dreams to gain the years of another person or simply put: more life. Surprise or not, there is a ritual and for that ritual he needs the two silver cups and a tear from a mermaid. Yes, there are mermaids in the movie. They also deadly and frustrated I guess. However, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) gets thrown in this by meeting the one who impersonated him and told the people that he was the real Jack Sparrow, a tricky double. That double is a ""she"" played by the wonderful and gracious Penelope Cruz. Let's not go that far though. She plays Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard. We all get the point after this reveal. Jack Sparrow is condemned to help Blackbeard reach his destination. We also find that Blackbeard's main reason to gain more life is an actual prophecy that fortells his death brought in two weeks by the ""one legged man"". The ""one legged man"" is actually the man he cut his legs off few months before and stole his ship. From this point over the story runs not only predictable (not that it didn't ran before) but also monotone. Along their journey to the Fountain of Youth we get a glimpse of Jack's old friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Phillip (Sam Claflin) a young Christian believer, Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) which is a lovely mermaid and Scrum (Stephen Graham), one of Blackbeard's ""servants"". We get through many fuzzy moments and pretty much boring. There is a big loss of excitement since there's nothing really new that can be said or shown in this franchise and definitely we really lost interest in the story since it's the beginning of a new one and it isn't even half the level of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl's"". We get an washed-up piece of entertainment filled with religious tomato-sauce and atheist pastry. You get the point of that. We get a couple of angry mermaids, we get a love story, we get few clicheic moments and more than anything we get a ""shocking"" ending to this new beginning. Nothing impressive, just the expected. The final act, the final confrontation it's exciting in terms of action but lacks in terms of storytelling and delivery. We also get the Spaniards (another group chasing the two silver cups) being actually smarter than all but ruined it at the end of the movie by doing one of the most stupid things I ever saw on screen. If you ever get what was that stupid thing I'd probably consider sending you 10 bucks. With all that we get that this movie has barely anything to do with Jack Sparrow. He's like a pawn or let's not exaggerate and say that he's more of a Mad-Man on a chess table played by Kings. He didn't really achieved anything in this movie and we didn't get any conclusion about his character's past, present or future...<br/><br/>Overall a boring fiasco well-executed that proves that this movie isn't necessarily a bad one but more an irrelevant, unnecessary, predictable, monotone, obvious and lifeless piece of filmmaking. But was it well executed? As far as I remember, I witnessed the most choreographed battle scenes I ever saw in cinema. Seriously, I understand they all need choreography but at least make them feel spontaneous and natural not forced and looking like they were practiced over and over again and the only thing Depp had in mind was to not mess it up. Not to mention because of this choreography, some battle scenes are actually hilarious and unfunny. I heard some ""mehs"" in the theater... Besides that, the 3D was far from being great. A lot of inconsistency and bad contrast, bad depth of field, bad blurred images and so on... It could have been much better.<br/><br/>The positive thing about On Stranger Tides is mainly Johnny Depp. Even though he isn't as funny or ridiculous as he was, even though this movie was not centered around him he still did the best he could do with the material he had. Johnny Depp is still Jack Sparrow and he'll forever be Jack Sparrow. I must say something that might enrage some fans out there: with all it's charismatic behavior, Jack Sparrow did not stole the show. No he didn't! Ian McShane as Blackbeard stole the show. His delivery cranked everybody up and he was a fascinating character to watch. He had potential to become a real nemesis of Sparrow's but who knows? Maybe he'll return the way the writers could always find a new curse or a new magical land that does the impossible. All the other roles were played accurately, even Penelope Cruz was enjoyable even if her moments on the screen were short and most of them lacked in sense and good development of her character. I think at times I found the acting too good for this boring story, I found the beautiful shots too much for this pointless flick and definitely found the music too epic for this epicless movie.<br/><br/>As a fan of this franchise I declare myself disappointed, not in Jack, not in Blackbeard or Barbossa and not in a new beginning but in execution, bad writing, bad structure and especially in the people responsible for the production of this movie for making a big U-Turn from the first trilogy to this second one. I'm sorry Jack, but I just didn't cared for you this time. Savvy?"

Sadly, the same cannot be said for On Stranger Tides.<br/><br/>This film drags on at such a sluggish pace I literally almost fell asleep around 30 minutes through, and if it hadn't been for my contacts lenses I probably would have fallen asleep & be done with the whole thing.<br/><br/>Not even Johnny Depp's impeccable performance as Captain Jack Sparrow could save this movie from being a shipwreck.<br/><br/>Only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the little romance between Philip ( Sam Claflin ) and Syrena ( Astrid Berges-Frisbey ), they certainly had more chemistry than Johnny Depp & Penelope Cruz's forced partnership which was to be frank, simply painful to watch. Also, the last 20 minutes wasn't too bad; it was actually mildy entertaining, at least it managed to wake me up a bit. Syrena's appearance was the best thing throughout Pirates, as she gave something fresh to a tired franchise.<br/><br/>All in all, I think the ship of this franchise has long sailed, and I sincerely hope they don't make another one, lest they churn out an even worse monstrosity than this one."

","I can't believe some of the people trashing this movie. I thought it was great! The action was loads of fun. The mermaids were incredible. The stories and side-stories kept me interested in the characters. It is funny, some people thought there was too much time spent on secondary characters while others wanted more. I thought it was just right. I still feel a little uneasy about how the mermaid romance ended. I would think that a devoted Christian wouldn't dabble in pagan magic, correct? Anyway, all the main characters were incredible, and I didn't miss the actors who didn't come back one bit. I wish the fate of Blackbeard would have had a twist. A man with one leg would kill him. We all knew it would be Barbosa, of course. Wouldn't it have been great if someone else had killed him during the fight who just happened to have one leg? Perhaps lost in that very fight? That would have been sweet. I loved the ending to the movie. I think Sparrow has grown throughout the Pirates series. Some people think he should be more selfish. I think not. I thought it was brilliant, and the only way to end the movie at that point. Allowing her to keep her self-respect and show her willingness to give her own life, while exposing Blackbeards selfishness. Awesome. <br/><br/>I hope we see another Pirates with Commodore Jack Sparrow!"

","I really enjoyed it! :) I'm a Jack Sparrow fan, and I had absolutely LOVED The Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's one of my favorite movies to this day. I was less enthusiastic about Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, because I felt that they were needlessly complicating, but I still enjoyed the humor.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides retains that POTC humor which makes the movies so special. It has some great scenes between Johnny Depp (Sparrow) and Geoffrey Rush (Barbosa), and a lot of those serious-but-funny moments. Penelope Cruz (Angelica) was great and she fit right in with the cast and with the story. Ian McShane, (Blackbeard) I felt didn't live up to his character. Davy Jones had been a much better villain.<br/><br/>The reason this movie worked was because they finally decided to end the Will/Elizabeth story. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but had they tried to drag that story any further, I don't think they could have done it without being inconsistent with the events of the last movie. Also, the plot wasn't as convoluted and confusing as the last two times.<br/><br/>The reason Curse of the Black Pearl was so awesome was that it was quite a simple but brilliant plot - with pirates! And I'm glad that On Stranger Tides tried to go back to that kind of story telling. I'm glad they used a new setting and new characters. It was a good choice introducing a love-interest for Jack, because that part of his story was interesting to explore. There also was a sub plot with a clergyman, which a lot of people didn't like, but I thought it was cute, but maybe that was just because he was a really good looking clergyman! :P<br/><br/>Was it as good as Curse of the Black Pearl? No. And I don't think any Pirates movie is going to be as good because none of them can take us through the delight of getting to know Jack Sparrow again, or the experience of watching seeming normal people, the governor's daughter and a blacksmith, going from a cliché forbidden love story into an exciting pirate story.<br/><br/>But as long as they don't end up hopelessly complicating the future sequels, I'm looking forward to them!"

","I was expecting more from this movie. First of all, there was too much unnecessary dialogs in the film. Second, the fighting scenes and the comic timing where not as good as in the other films. Another thing (correct me if I'm wrong), is that I don't like the fact that Blackbeard was not even mentioned in any of the previous films, including ""At World's End"" which is supposed to have all of the great pirates of the world reunited in one great battle for the survival of their kind. And all of the sudden he is the ""world's most feared pirate"", and has supernatural powers, with a supernatural ship. Oh! and he also can take other ships and put them in bottles which he then collects. Definitely, the selection of director Rob Marshall wasn't the best one, and for the next time I hope that they choose a better screenplay. In fact I gave this film a 6 mainly because I love this franchise."

","What Jerry Bruckheimer says to himself everyday. Anyway, 2010 was a bad year for Mr. Brockheimer, producing two flops, Prince of Persia and The Sorcerer's Apprentice, so needed a hit to get back on top. Luckily a Pirates of the Caribbean sequel is a good way to do that, even though At World's End was a incomprehensible mess and the director of the original trilogy, Gore Verbinski decided to make an animated film instead.<br/><br/>In the middle of the 18th Century Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in London after loosing the Black Pearl after the end of the third and King George II (Richard Griffiths) orders the pirate to lead an expedition to the Fountain of Youth, with Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who is now a privateer for the British Navy. Despite this Jack does not join them and escape, finding out someone is pretending to be him and lead their own expedition. He is soon captured and taken on board the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a former flame of Jack's. Soon Blackbeard, the British led by Barbossa and the Spanish are all heading to the Fountain and want it's power.<br/><br/>After the problems of At World's End, the budget of On Stranger's Tide was tighten, with filming moved to London and Hawaii and the plot was simplified. This was a smart move because it gave the characters and factors a clear focus. It is a better plotted film then At World's End and characters do not have loads of different goals. There were a few subplots but they were in context of the overall of the film, such as mutiny and the capturing of a mermaid. The actual story about finding the Fountain was very similar to an Indiana Jones, trying to find a famous legendary object/treasure/location and what's impact could be. Essentially this film is trying to be a Indiana Jones film with pirates. At the same time Jack's ability double cross people is toned down and On Stranger's Tide suffers because of it.<br/><br/>Rob Marshall replaced Verbinski in the director's chair and he is best known for making musicals. He does an decent enough job and pretty much the same from the previous films. This Pirates film is shot with a darker colour pallet and creates a problems, because it makes it harder to see the action sequences. The action is this film is the weakest in the series, the mermaid attack the best part of the film. On Stranger's Tide was shot in 3D and I saw it in 2D: but the 3D shots shall we say lacked subtly, with Blackbeard thrusting his sword or the mermaids driving towards the camera. Also Marshall saw fit to add some dancing and singing in the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp obviously loves the characters, he keeps coming back to the role and I am sure it's not just for the money. He is still pretty funny, but Sparrow was a more serious character this time round. Cruz is a fine addition to the cast as the feisty woman who is a capable fighter and had a spark with Depp, though I would have liked to have seen Zoe Saldana's character from the first film return and have her character expanded upon. Cruz is a talented actor and her Latin charms were a great addition to series: hopefully she will returns and get a bigger role. McShane is always good as a villain for hire, menacing and ruthless, particularly with the mermaid. Rush however looks very ragged and his role was pretty pointless: I am sure he respired his role for the paycheque so he could afford to do smaller films like The King Speech. Somehow the casting director found an actor who was even more boring then Orlando Bloom, Sam Claflin, who was a really brand, wet missionary who added nothing to the film and Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey is very petty, but because of lack of English skills she did not speak much. And Stephen Graham was seriously misused: he is a talented actor and was just used as a comic relief character, not say, a tough swordfighter and potential match for Jack.<br/><br/>There are elements of the film which are not expanded, like how does Blackbeard control the ship with his sword: is it a magic sword? Some explanation would be nice. Also Blackbeard's officers are zombies, making them more obedient, wouldn't it make more sense to make the crew into zombies and let the officers keep their intelligence and if anything the zombies did not seem that out of it: their only advantage is that they could survive being stabbed.<br/><br/>At times On Stranger's Tide feels a bit lazy and laboured, made simply to cash in on the popularity of the series. I have never been a big fan of the series but the films are entertaining enough. I just hope the fifth film the final one, allowing Jack Sparrow to retire and put some effort into it. On Stranger's Tide is decent enough but it is your typical blockbuster fare. You got to love Hans Zimmer's music, giving Pirates an almost Lord of the Rings style score this time round."
"petercha92-59-77662","5","0","0","5 June 2011"," A solid fantasy film, but doesn't quite hold up overall
","I must admit that I really enjoyed the first three movies in the franchise, so I walked in with high expectations for this movie. This movie is a good action fantasy movie. It has some great 3D scenes, Blackbeard is clearly a scary guy, and the mermaids are as beautiful as they are dangerous. It has nice effects, and the action is well done.<br/><br/>That being said, it wasn't quite the same caliber as the first three movies of the franchise. The previous movies had action and had fantasy too, but they were not just that. They were mostly character driven, and we as the audience were able to walk away really feeling like we got to know Sparrow, Davy Jones, Barbossa, Will and Elizabeth, and even the less major characters like Beckett and Tia Dalma. The movies were funny because we got to see the pirates' mind at work at lying, cheating, double-crossing, and all working for their own good while somehow everything worked out well for everyone. I'm normally not a big fan of romance, but even the story of Will and Elizabeth (and especially the more intriguing story of Elizabeth and Jack) were very well presented to the audience. But in this movie, there is no such complexity. The Spaniards remain a constant threat to the Brit's expedition throughout the entire film, but they appear about all of three times, and serve absolutely no useful purpose at all. I personally feel like I don't know Blackbeard at all other than the fact that he's got crazy magic powers. I also don't feel like I got to know Syrena, the random preacher whose sole purpose is to build an awkward unconvincing romance, or any of Blackbeard's crew. We already know Jack and Barbossa so they saved the film from total disaster, but even their acting was forced, awkward, repetitive, and mostly lacking in complexity or in any new character developments. It was as if they were just shadows of the great characters built in the previous three movies.<br/><br/>But as an action-fantasy flick, it's not bad. I just hope that the next two movies are more complex and deserving of the Pirates of the Caribbean name."

This is a bit less grand in scale, but this does not mean that the film is therefore less enjoyable. Similar scale to COTB. My only complaint is that the love relationship between Philip and Syrena could have worked better. Penelope Cruz is a great addition. I prefer her now instead of Keira. Orlando and Keira aren't really missed, but a reference to them would have been nice. Ian McShane as Blackbeard was BADASS!! Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa stole every scene, Gibbs was still as fun to watch. And as expected, Johnny Depp as Jack is back in top shape. Cameos by Judi Dench, Richard Griffiths and Keith Richards also were a welcome addition. The CGI is back perfectly fine(and there's less of it, which is great) and the locations are again stunning.Of course the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is fantastic again as expected.

","As I watched the blur of colourful characters from varied backgrounds whirl and strut across lavish sets and exquisite locations I couldn't help but think I'd seen it all before... but had long since forgotten. A fate that will no doubt be consigned upon any recollections of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides within days.<br/><br/>First let's take a step back by disclosing everything I know about the Pirates franchise already: - Johnny Depp is a scurrilous PG13 pirate named Jack Sparrow, without him the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is sunk. - The original movie is named after a theme park ride. - Don't ask me about the second or third films, I have seen them and can't remember a thing about either.<br/><br/>That's about it really, I know sweet Jack Sparrow... squat about the films, which doesn't seem to impact any enjoyment derived from this one. In reality each film is about providing just enough distraction to have the audience walking out of the theatre thinking 'well that must have been entertaining', and recalling one of the many distractions – pirates, ghosts, mermaids, Johnny Depp, cleavage – in a favourable enough light that they line up for the next inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>In this outing we are caught up to speed quickly. Sparrow is as always in custody, though the type of custody where he can casually escape whenever he wants.He has lost his beloved ship the Black Pearl, presumed sunk, most of his crew, and 90% of the co-stars from previous films. The one constant is Captain Barbossa, the nefarious ying to Sparrow's debaucherous yang, though he is now siding with the British navy, how very un-pirate-y indeed. <br/><br/>After the initial catch-up chat between Barbossa and Sparrow, which rapidly devolves into a slur-off of indecipherable accents and roguish bravado, there is the inevitable escape sequence and getaway chase.<br/><br/>The now free Sparrow hears of another claiming to be he, and he is none too pleased at this pirate piracy, that is until he is astonished to learn that it is none other than Angelica (Penelope Cruz) an ex-flame of his – one who he may have even actually... liked, and the two spend the remainder of the film smouldering at each other as they move from one carefully constructed setpiece to the next. <br/><br/>A map has emerged that apparently leads directly to an important site, but it seems every man and his parrot have the co-ordinates already with the British navy – lead by Captain Barbossa, the Spanish navy – lead by a handsome guy who looks like a cross from the Cat from Red Dwarf and Prince circa 1985 and still another vessel making a beeline toward it – lead by none other than the greatly feared Blackbeard (Ian McShane), a man whom even the lowest, most dangerous pirates dread. <br/><br/>Blackbeard's ship possesses magical powers that are stronger the closer he is to the ship and his crew are zombified strongmen, apparently more loyal and focused than regular scumbags. Angelica managed to secure a place aboard for both herself and Sparrow by claiming to be Blackbeard's long lost daughter...<br/><br/>The 'treasure hunt' in this film is the Fountain of Youth – something Depp and Cruz might actually need if they plan to sail this cash-seacow for much longer. <br/><br/>The remainder of the film has the various parties moving towards their goals in a very PG13 manner, with fight scenes at sub-Jackie Chan levels, and of course the primary characters running into each other repeatedly to exchange suitably pirate-y dialogue. <br/><br/>If you believe the film every ship is full of empty barrels lying about to be thrown around, jumped on or jumped off as they roll away cinematically, every room has many ladders that go straight up to the rafters for no reason, and every rope when cut has no impact but allowing the cutter to ascend rapidly, they never seem to be tied or supporting anything.<br/><br/>The much discussed mermaid scene serves no purpose but to allow the filmmakers to discuss it much more, insinuating how tough it must have been to have all those supermodels lying about with no clothes on again and again, even when the finished on screen product CGIs away all the goodies... And the finale takes place on a set which might have been left over from The Goonies.<br/><br/>I was amused by Pirates 4, mostly because I let the bright colours and expensive elaborate sets seduce me, lest I become enraged at just how calculated and empty this all is.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5 / 10. Pirates 4 might not be a total shipwreck, but it doesn't really float my boat either."

","this movie in my opinion is the second best pirates movie in the series. (firt being the curse of the black pearl), but i was worried about this one. there starting all over with the fountain of youth. which they mentioned at the end of the 3rd movie. but will and Elizabeth are gone. Davy Jones is gone, but who is gonna miss him. Tia dalma is gone, pintel and ragetti are gone. the only originals that returned for this is of course johnny depp (jack sparrow, Geoffrey rush (hector barbossa) and the guy that plays Joshua Gibbs. anyway they made this movie work without them. they got new people who did great in there roles and Ian mcshane (blackbeard) really stood out in this film. he made his character as evil as can be. he held his own as Penelope Cruz did as blackbeards daughter. they both did great. now to barbossa. he is no longer a pirate but a privateer working for the crown. as soon as i heard that i immediately thought there had to be an angle here of why he is doing this. barbossa may be selfish at some times but his loyalty is to pirates. and it still was. you find out why he became a privateer in the movie. also barbossa is one of the most popular characters in the movie. the writers wouldn't ruin his character that way. now on to the one and only jack sparrow. in this movie he is quite different for the better. he isn't hiding, not being cowardly, not running away. which he has done before, and don't get me wrong jack sparrow is one of the greatest characters in film history and one on my favorites. without johnny depp jack sparrow wouldn't be as successful and as popular as the character is now. as i was saying jack sparrow is more of the hero in this film. saving people. not being selfish, being brave. and that change is for the better. of course they couldn't make a pirates of the caribbean without action and comedy, and there was plenty of that without a doubt. the story is phenomenal, the actors are phenomenal. this film is the perfect pirates of the caribbean movie. the only thing bad about it was that it ended. this movie feels different from the 2nd and 3rd movie and is different from the 2nd and 3rd. defidently see it."

","I was completely excited to see all the new changes of the brand new Pirates movie. The movie is set after the events of the third movie, and it shows Jack Sparrow arranging a crew together on a quest for the Fountain of Youth. Also, along the way, Jack has to go through rough competition between Barbossa and a former lover, deadly mermaids, zombie armies, and the mighty wrath of Blackbeard. Although I loved the movie, I have mixed thoughts. The negative side - unlike the first three, this one didn't take us to the familiar locations in the first three. Also, the film didn't bring Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley back. Also, the film just didn't feel traditional to its elements. But my positive side - I thought this movie had excellent new characters including Ian McShane as the horrific 'Blackbeard', Penelope Cruz, who sizzles on screen, as Jack Sparrow's former lover, and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush return to the screen for their roles as Jack Sparrow, who is still witty as ever, and Capt. Barbossa, who is now sent Admiral of a British ship. The film also had neat visual effects, amazing music, and my favorite scene in the movie was the deadly mermaid scene. What happened was...well, you need to see the movie to find out what happens. Also, the story where everybody searches for the Fountain of Youth carried my expectations. Although not traditional to the first three, Pirates 4 was a unique style of the Pirate films that was completely interesting. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", in my review, ""nothing traditional, but extremely unique""."

","Flick Reviews Wes Yunker Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides<br/><br/>My hopes for the new Pirates of the Caribbean film was average at best. First of all there was the fact that Gore Verbinski did not return to make this fourth installment. Secondly, no Orlando Bloom and no Keira Knightly. I do agree that there story had been spent up and they lived happily ever after but in all reality Johnny Depp as the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow is what I would call a supporting role. There needs to be that straight man to even it out. And that is how I ended up feeling when watching At Stranger Tides. It was as if all the villains and great supporting cast of the first three films were having a separate spin off adventure. Sure I love Sparrow and Barbosa but not as leads. I'm not saying that they should have brought back Bloom and Knightly and I'm also not saying that they should have brought some other good looking male and female leads to take their place. So they were just screwed from the beginning in that sense. The second issue with the films was the villain. The notorious Pirate known only as Blackbeard (Ian McShane) did not in any way measure up to the villains in the first three Pirates movies. You don't see him at first and you're waiting wondering what this guy is going to be like. And then when he finally makes his long awaited entrance you may be somewhat disappointed; I know I was. I wasn't afraid of him, I didn't find him the least bit threatening, and could someone please explain to me how he has the ability to control the magical movement of everything in this ship by just waving his sword. And I would also love to know how he has the ability to capture gigantic ships and store them in tiny glass bottles. These are two things that are never explained in the film. We know why Barbosa turns into a skeleton in the moonlight and we know why The Flying Dutchmen has a tentacle face heart beats outside of his chest, but what the hell makes Blackbeard so magical? I would have been fine with that if it was explained. But I must say with its flaws it was a very entertaining flick. Quite better than the third which is still my least favorite and still not nearly as good as the first two (the second, Dead Man's Chest being my favorite of the whole franchise). I must praise the new director Rob Marshall ( Chicago, Nine) there was never a single moment when I felt that this movie was by a different director. It had the same look and feel as Verbinski gave to the first three. The action (entertaining as it sometimes was) often times seemed a little too much like a time filler. There has been great action scenes from the Pirates franchise that have stood out in my head but in this film most where pretty forgettable. The greatest scene in the film was most defiantly the mermaid scene. I won't reveal anything all I'll say is that it was the greatest moment of tension in the whole film. And of course Johnny was good as always as Jack Sparrow. It's the same old Jack; I don't need to say any more. A great new addition was Penelope Cruz. She did a great job as Angelica, a not to be reckoned with con artist and Sparrow's former lover who joins the cast on this fun, entertaining, just not all that satisfying installment of Pirates of the Caribbean. 3 ½ out of 5"

","On Stranger Tides is a crazy wicked tongue in cheek adventure that would leave you hooked and grinning throughout. Rob Marshall paces the movie superbly, flowing joyously from one crazy adventure into another. To me, this is the most entertaining Pirate movie in the series.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is at his outrageous best as Jack Sparrow, and Penelope Cruz's Angelica throws in a love interest that brings out a previously unseen moral angle into Jack's devil-may-care bravado. That is where the strength of the screenplay lies, in giving us a brand new Jack who still is strongly familiar. Geoffery Marsh's Barbossa is delightful too. The CGI and special effects are perfectly balanced, handsomely making amends for the jarring CGI overdose of 'At World's End'. <br/><br/>On the flip side, Blackbeard was a character lacks the swagger and the menace he should have had. The romance between the pastor and the mermaid is too saccharine. Yet, the movie's highs easily overshadow the lows. And the series' trademark tongue-in-cheek humor is sharp, shining specially in the taut chemistry between Depp and Cruz.<br/><br/>All in all Pirates IV is a fantastic spectacle and you wouldn't want to stay ashore and miss out on this adventure."

","The film begins in Spain. Two of the Spanish king's men discover someone who has seen Ponce De Leon's ship. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his First Mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) escaping the gallows. Along the way, Jack learns that someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew. They also run into Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), whom has sold out and now works for King George (Richard Griffiths). Barbossa lost the Black Pearl ship in a prior battle, and also lost his right leg. Soon, it becomes clear that Sparrow, King George, and the Spaniards all seek the Fountain of Youth, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>Sparrow later finds out that it was Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a former flame, that was impersonating him. Later, its revealed that she is the First Mate of a ship captained by Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Blackbeard also happens to be Angelica's father, and he too seeks the fountain of youth.<br/><br/>So lets tally it up. Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, King George, The Spanish, Angelica, and Blackbeard all seek the Fountain of Youth. Did you get all of that? Along the way, we meet some zombies, a clergyman named Philip (Sam Claflin), and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey).<br/><br/>My feelings about this film are all over the place. I saw it in 3D, and I strongly advise against that. Save for one scene with large leaves, there was nothing to justify the 3D surcharge. See it in 2D if you can. While I like Rob Marshall as a director (his previous work includes Chicago and Nine, the latter also starred Penelope Cruz), Gore Verbinski is missed. The mermaids were a nice touch, I thought they were done well. That Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom did not return this time neither helped nor hurt the film. Though it seems strange that neither character gets so much as a mention, as if they never existed. Penelope Cruz is a welcome addition to the cast, as is Ian McShane. The movie just seemed to be lacking in spirit.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides is a decent way to spend two and a half hours, but the series is showing its age (and not just on Barbossa's sandpapered face!). This is definitely the weakest installment in the Pirates franchise. I can see why Johnny Depp wants to space time in-between sequels. But then again, maybe this is a good stopping point. I'm not sure there is any meaningful story left to tell. Three stars out of five. See it in a matinée, and in 2D.<br/><br/>EDIT: I completely forgot that this is the second pairing of Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz.

","After a three-year hiatus, most of the cast has returned for the fourth installment of the popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. And while this was nowhere near the thrilling high seas adventure of the first film, it was a least better than part two and as good as the third edition.<br/><br/>It would have been much better, however, had not director Rob Marshall (""Chicago,"" ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") scuttled a great deal of the effort by introducing a foundering subplot about a religious sailor and his effort to save a mermaid. During these long, drawn-out and unnecessary sequences, I wondered when the enterprise would tack back onto the main point.<br/><br/>That point being the efforts of three different groups; the Spaniards, the British (led by Captain Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush, ""The King's Speech"") and Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) tagging along with evil pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane, ""Hot Rod,"" TV series ""Deadwood"") and former lover, Angelica (Penelope Cruz) searching for the mythical Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>Following various maps provided by unknown and supernatural forces, these assemblages battle each other as well as the elusive spirit of explorer Ponce De Leon. Other motivations muddle up things, as well; i.e. Jack and Angelica's sexual tension, Jack and Barbossa's ill will and Barbossa seeking revenge against Blackbeard for swiping the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>To reach the fountain, the crews must pass through dense jungles, foreboding forests, swallowing seas and a pack of beautiful but vicious mermaids (easily the most impressive scenes in the film). Of course, there are also plenty of chases, sword-fights, gun-play and derring-doo, mostly pulled off by Sparrow.<br/><br/>In addition, there is the comic touch (again, heavily tilting toward Captain Jack) evident in the past three pictures, although this release is much darker than it predecessors.<br/><br/>None of this bothers me at all, except for the seafaring missionary, Philip (Sam Clafin), and the mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), neither of which can act their way out of a wet paper bag. It's the cinematic equivalent of walking the plank or being bludgeoned with a marlin spike.<br/><br/>At two plus hours, the inclusion of this flotsam drags some of this movie to the depths of Davy Jones' Locker, and that character isn't even in this version. The Fountain of Youth is supposed to add years on to one's life, that subplot almost did the same for me."

Fourth entry in the series is much more straightforward in story and in tone, and delivers some exciting action scenes, nifty special effects, and plenty of humor.

","The fourth film in the pirates series isn't something to get excited about. I already thought that the third film wasn't that good, but this one is just as bad.<br/><br/>Instead of Orlando bloom and Keira knightley as the other main stars next to captain Jack, we now have Blackbeard and his daughter. Both much worse then their predecessors in the previous films. Blackbeard is suppose to be the ultimate bad guy, but instead he is an old man who tries to be a badass but really fails in doing that. His daughter played by Penelope Cruz had a strange role, you never really know what her backstory is, and her motives for doing what she does are kind of vague. And last but not least Barbossa makes a reappearance in this film. It never really becomes clear why he joined the royal navy, but he does play his role quite well, only I liked him a lot better when he was an actual pirate. And then off course captain Jack himself, well what can you say, Johnny Depp plays this character very well.<br/><br/>The other characters in the film include Jack's always trustworthy deckhand Gibbs who delivers a solid performance. Blackbeards priest, who overact his role and is not very believable. Then there's the mermaid who the priest falls in love with for some strange reason. This love is much to quick and unbelievable. And then there's the Spanish, who's role in the film is as weird as can be. You never really understand what there purpose in the film is, they feel completely redundant.<br/><br/>The 3D effects of the film aren't that good either. The special effects are decent, but thats the case in almost every high budget film nowadays. The pace in this film is confusing, it starts of in sixth gear and then shift down a gear every 20 minutes. Only to get a little bit exited at the end, but like I sad just a little. Pirates 4 never delivers the adventure and charm of the first film. I wouldn't say that this is a very bad film, it's just not that good, so don't expect to much."

","I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said ""the skinny girl is not in the movie"", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.<br/><br/>The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.<br/><br/>Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.<br/><br/>FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.<br/><br/>The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.<br/><br/>Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear."
"moviexclusive","8","0","0","21 May 2011"," Will Jack Sparrow return for a fifth time? We are guessing it's a yes!
","No, things will never be the same again – so don't you go into the cinema thinking that this fourth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean film series will be anywhere as good as the first movie in 2003. But yes, it is a true blue summer blockbuster – so you can go into the cinema and expect a swashbuckling adventure, and of course, a certain Johnny Depp to keep you entertained for the movie's runtime of 136 minutes.<br/><br/>If you don't already know, the series of fantasy adventure movies based on the Walt Disney theme park ride of the same name features the American actor as the lead protagonist Captain Jack Sparrow: Who else to bring this somewhat campy pirate to life than everybody's favourite Mr. Depp?<br/><br/>In this movie, the infamous pirate crosses paths with a woman from his past. The only problem is, she is now the daughter of one of the most feared pirates on the treacherous seas. Our hero isn't sure whether he is still in love with this fiery woman, or whether she is just a con artist trying to use him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. Before he knows it, he finds himself on a new adventure involving noble Englishmen, devious Spaniards, repulsive zombies and bloodthirsty mermaids.<br/><br/>You may remember reading the favourable review of the franchise's third movie in 2007 on this very same website (yes, it was written by yours truly), and seeing other reviews that thought otherwise. It will probably be the same scenario four year on for this Rob Marshall directed installment.<br/><br/>While some reviewers may not think much of bombastic action sequences, evidently expensive sets and pompous production values, this one thinks that these are the exact things cinema goers look out for in a summer blockbuster. Who would want to see Depp ponder over life for the entire movie? Who would want to see him sulking in depression for over two hours? Who would want to see the Golden Globe winning actor contemplate over his existence against the backdrop of breezy beaches?<br/><br/>It's the season to leave your brains at the door, and bring out the popcorn to see Jack Sparrow do his thing! May we also remind you that Depp was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of the campy pirate in 2003's The Curse of the Black Pearl?<br/><br/>The strangely attractive Kentucky born actor once again effortlessly pulls off the offbeat personality of Jack Sparrow with ease, providing some of the best moments in the movie. He is paired up with his co star in Blow (2001), Oscar winning Penelope Cruz as the sizzling female pirate who has something up her sleeves. Although clothes stay intact (it's a Disney movie, after all), the chemistry between the two is interestingly scorching. One just needs to imagine a too cool to be true Depp exchanging dialogue with a blazingly hot Cruz to know what we mean.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally return as Barbossa and Gibbs respectively, while veteran actor Ian McShane sends shivers with his portrayal of the terrifying pirate captain Blackbeard. Although their characters are nowhere as memorable as Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's, good lookers Sam Clalin and Astrid Berges Frisbey deliver decent performances as a stalwart missionary and his mermaid love interest. Also, watch out for cameo appearances by Rolling Stones founding member Keith Richards and an award winning Dame.<br/><br/>Primarily shot in Hawaii, this action adventure comedy features breathtaking views (the 3D effects on the movie aren't exactly spectacular though), and one particularly thrilling mermaid sequence which will change your impression about those bikini clad babes. Together with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Marshall has managed to deliver a respectable popcorn adventure to entertain audiences.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

","First of all I'd like to point out I never was a big fan of the pirates trilogy. The first one was great, the second was slightly worse the third was a complete waste of time (but of course that's only opinion based I still respect the people who like it I just have my reasons why I really don't like it) Anyway I wasn't expecting much of the newest movie but seeing how keira knightley and bloom were gone (thank god) i at least thought it would be descent and till the first hour it seemed awesome, I felt like it was back to the first part more dark scenes more seriousness, great mix of story and jokes but the second half thats when it went down hill. The story has so many wholes and there are so many illogic scenes, the characters (except for depp who was as awesome as ever) were boring or totally left aside, Black Beard doesn't get any introduction, never any explanation why he is so powerful, the spains are...just there (!!!SPOILER!!! seriously these guys come out of nowhere throw down a wall at the fountain and disappear again...hello?) But my biggest complain is this love story between a religious man and a mermaid which was ridiculous it made no sense it was unnecessary for the story had a lot of plot holes and was all in all totally forgettable. The only good things about this movie for me were the music (as always Hans Zimmer just knows how to make a good soundtrack) the atmosphere was great as always and the jokes of Jack Sparrow which are funny as well. 3D was useless (as always) the last five minutes of the movie (and the scene after the credits) are incredibly stupid but I guess for fans it will be a nice experience again but i certainly can do without"
"MarcusJ13","6","0","0","21 May 2011"," A better Pirates film
","I had decent optimism going into this film as I was hoping it would be more of a back to basics Pirates film with the intention of really entertaining its audience. With the you know who characters gone this was a clean slate and right from the outset I knew there wasn't going to be an insincere dark plot that fails to get off the ground. The fountain of youth element may seem like a thin plot for a film so long but the writers seemed to remember what genre they are in. This is more of an action film with plenty of sword fights put in. However much of the action is shot in the dark which if you're not a fan of may be off putting. Aside from that camera angle wise it is well shot and doesn't feel disorientating in the slightest clearly wanting their audience to be a part of the action without methods like shaky cam. <br/><br/>The film isn't perfect and the pacing becomes questionable towards the middle with some scenes looking as though they are repeating themselves. Nonetheless there is a decent pay off with the subsequent scenes. Onto the performances and they are mostly good. Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and co are brilliant in their roles and the film doesn't feel like it is all about Captain Jack with the way it was written. He was in just enough to be humorous without being irritating, although it is all a matter of taste and I would fully understand people becoming irritated by Jack Sparrow by now. Penelope Cruz now plays the female lead and it is clear even though we haven't seen them together before that her character Angelica and Captain Jack clearly have a chemistry and their scenes together were probably the highlight. In this sense Cruz made for a much better female lead this time round and stepped into the series like she had been there since the first film. The film despite its issue with pacing at the mid point didn't feel too long and had mostly kept itself to a premium. There is nothing terribly memorable in the film which is why it doesn't get a higher rating, it simply captures the spirit without being spectacular. In summary though it is a decent Pirates film and an improvement for the series that seemed to treat its audience with more respect this time round."

","More of the same...but what is wrong with that! You will never have a better time than when you watch Pirates of the Caribbean. This movie was blessed with a super cast. I'm always surprised at how good the story lines are. Johnny Depp owns the character of Jack Sparrow. They will never find a replacement for him. I chose to see the showing that was not in 3-D. I'm not a 3-D fan because it has never justified the $3.00 extra per person. I hope that everyone gets a chance to see this film and have the chance to enjoy it as much as I did.

The fourth movie plus 3D factor set me to expect more. 3D effects were good and our favourite CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is at his best. But this can't make up for otherwise slow story and weak characters. Their was not as much fun and enjoyment as could have been. Also, their is a confusion regarding the nature of characters which is most of the time self-contradictory. One can simply sense that something is missing. Plus, the movie keeps on moving away from the main plot. Disappointed yes but still it was a good time pass. Totally a one time watch."

","For 8 years now the on screen Pirates have kept us captive to their adventurous spirit. The Pirates are back again once more after four years to re-live the magical, sprightly and infectious spirit, And BOY! They do deliver and How! ""On Stranger Tides"" the fourth installment of the series has received a lot of pre-release hype and anticipation. The production house (Disney), The director, the ensemble cast and Johnny Depp have carried the entire burden on their shoulders admirably and delivered a wholesome fun filled roller coaster ride. This time the movie is a ""Stand alone"" so to speak. In essence it just conveys to all audience that to enjoy and lap up all the fun in store you need not have to be in touch with the previous movies and rightly so, as Depp, Geoffrey Rush(Captain barbossa) and Kevin Mcnally(Gibbs) are the only characters that return from the previous adventures to reprise their roles here.<br/><br/>The Adventure: <br/><br/>The plot is almost a perfect set piece and winds itself up for most of the first half to unleash wholesome fun and action filled adventure thereon. The premise here is the legendary Fountain of youth. The journey in quest of the fountain, which would give you more life. As is the wont of the series, more than one party takes up the journey and our beloved Jack Sparrow (Oops, I missed it.. It is CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) gets through all the traps, double crossers, cross fires and charms his way out to be the Last man standing with his complete skill sets. With complete Nonchalance, Wit, unbelievably cheeky one liners and eccentric manners Johnny Depp simply SIZZLES. Penelope Cruz is a woman from Jack's past and she forces and persuades Jack along on the journey. The Spanish and the British army set out on the quest as well and the climax is reminiscent of the First movie with all the characters culminating at the Fountain of youth.<br/><br/>The movie has many varied characters this time around, a religious Christian, a ghoulish villain, charming and vicious mermaids and the feisty and practical Spaniards. The Pirates series have always been about the ""Whole being better than the sum of its parts"" and this movie keeps the legacy alive. Having said that one must accept the fact that if not for Johnny Depp the whole series would be like Harry Potter without his wand. Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp are inseparable and they deliver Every Single time.<br/><br/>Crests and Troughs: <br/><br/>If anyone need one good solid reason to watch this movie the easiest answer would be Johnny Depp. But add to that, Penelope Cruz, Hans Zimmer (Music), Rob Marshall (Director) and Geoffrey Rush then you get Five golden reasons to unwind and enjoy the Roller coaster ride. Jack's entrance sequences have been a whale of a ride and here too the openings make you sit up. The action Choreography is simply brilliant, comical as well as cheeky and entertaining.<br/><br/>But all said you do feel a little bored during the intermediate parts of the movie. The half an hour period punctuated in the middle by the interval does get you restless as there is more of talk and less of action but you always know there is Jack poised to explode which he thankfully does. And yes, the movie is in 3D. And yes we all know it, it is completely Unnecessary. Wearing the 3D glasses significantly lower the brightness and contrast of the picture which is a big price to pay for a few effects here and there. Certain portions of the movie are a little vague and subtitles through the movie could have helped understand the plot better.<br/><br/>The Ultimatum: <br/><br/>Overall if you are a fan of the Series, it'd be a sin to miss this movie. You will be clamped in Irons and sentenced if you miss this adventure. If you are new to the series, well you will still be clamped in irons and sentenced for missing this roller coaster. So bring it on and say it aloud,""YO hooo! It's a pirate's Life for all of us!!!"""

","First of all , seeing this movie in 3D is pointless, and its a total rip-off . You can take your glasses off and still the picture quality is good, so the producing company legalized robbery and made me pay twice the amount for a ticket on a movie that is sold as being in ""3D"". But its not the only movie that did this , i see its a common practice these days.<br/><br/>As far as the script is concerned , the dialogue could have been better and there we're quite a few cringe and clichéd moments , especially how they handled the love story between the mermaid and the missionar.<br/><br/>And while i do get its supposed to be a fun adventure movie for everyone , they could have worked more a bit on the villain, its so one dimension and the way they choose to portrait Blackbeard's cruelty was laughable and not in a good way .<br/><br/>Overall the movie was pretty OK, had some good lines from Barbosa as always , but i suppose after 3 movies to me it just becomes formulaic. The movie is worth going to the cinema but only for the normal version, the 3D is a rip-off cause of these damn greedy companies."

Beautiful scenery, interesting plot, and plenty of humor, as we have all come to expect. The music, needless to say, was of superb quality, as always with Hans Zimmer. However, I could not help but notice that the direction was a little less sharp that with the previous three films. For part five, and I truly hope there IS a part five, can we bring back Gore Verbinski? With the previous three, there was a magic formula, and he was a part of that.

","I am a fan of the Pirates movies. Since 2003, I have enjoyed watching Capt. Jack and Co. stumble their way through adventures. Like many, I thought the last two sequels had a bit of bloat, none the less, they still entertained me immensely, thus I looked forward with fondness to sitting in a theater again to watch a Pirates adventure. I put on my Capt. Jack jersey, as I have for the last two films, and headed off to have fun.<br/><br/>Stranger Tides finds our good friend Capt. Jack continuing his quest for the Fountain of Youth that he set sail for at the end of At World's End. This time, there are two Jacks at the beginning. There seems to be someone going about England rounding up a crew under the guise of Capt. Jack. It isn't long before we learn who said impostor is, thus the quest ensues.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about the film was the return in Capt. Jack as a formidable Pirate. We had lost a little of that in the last two films, but here, Jack is in fine form verbally and physically. Depp pretty much wears Capt. Jack as a second skin and continues to throw layers on him. Rush is once again back as Capt. Barbossa, though this time, more of a ""company man"" in the beginning. Penelope Cruz is a fine addition as Black Beards daughter Angelica. Then you have Black Beard himself, Ian McShane, who turns in a wonderfully vile performance.<br/><br/>We get some zombies and mermaids this go around and enough action to keep you entertained. I thought Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was the best since the first film, it was continually rousing and fun throughout the film. And I think that is the best thing I can say about the film. It was a rousing fun time, exactly what I expected and like out of my Pirates movies. Yo ho, drink up and enjoy."

But when the ship lands on the Fountain-bearing island, the already flawed romp hits a wall and never recovers.<br/><br/>Tedious bouts of dialog replace sporadic action, and Depp's charismatic jester seems out of place within the plot-heavy escapades; like an out-of-work game show host alone on a broken down amusement park ride, he's got no one to counter, and nothing to balance.

While, Captain Jack sparrow still manages to amuse the audience with his dazed intelligence, the story and screen shots lacked freshness and ingenuity. Surely, Mermaids and Blackbeard add new twists, but plot is identical to the first movie. On top of it all, Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp had next to no chemistry on screen. The days of the movie ""Blow"" are behind them, its too bad. The 3D is more of a headache than an entertainment. The lighting of the movie is dim and smoky, and through the 3D glasses there are moments the audience sees very little.

Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) <br/><br/>In ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" CaptainJack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) searches for the fountain of youth with the welcome help of Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and the usual suspects. The action is incessant, the eccentric characters plentiful, and the adventure as a whole increasingly thin, an overload of trying hard to be quirky and ending up jerky. Even cameos by Judi Dench and Keith Richards can't surface this sunken treasure.<br/><br/>Jack and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) try to beat Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter (Cruz) to the fountain. While the addition of dangerous mermaids adds glamour and sex to a frequently unsexy franchise (faithful to its family orientation), this enormous franchise needs to drink from that fountain itself. Johnny Depp's drunken, fey pirate is getting old (he did get an Oscar nomination back when this was fresh stuff in 2003), the affectations merely keeping us from understanding what he is saying rather than adding to his characterization.<br/><br/>Additionally, the fight scenes rival Lord of the Rings for their excessive number and blinding cutting, leaving one to wonder if director Rob Marshall didn't just take footage from other swashbuckling movies. But the greatest thief of all is the 3-D pirate of lighting: The process drains light from scenes, and not just in this film. I'm a big supporter of 2-D.<br/><br/>And, yes, I'm over this franchise. When Geoffrey Rush and Ian McShane make me think of their previous acting triumphs rather their respective roles as Barbossa and Blackbeard, when the addition of a clichéd love between a mermaid and a preacher make you beg for the return of Orlando and Keira, and when Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz can't make me forget this is a dull sequel, then it's time to let someone else handle the critique of the next installment."

"elbes","6","2","5","26 May 2011"," If you loved the last three, I'd avoid this one....
","After watching ""On Stranger Tides"" as far as I'm concerned, Pirates of the Caribbean is a trilogy. Penelope Cruz made a terrific Pirate Wench, and the Design of the film, as always was visually stunning. Not to mention it was actually a brilliant relief to watch a 'Pirates' film without the annoyances of Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom's whiny acting. However, despite this, the film was really not great. The script was a lot poorer than its predecessors, as was the plot. The make-up was very very wrong and was distractingly modern throughout the film- not befitting the era or the mood. Some of the cinematography was surprisingly low-grade, especially in dark shots, and I was surprised some frames made the editing process (such as a frame with a large water globule on the camera lens, completely ruining any realism left). And that was another thing, the vague supernatural elements in the previous films seemed apt and 'in-place', yet these ideas were taken way to far in this film... since when was Blackbeard a wizard? However, the thing that bothered me the most about this film was the Christian moral values. Please don;t get me wrong, I have nothing at all against Christianity in anyway whatsoever, it's just when I go to see a film like this I do not expect to have it shoved down my throat at every opportunity. It seems that the writer/director deemed it necessary to have all the sin in the film toned-down, and that it was essential to have 'Christianity' win over all, with the incredibly sickeningly annoying 'Orlando-Bloom-esq' Missionary, who JUST WOULDN'T DIE!!! Normally I would suggest going to see this film just for good ol Captain Jack Sparrow.... but alas, even this classic character has been given a revamp, turning him into a bit of a 'Goody-goody' by the end of the film. Overall, I would say avoid it. Maybe see it out of curiosity if you must, or even just for the visual design of Blackbeard's ship. But if you're expecting another classic to add to the trilogy you will be sorely disappointed."
"MovieJunky101","6","2","5","21 May 2011"," A new movie with new adventures, new actors, but in all honestly, really just more of the same.
","For those of you who don't know, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in Disney's Pirates franchise has officially been released. A new movie with new adventures, new actors, but in all honestly, really just more of the same.<br/><br/>The film started off well enough, with Johnny Depp, once again embodying the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, making his grand entrance while trying to save his first mate, Gibbs (played of course by Kevin McNally) from the gallows. Then on to a failed escape and yet another grand (or familiar) entrance by the great Geoffrey Rush as the infamous Barbossa. Captain Jack makes another terrific, and comical escape, leading to a chase producing one of the best filmed sequences in the movie. <br/><br/>All right this is what I liked about the movie: That chase sequence, and some of the better choreographed fights, Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica, played by the gorgeous Oscar winner Penélope Cruz, and the fantastically underused, Ian McShane. Sparrow and Angelica's interactions were some of the best scenes in the film as well as the big mermaid sequence. <br/><br/>Now for what I didn't like: the Spanish's pursuit of the Fountain of Youth, just felt useless. The romance between the religious boy and the mermaid, Astrid Berges-Frisbey and Sam Claflin, just was not that interesting. The fact that Blackbeard was so fantastically underwritten, and the loss of momentum starting after the first big chase.<br/><br/>Other than the mermaid surprise, back before I even knew of their involvement in the film, I was down right shocked by the choice of Rob Marshall as this film's director. Marshall is a well known as a Tony Award nominated choreographer and director, and even more well known as the Academy Award winning director of the musical Chicago. <br/><br/>All in all, I really only liked the film in bits and pieces, Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane as Angelica and Blackbeard, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, the idea of the story (even if the script itself left more to be desired). First time Pirates director, Robb Marshall did well enough, though not as good as we could have hopped. He directed the fight and chase sequences like grand musical numbers, giving the audience some fantastic moments, but in the end the film as a whole, fell flat to my expectations. We don't get good movies out of the bits and pieces of good moments do we? As for all you hard core Pirates and Jack Sparrow fans out there, I'm sure you will enjoy the film as the heart and soul of the franchise, Mr. Johnny Depp, was used in almost every scene. The film should have revamped the series, instead they played it safe with a glossy studio film, made seemingly only to keep interest in the series. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides gets an 8 for the good use of Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. A 4 for not bringing anything new to the series, pacing issues and the terribly small amount of screen time for Ian McShane. In the end the fourth Pirates movie left me a little unsatisfied, and after averaging it out Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, gets a 6 which stands for average."

Compared to the previous three movies, this one is certainly stranger. In a dull way. It's still preposterously plotted and there's plenty o' Jack and a fair bit of Barbosa, but it's only just enough to keep this creaking crate afloat.<br/><br/>Even nubile sea nymphs and inanely melodious prose profusely proffered pointedly throughout cannot alleviate the strain of maintaining interest or enthusiasm as the climax climaxes.<br/><br/>There is more to come, and oddly I hope it's more like the previous two, wacky and frenetic as they were, and less like this snoozer."

Probably most disappointing was Blackbeard, who looked like any other pirate and didn't stand out to me as being a very imposing villain. Compare him with Barbossa when he was a ghost, Tia Dalma and especially Davy Jones. <br/><br/>Lots of missed opportunities here. First of all I would have made his beard BLACK, and something you can't take your eyes off of (hence the name), and I would have given him more magical power and sinister dialog. He should have been made into the nastiest, least honorable pirate alive. And I would NEVER have given him a girly daughter.<br/><br/>The mermaids were interesting as an idea, but as characters they played too small a role to sustain my attention. The Fountain of Youth was promising when they crossed into it but failed to deliver after they arrived. It was about as visually appealing as... well, an ordinary cave spring, only with a hint of ruins standing within.<br/><br/>The movie had many amusing moments, but they were strung together by the traditional pirate clichés and more sword fights that offered nothing we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>The background pirates were hardly even noticeable. No lovable sidekick pirates like Ragetti and Pintel or mascots like the undead monkey.<br/><br/>All in all it was fun to see Johnny Depp play Jack again, one of his most compelling characters, and Geoffrey Rush's ingenious Barbossa, but if you're looking for something to top Gore Verbinski's trilogy you'll be disappointed."

","OK, so besides being a HUGE Disney FREAK, and fan of the ride and films, this was not my favorite of the series, although I felt it was better then 3, I thought the storyline was kinda weak. The first 30 mins was so slow and boring to me and there were like 3 fights going on that I debated going home and going to bed. I began actually plotting what i was going to do the next day instead of watching the film.<br/><br/>That being said suddenly it picked up! Johnny Depp was hilarious as usual as Captain Jack Sparrow. The Fountain of Youth thing was kinda like blah and Sparrow really didn't even care about it.<br/><br/>Enter Angelica, who although i find Penelope beautiful, and she did some kick ass fight scenes, I always have a hard time understanding her so that ruined the character for me. I was wishing there were subtitles so I could know what the heck she was saying.<br/><br/>I didn't miss Will Turner or Elizabeth Swan, however I wish they had given some closer to that storyline like did he EVER get out of purgatory? The mermaids were sweet! Kinda like Ocean Vampires, so that was done pretty good. Hopefully they add some to the ride since they are adding blackbeard.<br/><br/>The zombie dudes were pointless to me, they really didn't explain that well and I think any of his crew could have been loyal without being zombiefied.<br/><br/>And so I guess the best part of the whole night was hanging out with my two Best friends Mike and Jason and Mike's cool shorts lol I'd still recommend people go see this film just because it is entertaining. BUT don't go in thinking it is gonna blow the others in the series out of the water< cuz well it just didn't for me"

","Why is it that these films still manage to be box office hits? This fourth installment in the series is more of the same; too much of the same. More of the same silly humor. Jack Sparrow is not funny anymore, he is becoming annoying and Johnny Depp's magic is wearing off. This film can be used as a guide for writing cliches. And it is so painfully American!<br/><br/>Despite the non-stop action and adventure and impressive visuals, I was bored because of the out of place humor and cliches. Romance is forced into the plot and is annoying and downright ludicrous. I honestly did not have fun watching this, although I must admit the Mermaid scene was really spectacular. And that's it! One scene. Just one scene I enjoyed about the movie."

","Eight years ago we were introduced to a scallywag, a pirate of sorts, a pirate by trade – Captain Jack Sparrow. Who would have thought that a big-time attraction from Disneyland & Disney World could spark a dynamite in the hearts of moviegoers? Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not – Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4. The cast – Geoffrey Rush, Ian McShane (thank you for portraying Blackbeard the way it was supposed to be played), the beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz and most importantly the man who needs no introduction the man who played Edward Scissorhands, the man who played Willy Wonka, the 21 Jump Street actor from all those years ago to a rising star and a beloved actor – the incredible Johnny Depp. From the story line, to the special effects, to the great music (Hans Zimmer, again you have proved your worth.) I give this movie a resounding and magnifying ARRRRRGGGGhH (a 10)."

","In this fourth instalment in the POTC franchise, we see Captain Barbossa and Captain Jack Sparrow trying to locate the 'Fountain of Youth'. Barbossa's agenda is merely to recover the 2 chalices in order to appease his king. Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane)also wants to discover the 'Fountain of Youth', but his agenda is to give himself eternal life. Along for the ride is Angelica Teach (Penelope Cruz) who is Blackbeard's daughter and an old flame of Sparrow's who also wants to get to the 'Fountain of Youth' to give herself life preserving qualities.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked about this entry is that it is well and truly back on track. We have more Jack Sparrow, plenty of fun and we also don't have the overly complicated plotting which we saw in the third film. This entry packs plenty of energy and some stellar performances (once again Depp and Rush don't disappoint and are clearly the best elements of not only this film, but of the entire franchise). Kevin McNally was also really good in the role of Gibbs and both him and Depp played off really well against each other - the scenes between Depp and McNally were probably the best in the film. Cruz was OK, but she was not in the same league as Depp or Rush (but she's so hot so I can forgive her for her average acting performance). It was also nice to see Stephen Graham in a minor role - I personally feel that he is an excellent actor and a massively underrated one at that.<br/><br/>One thing that's notable in this film is that there is virtually no CGI or special effects - this is not a criticism, in fact I welcomed it. It just goes to prove that these type of films don't need to rely on special effects to make a decent film. There seemed to be a lot of focus on the story and this entry (in terms of plotting and story structure) was much more cohesive than the third film.<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me about this film was the silly sub plot involving the mermaid Syrena and that bloke from Blackbeard's gang (sorry can't remember his name, but there again his acting was fairly forgettable as well). The romance was not only totally unbelievable (not to mention contrived), but it was also uninteresting and ultimately went nowhere. I really wish this pathetic sub plot had not been included in an otherwise excellent film.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an excellent entry in the franchise and is my second favourite film in the franchise (Curse of the Black Pearl is my favourite, but this comes in at a close second). I really enjoyed this film and I'm looking forward to the next entry in the franchise"

","I liked this movie because I liked the effects that it shows on the film and I liked all of the famous pirates that is tells you about like the pirate black beard and all the other type of mythical creatures it show on it like mermaids. I also liked that while they were on an adventure looking for a very valuable treasure there was a bit of romance and I like all the main characters on it like (captain Jack Sparrow) Johnny Depp who is in all the pirates of the Caribbean movies and Sweeney Todd and the tourists and there is (Angelica) Penelope Cruz who is in many other films like spy kids three and Sahara and grown-ups and dogma.

","The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film.<br/><br/>Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes.<br/><br/>The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.<br/><br/>Marshall did a decent job directing. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting."
"brando647","8","1","2","5 January 2012"," A Better PotC Movie Than Most People Will Give It Credit For
","When a film franchise has made as much cash as Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean, you know it'll take more than the end of a trilogy to put it to rest. I guess I always sort of knew another movie would make its way to theaters, but I admit I was still surprised when Disney announced a brand new sequel four years after the complicated conclusion of AT WORLD'S END. Well, when a new movie is inevitable, all we can do is hope they fix the mistakes of the first few movies without making rather than just horribly botching what was once an entertaining, if overly complex, series. Captain Jack Sparrow returns to continue the journey hinted about at the end of the last film: the search for the Fountain of Youth. After narrowly escaping arrest in London, Sparrow learns that there is an imposter posing as him in an effort to scrounge up a crew. His investigations land him enslaved on the Queen Anne's Revenge as part of Blackbeard's crew. The infamous pirate and his first mate Angelica (his daughter and one-time lover to Captain Jack) are in search of the Fountain of Youth before a prophecy can be realized: it has been foreseen that a one-legged man will kill Blackbeard. That one-legged man is none other than Captain Hector Barbossa; no longer a pirate, Barbossa sails for England as a privateer. The race is on as Blackbeard, the English, and the Spanish hope to be the first to the Fountain.<br/><br/>To start, I can't be the only one who doesn't think this isn't the worst film in the series. In fact, I actually really liked it. It's definitely better than AT WORLD'S END, and I'd say it's at least as good as CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. I enjoy this film because it doesn't over-extend itself with a multitude of story lines, dozens of supporting characters, or overzealous special effects. This movie feels more like a straightforward pirate adventure film. It does maintain a handful of supernatural aspects, but you expect a couple bits of mysticism in a good pirate movie. Whereas the first three movies always felt as if there was way too much going on, the story here is simple: a race to the Fountain. I admit it's a little sad to have a PotC movie without the Black Pearl and her crew, but the movie hints that we should be seeing her again in any future sequels (which I suppose are guaranteed with the roughly $1 billion worldwide box office this film pulled in). The movie is a lot of fun, with enough action scattered throughout to keep the adventurous pace. For whatever reason, I actually didn't care for the film when I first saw it in theaters (the wasted 3D didn't help the matter). I realized it's because I went in expecting another bloated, colorful PotC that I've grown accustomed to, and ON STRANGER TIDES breaks from that mold with a simplified, darker pirate adventure tale. I've since come to find the fourth movie as one of my favorites.<br/><br/>You know what I really loved about this movie? No Kiera Knightley and no Orlando Bloom. Good riddance. Their characters, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, are primarily responsible for what is wrong with the first three movies, in my opinion. Those fact that these two incredibly boring individuals were such pivotal roles dragged the series down. But now they're gone! Thank God for the Flying Dutchman. Not only did they do away with the two weakest characters, but they brought back one of my favorites (Barbossa). Next to Captain Jack, Barbossa is the greatest part of the series (probably because he less goofy and more.uhmpirate than Sparrow). Ian McShane makes an even better villain as Blackbeard. If you've ever seen HBO's ""Deadwood"", you know McShane can do stone-cold. Give him a cutlass and a supernatural pirate galleon and you've got yourself an awesome baddie. Penelope Cruz is Blackbeard's daughter Angelica. She's infinitely hotter than Elizabeth Swann ever was, plus she's got a fiery personality that Knightley could've only dreamt of in her time with PotC. The movie misfires a bit by giving a preacher and the mermaid he loves a little more screen time than necessary, but it only slows the story down minimally. I really don't know why more people enjoy this movie for what it is. Kudos to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio who've been with this franchise from the beginning and took a chance to change up the routine we've all grown so used to. At this rate, I'd probably support a fifth installment if Johnny Depp is up for another round as Captain Jack Sparrow."

","I'm assuming you have seen the previous installments of the Pirates of the Caribean saga/franchise. If you have, you know that Keiras and Orlandos character will not return for this one. But apart from Johnny Depp there are other people who do return from previous movies and lighten up the movie with their trademark humour.<br/><br/>How will you feel about this movie? It depends clearly on your love of the Jack Sparrow character (Captain, I know). If you like that character a lot, you will not mind a few faults here and there. If you are fixed on the fact, that Keira and Orlando are gone, you might as well not watch this, because you won't enjoy it as much.<br/><br/>The media tried to push other people in the cast as new Orlando and new Keira. But don't expect this to happen either. A fun ride (not as fun as the very first Pirates movie of course), that will entertain you, if you keep an open mind and your heart open for the one and only ... Captain Jack Sparrow!"
"lekgolah","6","1","2","4 November 2011"," One more step down from the original
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides had a few new things going for it and quite a few going against it, namely the budget being reduced, which is blatant throughout the film. While it tries to deliver on what the series is known for, it ends up feeling redundant.<br/><br/>What the film did have going for it was the new cast of actors and a new storyline, that is not a direct continuation from the last one making it accessible for new audiences. However like last time the plot is over complex, has too many characters and fails to bring a satisfying conclusion to any of them. The Spanish Armada are made out to be a significant force and their is a race to the fountain of youth but that never comes across. Maybe it was the reduced budget; one scene involves everyone preparing for a ship battle but no. <br/><br/>Ian Mcshane is a great actor and gives an intimidating performance as Blackbeard, however the script is weak and fail to make any of use of him. Unlike Davy Jones, one of the better villains in recent memory, Blackbeard simply barks orders and threatens people. There is no menace under his skin, which is a shame because he is meant to be a ruthless pirate. <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz, while a good casting decision is poorly used and the relationship between her and Depp is underdeveloped. Stephen Graham always brings something to his roles and does so here but is not given enough screen time. Richard Griffiths is embarrassing to watch as King George and Keith Richards appears briefly but only to help push the film forward slightly. I was hoping to see more of his character this time but instead we get less. Replacing Elizabeth and Will are a missionary and a mermaid. Their involvement is small yet inoffensive and do not hurt the film as badly as what other people have made out. <br/><br/>This leads me onto the mermaids, who steal the film/ have the best scene where they attack Blackbeard and his men. All the other action oriented scenes lacked any spectacle unlike the kraken scene from the second but this was very entertaining. The mermaids are presented as viscous yet seductive creatures who take men to the sea bed and kill them. It is also the only scene where there is a clear sense of danger and excitement. The films finalie is underwhelming and any drama and tension are broken by scenes of humour. <br/><br/>While Depp, Rush and McNally as Gibbs are good, they too suffer from what felt as if a large proportion of the film was cut down to a restrictive budget. Unlike the first two films, I feel less-likely to be returning to watch this again."

","MAJOR disappointment. Although Cap'n Jack Sparrow and Barbosa were great, they couldn't carry the movie by themselves. Too many of the dynamic characters were missing and the choice of Penelope Cruz as the femme fatale was a disastrous decision; she lacks in every way and comparing her to Keira Knightley is like comparing a kitten phart to a hurricane. I have hope that there will be, at least, one more episode in which Rob Marshall realizes his 'error', loses Cruz (hopefully by killing her at the beginning of the next movie) and reunites the original cast. Once in a great while, there is perfect chemistry between actors, a terrific plot and incredible effects that enters your living room and takes you to where they are.""

I think you could make the best of all POTC movie if you used these people, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Similar to his character in Hesher), Russell Brand, Rob Zombie and Fergie. Penelope was so bad in this movie that I fell asleep watching it in the movie theater and I had to pay to see it again. But I will not ever watch this one again. The first three films were so amazing, well cast and intense that I fell in love with them and I have seen each of them 30 + times.

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Pirates of the Caribbean returns with another Jack Sparrow's mystical venture. It introduces some interesting new characters and stories, the characters are enjoyable but the screenplay is loose. The best thing about the Pirates4 is the Mermaids, the entrance of the Mermaids has to be one of the best scenes in the entire Pirates Franchise. The first time someone decided to present the scary still beautiful side of the mermaids. Johnny Depp is drunken funny himself, we are kind of use to it. Geoffrey Rush is repetitive as well. Penelope Cruz is good but she didn't look as athletic as the character was. Though, chemistry between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz is really interesting. Among the new batch we Sam Claflin as the charming kind of priest religious guy and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as the captured Mermaid is serene. The weird thing was that they were supposed to be the new Orlando Blood and Keira Knightely but sadly they didn't get many dialogues or scene separately to shine. Gemma Ward as first emerging Mermaid is absolutely gorgeous, her entry and enchanting voice will be engraved in my head for long. Overall, Pirates are saved by the Mermaids. The Mermaids are the most fascinating part of the Stranger's Tides. I defiantly would like to see more parts as promised because it was enjoyable and there is lot of things can be done with these characters."

","pirates of the Caribbean is my best movie and this last episode is also a great part too.so many things changed in this part but quality never changed and i can say this part perfect too. so i recommend everyone to watch this movie... Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two."
"zardoz-13","5","1","2","14 June 2011"," More Tedium Than Treasure
","The fourth installment in Walt Disney's profitable ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" succeeds admirably in delivering less than the previous entries. Clocking in at 136 minutes, this ""Pirates"" sequel ends eight minutes shy of the original ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" which lasted 143 minutes. Further, ""On Stranger Tides"" runs about a quarter of an hour shorter than the first ""Pirates"" sequel ""Dead Man's Chest."" Comparably, ""On Stranger Tides"" is 30 minutes shorter than the bloated third installment: ""At World's End"" which wore out its welcome at 169 minutes. Alas, brevity doesn't salvage this shipwreck. Oscar-nominated ""Chicago"" director Robert Marshall and perennial ""Pirates"" scribes Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio blew a $250 million budget but what they've forged is largely forgettable. Indeed, the dire lack of imagination on the part of Elliot and Rossio, Marshall's second-rate choreography, and the overall shortage of spectacle sink this saga. Although it proceeded with their respective blessings, neither Keira Knightley nor Orlando Bloom reprised their roles as Elizabeth Swan and William Turner. They knew when to say enough.<br/><br/>Basically, ""On Stranger Tides"" navigates tamer tides. Elliot and Rossio introduce two new characters, the infamous Blackbeard (Ian McShane of HBO's ""Deadwood"") and his plucky daughter Angelica Malon (Penélope Cruz of ""Vanilla Sky""), and they serve primarily as villains who propel the plot. People who love the ""Pirates"" franchise may spot some familiar faces, including Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, Kevin McNally as Mr. Gibbs, Damian O'Hare as Gillette, Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father Captain Teague, and Greg Ellis as Lieutenant Theodore Groves. Familiar faces, two fresh characters, and a different plot don't save this scurvy saga. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" amounts to a paycheck movie. Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done little more than flog a franchise to see how much longer they could drag things out. Little about this third sequel, including Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, is entertaining. The mermaids are the only redeeming feature, but they cannot compare with the zombie sailors that trod the ocean floor in the original ""Pirates."" The race for the Fountain of Youth that motivates Blackbeard, King George, and the Spanish doesn't compensate for the clichés in Elliot and Rossio's briny script.<br/><br/>The action weighs anchor when Spanish fishermen net a geezer who knows something about Ponce de Leon's fabled Fountain of Youth. This opening gambit in Cadiz, Spain, generates minimal anticipation. The next scene in London, England, ratchets things up as Captain Jack rescues one of his crew, first-mate Mr. Gibbs, from a hanging. Everybody thinks poor Gibbs (Kevin McNally of ""Valkyrie"") is Captain Jack, and they are dying to see his neck stretched. Improbably, Sparrow cavorts about in a powdered wig and impersonates a British judge to get Gibbs off the hook. Of course, Jack and he don't get far before the authorities nab them. Jack is hustled off to see King George (Richard Griffiths of ""Gandhi"") and the monarch wants him to lead an expedition so that the British to beat the Spanish to the Fountain of Youth. Jack escapes from George's clutches. Jumping from a high window, our hero lands on a moving carriage, slips inside long enough to nibble a noble woman's ear (Judi Dench in a cameo), and steal her ear-ring. Bounding back atop the vehicle, he staggers and finds himself straddling two carriages as each careens along a thronged thoroughfare. Considering director Rob Marshall's award-winning background as a choreographer, nothing Jack does in this frenzied scene qualifies as either nimble or new. <br/><br/>Predictably, Captain Jack scrambles from one scrap to another. All this leaping and lunging creates neither hysteria nor humor. At one point, Elliot and Rossio have Jack fencing with himself in a spin on the famous Marx Brother's ""Duck Soup"" (1933) mirror pantomime as Jack encounters his leading lady. As an introduction to Angelica, who masquerades as Jack, these sword fighting antics mark a slight improvement, but nothing compared to the original ""Pirates"" when Jack sparred with William Turner. Naturally, Jack is searching for a ship and a crew. Fortuitously, Jack's dear old dad, Captain Teague (Keith Richards in a cameo), thwarts a lone British soldier from shooting him in the back. Eventually, Jack sets sail against his will with Blackbeard and company aboard the 'Queen Anne's Revenge,' where Jack discovers that his old ship 'The Black Pearl' has been shrunk to fit in a bottle. You see, Blackbeard practices Voodoo. Meanwhile, Jack's treacherous nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush of ""The King's Speech""), plies the seas in pursuit, but cares nothing for the Fountain of Youth. Specifically, Barbossa wants to exact revenge on Blackbeard for taking not only 'The Black Pearl' but also his leg. Like most hidden treasure quests, ""On Stranger Tides"" sends the heroes and villains off on a scavenger hunt. One of the items is a mermaid's tear. The scene where Blackbeard's sailors fish for mermaids is the most original splash that this soggy yarn offers. Believe me; you've never seen mermaids like this lot. Marshall and his writers confine the action largely to terra firma with our heroes and villains plunging through jungles and caves. As Captain Jack, Johnny Depp wears his eye-liner as thick as always and flails about like a drunkard struggling to maintain his equilibrium. Sadly, Depp adds little depth to his mischievous miscreant that we haven't seen before. Ian McShane looks every inch the part of Blackbeard, but he rarely gets a chance to chew the scenery. Hans Zimmer's exhilarating orchestral score from the original imparts greater momentum than anything that either Marshall or his scenarists conjure up for this third sequel. A romantic subplot between a missionary (newcomer Sam Claflin) and a mermaid (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) gets lost in this PG-13 shuffle.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" runs the franchise aground on a reef of déjà vu."

Balckbeard is wonderful for a new ""bad guy"" - a funny but scary character.<br/><br/>I usually don't like the 3D, but it was made well this time - almost the whole movie is 3D, unlike Tron, for example.

","Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides <br/><br/>This film is recommended. <br/><br/>""Captain Jack will get you high tonight, And take you to your special island.""<br/><br/>-Billy Joel<br/><br/>Avast ye mateys! Cap't Jack is back in the fourth installment of the Pirates franchise. This time we're set sail to find the Fountain of Youth! ( That sums up the entire plot and Depp depth of the film in about 10 words! ) Returning in full comic glory once again is Johnny Depp as the mincing boozy buccaneer, Cap't Jack Sparrow. Depp, ( in his words ) using inspiration from Keith Richards of Stones fame and PePe LePew of Looney Toons glory, plays his most famous comic creation with wry perfection. Also on board this trip is his once evil adversary, Barbossa ( an especially droll Geoffrey Rush ) and the newly eviler Blackbeard, played with true menace by Ian McShane. Penelope Cruz plays Jack's former paramour, Angelina. The role wastes the talents of this fine actress and she adds very little combustibility or comic timing to her underdeveloped role as his overdeveloped tempestuous love interest. <br/><br/>Missing this time are Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, but substituting for their roles as eye candy in this formulaic adventure ride of a film are Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena the Little Mermaid, and Sam Clafin as the handsome and hunkiest of all missionaries, Philip. ( More people would become devout members of his congregation with him as their spiritual leader. ) Unfortunately also missing in the film's script is much of the wit and humor of the original.<br/><br/>What there's plenty of is action, from well staged sword fights, daring escapes, and vampy vampire-like mermaids ( a mighty nice special effect, and I might add, the best section of the film ). At the helm of this film is Rob Marshall, who choreographs the festivities as if he were creating one big production number after another. He keeps everything moving at a clip, although many of the action sequences become monotonous exercises in expert stunt work or enhanced state-of-the-arts CGI, lacking any real spark or tension. The film certainly doesn't bore its audience with its numerous action packed scenes to hold one's interest. But Marshall sacrifices character development and plot details to make a film that almost seems desperate to keep everything and everyone afloat and doesn't leave any time for bona fide thrills or laughs.<br/><br/>Production values are still of the highest caliber: rousing music by Hans Zimmer, lush photography by the talented Dariusz Wolski, glorious costumes by Lucy Bevan , and remarkable production design by John Myhre. Yes, there were many gold doubloons spent on the film's lavish budget. Money seemed to be no obstacle.<br/><br/>The only real obstacle was the screenplay itself. If only this thin story had some meat too it. It's lean pickings. The script, credited to 5 writers and headed by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, seemed to be rote and wrote by committee as well. The dialogue lacks wit and the storyline seems trivial. The subplot of mismatched young lovers is strictly recycled Hans Christian Anderson, rated PG, while the exploits and escapades of Cap't Jack and his roguish crew this time around seem predictable and rather listless. Yet, the adventure saga still remains entertaining, primarily due to Depp's delightful tongue-in-cheek interpretation and the sumptuous visual look of the film. <br/><br/>Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides perpetuates the pirate myth of yore. There is nothing new or exciting in this blockbuster fantasy adventure yarn. We get more of the expected sameness from this successful film series rather than genuine unexpected moments. Although Pirates of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides still provides enough frothy pleasure, the tides are just starting to become a bit shallow on this particular voyage.

"Rafi91","8","1","2","2 June 2011"," PotC 4 ...a new beginning
","Action, adventure, romance, and comedy all fit into this one magnificent movie. The fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent family or teenage movie. ofcours some questions remain unquestioned but this is a different director from the previous three movies. All is good with captain Jack(Johnny Depp), once again he seems to be looking for a source of youth, the elixir of life, more specific The Fountain of Youth, but of coarse some other being is in search of the same item. Blackbeard(Ian McShane)and Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush). in quest of a crew Jack seems to inquire himself with a past lover, Angelica(Penelope Cruz) there is one problem though she seems to be Blackbeard's daughter. Held captive on his ship, Jack is forced to guide them through the dangers of the path to the Fountain. I find that the actors portray their characters excellently and each one of them capture the audiences attention. In place of William and Elizabeth there is a new, heartwarming romance between Phillip(Sam Claflin) and Syrena(Astrid Berges-Frisbey). They seem to nail the role of outcasts from their own kind, and yet every moment i saw the two being tortured or harmed in a scene it gave emotion and commitment. Like I've said before the plot had specific questions unanswered. What happens to Anelica after being marooned on an island, what ever happened to the rest of the crew from the Black Pearl (besides barbossa), and what happens to Phillip after Syrena drags him under the sea? Perhaps these questions will be answered in the next installment of PotC, along with better reviews. Besides the cast and storyline, the locations were beautiful and it was, over all, a thrilling adventure to sit through."
"stmusicpirate","10","1","2","2 June 2011"," Take what you can...give nothing back! Savy.
","Oyi, I have seen and heard whisperings and rumors that POTC 4 is terrible. Not true. Many of the other reviews said it was terrible because, ""Oh, Kiera and Orlando are gone. I miss them and they're pirate love."" I mean come on. SPOILER! They got married at the end of the third film, and had a kid. END OF SPOILER! What more do you want? They will be missed, I am sure and you can count me on that one. They are not what make the POTC franchise great and no it is not about Captain Jack. Simply, POTC 4 is not a bad sequel to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. In fact, it is a great re-boot to the franchise that is trying to get it back on it sea legs. Plus, a hell of good time to watch. Hellishly so. I give credit to Rob Marshall treading in newer waters. It still has the same old piraty spirit the earlier films were, and it's about the adventure and the fun of being of a pirate. <br/><br/>SPOILER OF PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 4: ON STRANGER TIDES. After sailing to and sailing back from being at the end of the world, Jack Sparrow is now on a search after the fountain of youth. To live forever is his journey, but another pirate who all pirates have come to fear, Edward Teach or rather Blackbeard, is after the fountain as well. Blackbeard is dying and wants to live forever, but he needs to finds the way that Ponce de Leon took. He needs the aid of Jack and his compass. With the help of Angelica, who was a lost love that Jack left standing at the altar, Angelica tricks Jack and winds him on board of the Queen Anne's revenge forced to help her and Blackbeard sail to the fountain to save her father's life. If that wasn't enough, there is also and will be but not limited to mermaids, zombies, more pirates of course, and a raring adventure on the high seas. But you wouldn't be interested now would you, aye! END OF SPOILER! <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean 4: On Stranger Tides is not like the first, second, or even third film of the franchise. If you are looking for the old POTC jokes, I am sorry mate that be not here. It's a fresh spray of the sea on your face. On Stranger Tides take summer films to new heights with a well written story of excellent funny and clever dialogue, showcasing amazing CG animations of a beautiful atmosphere and a sense of adventure of fights, ships battles, and romance. It's a pirate's life for everyone. Let's not forget the crew with fresh new faces as well aye! Well of course, Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow, my mistake, Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush fills his one leg and one peg legged shoes once again as Privateer Barbossa this time, and for the dreaded Blackbeard and his daughter, Angelica, Ian McShane and Penelope Cruz. <br/><br/>It has never been about Captain Jack for the franchise. He's is there to make the adventure a hellish good time with great sword-fights, funny dialogue, and well just being Captain Jack. For me, I love the franchise. It's the only thing that Disney has not corrupted, yet. From the first film setting the sail to where POTC needs to go, the fourth film takes it even further. True POTC 4 will never be ""Movie of the Year,"" but that doesn't matter at all. It's the sense of an adventure. Wanting to hold your swords and pistols in the air and scream, ""Aye,"" while in your seat. That is what makes the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise great and excellent. Too bad little Jack is stuck on The Pearl in a bottle. Oh well, I have waited four years for the next POTC movie and wait as long for the next, but this is what sails into theaters. Well I guess, take what you cangive nothing back. Savvy!"
"liamdegruchy","8","1","2","2 June 2011"," Jack is back and better than ever!
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back in this fourth instalment of the Pirtaes of the Caribbean franchise. Along side some old friends such as Captain Barbossa (Geoffry Rush)and his old first mate Gibbs, and some new faces such as the beautiful and sassy Angelica (Penelope Cruz)and frighting legend of a pirate that is Blackbeard. (Ian McShane) This troublesome tale sees' Jack go on a voyage to the fountain of youth. <br/><br/>Might I say how wonderful it is to have Jack back on our screens, Johnny Depp once again portrays the unique character brilliantly and yes at sometimes it is a bit repetitive but it leads to great comedy moments and entertainment for all. <br/><br/>Of course the movie could not beat what has come before such as the pirates first movie, but it lived up to be a great instalment to the franchise. Surprisingly I didn't feel the need for the old characters we all thought we would so desperately miss such as Elizzebeth Swan and Will Turner. Instead this movie had it's own stamp on the effect that it gave the audience and it is well worth a watch and a purchase in the future. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Liam de Gruchy"
"number_of_the_beat_666","5","1","2","2 June 2011"," Captain Jack Sparrow returns!
","Right away I'll start by saying that this will probably be a biased review. I've loved POTC since it came out 8 years ago, so when I went to see this, my mind was already saying that I would love the film.<br/><br/>On Stranger Tides may well be the best Pirates since the original one. That maybe because the majority of the cast are new, so now we can grow to love other characters. Jack, Barbossa & Gibbs are the only characters that return, making this an easy film to watch for newcomers. There are next to no references to the trilogy, which kind of sucks (I would have liked them to mentioned that people who died on the Black Pearl at the beginning became Will Turner's crew) but it doesn't ruin the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp still plays the legend that is Captain Jack Sparrow, and still plays him superbly. Geoffrey Rush once again steals the show as Barbossa. Every scene he is in is brilliant. I didn't think to much of Penelope Cruz, but she still was a good character.<br/><br/>I have to mention the mermaid scene, as it is one of the best scenes of all four films. At the beginning of the scene, you are told that they are evil, but, like the pirates, it's very hard to tell that they'll kill you! The music in the scene as well is very creepy, but at the same time it's such a beautiful score. It is, by far, the scene I will always remember from the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Barbossa doesn't get nearly as much screen time as most other characters. I found myself waiting for Jack and Barbossa to be in a scene together, and sure enough, when they meet during their adventure, the scene is hilarious. It's that kind of banter that made me fall in love with the series.<br/><br/>I also hated how they killed Blackbeard. He is such as legend in the pirate world, and they only give him one film. With him and the other legend of the seas, Davy Jones, dead, I can't think of another villain they can use.<br/><br/>I instantly recommend that you watch this film, even if you haven't watch the first three. Let's hope this is the first of another trilogy!"
"kunalkhandwala","8","1","2","1 June 2011"," Swashbuckling.... again!
","The Spanish galleons, Captain Barbossa leading a British vessel and the nefarious Blackbeard aboard 'The Queen Anne's Revenge', are on a quest to discover the mythical fountain of youth that holds the most desirable power. But one man is not too keen on obtaining such powers. He would rather face danger everyday and sneak life out of death's grip. With his mascara, beaded hair, trinket filled ragged attire and a worthy hat, Captain Jack Sparrow unfolds yet another adventure at high seas involving his female counterpart, a religious prisoner, the one-legged Barbossa, infamous Blackbeard who returned from the dead and those unearthly mermaids. 'On Stranger Tides' is by no means a revival of the series but it is still the same swashbuckling fun that you have aboard the journey that involves everyone's favorite Pirate. <br/><br/>Director Rob Marshall ('Chicago', 'Nine') takes the reigns from Gore Verbinski but one fails to notice any disparity in their styles of Pirate faire. As Jack Sparrow escapes imprisonment in London, he is however, unable to secure a ship and a crew that can set sail to freedom. That changes when he meets the ravishing Angelica (Penelope Cruz). He soon finds himself on-board Blackbeard's ship which is in pursuit of the Fountain of Youth. The challenges around the ceremonious drinking from the fountain involves two chalices, a teardrop from a mermaid and getting there before the Spaniards and Barbossa do. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is incomplete without his missing Black Pearl aboard which he commands a strangely buffoonish crew. Here, he is a reckless but glamorous guide without a plan as he jumps over cliffs, exploding lighthouses, sways over coconut trees and escapes certain death in all cases. The crew's encounter with the Mermaids in dark waters is perhaps the movie's highlight. Gorgeous looking mermaids conceal a vicious side but the determined Blackbeard does find a victim for a tear. Philip's tender love with Syrena, the captured Mermaid is strictly within limits in terms of length and digression from Captain Jack's adventures. The climax doesn't add any twist and is atypical of how Verbinski would end such adventures.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Rob Marshall doesn't do much wrong. People can grow tired of any series that continue through the years but this one has Johnny Depp. He lets go of his forgettable self as a 'Tourist' and gets into more comfortable shoes so easily. Jack Sparrow is an iconic character and Johnny Depp is now hardly more than this character. One can get tired of sequels but not with Jack Sparrow in them. This ship can sail on for much longer with him at the stern.<br/><br/>When the cast is dominated in such a manner by Johnny Depp, there isn't much of a lasting impression the others can leave behind but Penelope Cruz is a much better Pirate than Keira Knightley could ever be and without Orlando Bloom, there isn't much to miss unless he's an elf. Ian McShane as Blackbeard looks nefarious but nothing like Davy Jones' presence while Geoffrey Rush again, as Barbossa is competent. Hans Zimmer's score still resonates the precarious adventurous spirit at high seas and the cinematography even with most sequences being in the dark is captivating. <br/><br/>Frankly, Rob Marshall could not have done much more and Disney should be content with this year's biggest opening recorded by this installment of the Pirates on Stranger tides. If you prefer a convoluted plot with mystery, deep characters, intense emotions, memorable dialogues and epic story telling, then you cannot have the nonsensical Jack Sparrow in the middle of it all. He would be lost in his delusional state that he often tends to be in. For now, sail these stranger tides and aye! Don't be bringin those bottles o' Rum wid you...<br/><br/>8.040 on a scale of 1-10."
"tiggerpup91","10","1","2","1 June 2011"," A Fun-Filled Adventure!
","Johnny Depp hasn't lost a bit of his pirate charm in this newest installment in the Pirates franchise. I'll admit, I went into the movie with my doubts- I didn't think the movie would be half as good as the first, or even the second or third. However, those doubts were quickly and utterly washed away. So let me assure you, the movie is well worth the watch- it's filled with action-packed, fun and sometimes hilarious fight sequences, witty dialogue and wonderful, new characters. This is one Pirate movie you don't want to miss out on.<br/><br/>I'll stay spoiler-free, but go a bit more in-depth about the movie. Once more, Captain Jack Sparrow is wrapped around and involved in another mysterious and adventurous plot, and the fun is only just beginning. I watched it with a friend, and we found ourselves laughing, cheering, gasping in fear and surprise, and overall enjoying the movie by every second. If you enjoyed the charm, spirit, and the essence of fun and adventure from the first three movies, you'll love this return to the world of pirates just as much, if not more than, the previous installments. <br/><br/>One of the best parts of the movie was the acting. The two new main actors we see, playing alongside Captain Sparrow, didn't feel out of place at all- they held their own as solid, 3- dimensional characters and even challenged Johnny Depp for the limelight. We also get to move along the plot with a few secondary characters that were, in my opinion, just as wonderful and deep as the main ones were. <br/><br/>Overall, I rate this film as high as I possibly can. The score was brilliant- Hans Zimmer wows us again with his unbelievable talent- the acting was flawless, and the fun never stopped. I was even impressed with the fight-scene choreography. It challenges even the first movie in regards to which movie would be my favorite. If you're looking for a fun adventure (without the complicatedness of the trilogy-interwoven-multiple-plots from the first three), sailing the high seas with pirates and the always clever and charming Captain Jack Sparrow, definitely take your friends and family to go see this movie.<br/><br/>P.S. As far as appropriateness for children goes, I'd be okay with going to take the 12-year old I babysit with me to see it, as there isn't really any extreme sexual or vulgar references, and the language is surprisingly kept to a minimum (with a few scattered exceptions). However, the fight sequences and sometimes bloody/graphic moments, while exciting and fun, may be too scary for the younger children. So take caution when bringing the little ones along for the show."
"smokyowl","5","1","2","1 June 2011"," Wait for the DVD.....and rent it.
","The first 40 minutes were so boring I left to get a refill of popcorn. I don't usually do that, but the plot was so predictable I figured I wouldn't miss anything...and I didn't. I only laughed once during the movie, and there was only one shot that would make me go to the theater to watch it, and the shot lasted 3 full seconds. The first half of the movie gets off to a sluggish start full of predictable outcomes and exposition. Then there's the mermaid part, then the conclusion....big deal. Then there's the whole sub-plot with a guy falling in love with the mermaid....and during the movie I kept asking to myself: ""what's this guy's name?"" The movie as a whole just isn't entertaining enough to warrant seeing it in theaters. A few parts are okay, but overall I'd definitely suggest waiting for the DVD and rent it. Die hard fans of the series will probably love this movie because they are die hard fans, and they'll hail it as being great because they are emotionally invested in it already."
"shunad","8","1","2","1 June 2011"," Good film with lots of action
","The first film in the series was a good movie, the 2nd was too long and I didn't bother with the 3rd because it was longer. This time it is a decent film but still too long. The story is that after escaping from a hanging Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp ends up on the ship of Blackbeard, it was a good idea to put him in this movie cause he's a well known pirate. I thought the humour was the best of all the films because it made me chuckle quite a few times. The acting was up to the standard of the previous films, Johnny Depp did a great job. The characters were good however it has too many new characters and not enough old, all it has is Jack Gibbs and Captain Barbosa. The length was too long, it was a good length for most of the film but dragged on near the end. The action was brilliant, there was a good amount of action scenes for example the mermaids in the sea. Overall this is a good film but the ending was disappointing. I give it 8/10."

The subplot of the mermaid and the holy man was absolutely lost on the cutting room floor...hook, line and stinker.<br/><br/>Everyone, cast, crew, writers, producers, Mickey Mouse and the whole Disney monolith should make a big pass on any more sequels to this worn out franchise.<br/><br/>Still, as always, the only bright spot in the entire 2-plus hours was Ian McShane. He could be snoring and it would be full of character and devious charm.

"siciliajessica","2","1","2","31 May 2011"," Why...?
","I really wanted to like this movie...I really did. When I walked in the theaters I had high hopes, thinking that the directors and the producers would have learned from the previous films and would do something different with this one. But oh how wrong I was. This film is so bad that it makes the the third Pirates looks Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>For starters lets begin with the plot. What plot!?! I could hardly keep track, there was literally a million different subplots, a million different things going on all at once that you could hardly keep up. And overall you could care less of what happens at the end, it became very dragged on and boring when the characters were doing nothing but talking. Oh and another thing, when you make an adventure story please make it somewhat believable! I know that it's supposed to be supernatural in some way but they overdid it here with voodoo dolls and having magical ship with a mind of its own that kills its sailors with the ropes. And don't even get me started with the whole mermaid tear, it was so weird that its hysterical. <br/><br/>And now to the characters. There was no character development, nothing. You felt no love or compassion for any of the characters, not even Jack Sparrow. When I watched Johnny Depp on screen it felt as if he wasn't happy with his character, this is the weakest I have ever seen him as Jack, but I must give him credit for he was the best one. And then there is the villain? Who Blackbeard? He didn't do anything except keep the same solumn face, there was no fear at all with him. Penolepe Cruz could have done so much better! She did not fit well in this film, as if she was out of her realm. There was no chemistry between Johnny Depp and her, the ""love"" that they shared was not well acted at all, very unbelievable and not worthy of caring about. Barbossa was very bad overall, he was slugging through the film just to be there, he had no point and they made his character a lot more lame and wimpy. The mermaid love story between the priest and her was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen! It was very clichéd, pointless and down right dumb, why the heck would a priest fall for a mermaid!?!? Who would have thought? <br/><br/>And the ending is very weak as well, it leaves you very disappointed as if nothing was accomplished, nothing happens with Penolope Cruz's character and Jack didn't gain anything, not even a heart or morals. As far as I'm concerned, this series is dead, over. There is nothing you can do to revive it now, Hollywood should just let it be and move on to something new"

But for some reason the sequels are all missing the right touch of make up on the characters, and the spice in the dialogs. Of course I missed Orlando and Keira in this movie.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the overall plot of the movie. However, there are parts of the movie that makes you connect to it, and want to sit through this rather long movie.<br/><br/>The mermaids - All thanks to the mermaids, the movie kept going.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't take your kids to this movie - they will probably start hating all the fairy tales about mermaids.<br/><br/>Fun movie, but just wait and watch it on DVD."
"mccormick632","5","1","2","31 May 2011"," Plot holes detract overall enjoyment
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, is a film that has no right to even exist. The first three films ended nicely, with Davy Jones dead, Will Turner is the new captain of the Flying Dutchman, Jack Sparrow and Barbossa are both searching for the fountain of youth, and Elizabeth has a son and they live...somewhere and all is well. Even though At Worlds End did leave potential for another sequel, there was no need to make another. The below-average reviews did not help either. It was clear that people were done with the Pirate films, so this one is, for some people, unnecessary and unwanted.<br/><br/>I will admit that going into this film, I though it was going to be bad. The trailers were unimpressive, and I didn't think the film needed to be made. Yet to my surprise it actually wasn't that bad. Sure it fell victim to some poor writing, lackluster action scenes, pointless characters, pointless romances, and unexplained plot points, but Pirates 4 was enjoyable despite all the aforementioned faults.<br/><br/>The story involves Jack on a mission to find the fountain of youth. He is forced into joining Blackbeard's crew because of Angelica, an old flame of Jack's, who are also searching for the fountain, while being followed by Captain Barbossa. Barbossa has become a privateer in the British Navy, who somehow forgot the whole, ""he was a pirate who died and was brought back to life"" bit. Jack attempts to start a mutiny but it is quickly crushed when Blackbeard whips out his never explained telepathic powers with the ship which is somehow controlled by his...sword? Who knows, but this is a major plot hole because it is never, ever explained.<br/><br/>Anyway, the other major problem I had with this film was the romance between the clergyman and the mermaid. This side story is completely unnecessary and we don't even know how it ends. The last we see of the clergyman is that he is being dragged underwater by the very same mermaid who ""loves"" him. Is he dead? Where are they going? Is she going to save him like she said or is she going to end his pain by mercifully killing him? The film ends with a showdown between the British, Spanish, and Blackbeard's crew at the fountain of youth. Long story short Blackbeard dies, Angelica is upset because Blackbeard may or may not have been her father, even though he tried to kill her, and Jack strands Angelica on an island.<br/><br/>Pirates 4 is by no means bad, and there are a lot worse movies to see at the moment (*cough* Thor *cough*) but if you want a well written story, skip this, cause there is a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense and is never explained."
"The_Light_Triton","10","1","2","31 May 2011"," Arghhh! We be searchin' for the fountain of youth!
","One thing that will never cease to be cool is middle ages era pirates. Pirates are loved, hated, feared, and admired by many, many people. back in the 16th through 18th centuries, the most popular pirates, the English, french, and dutch were hired by the European hierarchy to plunder Spanish vessels carrying treasures and gold from the Americas and the Caribbean back to Spain. they kept this up until the 1730s, by then pirates wern't the same as they were for the past 2 centuries.<br/><br/>Nowadays, piracy still exists, but most of it happens around the coast of Africa and Asia. Somali is infamous for it's piracy. However, Somalian pirates aren't as swashbuckling and charming as jack sparrow would be.<br/><br/>Set in 1750, Jack sparrow (Johnny depp) finds himself in an quest to find the fountain of youth, along with Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). However, he is not alone. He is in a race against Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his beautiful daughter (Penelope Cruz). They all need a few extra things to drink from the fountain of youth - 2 special chalices and a mermaid's tear. With exciting sword fights, Treks through jungles, Fights for life against enchanting yet deadly mermaids, and religion (Yes, Religion.) hang onto your seat cause you're in for a swashbuckling time.<br/><br/>Now my favourite scene has to be the mermaid scene. Nothing says awesome like seeing and hearing a beautiful mermaid, the way her eyes stare into yours, and her voice bringing you into falling in love, and the next moment, her friends start to tear you to shreds. quite literally. (note to parents: One scene involves a man being dragged about 30 feet below the water, and 8 or so mermaids rip him apart and eat him alive. just a little warning.) Bottom line, if you're going to waste 30$ this summer on a movie, make sure it's Pirates. i guarantee you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>one question - What the hell happened to Philip and Syrena at the end!?"

With Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) and his crew on there trail, Will they ever find the fountain of youth? <br/><br/>I liked this one, Johnny Depp is always quite the scene stealer as Jack Sparrow, without him this would have been a nothing of a movie. Penelope Cruz is pretty good also, like a female version of Jack. Ian Mcshane is memorable as BlackBeard, Geoffrey Rush is also good too. The special effects are pretty good. It's not as good has the first one, but it nearly comes close."

","Go and see this movie since it's as good as any of the other installments in the series. Why is it that professional critics want to deprave the ordinary man (woman) of a good movie? If it is a bad movie, like the love guru, it will get a low score on IMDb. I would never have seen this movie if it wasn't for the high score it got here.<br/><br/>A long time ago I learned from a true movie-buff that you get the best movie experience if you sit real close to the screen and in the middle seat i e row four to six. That is especially true with these modern 3D-movies.<br/><br/>Any movie with Kieth Richards in it is a good movie by the way."

","Now that graphics and interest has caught up, comic book adaptations have become normalized, and cross-franchising doesn't seem as unexpected as it once was, feature length movies have officially reached the ability to become serialized--and this is a good thing. Not to say that there are not movies in the past with a nearly endless line of sequels--horror and porn are sort of infamous for it--and furthermore, film serials were quite common before movies expanded to multiple reels, but nowadays we practically have franchise movies sold in narrative blocks of three. The problem is when each episode depends on each other--which is why Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 are not that great, why Matrix 2 and 3 are not that great, and why On Stranger Tides is the sequel Curse of the Black Pearl deserved. Maybe other franchises will also embrace general serialization as a stand-alone interest, maybe not. Nevertheless, On Stranger Tides should make an example of things.<br/><br/>It probably won't, because... people don't think about things like this... but nevertheless, what really DO you expect from Pirates of the Caribbean? You expect Jack Sparrow, and you don't expect him to be particularly bothered to make a point of doing specific things in a way that garners a logical plot. For that, you need other characters with other interests to drive the story. The problem with 2 and 3 is that it was bogged down in characters that outlived their welcome (Elizabeth and Will, aka Keira Knightley and Legolas) whilst introducing a broad array of other characters, none of which the filmmakers writers, director, or producers alike wanted to kill, dragging the story on an endless array of double-crossings until it finally just got tired and fell down like a kid spinning round and round yelling. Pirates 4 does the necessary and gets rid of all that crap. Now characters are in danger. Now they could possibly die. Now, when a handsome loverboy finds his missus magical (this time a clergyman and a mermaid, heck yeah!), the movie lets them do their lover-ly thing and sinks them into the water to be forgotten for good.<br/><br/>This movie is the continued adventures, but in the way that anybody could come in or out as they please. Jack gets a bit more backstory, the worldbuilding gets broader, and there are flesh eating mermaids (not necessarily far from traditional merlore, but let's keep in mind this is the same studio that is responsible for Ariel the princess on first grader girls' backpacks). The only reason to see 2 and 3 would be to understand why Barbossa appears in 4--a throwback again to the fact that nobody wanted to kill anybody in the second two sequels, and in fact just had to bring back basically the only dude who died in film 1! More importantly, this movie has Blackbeard. After about seven or eight long hours combined of pirates scowling and buckles a-swashing (swashes a-buckling?) and a rather tepid Cthulhu wannabe Davey Jones following up the at this point fully all-too-lovable Barbossa, Blackbeard fills the presence of the screen with some real sense of unease. This is one maniacal pirate, whilst being cold and calculating--FINALLY! Spritey Jack has a foil! Blackbeard is everything Jack Sparrow is not--solid, burning, serious, destructive, fearful, and evil. The best part is, however, he has a relationship you can actually connect to--and its his treatment of that relationship that really shows how dangerous this guy is.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the use of 3D. 3D technically doesn't do anything aesthetically good depth of field couldn't do in 2D, but for what it's worth, Rob Marshall and Dariusz Wolski don't clutter up the foreground of vision with out-of-focus layers (in other words, the exact thing your eyes were they on their own would focus on first, but instead stay out of focus because the camera decides) and lets the characters' faces loom in foreground, the world of fantasy and adventure in the background. It's a good choice, this movie is much more pleasant on the eyes in terms of stress than even Avatar, which reveals the limits of 3D in almost the very first frame with that friggin' droplet hanging in the air. And if you are the type of person to pay attention to such things, this movie is cut a bit slower than previous fares, probably to make room for the 3D and the delayed reaction times to spacial cuts audience's eyes have. It looks like Hollywood is finally learning to use its little spectacle beast correctly, finally. However, just as Avatar looks better in 2D, I wonder if Pirates 4 wouldn't seem a bit slow and laggardly in 2D. I suppose I'll find out later since I wouldn't mind watching this one again.<br/><br/>At any rate, this movie is pretty much just as it should be, as far as the franchise and the technical aspects are concerned. Hopefully discontinuous serialization of franchises will continue to occur whilst 3D filmmakers keep their frames clutter free, and maybe someday Disney won't own a near monopoly on swashbuckling. Amen.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","I had low expectations but was rewarded with all you could get from a movie like that - a perfect 7 star entertainment!<br/><br/>I wasn't a big fan of the predecessors, because I was probably expecting them to be more like Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Fun entertainment with a simple yet interesting plot, including good jokes, beautiful actresses and actors portraying pleasantly caricatured characters as well as fascinating sets and action. <br/><br/>Compared to the other movies with dozens of unfinished subplots, annoyingly stupid supernatural characters combined with cgi all over the place, main plots that are both boring and confusing (without the positive effect some complexity can have), this was brilliant.<br/><br/>You will have no, or at least believe you don't have, long lasting scenes of boring cgi covering 90% of the screen - like giant octopuses or eternal fights with indestructible skeletons, but instead some mermaids with character. Shortening might have been possible, but all you want from a film like that is to lure you into another world for a while - why not for a bit longer?"
"evan_harvey","5","1","2","28 May 2011"," Lost at Sea
","There's nothing really wrong with the latest Pirates film, but it still fails to gather any real steam. Here's why:<br/><br/>Characters: The real disappointment here is Blackbeard. Apparently he captured the Black Pearl, but we never see that. Apparently he's a notorious pirate and is feared, but we never see that either. The first three films all had good antagonists. We saw Barbossa and his men in action. We saw Davy Jones and how he'd become corrupted. We saw the East India trading company and it's ruthless ways. We never see anything of Blackbeard. That alone almost ruins the film.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom also do not return for the fourth installment, which sucks mightily. It's not the same without them.<br/><br/>Plot: Why is Jack Sparrow on another adventure? He has no real motive here. There's some weak attempt to do so with someone impersonating him, which makes no sense at all, but the premise is flawed. Without a real reason, well, there's no reason.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I noticed that I missed the reason Jack is apparently on this quest: Penelope Cruz and whether or not he loves her. Well, that's not a particularly good reason, and certainly not a compelling one.<br/><br/>SFX: okay, nothing amazing like the first three films.<br/><br/>The real reason: why this film sucks a bit? The script/story is weak. The basic idea is okay - the continuing adventures of Jack Sparrow and what not - but the story is poorly told. As I said, there's no reason for Jack to go on this adventure. He's really just along for the ride, and it ruins the film. Blackbeard's reason is okay, but not particularly good. The other characters largely don't matter in this regard.<br/><br/>So, to summarise, the main problem is that while it's okay, it's really just a poorly written, tacked-on new film. All the basic ingredients are there, but it fails to make an impression. Not bad, but average.<br/><br/>5 out of 10."
"MoffatLP","7","1","2","28 May 2011"," Not What I Wanted, But I Received Better
","The thing about these 'Pirates' movies is that somehow they are historically related to classic tales, in this case, it was to the famous Blackbeard. I think that he was the best choice as a historical figure. Blackbeard is very known and already sense the evil in him by hearing his name. Another thing that is related to the other movies is that there are the bits of humour throughout the entire thing. Some of the fight scenes were very very similar to the previous ones. This was worth the watch in 3-D. Recently there haven't been many good 3-D movies, but 'On Stranger Tides' was one that really was worth seeing. Johnny Depp yet again played another amazing performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. I hope to see another series being released in the near future."

","A year-ago-ish I saw How to Train your Dragon 3d with my friends. This time, it was Pirates 4 in 3d. One less friend, but still as epic.<br/><br/>I saw the first movie, and it was epic win. The second started to get boggled down with story, and the third was a bit better since I had wikied the story. The fourth, however is continuing the story, however it also contains plot information based on characters that existed BEFORE Jack Sparrow's first appearance in the first one.<br/><br/>The plot is okay. We lost a lot of good actors due to the fact that the story was getting established. However, we still got enough recognized characters that it isn't all brand new. Mermaids and Blackbeard and a love interest, and so on.<br/><br/>The special effects are stunning and I'm quite impressed by them. The ending was very funny and amusing, however it wasn't as epic as past ones. I am glad, though, that Jack Sparrow was the last on screen.<br/><br/>Rated 8/10, 1/10 because of the swearing, and 1/10 because of the sexual content that could have been avoided."
"Ryan_MYeah","7","1","2","26 May 2011"," It delivers on the action, comedy, and visuals, but lacks in coherent screen writing and direction.
","In On Stranger Tides, Johnny Depp returns as everyone's favorite rum guzzling, scenery chewing swashbuckler from the Pirates of the Caribbean saga, Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Several years after the events of At World's End, Jack is in London seeking a crew and a ship to set forth on a journey for the legendary Fountain of Youth, but after a chance meeting with an old flame of his named Angelica (Played by the lovely Penelope Cruz), he is brought aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the merciless Blackbeard (Played by Ian McShane), who is seeking the fountain for his own selfish needs, and who may possibly be Angelica's father. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Played by Geoffrey Rush), now a privateer for the English crown, is also on an expedition for the fountain, but above all else, has a personal score to settle with Blackbeard.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Rob Marshall, the man behind Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha, taking over the helm from Gore Verbinski, which is the first problem that this movie has. It's not that Marshall's direction is terrible, but it feels stylistically disjointed from the previous installments. The movie's screenplay also features moments of lazy writing, and quite a few incomprehensible subplots. But it's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, so you know what you're getting: an admirable cast, highly effective humor, and fast paced action sequences, such as one particularly outstanding, and unsettling mermaid attack sequence.<br/><br/>Another problem I have with the film, albeit to a lesser extent, is how it sounds. This isn't a knock against the creative effects, or another great score by Hans Zimmer, accompanied this time around by Mexican musical duo Rodrigo y Gabriela, but sometimes during the film, the blend of ringing swords, cannon fire and French horns mixed with the somewhat chaotic nature of the action scenes can become a bit bludgeoning.<br/><br/>Still, like the previous entries, the film is typically beautifully designed through the great visual effects, lovely sets and costumes by John Myhre and Penny Rose, and incredible makeup work on mermaids, zombies, and injured sailors, so you can expect to hear me singing the praises of makeup designers Joel Harlow and Peter King for the rest of the year.<br/><br/>On a final note, I do admit that the series has become a big cash cow, and with each new installment it had been getting worse, but I think this one is pretty much on par with the last installment. It's not a good movie, but it's fun enough.<br/><br/>So I'm gonna give On Stranger Tides a tepid **1/2 out of ****"
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","2","25 May 2011"," Lots of swash, lots of buckle, not much plot
","The ""Pirates"" franchise is one of the strangest in the world of movies; it is so entertaining and profitable and yet based on nothing more than a theme park ride and totally lacking the narrative form of the ""Harry Potter"" films or the endlessly refreshed format of the James Bond outings.<br/><br/>At its heart is Captain Jack Sparrow, one of the oddest and most lovable characters in cinema and an absolute triumph of creation by Johnny Depp. Nothing else seems to matter, as long as there is endless swash and buckle.<br/><br/>For ""Pirates 4"", Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have sailed over the horizon but Geoffrey Rush is back again, wide-eyed and legless, and Ian McShane and Penelope Cruz are now on board. And we have mermaids - but not as we usually imagine them (think ""Splash"").<br/><br/>As with the other ""Pirates"" sailings, an intelligent – or at least intelligible – plot is as elusive as a mermaid's tear. All that is clear is that everyone is seeking the Fountain of Youth and, at some two and a quarter hours, the viewer too might want to join the search.<br/><br/>Yet visually it is all so kinetic and emotionally it is all so much fun, we forgive the leaks in the hold and just go along for the voyage. At the end of the endless credits, there is a short clip that makes it clear that ""Pirates 5"" will be docking in a few years."
"pyrocitor","5","1","2","25 May 2011"," Stranger tides? Nay – still waters.
","There is a beautiful irony in the newest installment in Disney's ongoing plundering of the seas of box offices worldwide being titled On Stranger Tides, as there is virtually nothing in any way strange about it. Indeed, it is worth noting that the working title was Pirates of the Caribbean: The Fountain of Youth, as the entire film carries such a sense of borderline- irritating straightforwardness and linearity. Hawked as an antidote to the labyrinthine narratives of the second and third installments by providing a stripped down narrative with more focus on story and characters, the only promise that On Stranger Tides makes good on is that of being stripped down. Despite having jettisoned many of the franchise's ever growing cast of familiar faces and subplots and clearing room to start anew, the latest Pirates escapade unfortunately comes across as lukewarm and benignly pleasant rather than any sort of infectiously fun adventure on the high seas like its predecessors. <br/><br/>As if mortified at the prospect of confusing audiences once again, the film proves frustratingly content to play it safe throughout. There are certainly no 'rocks into crabs afterlife hallucination' sequences to be found here, but nor is there a surplus of jaw-dropping set pieces or scenes of visual majesty designed to deliver the sort of escapist spectacle the genre was designed for, lending credence to the purported budgetary restraints. In fact, only a chillingly tense mermaid attack midway through the film stands out amidst a slew of half- baked chases, brief swordfights and other such near successes (the living ship rigging of Blackbeard's vessel, while a decently interesting conceit, still pales in comparison with the sight of Bill Nighy's face covered in wriggling, independently moving tentacles as Davy Jones), all coupled with the spirited droning of what is surely Hans Zimmer's most uninspired musical score to date. <br/><br/>New director Rob Marshall, more renowned for overseeing musical dance numbers than swashbuckling, continually scrabbles for predecessor Gore Verbinski's joyful fusion of dark- tinged but overall lighthearted adventure, yet his film feels perpetually neutered. There is a continuous sense of the plot being driven by familiar tropes (double-cross leads to skirmish leads to witty banter leads to Sparrow buffoonery and repeat) more than any overriding notions of character or narrative development, while the film functions to namecheck an appropriate medley of iconic components without doing any of them justice (it is hard to imagine a more boring take on the high concept of zombie pirates). One could speculate that loosely adapting the story from Tim Powers' fantasy novel proved a hindrance to innovative plotting in the film, yet the sense remains that the film would have felt equally stilted and forced no matter what central story. <br/><br/>That said, there are dashes of amusement to be found even for more skeptical viewers. The film's daringly cartoonish portrayal of the sparring political powers of the time (both Richard Griffith's nearly drooling, uncomfortably scene-chomping English King George and the comically robotic Spanish) can't help but suggest some sort of ambiguous contemporary political satire of childishly warring over desirable goods. Nonetheless, any such hinted subversion is easily overridden by the mawkishness of a forced missionary/mermaid romantic subplot that comes across as nauseatingly traditionalist and a final act riddled with unrealistic character motivations and actions. It's enough that by the climax, rather than pining for a plot that made sense, the viewer is left pining for a plot with any spark of enthusiasm or intrigue intact. <br/><br/>It feels almost redundant to say that Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow saves the day, but there is no question that his eccentric yet uncanny blundering remains simply a joy to watch, even if the woeful writing leaves his character awkwardly poised between driving the plot along with unconventional lucidity and haphazardly tossing off one-liners more often than not. Fellow franchise veteran Geoffrey Rush equally struggles against the script but manages to infuse Captain Barbossa with his standard roguish twinkle, extracting welcome comedic mileage out of a recently acquired peg leg. Penélope Cruz is less fortunate in attempting to combat the shoddy writing of her femme fatale character (even her murky past with Sparrow feels irritatingly inconsistent), and Cruz is given little more to do than sulk, rather than offer her characteristic sultry charisma. Similarly, Ian McShane's take on legendary pirate Blackbeard feels entirely mishandled, consistently contradicting the character's peerlessly evil reputation by coming across as oddly vulnerable, sympathetic or simply bland, with McShane given no chance to let loose any trademark snarls or villainous scene-chewing whatsoever. In the same vein, Keith Richards' reprised cameo, apart from one priceless wisecrack (""Does this face look like it's been to the fountain of youth?""), feels particularly pointless, though an unexpected Judi Dench cameo is far more fun, and definitely worth keeping eyes peeled for.<br/><br/>While it would be false to say there is no pleasure to be extracted from the old Pirates formula being dusted off and rehashed, but the film carries such a sense of willful mediocrity to it throughout that it is hard to ever properly buy into the fun. Indeed, On Stranger Tides does function as a pleasant enough temporary distraction, but any further longevity to the franchise would require a substantial return to the energy and inventiveness of the earlier films, and soon. Forget stripped down, this pirate ship needs fleshing out something fierce. <br/><br/>-5/10"
"evansiggson","7","1","2","23 May 2011"," spirituality in pirates?
","The first Pirates was entertaining, fun, and offered something for children and adult viewers. The following two sequels went off the deep end, confusing adults and boring children with an unclear plot and no clear hero to root for. <br/><br/>I entered the theater to watch Pirates 4 with various expectations and presuppositions. Gone are the boring and at times unwatchable Will Turned, Elizabeth Swan, and Davey Jones. Back, of course, is Jack Sparrow and the incredible Barbosa (Gregory Rush). Welcome Blackbeard and Angelica to the franchise. The story is far superior than the last two installments. The plot is understandable yet still contains multiple layers. Various parties are racing to find the fountain of youth. Of course the audience is aware that each character cannot be trusted and deception will used for personal gain. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most intriguing character is Philip the priest who is somewhat a prisoner upon Blackbeard's ship. Throughout the movie we discover Philip is the only one who looks for the good in everyone. Philip believes that every life is valuable and that none is beyond the hopes of salvation, although Blackbeard greatly tests this theology. Are there people we feel are beyond salvation? Do we consider the blackbeards in our lives as valuable people with worth and value? How far can one go before we write them off? This tension is wonderfully explored with Philip. <br/><br/>Another profound issue raised is when the Spanish destroyed the fountain of youth since eternity only comes from God. What is the role of a Christ follower when others are seeking eternity from a source other than God? Is destroying those false hopes (from their perspective) commendable or classless? Does God need defending? Is love allowing one to attempt to quench their thirst from a false source or is it destroying the false source? Perhaps the answer is neither but within conversation and relationship. <br/><br/>Near the end of the film Blackbeard and his daughter are faced with a choice. One can receive eternal life but the other must sacrifice their life. How can this decision be made? Blackbeard selfishly attempted to take eternal life at the cost of his daughter's life. Jack Sparrow predictably tricked him and Blackbeard received death. Here Blackbeard served as an anti-Christ type of figure. Eternal life cannot be stolen, it must be granted. One receives eternal life only when they give up their life willingly. <br/><br/>Overall fun movie again and would have been a better part 2 sequel than the last 2."
"jdkraus","8","1","2","22 May 2011"," Another fairly decent installment of the ""Pirates"" franchise
","One may think that another ""Pirates"" film would be terrible, specifically the fact that there's no Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom, there's a different director, and the idea in it of itself seems insane. Despite these discrepancies, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", proves to be another decent installment of the series. <br/><br/>Once again, Johnny Depp dazzles the screen with his humor, charm, and wit as Captain Jack Sparrow. It's impossible to resist the man in a pirate's outfit with the flawless gold teeth and eye make-up. Geoffrey Rush is simply better than ever as Barbossa (who doesn't need much makeup for the role I might add). Kevin McNally returns as Gibbs as does Keith Richards as Jack's father—but only for a mere, somewhat out of place cameo. It may seem disappointing that some of the old faces are gone from the first three films, but the new ones blend in perfectly as replacements. Among them is Penelope Cruz, as Jack's old flame, and Ian MacShane as her evil father Blackbeard. Both do exceptionally well, though Blackbeard is not as up to par as a villain like Davy Jones—he simply lacks the menace. <br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", also proves to have some very memorable action sequences, particularly a chase scene in London (which takes place during the first half hour of the feature). There is also a bit of clever humor that made me laugh almost as hard as the first ""Pirates"" film. Rob Marshall proves himself to be fit for the role as the new director of the Pirates films, too. The other technical aspects of CGI, production design, and make up are impeccable.<br/><br/>One technical feat that seems lacking is the lighting. It is understandable that it is to be dark during the night, but it did not have to be so dim that I can't tell what is happening on the screen. The plot also did not hold up as good as the earlier films. For instance, I was expecting a big finale like in any other feature. There is one, but it is not long enough, nor is it very memorable. There are also a couple of things left hanging that made me feel confused. <br/><br/>Overall though, for a multi-billion dollar series, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" does a pretty good job. It is better than the slow-paced ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it is not a masterpiece like the original film. When you have nothing better to do, go see this feature on the big screen. <br/><br/>***/****"

","This new addition to the popular franchise does not make you say, ""why didn't they stop at number 3?"", It made you say, ""So that's why I like the Pirates films!"". Even if you haven't seen the previous 3 or forgotten what happens that will not hinder your enjoyment of the film. I loved the characters, no shallow performances, the plot was substantial and cool and the whole narrative was great. At first the film starts with a few fighting scenes which makes you think, ""Is this what the whole film will be about?!"" But it evolves into a great film with a good balance of action and talking bits. Penelope Cruz was the star of the film, feisty, funny, flawed, not sure if she is really bad or not, she brought depth to the film. The film itself had depth and did not bore. The whole film was intricate, meaning it was very interested in the characters and the journey they endured. A great fun film for all to enjoy!

"lisalawley-1","9","1","2","22 May 2011"," I really enjoyed but but............!!
","I have just seen this and I loved it mostly. Not as good as the others, but I didn't expect it to be. It exceeded my expectations in some ways, but disappointed me in others. It might seem over critical of me, when you read this review, seeing as I would give the first three 10 out of 10, and this an 8-9. I enjoyed it very much, but if I had to compare to others, it has to be marked down.<br/><br/>I thought Johnny Depp was again superb. As I adore Captain Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp) I had to see this regardless of what the reviews may say. A slight change in character in my opinion, but not a bad thing. The character Jack Sparrow is lovable and often mysterious, clever or lucky rogue, and this time his character opened up a bit more, to reveal more of his caring and genius side. Depp never disappoints. The only downside is that the trailers show the biggest and funniest one liners, and I always wonder why the producers do that? It's annoying!!<br/><br/>Rush was brilliant as ""Barbosa"" as he always is. He had a difficult role to play in this one. He wasn't full Barbosa until the end, because he couldn't be. It was a shame, but maybe it would have been too cliché if he had. It's a shame though, because I loved the character Barbosa, and in part that is what I wanted to see, but the story didn't allow it. That is not Rush's fault. He still played a blinder.<br/><br/>Gibbs was Gibbs. It was nice to see him back even if we didn't see much of him. Other characters were missed, which I *think* left a big hole for such small roles. Lee Arenberg (Pintel) and Mackenzie Crook (Ragetti) for example, that made a good double act, that increased the comedy appeal. There was to me, a lack of good supporting actors, and that was a real shame. This made me realise just how good these smaller roles were in the first three films. The supporting actors were instantly forgettable, which is a shame for them as much as the audience.<br/><br/>Penélope Cruz was superb in my opinion. A great actress in this, very believable and a great addition. I personally think she had the most to prove in this, having to take over *in a sense* from Keira Knightley. She did a great job. I know that, rather unfairly, Cruz was one of the characters that I was worried about, but she did brilliantly. She was sexy and feisty, and played the role very convincingly. There's great spark between her and Jack, and dare I say it, I think her role was more convincing than Keira's. Maybe that's unfair though, because clearly, they are two different characters. It was just a shame that her character seems to have been ""plucked"" by the writers like most of the others in this film.<br/><br/>Sam Claflin, was another new comer, and a new actor. One to watch out for in up coming films I think. I think he played a blinding part. Very sincere, hugely attractive. It does seem like he was a co-incidental part really, which is a slight shame. His character wasn't really explored enough, and I found myself wanting to know more about him. Maybe it was just simply clever directing, as to not give away too much to the audience, or maybe, they didn't want to over cook the role, making him a character filler for losing Orlando Bloom. Which like Cruz, is really what they were, character fillers. Either way, a great character, played by a skilled new actor.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Ian McShane as Blackbeard. He played a good role, but to me no where near as good characters as Barbosa in the first, and Davy Jones in the second and third. He basically had command of a ""sword"" that didn't really do much. He was ""ruthless"" right until the ""end"" but to me, it wasn't enough. His character was too shallow. Both Barbosa and Davy Jones were allowed enough time for the audience to fully discover them, and they were frighteningly interesting. Blackbeard wasn't a patch on that, and won't ever be either. His crew that he ""zombified"" were unconvincing to me. The whole ""Blackbeard"" bit was the biggest disappointment, and that is a shame. <br/><br/>This one lacked the special effects of the other three. I thought the film had two great bits. The first, in London where Captain Jack escapes as only Captain Jack does. Brilliantly lucky! The second was the Mermaids. Very good indeed, but not ""spectacular"" to me at all in comparison to the other three.<br/><br/>Will there be another? I'm not convinced. Cruz ends up left where Sparrow was left in the first. Barbosa returns to his post of captaining a ship with power, and Jack Sparrow ends up being older and wiser, with no ""real"" aspirations, other than just appreciating being a ""Pirate"" Never say never though. I would like for there to be another, but equally, I am satisfied with the one's we have now. Having lost some of the ingredients that made the first three superb, the forth one might just be enough now. The writers would have to really pull the cat out the bag to make a fifth in my opinion. They would have to resurrect a fair bit, but would that make it just a hash of the first three?<br/><br/>The success of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has got to be all the ingredients though. That's everything from the main characters, to the supporting roles, special effects, writers, screen play and directer. This fourth instalment was stand alone for sure.

","Depp and McShane are always entertaining, but this movie isn't even close. Cruz is like Puss In Boots from ""Shrek"" in human female form. Keith Richard is ridiculous, as usual. This might be about two hours but feels like two years. Rush is possibly the best thing in the movie, but he's really underused. The plot concerns the Fountain of Youth and somehow all these characters chase each other around with occasional sword fight to relieve the tedium. The battles are well staged, but the story is incoherent and silly. Depp gives his usual performance, giving more to the role than it deserves, the same is true for Rush and McShane, Cruz is blah. Worst one yet, but surely there's another coming along."

","Well if your a big fan of the Pirates movies then you have to see this no matter how good it is right. Well its not a total stinker but the storyline is horrible, what they did with Captain Barbossa is a crime. You put Ian Mcshane in the movie and basically don't use his talent. His character Blackbeard probably the biggest pirate ever just doesn't have the part written as so. Jack Sparrow is funny in the movie but we knew he would be. The storyline doesn't really even pickup right where they left off in the 3rd movie. It was a good idea to get rid of Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley as I thought it brought the 3rd movie down a bit, but if your going to do that think of some characters to replace them. This movie would be a better rental or buy to watch at home rather than spend 40 to 50 dollars on popcorn,candy and tickets.Yes they left it open for another Pirates."

","Making waves at the box office this summer is ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", the latest addition to Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. With a new director and creative team, this movie discards the storm tossed continuity of the second and third Pirates films and starts off on a clean slate, making the story easily accessible for newcomers to the franchise. For those who have followed the series from Pirates of the Caribbean 1, the movie might come across as rather predictable thanks to the established Jerry Bruckheimer formula of comedy and chaos.<br/><br/>On Stranger tides opens with the eccentric pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (masterfully played by Johnny Depp), in a bit of a tiff. Without a ship, without a crew, and narrowly escaping imprisonment Jack lands himself into a hunt for the mythical fountain of youth after running into his old love Angelica (Penelope Cruz). But she is not the only one after the fountain. Competition comes in the form of the Spanish armada, a British expedition led by none other than Sparrow's ex-rival Barbossa and the infamous pirate Black Beard. Along the way, we get a tacked on side story about a missionary falling for a mermaid, a surprising father/daughter revelation and a convoluted quest for a variety of items needed for the ritual at the fountain.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides seems like a return to the darker style of the first Pirates movie with voodoo magic, on-screen deaths, and a really disturbing take on Mermaids. However, it retains the needless ""side quests"" narratives and the unexplained magical mythologies. Stuff like Black Beard's voodoo powers, his magic sword or the fate of Jack's old ship, The Black Pearl, are merely glossed over and never explained. Instead, more time is spent on moving the plot along from on comedic action sequence to another.<br/><br/>Not that it is a bad thing since the comedy scenes, all involving Jack Sparrow, are the highlight of the movie. These include a gut bustingly funny chase through the streets of London and an over-the-top escape from a Spanish prison camp. The downside is that Jack is once again reduced to just being ""bugs bunny"". He is the funny guy who gets into crazy situations. The deceiving, under handed, unpredictable, eccentric scoundrel side of his character is very much downplayed for laughs.<br/><br/>As a result Jack and the rest of the characters come across as nearly one dimensional. Character development is almost non-existent despite having so many characters to choose from. Black Beard could have done well with a sort of emotional redemption arc, or perhaps Barbossa could have been given more depth about why a pirate like him would want to ""go legit"". There was a hinting of a conflict of principles regarding fate and free will but it was never expounded upon. And of course, Disney has not forgotten about the eye candy vacuum left by the departure of Orlando Bloom and Kiera Nightly from the previous movies. The afore-mentioned missionary and mermaid (played by relatively unknown actors Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey) fill those shoes and deliver the passion-devoid yet mandatory romance subplot. Between the one-note villains and the simplistic heroes, ""Predictable"" would be the word to describe the plot.<br/><br/>What the film manages to deliver is what made its predecessors such fun to watch in the first place. The unimaginative script is pretty much redeemed thanks to perfect casting and professional, though slightly exaggerated, acting. The production designs, costumes and sets are beautiful as always, as well as the various on-scene locales. They maintain the realistic-styled slant with a gritty, well worn feel mixed with Disney cartoonish colors which succeed in truly immersing the audience into that world. It is a pity though that director Rob Marshall, whose resume encompasses only musicals and small romantic comedies, feels out of his element directing a summer blockbuster. Gone are the wide panning shots and the sweeping camera-work of Gore Verbinski, replaced by Marshall's rather run-of-the-mill directing that fails to instill Pirates of the Caribbean with much needed scope and scale.<br/><br/>More of a comedy with fantasy elements than a fantasy epic, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger tides is sure to entertain with its timely comedy and brisk pace. Compared to previous Pirates of the Caribbean films, it easily ranks higher than the second and third entries but lacks the character development, less complicated plot and scope of the first film ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". Still, ""On Stranger Tides"" does not feel like a major turning point or epic life changing event for any of the characters. Then again as Jack says, ""It is not the destination, so much as the journey."" And this is one entertaining journey which would at very least leave you with a different impression of Disney singing mermaids.<br/><br/>7.5/10 rounded down to 7<br/><br/>http://thexamtaroshowvault.blogspot.com/"

Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not – Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4.

"MovieProductions","5","1","2","20 May 2011"," DBOX 3D Review: Bigger doesn't exactly mean better
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Keeping my head held high, walking in with my $22.75 ticket to where my derriere would be seated D-box style, and my eyes wide open in every dimension, I thought, how could I possibly be disappointed with such an experience? Too bad it wasn't the experience that sucked. It was the movie. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy my case of pure action fluff, but when it's done to the point where it's fun and engaging. This wasn't. Any fun or intrigue that the franchise once had has been drained, and the results reflect on that. The story is non- existent, the performances are nothing special, and the film's running time is lengthy, feeling bloated and excessive. Remember, bigger and louer doesn't always mean prouder.<br/><br/>First, let's start with the story. Well, there isn't one much to begin with. The Pirates are basically on search for the Fountain of Youth. And yes folks, that is seriously it. You'll have the occasional pratfalls and drawn-out fight sequences, but for the most part, that's it. And do they find it? I think you can figure that one out. I just don't get it. After three movies, that is the best story they can come up with? Why not embark on something more fascinating, or have a few twists here and there. Instead, it's just a rehash of the films, and not exactly the best one either.<br/><br/>The performers? Everyone's pretty much the same. Johnny Depp plays the eccentric, occasionally irritable protagonist, while Penelope Cruz is the snappy love interest, who bats her eyes and looks pretty. Geoffery Rush is well... Geoffery Rush. <br/><br/>What about the eye candy? Action is action. I don't care if you have a character doing ninety backflips in a row. It's just staged material that tries to be as slick and stylistic as possible, but comes across as middle-of-the-road and tiresome. And the scenery, it is nice to look at, and for sitting through all the credits, and even being a skilled observer, this does look like an expensive movie. However, there's nothing new to look at. Actually, I think the earlier films had a more sleek design.<br/><br/>Now the common question everyone has, the 3D. In all honesty, I personally think it was useless. Yes, you have the typical ""gotcha"" moments, but there was no sense of depth. I think it was just such a waste to use perfectly good cameras on the tired third dimension. 3D just did not work with this movie. <br/><br/>DBOX. After 3D and IMAX, this is allegedly the new theatrical format. I must say, it doesn't disappoint seeing as how the chair is in sync with the audio (it vibrates, moves side to side, or ascends or descends the viewer), however, there's always room for improvement. Still, I wasn't exactly the happiest camper paying $22.75 for a bloated picture that went nowhere, a tried 3D format, and seats that while good, still leave a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Boom. Boom. Boom. And... it's in 3D. If that gets your heart racing, then by all beans see this movie. Actually DBOX it. Then you'll be ""in the movie"". I'm sorry, I'm all for enhancements in technology, but when the story and acting is sacrificed, the whole movie suffers. I hope this seriously is the last installment. The series is just getting more and more tired with each progression.<br/><br/>On a side note: The after-credits sequence is a disappointing one. I sat through and watched all the credits and waited for a nearly one minute scene that was rather unnecessary and completely useless."
"andreykorzh","4","1","2","20 May 2011"," Just plain dumb
","What a boring/silly movie it was, seriously, I should have left in the very beginning. My overall impression was that the producers were so in rush to release it by June (as the first summer blockbuster) to cash in on it that they didn't really have time to think on a storyline or character development. <br/><br/>For me it's quite funny to observe how everyone tries to be politically correct and have the cultural minorities represented in every movie – in and out of context. After seeing Afro-American pirates and mermaids I knew there were some Asians missing, and some minutes later – there you go – two Asian pirate-characters popped up. <br/><br/>The movie itself felt like a boring bus ride – no novelty, every thing was done and seen before hundreds of times. Depp looked like a loner abandoned by Bloom and Knightly who probably got fed up by this never ending pirate story. He is really a captain of a sinking ship. In a nutshell, it was just plain dump, stupid if you want. I understand it's a fiction, but the escapes and the fights were so unrealistic and unbelievable that it made me even more disappointed and left feeling deceived. Only 10 year old could buy that. Seriously – a man is capable of bending a palm tree for 30 degrees with a rope while standing on a top of another palm tree and then using it as a catapult to fly like a rocket-man?<br/><br/>If you have kids – they might enjoy it, if you're looking for a few laughs – go watch ""Bridesmaids"" instead. P.S. what's sad is that for sure there will be a new instalment with lonely Depp in it...and it will suck just like this one."

"blackmambamark","5","1","2","20 May 2011"," A script so bad that it made Jack Sparrow boring...
","Much like the 'Survivor' series, Jerry Bruckheimer just doesn't know when to call it quits with his projects. 'At World's End' is without a doubt one of the worst third installments I've ever seen. One would figure he would stop there. But why? Two of these pirate films are within the top 10 highest grossing pictures of all time. And that's what making movies is all about right?....making money? Well, with two of your main supporting actors gone, (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly), you obviously need to introduce NEW characters for Jack Sparrow to pinball around with on screen. Enter Penelope Cruz.....who i kid you not, contains more wood in her character than Keira Knightly. And no, that was not a sexual reference. I actually dreaded every scene she was in. She could have died halfway through the movie and i would not have cared. And the character who i guess is suppose to replace Orlando Bloom, was even more boring. He had absolutely zero stage presence. He looked more like an extra that they decided to make one of the leads at the last second.<br/><br/>But i do not blame these actors......i blame the terrible writing. Because there is no depth to any of these characters. I remember the first pirates' film, and how fun it was to watch, and how entertaining these characters were. Now it's just a bunch of non sense. Dare i say that the writing is so bad that even Jack Sparrow was boring? Yes, i will say that because it's true. Just because you have him swing from a chandelier, doesn't mean it's the same Jack Sparrow. Where were his funny little comments? His quirky/confident sense of humor? My guess is that it sunk somewhere within the third installment. If you're reading this and shaking your head saying 'That can't be true'.....yes, it is. I didn't think it was possible either.<br/><br/>And speaking of nonsense, the storyline. For starters, the bad guy is a man named 'Blackbeard'. Who has the ability to control stuff with the wave of his hand. Much like a jedi. But what separates him from being a jedi is......in Star Wars, they actually explained how they were able to move stuff. Whereas in this movie, they just did it because it looked cool and didn't even care to explain how he's able to do these things. That's just one example from the laundry list of loose plot outlines this film has.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.....good lord this was boring. This series has gone from ""Can't wait to see the next one"", to ""Oh, they're making another one"", to now ""Ah, who cares"". But knowing Jerry Bruckheimer, this probably won't be the end. And that makes me sad......what a waste of 250 million."
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","2","20 May 2011"," Another one that reboots what seemed to be a dead franchise
","¨What can I say Gibbs? It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy! ¨<br/><br/>The fourth film of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has finally arrived and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I was reminded why I had grown to love Jack Sparrow so much after the previous two sequels had lowered my expectations a bit. I've enjoyed all four movies, although none has topped the original one. The good thing about On Stranger Tides (the title taken from Tim Powers' novel which this film is loosely based on) is that it's the closest and most similar to Gore Verbinski's first film The Curse of the Black Pearl. The following sequels seemed to get more complicated and loose some of the focus of what made the first film so great: the characters. On Stranger Tides goes back to the basics and has a much simpler story reminding us that there is no need to complicate the plot when the truly entertaining thing about these movies are the characters. One may argue that two of the most important characters are missing in this film: Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner, but in my opinion Jack Sparrow and Barbosa are truly the central characters. This film lets us focus entirely on Sparrow and that is fine enough with me, while Barbosa takes an interesting and comical approach in this movie. Screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio are back for the fourth time and I'm glad they decided to keep things much simpler and entertaining. This time around the man that was missing was the captain of the original three Pirate movies, Gore Verbinski, who was replaced by Rob Marshall (director of Nine and Chicago). I must admit this is my favorite Rob Marshall film now and the second best in the franchise.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back again for another adventure. When his friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally) is about to be hung in London, Jack shows up to rescue him, and in his possession he has the map to the fountain of youth. While in London he hears a rumor that Jack Sparrow is looking for a crew for his new ship. But that can't possibly be true because he is Jack Sparrow and he doesn't even own a ship. It appears a woman from Jack's past is behind this, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a con-artist who will do anything to get Sparrow to take her and her father, Blackbeard (Ian McShane), to the fountain. Sparrow apparently still has feelings for her, but he doesn't really want to take them, so he is forced on board the Queen Anne's Revenge anyway. The ship is protected by zombies who obey Blackbeard's every command, but that isn't Sparrow's only worry: the waters are infested by dangerous mermaids who lure the sailors into the deep sea to be eaten. Blackbeard is an evil man, as one of his Christian missionary prisoners, Phillip (Sam Claflin) points out to him. Angelica is worried about a prophecy that her father will soon be killed by a one legged man, and that's why she's in such a rush to get to the fountain before anything happens to him. Sparrow has no intention in saving Blackbeard. Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) is also after the fountain of youth, although he isn't a pirate any more. Now he is working for King George and his men. So the race to the fountain of youth begins with several dangers on its way.<br/><br/>This film is character driven, the story really doesn't have to be all that complicated and that is fine with me. It's purely entertaining and fun. Jack Sparrow is his usual self again and I just couldn't get enough of him; he is always great and funny. Out of the four films this is probably the least funniest. I didn't laugh a whole lot like I remember laughing in the other movies, but I still had a great time with the action and adventure. Geoffrey Rush is probably the funniest character in this movie showing a different side of Barbosa. Newcomers Sam Claflin as Phillip and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena seem to be the next Will and Elizabeth for the franchise, although they didn't get too much screen time. My least favorite character was probably Angelica, I didn't like her character at all. Ian McShane played a decent villain. The best thing about On Stranger Tides is that the film centers on Jack Sparrow and we get to see plenty of him. The action sequences are really well choreographed and the visuals are great. The scenery is also beautiful. Before this film I wasn't so excited about seeing another Pirates movie, but this one left me wanting more. This is not one of those intellectual films, but it is what a summer popcorn movie should be like. It's not perfect at all, but it is entertaining and reminded me a lot of the original.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"campkllyrsf-1","7","1","2","20 May 2011"," ON STRANGER TIDES treads no new waters
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is quite a misleading title in many ways. First off, the movie no longer takes place in the Caribbean. While it never actually says which bodies of water this movie takes place in, the two countries involved are England and Spain, so it's safe to say we've moved to the Mediterranean Sea. And second, ON STRANGER TIDES treads nothing but familiar waters.<br/><br/>One thing that OST does do that the previous trilogy did not was to make Jack Sparro—sorry. Captain Jack Sparrow—the protagonist of the film. Take a moment and think: Who was the main character in THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL? It wasn't Jack; it was Will Turner. Will was on a journey to save Elizabeth, and Jack was merely his means to an end. Jack was never really a good guy. He's a pirate, after all. He's out for himself and toys with the characters actually involved with the story for his own personal amusement, only to succumb to his conscience and help save the day. But having Jack as an outside character—with us not knowing his ultimate intentions until the very end—was what lead him to be one of the most recognizable characters of this generation. But he's not a protagonist. <br/><br/>Not all of Captain Jack's charisma is gone. He's still an entertaining character, but the mystery of what he's going to do next just isn't there anymore. I can't really blame Depp for this, as he pulls off Sparrow like he was born for it. But the writers just to have put him in a spot where he doesn't belong. Jack's intentions still aren't clear from the get-go, but the movie sets it up to be his story. And that causes some narrative problems. <br/><br/>The movie itself is easily the worst of the series. To put that in perspective, I LOVE all three previous movies. Even AT WORLD'S END I adore. They're this generation's INDIANA JONES. While some may say it's better than 2 or 3, it doesn't really hold true to the original. <br/><br/>Story-wise, it's pretty straightforward. Multiple groups of people are trying to find the Fountain of Youth for their own reasons. We're just seeing who's going to get there first and who's going to get what they want. Simple as that. But, as Captain Jack says so eloquently in one of his many clever, fourth wall-breaking comments, ""It's not so much the destination so much as the journey."" Too bad the journey isn't all that interesting. <br/><br/>While the trailer points out both zombies and mermaids, only the mermaids hold any plot significance. The zombies are there because. . . well, why not? The first movie had a crew that turned into skeletons in the moonlight, and the second and third movie had a crew of mutated humans who looked like sea monsters. So why not make the crew of the bad guy's ship ""zombie-fied""? I will say, though, the mermaid scene was pretty damn brilliant. Too bad it's the most original and interesting part of the film, and it comes at about half-way in. <br/><br/>Probably my biggest complaint is that many things that happen in OST just seem to be far too reminiscent of the original movie. The first escape scene is far too much like the one in the first movie, and the first sword fight is far too familiar to that of Sparrow vs. Turner—they even fight up on planks on beams of the roof just like in the first movie. Even the final battle takes place in a cavern with rays of light coming down in patches from the holes all around. It's all too familiar and very uninspired—not to say it isn't enjoyable, but it's nothing new. Other than the mermaid sequence, nothing stands out. There's no fight with people morphing back and forth from skeletons. There's no fight on a rolling water wheel. There's no fight on ships trapped in a whirlpool. <br/><br/>One thing the movie never does is become bad. It's just disappointing how mediocre it ends up being. The movie is still enjoyable and has a lot of that humor from the original three. The characters are still fun to follow, and the locations are gorgeous. But it just doesn't go on past decent most of the time and never beyond good. Is it worth checking out? Yeah. Despite my negative criticisms, the movie's still fun to watch. Just don't expect the same magic that the first three had."

","So last night around 1 a.m. me and a couple of friends got the spontaneus idea to go and watch P.O.T.C. 4 (Premiere night). Withing twenty minutes i booked the tickets , we hoped into my car and were on time for the 1:20 a.m. play ! It couldn't have been a better night :)<br/><br/>Firstly , if any of you were worried that the fact that Bloom(Will Turner) and Keira Knightley(Elizabeth Swann)not playing would somehow make the movie worse.. then just don't ! The movie was perfect without them ! They were good in the previous three but they just didn't belong in this one and i can guarantee that you won't miss them at all!<br/><br/>The cast was well picked and everyone's performance was superb..Also many ""big names"" appear in this movie, but i will mainly talk about Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica(Penelope Cruz). When i first saw Penelope in the trailer i, for no particular reason got the idea that i will not like her in the movie .. but she totally proved me wrong. She fitted her character perfectly and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing her role. Blackbeard was also ""awesome"". He brings out the "" I am the pirate that all pirates should fear"" kinda vibe with his deadly black humor and beastfull actions ,without falling into the "" I AM SO EVIL HAR HAR "" trap. Really quick here.. i personally loved and couldn't take my eyes of the mermaid and the the little romance embed in the plot (Watch what people say so that you don't fall into wrong conclusions).<br/><br/>The movie was also more action packed than the previous movies i believe , with Jack once again showing us how creative , funny and plot twisting he can be by multitasking a thousand things at once !<br/><br/>The VFX (Visual effects) were there , taking my breath away every know and then (but mainly because i am into that stuff) but i am pretty sure they will get you jumping on your seat as well !<br/><br/>Soundtrack was similar to the previous movies but remade and as always fitted the scenes perfectly , making everyone in the theater wanting to draw their non existing sword :D<br/><br/>Plot was OK , nothing complicated( and by that i mean it wasn't Inception... but it also wasn't F&F ) but still had a lot of twists and turns that will make you go AaaaaAaaa! <br/><br/>As for the 3D.. it depends on how you think of it. If you are one of those guys that take their glasses off , don't see a big difference and then decide that 3D is awful then got watch it in normal ^^ If like that little difference that only strikes the back of your mind then i guess the 3D was OK-ish.<br/><br/>So !!! You liked the previous 3? GO watch it ! You are not a big fan of the series? STILL.. GO WATCH IT ! 9/10 will leave the Theater with a huge smile on their face.. and if they wait till the credits end.. an even bigger smile! (o.O) P.S. The mermaid's beauty will bring tears in your eyes!"

The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking) .<br/><br/>BUT what shocked me most is ,in the latest installments was the loss and disappearance of a few characters , such as "" will and Elizabeth "" , and the crew of the black pearl , and tia dalma, in which makes a question hover around my head ( what in the world happened to them ?? )so as a result it might be considered as a critical down fall to the movie . or perhaps a new story line ??? <br/><br/>all in all , it's a great night out with friends or family to watch this movie .<br/><br/>my review is 9/10 so all of you fans of Johnny Depp , i have one thing to say to you : IT'S A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME DRINK UP ME HEARTIES , YO HO !!!"

","So it is 2011 and finally we got ourself another Pirates Of The Caribbean movie. The movie starts in London with the probably most iconic movie character today Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp again delivers with his portrayal of the swashbuckling pirate Captain Jack Sparrow with some great humor and several well thought one liners. Although I do feel that some of his jokes felt that they were used before, fans of Jack will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>Jack is on a quest to find the mythical fountain of youth. But he is not the only one. On the same path are also the British Empire (party led by the newly pointed privateer Captain hector Barbossa), The Spanish Kingdom and the infamous Black Beard with his daughter Angelica who was Jacks lover in the past. Geoffrey Rush excels as the retired pirate without actually loosing the pirate swagger and mannerisms. He steals every scene including the ones with Jack. Ian Mcshane on the other hand is not actually bad as Black Beard but as far as I know the story behind this person, Mcshane was not so terrifying at all. Penelope Cruz as Angelica was a perfect match for Jack Sparrow and she did an excellent job of portraying a heartbroken former lover of Jack. <br/><br/>But, people who were hoping to be free of a new romantic Will-Elizabeth tale were sadly disappointed. Again we have 2 characters who were flat on their performances and I did not care if they died or lived. So in conclusion Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Strangers Tide was a great picture. The action scenes were great, the story was also less complicated then the last two films and the lenght of the movie was also adequate. Not as good as the first film but better than the last two. Not a bad movie to start the summer season! <br/><br/>8/10"
"Fields201","7","1","2","20 May 2011"," And Really Bad Eggs....
","Upon hearing the announcement for Pirates of the Caribbean, I had to ask myself: ""Is this a way to milk the franchise some more or was it to redeem themselves for the horrid At World's End?"" After much pondering, I'm going to say both. Does the fourth one make up for their last abomination or has the cow's udder had finally fallen off?<br/><br/>First and foremost, the Pirates is about fun and what imagination is brought to the screen. This time, the imagination is bent on finding the Fountain of Youth. It's apparent right from the very first frame, and we are constantly reminded about the Fountain Youth from Scene 1 to Scene End. It's said in every sentence of dialogue between characters. I have expected a narrator to say in every scene, ""And so our heroes search for the Fountain of Youth..."" in case we the stupid audience has forgotten about what they were after. <br/><br/>The film pits Captain Jack Sparrow pretty much forced to find the Fountain of Youth against his will by his ex-girlfriend Angelica and her father Captain Blackbeard (played by Ian McShane, and I enjoyed every scene he was in), and meanwhile, Captain Barbosa (once again played by Geoffrey Rush in his memorable performance) and his crew. I'm not really sure what their motivations are for finding the Fountain of Youth. Captain Jack just wants his Black Pearl back, and the rest, well, I guess they just want eternal youth. <br/><br/>Along the way there is swashbuckling, mermaids who kill people, zombies, bad people, and banters between Captain Jack and Captain Blackbeard. I must say the actions sequences this time around are creative, and I would be lying if I said that they weren't thrilling. The first half of the film kinda dragged, but it picks up once they find the mermaids. However, it's like a trek through the jungle, and nobody really gets lost and they just happen to stumble onto the Fountain of Youth later on. As a friend of mine pointed out, that at least in At World's End, their journey seemed to be more deadly. They nearly froze to death and almost doomed. The stakes didn't seem to high on this one, other than being attacked by fish and Spaniards. <br/><br/>Another problem I had with this one is the direction. For a summer blockbuster, the scenes just felt a little slow moving, and the establishing of each scene almost made me not care of what the scene was going to be. The writing was good, and I think that's what saved it. <br/><br/>So why did I like this one? I just enjoy Johnny Depp's performance of Captain Jack Sparrow this time, and Rush's performance as Barbosa. I also really enjoyed Captain Blackbeard. The action scenes (though sometimes just come out of nowhere) kept me from falling asleep at the slow parts, and at least the film didn't feel like it was all over the place like its two predecessors. It has a clear focus, at least, and I liked how it doesn't stray far from that other than the needless romantic subplot between the clergyman and the mermaid.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the franchise, then you are going to see this anyway. I'm not sure if the film will make more fans or not, but it's enough excitement to warrant my butt in the multiplex in the next installment whenever that comes out, savvy."
"cherienduane","8","1","2","19 May 2011"," I enjoyed it
","Being a long time Johnny Depp fan some say I am a little biased towards his work but I have enjoyed all four installments of the Pirates franchise. The latest installment is not my favourite but still very entertaining.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the toning down of Captain Jack Sparrows personality, I am unsure why that was done.<br/><br/>Being mostly set on land bought the story back to reality while introducing some new characters who did not take over the whole movie as they seemed to do in the past two.<br/><br/>I would probably not recommend this movie for the very young as there were a few scenes which gave me a little fright but in all I recommend seeing this movie with an open mind and no expectations of seeing anything relating to the past three."
"faisal_khatib","7","1","2","19 May 2011"," This may not be the best installment but it is surely not the worst.
","Disney chooses to scale it down. How much bigger can the series get they said. A complete rebootback to basics. And that's what I like about this movie. A lot simpler but entertaining at the same time like how the original 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' was which I adore more than the other two installments.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow (There Should Be A ""Captain"" In There Somewhere); the swashbuckling pirate nailing the role once again with Ian McShane making his Pirates debut as Blackbeard; the villain in this installment who even though does justice to the role but isn't able to fill the mighty shoes of Bill Nighy (who played Davy Jones in the previous installments). Kevin McNally plays the ever faithful and equally funny sidekick Gibbs and Geoffrey Rush does a fantastic job yet again as Captain Barbossa though this time with a wig. Penélope Cruz as Angelica is rather impressive; a little feisty but easier on the eyes though with her rather underdeveloped character, she lacks the screen presence that Keira Knightley had. Honestly all the new characters seemed that way which was disappointing. Sam Claflin as Philip could have been utilized better while Astrid Berges-Frisbey as the Mermaid Syrena was awkward to say the least because she hardly had anything to do and the fact that she was artistically naked seemed to excite some people in the theatre. More could have been done with both those characters and the same could be said about Blackbeard who seemed a little forced and cliché. In fact quite a few scenes in the beginning of the movie were predictable, something you wouldn't expect from Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>The rather uncomplicated story starts off a little slowly picking up pace somewhere in the middle taking the viewers on a vivacious fun ride. The mermaid scene is by far the highlight of the movie for memermaid sharks/vampires as my sister put it. The cinematography, graphics, sets and costumes are immaculate while the action sequences are exhilarating. The background score is a little unoriginal and loud in some scenes though did add to the complete pirated package. The supporting small characters were nonexistent unlike the other installments which was a rather big disappointment while Orlando Bloom (who played Will Turner) interestingly wasn't missed at all.<br/><br/>Rob Marshal has done a better than expected job as a first time Pirates director making a flawed but still fun movie. Even though this is claimed to be a reboot of the series, comparisons do crop up and this may not be the best installment but it is surely not the worst."

","I watched the movie today in 3D. There are moments of magic in the movie that simply take your breath away. Was the 3d worth it and good- answer is yes...there are many scenes in which the effects are enhanced by use of 3D technology.<br/><br/>Geoffrey rush(barbosa) is superb as usual. Johnny Depp is his usual quirky self and Jack sparrow rocks. Penelope adds some freshness and feminity to the franchise(though I hear that she was pregnant while the movie was being filmed). There are many sub plots and little love stories within the main storyline which keep us interested.<br/><br/>I cannot understand why the critics and other pedestrian review sites(RT) are giving the movie a mauling and ? were they paid or were they in love with skinny lizzy or orlando blooper"
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","3","13","17 May 2011"," More serviceable than sunken treasure
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back and after avoiding a gaol sentence through his friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally) he's taken before King George II and asked about finding The Fountain of Youth. Sparrow has a map but the King wants him to work with Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in finding it before the Spanish do. Jack escapes and discovers that someone has been impersonating him. It turns out to be an old flame of his, Angelica (Penélope Cruz). She claims to be the daughter of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and they're crew is after the Fountain of Youth as well. Taken onboard their ship the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack is forced under the tyranny of Blackbeard and his telekinetic powers to help with their expedition. Meanwhile, Barbossa is using Gibbs as a guide to locate the fountain first because he has a personal vendetta against Blackbeard. <br/><br/>The fourth Pirates film is more serviceable than sunken treasure. Rob Marshall has taken the directing reigns over from Gore Verbinski for the first time. His film offers everything you've come to expect from the franchise and not a whole lot more. With each additional entry in a series it becomes increasingly difficult to develop the remaining characters in new and meaningful ways. This is why most trilogies die by their third feature. On Stranger Tides is a film of fleeting moments. It makes little effort to take its characters or audience to new places. And yet it's still occasionally rousing because of the slick handling of the set pieces and improbable acrobatic stunt work. There are some memorable ones here, most notably a shore side battle with some supernatural mermaids, throwing buccaneers into the air. And when Hans Zimmer's marvellous score begins to swell, it's difficult to resist. But at a ridiculous 135 minutes these action pieces are posturing as a narrative that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This is a series that was adapted from a theme park ride after all and it plays out in a similar fashion. That said there is far too much time is spent in a single location, when they actually reach the island containing the fountain. But surely the most bizarre thread in the plot involves a marginalised missionary character and his relationship with a captured mermaid. It gives way to some highly transparent Christian-redemptive messages that don't fit with how comical the rest of the movie is. Finally, the film is capped off by a rather abrupt ending, which inevitably means that Pirates 5, 6, 7 and Son of Sparrow are on their way. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, for a film of this budget there are some grating technical problems. The film is meticulously detailed, authentically visualising the period with lavish costumes and locations. But this is offset by some poor photography, with scenes that are badly lit and far too dark and muggy. It's a problem compounded by the useless 3D glasses, which are notorious for absorbing the light and colour out of any film. Save yourself the extra dollars and a headache and see the film in 2D because at this length the third dimension is more nauseating than dazzling. At least the most significant part of the Pirates formula is still intact. Captain Jack Sparrow is still one of the most enjoyable characters from films of this kind and Depp is in top form. The sporadically witty script provides him with some very funny dry humour. Towards the end of the film he tells Angelica: ""If you had a sister and a dog...I'd choose the dog"". Rush is a great sport again; very charismatic as Barbossa and Penélope Cruz has some nice chemistry with Depp, even though the back- story shared between their characters is underwritten. Ian McShane is also strong, providing some very menacing support as Blackbeard. Look out for Australian model and actress Gemma Ward too as a mermaid with some serious bite. This is a pretty safe entry that provides everything that younger fans have been expecting. The formula still works but it never reaches the heights of the first movie, which lived and breathed off its originality. Surely Disney realise that they're running out of air."
"Leofwine_draca","4","1","3","14 January 2014"," More CGI nonsense
","Just when you thought that the endlessly bloated PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy had finally finished, along comes yet another blatant exercise in money-grabbing by Disney. By now, half of the original cast have bailed, leaving the shameless Johnny Depp to headline things in another overlong, over-boring adventure.<br/><br/>This time around, Depp teams up with a stilted Penelope Cruz in search of the fountain of youth, or some such thing. It's a pirate-fantasy re-run of INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, with Ian McShane taking over from Sean Connery as the larger-than-life elder. Sadly, the wishy-washy storyline is simply an excuse for endlessly dull action sequences and pretty but insubstantial special effects.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of these films, not even the first, which I found to be a soulless and bloated Hollywood blockbuster, but ON STRANGER TIDES really takes the biscuit."
"Desertman84","8","1","3","21 October 2012"," It Suffers From Franchise Burnout
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fantasy adventure film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Gore Verbinski, who had directed the three previous films, was replaced by Rob Marshall, while Jerry Bruckheimer again served as producer.It features Johnny Depp,Penélope Cruz,Geoffrey Rush,Ian McShane and Kevin McNally.<br/><br/>In the film, which draws inspiration from the novel On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers, Captain Jack Sparrow is joined by Angelica in his search for the Fountain of Youth, confronting the infamous pirate Blackbeard.Crossing paths with the enigmatic Angelica, he's not sure if it's love-or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the ""Queen Anne's Revenge,"" the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past. <br/><br/>The film is shorter and leaner than the previous film of the series,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End; but it runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non-stop barrage of noisy action sequences.There is fun to be had and it's exciting to see Captain Jack Sparrow on the big screen again but the overall production suffers from franchise burnout despite the presence of Penelope Cruz and the fine performance of Ian McShane."

"XweAponX","Null","1","3","19 August 2011"," On Stranger Tides: Back to being about Pirates
","This film is as good as the Original ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" - I never liked the story arc that followed Curse of the Black Pearl, it was about everything but Pirates. Sea Goddesses, Flying Dutchman (With the wrong Captain, Davey Jones was not captain of the Flying Dutchman, Vandervecken was), the three original Pirates films were the story of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann- Curse of the Black Pearl was complete in itself, I always thought by adding all these sequels, they were stretching for a story. It was all too much, too fantastic, and not wholly as enjoyable as the first adventure.<br/><br/>Not so here: This 4th installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, brings the focus back to a Pure Pirate Adventure, and with the departure of Swann and Turner ""At Worlds End"", Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio were free to tell further stories about Captain Jack Sparrow, with the help of novelist Tim Powers, Disney actually purchased the rights to his book and worked with him, as opposed to James Cameron's outright theft of Poul Anderson's 1957 Hugo award winning short story ""Call Me Joe"" (Which became Avatar). This merger of a 20-year old novel and new characters from the franchise, and the acknowledgment thereof, makes me hope for Hollywood Writer/Directors who would borrow plots and characters from well known books and try to get away with it ""scott free"".<br/><br/>The threads from the Novel meld into the already laid out story of Jack Sparrow, which we have been hearing since the first film in the franchise- Kevin R McNally, as ""Gibbs"" has been Keeper of Jack Sparrow's Continuity since the first film.<br/><br/>This film injects a new villain into the Pirates Universe: Blackbeard, as played by the great character actor Ian McShane. McShane epitomizes all of the portrayals of Blackbeard and other evil pirates in pirate movies back to Basil Rathbone in ""Captain Blood"".<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush once again plays Barbossa, who is ""Not a Pirate"", well, at first, in this story. Along with McShane as Blackbeard, Penelope Cruz is ""Angelica"" - Apparently ""Blackbeard's Daughter"". Or is she? The characters of Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, Angelica are all wonderfully duplicitous, not being ""evil"" or ""good"" characters, they are more like real people, who have both bad and good aspects. And so, the relationships between Jack and Barbossa, and Jack and Angelica leave you asking ""Who is fooling who here""? And in reality, we are the ones being fooled, by the convoluted plot which Elliott & Rossio have woven into the fabric of the original Powers' novel.<br/><br/>With the absence of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, This film focuses more on Jack's actual romance with Angelica, and there is also a side-romance which develops between the characters of Man of Faith ""Philip"" (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named ""Syrena"" (Spanish Actress Astrid Berges-Frisbey) - The resolution of which is difficult to understand, unless you pay attention to the sailors small-talk and speculations regarding the nature of Mermaids in this story.<br/><br/>Look for Cameos from Dame Judy Dench, Richard Griffiths and another appearance of ""Captain Teague"" (Kieth Richards). Stephen Graham (Band of Brothers, Snatch, Gangs of New York) is the Mandolin-playing Scrumm, another duplicitous character. The ""First Mermaid"" is played by Gemma Ward, the Mermaids are all Fashion Models - From the waist up.<br/><br/>Barbossa has developed a ""hobby"" of collecting Poison Frogs - There is a reason for every apparently idle scene in this film.<br/><br/>This film is back to the basics of what made ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" so good - It is a fresh story, less dependent on special effects and more on character interaction. The introduction of new Director to the Franchise, Rob Marshall, did not significantly alter the way the story was told- This is a story about Jack Sparrow, and all of the things that endeared that character to us from the first three films, are all here in ""quadruplicate"". Marshall's direction was less over-the-top than Verbinski's. But the best quality of this film is the usage of Hans Zimmerman's Score, including the ""Pirate Theme"" - Which was first used in the movie ""Gladiator"", all of the musical queues from the first three films are here, plus new cues with Spanish flavour which add a lot to the atmosphere of the film. This is a film of extremely high quality, as is the case with anything Jerry Bruckheimer produces."

","Gore Verbinski did an excellent job in re-creating The Ring for American audiences. He works well in dark surreal worlds, which worked well for the first Pirates of the Caribbean film. It's a classic, one of a kind action/adventure with the dark tones of a horror film.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest had a plot neither children or stoners could follow. It was an exhausting wait to get to the action sequences and then, when they did happen, it was so over-the-top, all believability, and therefore all invested suspense, was lost. You found yourself laughing at the film, not with it.<br/><br/>At World's End takes a turn for the serious and gets much darker. Much too dark for the kids who Disney sold the first two films to. As an adult, it's good twisted fun at the beginning but that soon fades out with the drama that comes with being the end of a trilogy.<br/><br/>Now, with a new director and some new characters mixed with the old, we have a new film in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, On Stranger Tides.<br/><br/>First, On Stranger Tides never gets any more strange than the last film but it is a whole hell of a lot better! Rob Marshal has shown here the balance a film needs to be fun for children without insulting the intelligence of the rest of the audience, in both action and comedy. The action stays in the ""fun"" zone, best compared to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, all things that happen outside of known physics are played along side a well deserved laugh. You laugh along with the film, the opposite of what the past films have been guilty of.<br/><br/>Also, this is the best live-action 3D film since Alice in Wonderland.

"rebrov85","7","1","3","22 May 2011"," Depp stars again as Captain Jack
","Having seen the previous 3 Pirates of the Caribbean films, I was always going to want to see the latest film in the series to see how it compared. Rob Marshall took over from Gore Verbinski as director to deliver Captain's Jack Sparrow's latest adventures on the high seas.<br/><br/>'On Stranger Tides' focuses on the competitive battle to find the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>The fountain has the power to transfer the remaining years of life from 1 person to another. To do this the fountain's water must be drunk using 2 chalices, 1 containing a mermaid's tear.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow, after rescuing his friend Joshamee Gibbs from certain execution in London, has got his hands on a map that can lead him to the fountain - making him a very useful commodity.<br/><br/>The Spanish fleet have also found clues to the whereabouts of the fountain and set off from Southern Europe in large numbers to find it. The British forces find out about this and desperate not to be shown up, hire Captain Barbosa (one of the few characters to make it into the new film from the previous trilogy) to lead a ship and beat the Spanish to the fountain.<br/><br/>We find out later that Barbosa is really spurred on by revenge to track down and kill Captain Blackbeard.<br/><br/>Barbosa may get what his want, as Blackbeard has received a supernatural vision of his future that states he will be killed by a one-legged man. Desperate to avoid this grisly fate, Blackbeard sets his sights on finding the 2 chalices and utilising the magic of the Fountain of Youth to extend his life.<br/><br/>Blackbeard's daughter Veronica (Penelope Cruz), who we find out has a romantic history with Jack, manages to capture Sparrow and take him aboard her father's ship as a member of the crew.<br/><br/>After failing in his attempts to overthrow Blackbeard as the captain of the ship by orchestrating a mutiny, Jack's life is threatened and he is forced to comply with Blackbeard's requests. Blackbeard then goes on a 'scavenger hunt' against the clock, trying to get his hands on the 2 chalices and a teardrop from a beautiful man-eating mermaid.<br/><br/>The film culminates with a 3-way battle between all of the 3 interested parties at the fountain itself. I won't spoil who wins! MY 2 CENTS The Pirates of the Caribbean series of films has always provided good family entertainment and the swashbuckling nature of pirate life will always capture the imagination of audiences from a variety of age-groups.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is, as we have come to expect, amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow. A charismatic and energetic performance ensures that he steals every scene he is in. His rapport with Angelica was also successful and the sexual tension between Depp and Cruz far exceeded that between Depp and Keira Knightly in the previous pirate films. Geoffrey Rush was great, reprising his role as the salty seadog, Captain Barbosa.<br/><br/>Ian McShane looked menacing as Captain Blackbeard, but sadly despite obviously lacking any form of real morality, the character never really became the menacing presence I feel a villain in such films should be. His reliance on the supernatural was never really demonstrated beyond rope tricks on his ship.<br/><br/>Shot against beautiful Jamaican islands, the film provided the perfect environment for the characters to perform their expertly executed action sequences. In my opinion though, the film relied too heavily on these sword fighting scenes, which I know is an odd statement to make about a film about pirates. I think a running time of 2 hours and 17 minutes helped make these stunts a tad repetitive, with maybe a little more variety required.<br/><br/>The use of the Spanish fleet also seemed pretty redundant and I don't know why they were really required in the film. The characters offered nothing in entertainment and I think we could have done without them.<br/><br/>The were laughs to be had throughout the film, mainly from Jack himself, but I think there was a void left that was previously filled by the pirate comic duo, Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook). This kind of comic relief wasn't addressed and could be why the constant tirades of action and sword-play became a tad tiresome.<br/><br/>MY RATING: 3/5 I enjoyed this compared to ""At world's end"" and would certainly recommend it if you enjoy the rest of the Pirates of the Caribbean series.<br/><br/>Depp is again in his element as Captain Jack but as with most films that run over 2 hours, you will find yourself drift off now and again due to the constant action scenes. I will always be interested in this film series as long as Depp sticks with it.<br/><br/>A good film, but unspectacular.<br/><br/>LIKE THIS REVIEW?

"archravenstorm","8","1","3","21 May 2011"," Solid pirate summer fun
","As a huge POTC fan geek I'm going to be biased, so I'll just say that the other five people I had with me on the first viewing all like it ""I enjoyed it"" - ""it was good"" were the comments I got over dinner after, and this was from people who may or may not have seen any of the other POTC movies. Had to do a fast synopsis for a few.<br/><br/>The good: For me, Depp holds his own in deliciously fine form through the film, and it's a relief to have lots of Jack, strong and sardonic in some places, fey in others, and as amusing as ever - with an equally excellent performance by Rush as Barbossa (good energy from both). Penelope Cruz turns in a believable performance as Angelica, and Depp and Cruz are a good fit. There's been some complaints about McShane being a less charismatic Blackbeard - but in the original book he is also portrayed that way - very bad, ruthless, but very intelligent. In the book he isn't some fire-breather of a person. Some pains are taken along the way to make sure the audience is carefully filled in, which I thought was funny as the producers were obviously taking care of all those bemoaning how confused they were during POTC3 - even though POTC 4 is pretty straightforward.<br/><br/>Lots of action and some high-energy fencing and escapes, balanced out with some down time. A lot gets crammed into the allotted time, but it's paced evenly. As rich-looking location and set-wise as any of the other POTCs. Thought the mermaid scene was impressive, spooky, even a nice haunting song that threads through the scene.<br/><br/>The bad: A couple of things could have been built up to than to more than they were, and the zombies while impressive didn't really do that much in particular, for me they made less of an impact that the sea critter men of POTC 2 and 3. But that's also true of the book the movie is based on (where it may be hard to tell you are dealing with a zombie). The subplot romance with the mermaid was a nice nod to mermaid folklore but it was just OK. And there is a bit of jerkiness or jumps in the narrative here and there that I thought were ""reaching"".<br/><br/>Was better in the second viewing as the new setting(s) and characters were expected and could relax into the film more - probably will see it again before it leaves theaters. The audiences I have been with were laughing and seemed to be enjoying themselves. In any case, think a lot of ""professional"" critics are ignoring all the good things about this film, like the fact that it's a good to very good film."

","Well, the good news is that Pirates 4 is better than Pirates 3. The bad news is that it is no better than Pirates 2, and probably not as good.<br/><br/>Let's look at the good and bad. It is entertaining and undemanding, excepting only a need for stamina - it is overlong. The story hangs together reasonably well (as long as you are prepared to overlook ""How did he know that was there?"" all the way through - Ponce de Leon's ship on top of a remote cliff, for a start off)). Depp's Sparrow is always entertaining company, and Blackbeard is also a welcome villain (although McShane's accent is a bit indecisive). Penelope Cruz never really catches fire, however, and Geoffrey Rush seems to be just going through the motions.<br/><br/>With the exception of a chase in London and a nocturnal mermaid-baiting expedition, there are no set pieces on the scale of the cavern swordfight in the first one, the waterwheel fight in the second, and the whirlpool battle in 3. That doesn't really matter, because the rest of what goes on is sufficiently entertaining - I particularly enjoyed the interplay, sketchy though it was, between the cleric and the conflicted mermaid. There are a couple of massed battles, but they don't achieve much - they are simply well-choreographed mêlées of a lot of blokes clashing swords about.<br/><br/>I will say that the film is very dark (my father complains about modern films being predisposed to darkness and muted colours, and I see what he means here). When things are light, the colours are vivid, but a lot of this film takes place at night, and the 3D specs darken things down still further. The 3D is at least live, not post-production, and is effective at times (especially underwater), but it is far from essential.<br/><br/>I'm glad to be spared Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but I missed the comedy relief pirates and soldiers.<br/><br/>And, while I enjoyed this one well enough, my memories of how excellent the first one was are still strong enough for me to say, ""I'm glad you recovered from number 3, but no more now, please."""

","It's more of the same - and that's really the problem. The first movie was fun and interesting but the two sequels that followed insisted on trying to top the first but all they delivered was crazy over the top CG madness that most found to be genuinely uninteresting. I was expecting better this time around even though I don't know why. Everything in the trailers screamed crazy cheese but I was hoping for the best. Instead, this movie delivers wall to wall self-consciously cheesy and idiotic moments. Why not just stay home and rent the last two sequels? This movie misses the fun but does go far beyond dumb.<br/><br/>It's too bad On Stranger Tides is such a miserable end to the franchise, and I do pray it IS the end.

"bob the moo","Null","1","4","21 September 2011"," Improves on the third film but is still just a lot of empty noise without enough fun
","I remember the first film in this theme-park-inspired franchise. I liked it. It was fun, didn't take itself too seriously and was as light and playful as the cowardly and comical Captain Jack. That was nearly a decade ago and a lot has changed since then. For one thing the franchise has to content with the fact that the third film was a terrible dog – plodding, dull, overly-serious and provided big action sequences that for all their cost didn't have a second of fun in them. I ignored On Stranger Tides in the cinema (as I did with the majority of the summer blockbusters this year) because I had no high hopes for it and no reason to spend nearly £20 to see those low expectations fulfilled.<br/><br/>On DVD it hurts less so I tried it here. On the positive side the film is better than the previous one. It seems to have recognised that it isn't some amazing sea-faring epic but just a silly piece of entertainment based on a theme-park ride. As a result it seems a little freer with itself and at times it seemed to suggest that my entertainment was something it had an interest in. Sadly it doesn't do this often enough or well enough to really lift it up to be a film worth seeing. Along with the less serious tone, the film delivers loads of action sequences with lots of special effects – they are large, they lit up the walls in my front room and they provided enough bass to make me happy with my choice of speakers. But that's about it because they are, like the film, dramatically empty. You never really feel peril for the main characters and there is little dramatic reason to care – so, while the effects and sets are expensive, the money is wasted as they do not have the content to make it work.<br/><br/>In terms of the writing, one problem is the transformation of Captain Jack into an indestructible superhero. Where once he seemed to be winging it, now he seems to be in charge; where once he appeared cowardly, now he rushes into danger. OK the words out of his mouth suggest otherwise, but the action doesn't. It makes it harder to like him and, while Depp's performance hasn't changed, the character certainly is a lot less entertaining than he originally was. Speaking of the cast, a few key names are absent but bigger ones are brought in. Cruz was potentially a nice bit of casting as she does have a passionate air about her and seems to be able to ooze sexuality with ease; sadly the film doesn't use her well and, although she looks good, she cannot find that spark – something I would have thought would have been so easy for actors like her and Depp to get. Rush returns and does his thing while McShane takes the role of the main baddie. Again this should have been an open goal but he is too one-note. He is still a good presence in the film but I'll take 30 seconds of his Swearengen over 2 hours of him here any day. Graham gets his exposure and payday and who could blame him – but he is capable of so much more than he does here. Richards shows up for an obvious and unfunny cameo while the rest of the support cast are either stuntmen or famous faces for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The fourth Pirates film is an improvement on the third – but sadly not by anywhere near the margin it needed to be. It mostly avoids being overly serious but yet it still isn't a great deal of fun to watch. The noise and effects mean the time doesn't drag but it is empty spectacle for the majority of the time and good chunks of it could have been cut to the benefit of the film (the priest and mermaid for example). It isn't absolutely awful by any means but it is bland, empty and nothing like the amount of rip-roaring summer fun it should have been. There will be a fifth of course, but event movies make money, but I really hope they can work out that simply spending more and more money on effects or putting more plotting into the film is not what made people enjoy the first one."

"cara-58","3","1","4","30 May 2011"," They just keep getting worse
","I was a huge fan of the first Pirates of the Caribbean (it was one of my favorite movies of all time), however, each successive movie has just gotten worse. While the second and third movies at least had some merit, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides has reached an all time low. It is apparent that the film makers are only interested in making money at this point.<br/><br/>I didn't really expect that much from this movie but I at least expected some good laughs, entertaining sequences, and good sword fights. This movie failed to even deliver that much. I found myself extremely bored half-way through and wishing that it would end already. The returning characters are just sad shadows of their former selves and the new characters are boring. My biggest problem was with the new portrayal of Barbossa, who is delivered by a seemingly bored Geoffrey Rush as a rather pathetic afterthought to the movie. Apparently, he is supposed to be this big scary fate for Blackbeard but he really only comes off lame. In fact, the characterization of him in this movie undermines his previously terrifying character in the first movie. He is no longer terrifying but now almost silly.<br/><br/>Blackbeard is not a particularly convincing villain. Most of his evil we seem to be told as background story, rather than actually being shown. He cannot hold his own against the original Barbossa, Davy Jones, or Lord Cutler Beckett. I had a hard time being convinced that he was even worth dealing with.<br/><br/>I did have a soft spot for Penelope Cruz as Angelica, if only because it was nice to finally have a girl that could keep up with Jack in sword-fighting and had an actual Spanish accent (the other Spainards were pretty unconvincing). She certainly tries to entertain, and for that I give her credit, but her storyline is based on a rather flimsy pretense (what the heck was the daughter of a pirate doing in a convent, anyway?) Against my better judgment, I kind of liked the clergy and the mermaid side-story but it didn't really add anything to the movie. It seemed to sort of be just a stand in for Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, without whom Pirates is just not the same. The sort of anonymous ""Spanish"" group who are sort of supposed to seem like the enemy had me scratching my head. Their part in the movie seemed so utterly pointless, I'm not sure why the film makers included them other than just to have more action.<br/><br/>A couple final issues: All the sword fighting was a sad repeat of the first three movies. It was incredibly obvious that the film makers had run out of ideas. You see almost the exact same moves as in the previous moves (fighting in the rafters, tripping enemies with a rope, etc). I know sword-fighting is sword-fighting but I can't believe that they made it that blatantly repetitive. Also, the funniest moments of the movie were basically those that were in the trailer. If you can boil the number of funny moments down to about two minutes, you know there is not nearly enough of them. Lastly, the ending of the movie was lame. We know that Jack has feelings for Angelica but the whole movie goes by and neither ever really act on them which is just plain frustrating. But that's Disney for you.<br/><br/>If you're a Pirates fan, you'll probably watch this movie no matter what I say (I know I would) but I doubt you'll get much out of it."
"TheSonomaDude","3","1","4","25 May 2011"," The Worst So Far, I Think
","POTC4 isn't really apart of the POTC saga. It seems like a spin off. It should have been called The Jack Sparrow Chronicles Part 1: On Stranger Tides. It really has no relation to the series.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to mention is that this film has a 150 Million dollar budget, which is strikingly lower then the rest of the franchise, but maybe for a good cause.<br/><br/>This film is 90% action scene after action scene after action scene. Every 5 minutes, Jack Sparrow is swinging from chandeliers, jumping off an exploding lighthouse (in slow-mo), jumping from treetop to treetop, or getting into sword fights on cliff sides. While it may seem exciting, it is surprisingly VERY boring. There were several scenes that made me almost fall asleep. We've seen all of it before, and we know whats gonna happen.<br/><br/>The story involves trying to find the famous Fountain of Youth. But it seems like the story and script was originally a National Treasure film, but they changed the script and put in pirates. When they finally get to the fountain, nothing is accomplished. Its just like ""we found it...lets fight!"" and another big action scene pursues.<br/><br/>In conclusion, its the worst one yet. If you wanna see it, fine, go ahead. But its definitely the last I wanna see of Jack Sparrow."
"david-2829","6","1","4","23 May 2011"," Good, not great -- does not have the repeatability of the original trilogy.
","Admirable attempt to create a new adventure in the Pirates canon with no egregious violations but certainly a host of minor infractions. It's fun, sometimes funny, with some favorite characters as well as a few new faces and succeeds at entertaining even as it falls short of it's venerable history.<br/><br/>First the GOOD: Johnny Depp, while not quite as out of balance or odd, still delivers the quirky pirate we've all come to love. Geoffrey Rush also reprises a favorite character with relish and aplomb. Ian McShane as Blackbeard has surprising presence and I enjoyed the mystery and intensity he brings to the role. Also good are a few good action scenes, some funny moments as Barbossa & Sparrow attempt a daring heist and are captured, and the interesting twist on mermaid folklore.<br/><br/>Another great moment was the inclusion of a true classic scene from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride - the ""Skeleton on the bed with a magnifying glass"". It was a joy to see they're still working in elements from the Disney ride that launched this billion dollar empire.<br/><br/>The NOT-SO-GOOD: The two primary offenders happen to be the dialogue and the land-locked conquest. First of all, this is a Pirates movie, and that should mean a lot of action on the sea, canons shooting, fighting and outmaneuvering and the mystery of discovery. Instead, we spent at least 3/4ths of the movie getting prepared to set sail, or searching for the Fountain of Youth. Oye, ye Land Lubbers!<br/><br/>The second major problem is the dialogue doesn't have the punch, or the comedy worked into the original. There is too much exposition about the quest, and everybody seems to already know where the Fountain is. Jack Sparrow is more coherent and succinct, with less meandering and fewer odd word choices. And I think we miss out on a lot of comic potential without the two bumbling sidekicks or a love triangle involvement.<br/><br/>The interaction between Sparrow and Angelica (Cruz) is never quite believable. We don't sense Jack actually pining for her, nor does Angelica seem any bit entranced by Sparrow. She is overly dedicated to her father for reasons not explained or believable. I can't believe this... but I miss Keira Knightley's internal struggles and wish Cruz had more of that conflict.<br/><br/>The movie definitely suffers from the lack of a true good guy (ie. Will Turner) and a true bad guy (ie. Davy Jones). This setup had allowed Jack Sparrow's self-serving nature to be showcased, moving on a whim to whichever angle served him best. In Pirates 4, Jack Sparrow has taken the ""good guy"" role, which doesn't fit him quite right. <br/><br/>CONCLUSIONS: While it's not a bad movie and I was happy to see it, this movie is going to be more sharply criticized for its shortcomings. Too much land-trekking, more mundane expository dialogue, too light on comedy and not enough discovery.<br/><br/>It's a fun ride, but not repeatably wonderful like the ""original trilogy"" (which is becoming a more common phrase isn't it?)"
"AnthonyWatkins","8","1","4","22 May 2011"," Pirates Franchise Reborn
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is full of new things. New director, actors, and storyline. After ""At World's End"" many people thought the series was over. However, Rob Marshall managed to renew one of the most successful movie franchises of all time.<br/><br/>The addition of Penelope Cruz really added to this movie. As Jack's opposite, she really shares some of the same ""skills and abilities"" Jack does. Blackbeard was also played perfectly by Ian McShane. I would even go as far to say that he is more intimidating of a vicious pirate captain than Barbossa was in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Overall, the new actors really helped this movie. You couldn't do any more with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's involvement in the series, so this is exactly what you needed if you wanted the series to continue.<br/><br/>As far as the length of the movie, it sure did not seem like a mere 2 hours and 17 minutes. That's not a bad thing, either. The last movie, ""At World's End,"" was only about a quarter of an hour away from 3 hours. (which it somewhat had to be because of the climatic battle that had to be at the end) I am saying that this movie had lots of action and plot contained in the shortest running time of all previous movies in the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very impressed with this movie. Captain Jack was his usual, witty, hilarious self. The witty lines, charm, and action-packed sequences propelled this film. It's like what people say, it seems to return to the style of the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" I definitely recommend watching this movie. And, with the Pirates of the Caribbean 5 script already finished, it appears we will see Captain Jack back before we know it."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is a terrific franchise as is the completely unsurpassable Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Having decided that my love of the other movies was sufficient to carry me through to also watching 'On Stranger Tides' at the cinema last night, I feel short-changed.<br/><br/>I suppose most of the familiar ingredients were there: Captain Jack (Brilliant – though very notably sober/sane); Mr Gibbs (fine support though clearly 'grease to the cogs' of this film), Barbossa (lost to an ocean of very unsettling English'pirate'esque accent/appearance, that I truly hated throughout), the gorgeous girl (by the end of the film, even I would have used the bullet), the dastardly villain (barely believable, but let's not dwell on it) cameo appearances, escape antics, quippy remarks and a very light sprinkling of supernatural mystery. However, and to quote and earlier Captain Jack himself, ""Why is all the Rum gone?"" Despite everything, and with a certain amount of personal hoping that the film might deliver by the end, it came up lacking. Looking back at it, in the cold light of morning (mourning perhaps) it felt like a penguin featurette from Madagascar. E.g. a perfectly watchable distraction of familiar friends and places, but ultimately a peripheral story of little significance.<br/><br/>Sorry Disney, we love Captain Jack and all his friends dearly, we want to see more of them and the are certainly worthy of continued investment, but you must do better!"

Everything seems dull, soulless, made just because it had to be made. The intense action we were accustomed with seems to have drastically decreased, laughter along with it while the story is mediocre at best.

","First the casting of main character is very awesome. I think Jonny Depp is most sexy man in the Hollywood. So he is very suitable for his character Captain Jack Sparrow. Second the plot was really exciting. Whoever watch this movie, they will surely enjoy this movie. Specially in fighting scene on the ship. Third I think the directing of Rob Marshall was great. His directing gives us a comfortable feelings during running times.<br/><br/>I enjoy watching this movie for 5 times. But when I saw this movie for5times, it wasn't boring.

","I loved the movie in every way, the action, the romance, the cast, the plot, etc. Even if Elizabeth and Will (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, respectively) aren't in the movie, at least we know their story from the previous movies. Plus, who doesn't like the relationship between Syrena and Philip (played by Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey and Sam Claflin, respectively). <br/><br/>Although, it would be great if they were in the next movie, and if Philip's fate was more clear, but other than that, it was a great film and it reminds me a bit like Catching Fire, The Lost Future, and a lot of other movies that I've seen and loved.<br/><br/>I don't mind flaws, as long as they aren't very big and noticeable. However, this movie could be better, like if the ending wasn't a huge cliffhanger, and other flaws. It probably deserves a 9, but for the relationship between Syrena and Philip, I'll be nice and give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides a 10."
"jamestheactor","8","0","1","27 April 2016"," A departure from the previous films, but still an adventurous, yet emotional adventure.
","It's a departure from the previous adventures. I had a feeling that Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly) would not be returning after the events of the third film, but it wouldn't be the same without Johnny Depp! The scene in the courtroom with Jack impersonating the judge is very amusing and I was surprised to see that Barbossa is now a Privateer. The following chase through London after is entertaining, but I would've preferred it if Jack and Mr. Gibbs had escaped. In that disguise, Angelica looked just like Jack! The way Jack confronts her never fails in its humour and the search for the Fountain Of Youth gets started really well. The ritual of the Fountain was not what I thought it would be: I originally thought that whoever drinks from the Fountain would gain eternal youth, but in actual fact two people drink from two chalices with one containing the tear of a mermaid. The drinker of the other chalices dies and ""donates"" their remaining years to the other drinker.<br/><br/>The effects are impressive and it got rather tense aboard Blackbeard's ship. During the mutiny scene, I agreed with Philip as he made his stand. Sam Claflin plays him convincingly and strongly. I'm also a Christian, though I've never thought anything linked to missionary. Blackbeard certainly had an evil presence. Ian McShane plays him well and his scenes with Jack are tense, but not without humour. The mermaid attack at Whitecap Bay is also tense, but Jack brings humour to the scene again when he falls off the tower. I was concerned for the mermaid Syrena from the moment I saw the front cover of the film. Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey plays her wonderfully and on the DVD front cover, she is holding onto Philip as if to say, ""Keep me safe."" I was pleased that Philip protected her as Blackbeard's crew journeyed to the Fountain. During that time, Syrena saw that Philip was not like Blackbeard's crew. Jack's meeting with Barbossa on Ponce de León's ship is also fun to watch - they try to keep the balanced ship stable as they discover that the Spanish have taken the chalices. Jack stealing the chalices is also a great scene and Barbossa's story of losing the Black Pearl is interesting as I was wondering what had happened to it.<br/><br/>I felt so sorry for Syrena when she was tied up and Philip apparently killed in front of her when Blackbeard saw that they had feelings for each other. It was like a knife through my heart. I thought Philip had been killed, but I was VERY relieved when it turns out that Philip is alive. His attempt to rescue Syrena is so moving, but I was annoyed when the Blackbeard's crew suddenly appeared, tied Syrena up again and forced Philip to go with them. The remainder the journey to the Fountain is inspiring, as are the effects, but I couldn't stop thinking about poor Syrena. The Fountain of Youth is certainly a sight that's not easily forgotten, and the confrontation between Barbossa and Blackbeard is entertaining. I was surprised when the Spanish arrived to destroy the Fountain and the climatic battle is fun to watch. I was relieved when Philip saved Syrena. I would've done the same but I was still unsure about how she felt about Philip. Blackbeard gets what's coming to him. I should've known Jack would switch the chalices so that Anjelica would end up drinking from the chalice containing Syrena's tear! <br/><br/>I've always found it tense when someone loving someone, but not knowing the outcome. Philip is injured during the battle, after freeing Syrena, he applies water to himself and Syrena appears before him in the water. It's a very sweet moment. Philip asks for her forgiveness, but I think Syrena had already forgiven him. She forgave him a long time ago. You can tell by the way she looks at Philip. She loves him and wants to give him the power to breathe underwater. Now THAT is a gift! Serena kisses Philip and takes him underwater. Philip and Serena together at last.<br/><br/>It seems that Blackbeard's evil has rubbed off on Anjelica as she states her hatred of Jack as he maroons her on island with a pistol containing one shot. However, that shot is quickly used as an attempt to kill Jack, which fails. I had a feeling Barbossa was going to return to piracy as he claimed Queen Anne's Revenge but the scene is still entertaining. Jack's meeting with Mr. Gibbs on a beach and his charm on explaining how he prefers to not know what moment will be his last never fails. I hope the Black Pearl gets restored to its original size."
"filipemanuelneto","5","0","1","13 April 2016"," A good movie, but with questionable plot options
","This film is the fourth of the saga ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". In this film, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), after an incredible escape from London, where he should be tried, sets sail in search of the legendary Fountain of Youth as a prisoner of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his alleged daughter, Angelica ( Penelope Cruz), a Spanish girl who angelic has only the name. Against them will oppose the Spanish and English navies, the latter being led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who now works for the English king. Directed by Rob Marshall, has screenplay by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and other collaborators.<br/><br/>There are certain films that are made in the name of art and because of challenge they represent. I think the first film of this saga was one of them. But there are many other that are made for profit only, and this was clearly one of them. Far from being very good or have the quality of its previous, it was sufficiently acceptable. The cast was up to, but Depp could no longer be as funny as in previous films. His character, despite the unpredictability, didn't surprised the audience who, knowing him better now, expects anything from him. The end of the participation of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, justified by the conclusion of the story of their characters in the previous film, may also have made this movie less interesting, especially considering the importance of their characters in previous films (it was their love that began all the story), how the absence of these characters breaks the link of this movie with the others and also the fruitful way they shared the scene with Depp and Rush. If the input of Penelope Cruz in the plot was planned to address this lack, then it failed miserably, despite the merits of the actress, who made her best efforts and proved to be a great romantic match for Jack Sparrow, thanks to the fiery and impetuous personality of her character. Equally surprising was Rush, who held the role of Barbossa, whom fate has now made king's privateer. Without a leg and with a wig that completely clashes with his appearance, Barbossa seems more than ever with Long John Silver. The major flaw of this film is the plot: not being able to continue the story that came from the previous films, the script created a whole new story which takes maybe some years after the action of the third film, and only kept some characters from that film. Its a legitimate solution, recurrent in sequels but questionable here, after three films where the plot maintained its unity. This film eventually clash with them as a black sheep in a flock of white sheep. Making a prequel to the first film maybe had revealed a more interesting idea, respecting plot's unity in the whole saga.<br/><br/>When this movie was announced, the audience waited eagerly. However, with a new plot, this movie became an ""alien"" in this cinematic saga. Despite this less positive note, the film is good and the actors deserved congratulations. We just have to understand that this film has almost nothing to do with the previous ones."
"wichio","7","0","1","15 October 2015"," Good but not great
","Remember those straight-to-video sequels Disney often releases. On Stranger Tides feels like one of them. By itself it may count with a great production and actually not a bad story to bring to film, but it doesn't really live up to the previous films. The original trilogy felt like that. A trilogy. Curse of the Black Pearl's story may not have much to do story-wise with the other two, but at the end, the three felt like a saga. This feels more like a stand alone film, which, have it been the first one to be released, it wouldn't have felt as bad as it does now.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story, it's not all that entertaining. While the first one brought a fresh piece to cinema, and introduced us to beloved characters in an epic adventure, the second and third one brought those characters to develop, finish personal business and get into new adventures. This one leaves everything aside going for a fresh start, not really giving much importance to where the characters were before, and bringing some new ones which don't really grow into us.<br/><br/>The mermaid sequence is the one worth watching in the whole movie. I wish the part with Ponce de Leon's ship would have carried us to a more epic battle, and I feel the same way about the part where Jack and Barbosa steal the silver chalices from the Spaniards. Which, BTW, the Spaniards work as an antagonist to all, Barbosa, Jack Sparrow, and Blackbeard, but in an attempt to reduce screen time and avoid saturating the story, they don't develop those characters (or at least one of them), and don't give them a motivation to go to the fountain, making all their role in the film feel a little off.<br/><br/>Aside from that Angelica and Blackbeard could be characters to look forward to in further films, and so are Philip and Serena. The cast of the fifth film has been announced and none of them are part of it. A film where all the major characters from the franchise have a worth part would be way too heavy, so if i had to choose, between bringing them back, or having more Will and Elizabeth, I would go with Will and Elizabeth any day. So yeah, stick with the original trilogy, but don't give this one the cold shoulder."
"SteveJames1967","8","0","1","13 October 2015"," New Blood in an Older Series
","Let's just say I was disappointed before the movie even started. To me the movie series wasn't all just Captain Jack. Pirates of the Caribbean isn't the same without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. It's also probably for the best. With all the same characters as the last it would run the risk of being the same movie over and over again. Penelope Cruz did add to the movie. I hate to say since I'm not a fan of her. This movie is just nothing without Johnny Depp. He makes the movie. Everyone loves Captain Jack for a reason. He's oddly charming, yet humorous and serious all at once. Nothing wrong with a few sword fights and new characters. Fresh blood in and old established series can be nice."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","0","1","7 October 2015"," Best of the sequels
","Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the odd one out in the quadrilogy (as there must be in any quadrilogy) but I think it's an overlooked gem, and is my second favourite of the franchise, after Black Pearl. Dead Man's Chest and At Worlds end had their moments (Davey Jones and his crew are a special effects highlight), but are so bombastic, overblown and convoluted to the point of freaking madness, it's nice to see a shorter, saner, more toned down sequel that ditches all the hooplah and gets down to what made the first one special. Also, it ditches Keira Knightely and Orlando Bloom in favor of some new characters to freshen things up. Knightley I always enjoy and somewhat missed, but I was damn happy to be rid of wooden faced Bloom, he's just such a buzz kill in anything but Lord Of The Rings. Hear that shrill sound on the wind? That's the furious cries of several million girls reading this and calling for my head on a stick for my comments about Bloom (believe me, I've explained my opinion on this to girls I've known in person, and the looks I've gotten could melt steel beams lol). Deal with it. There's still Johnny Depp, free from much of the CGI spectacle of the two previous ones and immersed in an enjoyable story, this time searching for the infamous Fountain Of Youth. Also out to find it is ex - villain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush can play this character for the rest of his career as far as I'm concerned, he's always a delight), now working for the King of England (Richard Griffiths in one of his final appearances). Penelope Cruz fares well as a fellow rapscallion out to find the fountain. I also fell head over heels for the stunning, eerie mermaid played by newcomer Astrid Bèrges. It's Ian McShane as Blackbeard, however, who steals the show. Ian has a presence that fills every frame and second of dialogue he's in, and he has a blast as the notorious pirate king, sporting eyeliner, the classic tricorner hat and a psychopathic attitude. I was just so pleased to find the sense of adventure restored in the franchise, an order out of the previous chaos of sorts. It's the sort of spirit that's owed to the legacy of the first movie, and the same spirit I hope to see from the upcoming fifth entry."

","Something about this movie i'll never understand...is why so many people disliked it. Sure, not enough to give it a less than average score, but still, significant enough to make me scratch my head.<br/><br/>Compared to the third movie, I felt this one came back to the root of pirate lore with a VERY simple ""go from A to B, go through C on your way back"" and things like the Fountain of Youth, the Spanish navi, mermaids and blackbeard. What could possibly go wrong? Specially when the previous movie had a plot so complex it could give Lord of the Rings a run for it's money.<br/><br/>This movie also took out the couple Will Turner and Elizabeth, which in the third movie, kinda stole jack's thunder way too much. this fourth movie allowed jack to have his shenanigans all the time. Although a little too much, but also gave some good character developtment to Blackbeard, his Daughter and even Barbossa, who knew.<br/><br/>In the end, I felt like this movie was redeeming for the previous. It started funny, ended funny, was epic (and funny) all the way through, still giving us that little taste of ""I want more"". And more we shall have, lets meet again at ""Dead men tell no Tales""."
"SammysMovies","7","0","1","9 March 2015"," Awesome as always!
","Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides is the fourth instalment in this franchise and it is definitely as good and entertaining as all previous films. <br/><br/>In this one, Jack is trying to get to the fountain of youth with a lot of other peoples including Black Beard played by Ian Mcshane. Then follows the usual awesomeness you would expect from a pirates film!<br/><br/>After the poor critics that received Pirates Of The Caribbean at world ends which I thought was really good but maybe the weakest of all four movies, this one had only one way to go and that's up. After 4 years On stranger Tides finally came out and it was fresh and inventive. It went back more to the routes of the first film which is considered to be the best. It was a fun entertaining Summer movie and that's why I think it's an awesome fun movie to watch. I Definitely recommend this one to anyone if you have not seen it yet.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next one(still a few years..)and I think this movie is excellent,definitely check it out! You won't regret!"
"Quinoa1984","5","0","1","14 November 2014"," Hey, he's Captain Jack Moneyrichardsparrowjet!
","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is a big McDonald's thing of the movies, where it comes slapped with the greasy paws of Jerry Bruckheimer and ready to sail off into matinée serial territory. This could be fine except that as each passing film goes on (with a couple of minor exceptions to scenes I'll mention) the quality of the series lessens with each film. It also doesn't help that this time the franchise loses one of the interesting things going for it in Gore Verbinski's visual/storytelling sensibility. While he ended up making parts of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End cumbersome with super-sized plots not worth much (albeit parts of Dead Man are a lot of fun, and the Davy Jones Locker segment of 'World's' is a perfect slice of surrealism), Rob Marshall just doesn't really have it in him to take the series where it could go.<br/><br/>This latest effort, On Stranger Tides, misleads in its title (not too strange), and is still stuffed with over-plotting with double crosses and other shenanigans and new characters. The premise should be simple, and it is: there's word of a Fountain of Youth(TM) off on an island somewhere, but as Captain Jack (Depp, of course still around once again) is off to find it he has to contend with Blackbeard (Ian McShane) going also for it. This could make enough for a movie, albeit lifting a bit already from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And there's a little extra intrigue with Blackbeard's daughter, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), being Sparrow's kinda-sorta-not-really love interest of yore. And of course the mermaids, who for at least five minutes when revealed as the blood-thirsty hybrids they are make the film full of vigor and excitement.<br/><br/>But then there's other stuff padded in to make it once again an over-long effort (not as long as At World's End thank goodness, but too long still), with Barbosa, Geoffrey Rush's most hammiest of ham-bone characters (whether it's also in his acting I'm not sure), also chasing after the Fountain but for more shady reasons as he appears up front as an actual ""Captain"" in the Royal British navy or whatever.<br/><br/>AND there's another goody-too-shoes along the lines of Orlando Bloom, though this time not him (thank foodness) but some other bland guy I don't remember his name at all and then he gets into some entanglement with the one mermaid they catch to take to the fountain. Why the mermaid? It's complicated... or, rather, not really, just a tear of a mermaid and some water and a couple of glasses and that's it... but it's more complicated than it seems, after a while.<br/><br/>Frankly, memory of this is spotty. Not because of it not trying, but because it just didn't try hard enough. Marshall's direction doesn't really try for anything that inventive like Verbinski was able to, and directs action in the most cardboard-cut-out of styles that one could see in any Bruckheimer actioneer. If that floats your boat, you might enjoy the movie a lot, but the action and excitement of past films (save for an escape scene early on with Sparrow through the streets of London, or some such town, and the mermaid scene mentioned earlier when they first appear and attack the pirates) is lacking here.<br/><br/>So, therefore, much of the movie has to rest on the appeal of its performers. How does it fare? Taking out of account whoever that bland-priest-kid was, and the mermaid girl equivalent (aka Bloom/Knightley 2.0), we got a couple of the regulars with Depp and Rush, and they both have their moments for sure - Depp especially has to carry a lot of scenes (arguably, even, the whole movie overall) on his shoulders, and for what it's worth in the fourth go at it he can still hold attention and get some chuckles... not laughs, mind you, just chuckles at this point. Honestly why they keep Sparrow's father, -the almost inimitable Keith Richards- as such a walk-on player on these films is beyond me as he could save portions if it was bumped up to a small role. Rush, meanwhile, is often relegated to exposition even when things should get interesting.<br/><br/>Curiouser still is McShane and Cruz. McShane could have made this a really memorable villain, but he seems to be tired through a lot of the performance, sometimes getting a little energy to yell during a scene, and not enough to make one feel that this is such a ""Bad Man"" as he calls himself. Cruz does better as a firebrand tough-girl sort who can kick butt and take names when need be, but isn't given much of a character either except near the end when there's some wicked double-crossing going on between her and Sparrow on a beach. It's a fine scene that the two actors have - and it's even a moment that shows why they're such *great* actors in other performances - and yet a little too little too late. By then the plot has turned its gears, Hans Zimmer's surprisingly generic score has gone through its motions, and mermaid tail (pun intended) is sorely lacking.<br/><br/>One small note to Marshall's credit, he gets ONE really fantastic WTF cameo during the city-chase scene with Sparrow when he lands in one of the carriages crossing town. I won't say who it is, but it's a self-conscious regal-joke that had me laughing harder than almost anything else in the movie. And a scene like when Sparrow argues over a big-giant-scary jump off a cliff into a river should have been the tone of much of the movie... and it isn't. It's not too terrible to hate (sorry House Next Door guy, this probably makes me a half or quarter of a c*** then), but to recommend it as anything other than at best a rental or a lazy summer afternoon nothing to do cable TV view would be false."

"mike48128","8","0","1","21 May 2014"," Too much of the same with a very confusing plot-But still fun!
","I had to see this one twice in order to fully comprehend it. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz run away with the film as Jack Sparrow and Angelica, Jack's soul-mate and perfect foil. Great chemistry between the two characters. In fact, she almost outshines Johnny Depp (Jack). On cable with commercials, the film seems to go on forever. What makes the plot so confusing is that Blackbeard and Edward Teague look very similar because both have flowing gray beards. One of the pirates (Barbossa) has a peg leg, so he is more easily singled out. The plot is a jumbled mess of the supernatural,voodoo, zombies and other undead, magical powers, the Fountain of Youth, English and Spanish explorers, and so many swashbuckling sequences that it made my head spin. Want a plot summary? Read it elsewhere as there are over 400 other reviews and a great Wikipedia summary as well. Did I enjoy it? yes. The romance between the Evangelist Philip and the ""good"" mermaid, nicknamed ""Syrena"", was haunting but almost unnecessary to the story. How she is going to rescue her dying love is unclear, as the mermaids here have a ""taste"" for human flesh. She drags him under the sea not to drown him, but to save him. This is never explained. Conquistador Ponce De Leon stops by to destroy the Fountain of Youth, as ""only God can grant eternal life"". Angelica and Blackbeard, both mortally wounded by a poison-laced sword, drink the fountain waters from silver chalices. Angelica lives and Blackbeard dies a horrible death and is turned into a skeleton. A mermaid tear in the magic water makes all the difference! So many questions here. The mermaid's rescue, as mentioned earlier. Jack's ship, The Black Pearl, is bewitched and miniaturized as a ship in a bottle. How to enlarge it, using mumbo-jumbo black magic? Will Angelica ever be rescued from the tiny island where Jack marooned her? Jack's Voodoo doll washes ashore and she picks it up. Fade to black. To be continued? This movie gave me a headache. An ""8"" because I enjoyed it in spite of itself. Alas, too many plot holes and shortcomings, me matey. Keep yer eye peeled for yet another sequel in 2015? ""Argh!"""

","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns for the fourth installment of this most unlikely franchise. This time he's after the fabled Fountain of Youth. It's as outlandish as ever. He runs across Angelica Teach (Penélope Cruz)who's been impersonating him. She was once preparing to be a nun when he found her in a convent. Soon he finds out that she's the cruel pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)'s daughter, and he's forced into leading them to the Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is now working for the British and is hot pursuit.<br/><br/>This is a mess of questionable characters with murky motives. The lightness of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are gone. We've left with a convoluted plot with unlikeable characters. Jack Sparrow was the rogue in the first one, but in this one, he's the nicest. How did that happened? The newcomer in this one is Penélope Cruz. Let's just say the outfits don't release her biggest assets. Of course she was pregnant during the filming. It doesn't make the movie any better.<br/><br/>Then there is the action. It's has the required swashbuckling, but it lacks the great memorable set pieces. To be honest, I can't remember a single set piece from this movie.

The fans may not stick around for a fifth film if these two are not reunited with Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>As for the story of ""On Stranger Tides,"" we find Jack Sparrow eagerly searching for the Fountain of Youth. However, the notorious Blackbeard is in search too, Jack's pirate enemy. The story itself has some splendor; it doesn't seem to drag on. It may have been more intriguing though if it didn't seem like a reboot of the franchise and just another continuation of the series."

","Honestly, I thought the new entry in the lucrative Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is actually not has half-bad as many people claim it to be. Going into this movie, I expected to see my favorite hero return and a bunch of well-placed action and explosions. That is what I signed up for and that is what I got. Also, this movie focuses on Jack Sparrow rather than other characters. I'm glad that happened because we got to learn more about Jack.<br/><br/>The fourth entry into the series is about how Jack ""teams"" up with Blackbeard and how they find their way to the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>I'm glad Johnny Depp reprised his role as Jack because no one can play Jack like Johnny can. Geoffrey Rush returns as Barbossa and he still is good. I thought Ian McShane was a sinister villain and Penelope Cruz was a nice addition.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun film that featured that good, ol' swash-buckling action. I was happy to see that they added the element of mermaids into the movie. This movie reminds me of the fourth Indiana Jones movie. People didn't like it much but I really did. That is how I feel about this movie. I rate this film 9/10."

","Free of his debt to Davy Jones, we join Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in the process of rescuing a trusted shipmate from the Royal executioners. When that fails, the crown attempts to coerce him into setting sail for the fabled fountain of youth. However, while Jack is in possession of neither ship nor crew, (and the film is without former cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley who elected to pursue other projects) Sparrow's captors are under the impression that he has a ship and is presently amassing a crew. Sparrow investigates and discovers someone impersonating him for their own purposes. A woman, of all things. In fact, a woman from his past by the name of Angelica (played by Penelope Cruz). <br/><br/>Clearly the story is complicated and the viewer is asked to make many accommodations where plausibility and time are concerned. That said, it's a well-executed successor to the three previous films, the action is entertaining and the cast is, for the most part, more than adequate. A great time at the movies."

","First of all, I wanna say I am POTC obsessed. I have seen the first three many times and I absolutely adore them. I have potc scene it, a framed photo, action figures, an Aztec gold necklace, you name it. My favorite character was Will Turner. Jack (sorry, Captain Jack) was awesome, but I feel in love with the hopeless romantic whelp that is Will. He grew throughout the series, and I loved it. I am also a passionate Willabeth (Willabeth= Romantic pairing of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann) fan. So, needless to say when I heard #4 did not include them, I was not anxious to see it. But, being a pirates fan, I had to watch it. What a mistake. First, my friends say I only hated it cuz Will/Liz wern't in it, but that's not true. They would have made it better, but that's not why i hated it. I hated it because it was boring, repeated many things, and the new characters were stupid. The sword fight between Jack and Angelica? Almost a complete copy of Jack and Will's in COTBP. There was absolutely no memorable lines or scenes. In AWE, I sobbed my eyes out when Will was stabbed, and again when he had to leave Liz. OST gave me no emotion whatsoever. I might have slightly smiled once, and that was it. The new characters were so annoying- I honestly didn't care if they lived or died. I hated Phillip- if he was supposed to be Will's replacement, that is just sad. Phill/Serena's love story was a poor replacement of Will/Liz's, cuz Phill had just met Serena, and he was all ""Omigod, I love u sooo much"". No guy could love a girl as much as Will loved Liz, plain and simple. I hate phill. The best part of the movie was when Serena dragged him to the bottom of the sea. And where do people go when they drown? THE FLYING DUTCHMAN! YAY! So hopefully Will'll be in Pirates 5. Overall, for a obsessed pirates fan like me, this film was very disappointing. Unless they make a Pirates 5 and u need 2 watch this 2 understand it, save your money, and continue loving the TRILLOGY in peace."

","Johnny Depp is back with the most iconic role of his career, Captain Jack Sparrow. It's time to fly the pirate flag again. Thiz time, he is on a quest for the Fountain of Youth without two other main characters, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). But don't worry, it doesn't mean that thiz sequel will be less fun than the previous trilogy. They sail at almost full speed, the infamous pirates like Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and my favorite Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) are about to make a rousing new adventure. Thiz sequel is directed by Rob Marshall who is formerly known for his successful musicals like ""Chicago"" (2002) and ""Nine"" (2009). For the first half hour, Captain Jack's adventure is still exciting to follow, when he is captured by King George II and manages to escape. His comedy routine is still so fresh. I have to add something regarding the performance of Richard Griffiths as King George II, I love his funny face expression so much! His goofy and indolent expression is really fun to watch. The rest of the movie is pretty similar to its predecessor ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" (2003), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" (2006) and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" (2007). They insert unrevealed love context between Captain Jack and his seductive ex-girlfriend Angelica Teach (Penélope Cruz). Surprisingly, Cruz can fill her role quite well among these pirates. If we compare to the previous films, there is a decrease in dark and mysterious nuances that have been the characteristic of thiz franchise. Yes, we still feel thiz atmosphere when Captain Jack in Blackbeard's ship the Queen Anne's Revenge or when they are surrounded by extremely exotic and beautiful mermaids. Beside that, we won't find any more. Just like its predecessor, the story contains several subplots which may not be easy to understand. You have to put some extra efforts to comprehend the core of the story. Why they need Mermaid? What are the motives behind the involvement of Barbossa, Blackbeard and the third party Spain? Well, don't ask me. I find myself still thinking How The Black Pearl ends up in a bottle in the first place?! <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Apart from these, the special effects make the film spectacular, so the spectators can watch the movie pleasurably. The plot is when Jack (Johnny Depp) crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past. The other thing is that Jack (Johnny) is a great actor. The film has so perfect scenes, effects and sounds. You will feel like you are in this situation. Thus, my comment will be positive and I suggest all of you to watch it. Be sure, you will like it."

","I am a big Pirates of the Caribbean fan, so I'm kind of ashamed of myself for seeing it so late after the release. I didn't know what to think of this movie before I went to see it, because some people loved it, yet some hated it: so I had to check it out for myself. I did do that and I went into the cinema with no expectations what so ever, so I was not disappointed. Wasn't disappointed? I loved the film!<br/><br/>It was very entertaining, the writers did a great job. Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing as usual and Geoffrey Rush played well too. Ian McShane was kind of a weak villain, and the movie took a little bit too much time to start (the first half is very slow, with unnecessary sword fights), but for the second half Rob Marshall finally finds himself and continues the film in a good pace and rhythm. I don't think Marshall is a better or worse director than Gore Verbinski, the change of directors freshened up the franchise a bit. I didn't mind the priest- mermaid love story in the film either, I think it was a good added spice.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go as far as to say this film was the best in the series, but it was by far the most entertaining and it lived up to the first one. Thanks to Hans Zimmer's breath-taking music, Johnny Depp's performance and the hilarious character of Jack Sparrow, this franchise will never get old for me."

","No Spoilers! No, it isn't the most spectacular movie ever made, and it's not even the best Pirates of the Caribbean. On Stranger Tides just a good movie to watch and enjoy Captain Jack Sparrow's daring antics and tongue-in-cheek humor. If you are one of those harden intellectuals who considers a movie bad if it wasn't as good as the Dark Knight or some other Christopher Nolan film, then of course you won't like it. Truth be told, I never liked the fact that they ended the series with Pirates 3. It ended sad, unlike Curse of the Black Pearl's romantic, swashbuckling final scene. Pirates 4 brought back that ""Pirates"" ending that the 3rd lacked! As for plot, not as good as the previous movies, but definitely enjoyable. Also, as for it being a series that Disney is using to bring in loads of money, Pirates 4 would have been even bigger and more bloated than Pirates 3 was, and it certainly wasn't! As long as Captain Jack Sparrow sails the seas, I will be there in a dark movie theater to watch his adventures every single time."

","I love Pirates of the Caribbean, but. . . Part 4 misses what was earlier not noticeable... and that's the magic of Gore Verbinski. Not only poorly directed, but poorly written & performed as well, Pirates of the Caribbean 4 turns out to be an unnecessary sequel to the trilogy that actually ended the saga in a respectable manner if not on a high.<br/><br/>The only one holding the thread and saving the film from utter crap is Johhny Depp's immortal character, Captain Jack Sparrow. Although his performance in this movie is below than the first 3 movies, he still shines above everyone else. The removal of Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightly was an addition but it didn't help the movie much. Every previous character appeared rusty in their performances & the new ones are not much of help either.<br/><br/>What Gore Verbinski had done with his trilogy was to weave his web with great humor, supported by fine performances from the cast, pushing the visual effects to great extent, never making it look absurd & then leave Johnny Depp to do the rest. What Rob Marshall did was he never pushed anyone to the limit. Not the writers, not the actors & not even visual effects department or music & himself was trying too hard to force people to like it.<br/><br/>Compared to the previous three movies, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a sorry addition to the series & has nothing that can be called better than anything in the first 3 movies. Curse of the Black Pearl had remarkable performances & plot, Dead Man's Chest had great visuals & was a perfect blockbuster film. At World's End even though was the weakest, had remarkable music at least. POTC 4 has nothing. Kinda feeling sorry for those who watched it in 3D. Must have been a horrible experience because of movie being highly dark & no scenes having 3D effects at all.<br/><br/>At World's End ended the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy in a fine manner. This film was not needed. It simply shouldn't have been made in the first place. If you wanna watch it, don't have any high expectations... not even from Johhny Depp. He was poorly handled, just like the whole film."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides restores the franchises sense of entertainment values of the original film, and the fact the film's screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio aspires for a more clear and coherent plot is a big sign the creative team behind the film has started from scratch and not letting the same mistakes that happened with the last two previous films by them not going overboard with plot and effects. Speaking which the visual effects in this installment unlike the last two films do not over power the from the films main plot and action but enhances the sequences that it will just fly right over your head that is computer graphics The action is also while not quite as epic as At World's End but is still quite awesome and edge off your seat excitement especially the battle at the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>The cast were all terrific including the newcomers to the series bring such a breathe of new energy to the franchise. Penelope Cruz, who brings much spunk, sex appeal, and feisty attitude as Angelica. Ian McShane is also fantastic as the cruel and menacing Blackbeard, although my only nitpicking flaw I had with his origin could have been further developed, because he is not as sympathetic of a villain like Barbossa and Davy Jones, but I think that he wasn't suppose to be because underneath his menacing ways is someone who will do anything to show what supposed bad ass of villain when he is afraid of his own demise.<br/><br/>The returning cast which include Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are as usual great in their roles and Johnny Depp once again knock it out of the park as Captain Jack Sparrow. The opening scene with Jack dressed up as the judge is one of the most brilliant comedic scene Johnny Depp as done in his career and the best scene in the whole movie. It only proves just how much of a genius character actor of our time. I personally don't see how anyone could say its tired-some and boring, to those people I've you probably don't have any sense of humor even if it hit you in the face."

","The movie contains not much dialogue, a sad love affair, couple of new and original story lines and lots of stereotypical pirate types. J. Depp makes a big effort to not sound normal. The way he keeps talking like Jack Sparrow just doesn't make him connect with the audience in my opinion. BUT - this being primarily a children's movie (a Disney one), it is best suited for them - getting exited about exotic places, mystique, mermaids, seamen talking funnily and making funny faces. No place for rationality or hardships of life, which are still to be taught at (life) school. Only few people of today's padded environment would be capable of dying of old age either being a soldier or a pirate in early modern age Europe.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this particular pirate movie doesn't contain any educational angle for kids - none of the pirates were hanged. Only a couple were shot by the Spanish (who also shot the English). Truth be told, the bad will get punished, but one just doesn't have the feeling of it having been done.<br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, Disney has made a movie or movies about mermaids before. Anyway they seem to be a rather underused resource at Hollywood, meaning a complete surprise. Other stuff were old - think of Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail."

","After 4 years of since World's End, Capt. Jack is back on a new adventure. This one is much better formulated than the World's End, and story is more linear without taking so many detour on side plots.<br/><br/>For 250 million dollars, this is bit tame, but considering that 56 million went to Johnny Depp, the actual budget of the movie is almost par with some other movies made in recent years. <br/><br/>Jack and Barbossa embark on search for Ponce De Leon's fountain of Youth (BTW this is anachronism because Ponce De Leon never found the fountain of youth). Because there's a clear target, story is much easier to understand than Dead Man's Chest, or World's End, but there's still too many side plots. For instance the story would have been fine without introducing Black Beard, but the malady of the plot is similar to those found in the World's End - trying to put too many different elements to the story.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback of this film is that things happens in the dark about 50% of the time, and detracts from the interesting sceneries that could have been there instead.<br/><br/>There seems to be less focus on Capt. Jack on this movie compared to the trilogy. The focus is more on the story itself. They should focus more on the perfect Jack Sparrow moment like they did in the Curse of the Black Pearl. There's also a lack of antagonist for Jack Sparrow like Lord Carrington who intensely despises Jack for who he is, but actually creates good moments as Jack gets to mock him in his own unique ways. <br/><br/>So I think Pirates Of the Caribbean should get back to its roots, and refocus on Capt. Jack, but it might be too late for that, as Jack's mystique is waning after four movies. But it's still a fun movie to watch that doesn't fail to entertain."

Jack Sparrow's search for the Fountain of Youth is still a little too long (there's really no reason for these movies to be over two hours in length), and there was DEFINITELY no need for another peripheral love story now that Bloom and Knightley's storyline was finally (and mercifully) ended in At World's End. <br/><br/>The characters of Philip and Syrena are blatantly forced into the story just so there would be another couple, and the time and attention focused on those two definitely hurts the overall pacing of the movie.

I like that the Captain Jack Sparrow character is being given more background. Before he was quirky and likable but only seemed to be acting as a catalyst in the Swan/Turner love story. Now he has his own back story and possible love 'stirrings'. Penelope Cruz does a great job as the female foil in this one. She had a hard role balancing her character between the pull of bad vs good. Ian McShane was a fantastic choice for the part of Blackbeard! Geoffrey Rush - his Barbosa is iconic. Really liked the mermaids! This was one of the better ""Pirate"" films, in my opinion. This film is more balanced and not as dark as the 2nd and 3rd were.

Johnny Depp continues to be the raison d'etre for the project and he is in fine form with antics that include a lot of sword play and harrowing escapes, and yet all the while maintaining that inimitable twinkle of the eye that makes these films fly.<br/><br/>Some new folk are around - Penélope Cruz is lovely and lush but without a whole lot to do in this search for Ponce de Leon's site of the Fountain of Youth. Ian McShane is the peg-legged Blackbeard, Geofffrey Rush hams it up as Barbossa, and Richard Griffiths has a terrific time as the blubbery old fop King George - a role that deserves some awards for best supporting actor. The show is mighty and loud - Hans Zimmer's musical score drowns out most of the dialogue, but then that is no great problem as the dialogue is secondary to the action.

","Strange Tides wash...ashore. Sometimes you can be surprised at what you can see and hear at a movie; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is one such movie. One: When Jack Sparrow was trying to get away from men pursuing him, he jumped down and into a horse pulled carriage. Inside was an aristocratic looking woman. In order to appease her to his good, he began to whisper (seduce) in her ear. She being immobilized,and after gaining his objective, he leaves her - but her expensive ear jewel is gone. The whole time he was seducing her, he was stealing her ear ring! How true with the great seducer of all time. When Satan whispers in the ear of man, he is stealing what precious jewels he can. The first seduction of man occurred in this fashion. While he was whispering in the ear of Eve, he was stealing the precious jewels God had given Adam and Eve. Satan's deceitful promise ended in man being robbed - death. He took the jewel right out of the ear while speaking seductive words. Two: There was a scene with men in a small boat out on the waters. A mermaid swam up to the boat. One man was mesmerized with her. He was drawn to her beauty. He wanted to be with her, so he went to go over the edge of the boat to be joined to her. As he was about to join his lips to her, her beauty changed to fangs. Some mermaids took men to the bottom of the sea. This one, later, washed up in a fishing net. A reminder Satan can allure man to become one with his false beauty, but his plan is insidious; his plan is bring man under his power and carry him down to the bottom of the sea (death). Three: Even the clergyman was drawn to the mermaids beauty. Though his motive may have seemed virtuous, for him to be with her, he went down with her into her world. Even in the movie, it did not show that he going with her produced the outcome of love and life - it alluded to that. The reality in our world is that any man drawn to the beauty of this world, whether clergy or whatever, will be taken down to the depths of the sea - death. Four: There was a corpse of a treasure seeking pirate in a room of scattered treasures, which treasures had the appearance of cankering. The corpse had a ring still on his finger. The words of Jesus came to mind, ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"" (Mark 8:36-37) All treasures will canker. In the moment of death, a prized ring sits on a dead body. What will a man give in exchange for his soul? Who would have thought "" Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" would have spoken such truths? Strange Tides wash truth ashore."
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","7 August 2011"," Kudos for turning around the spiral...maybe Pirates can still survive
","Curse of the Black Pearl was one of the most brilliant adventures I had ever seen. Unique and huge and made Pirates the coolest thing out there and Johnny Depp created one of the greatest anti-hero characters in film history. And then the original trilogy began to spiral down into clutter and confusion and lost all that heart that came from the original. Still the original was amazing enough that I really did want to see this newest, long awaited instalment. I was even more excited that Johnny Depp and the film makers made clear they were trying to take this back to their roots. Clearly they knew that despite the BILLIONS of dollars the original trilogy made there was some serious clutter starting. So they made Jack Sparrow the main focus, threw in some new characters and took him on the high seas in a new adventure. Well done for turning it around. Does it touch the original? Not even close. I felt like maybe it was a little too basic and they even maybe played it too careful (I know darned if you do and darned if you don't) but there definitely was a spark still missing. However, the film is terrific and fun and adventurous and you don't miss the characters of Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) or Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) because Depp clearly carries the film.<br/><br/>You really can't say a single bad thing about Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He has the character down to a fine science and while I think he's lost his unique and fun edge it is still always great to go on this adventure with him. Depp is flawless and a movie star in every sense of the word. Even if the series continues to get worse I have no doubt that Depp's Sparrow will be brilliant. Penélope Cruz has proved to be a very versatile actress and this is a good turn for her. Taking on the strong female swashbuckler and former love of Sparrow, Angelica is fun and her and Depp have amazing chemistry together. She fits right into the story and into the cast. Geoffrey Rush returns in his terrific role as the over bearing pirate Barbossa. I have loved this character since day one. I felt like he was a little low key in this film and him and Jack didn't have as much banter against each other which always made for great moments in the original trilogy. Ian McShane joins the cast as the legendary Blackbeard and who better to do it. I mean McShane sort of gets type-casted in this type of villain but he is still perfect for Blackbeard. Kevin McNally also returns in his role as Jack's number one man, but he is sadly underused and almost feels like he was only forced into the story to have a returning character.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski is not a seasoned director but he is incredibly talented. I feel like Rob Marshall is a step down from having Verbinski's vision behind the camera. Marshall's career has been successful but focusing on musicals (Chicago) and a time piece like Memoirs of a Geisha. That doesn't really translate into swashbuckling adventure. On Stranger Tides is a good film, it is a welcome turn around to the series but the problem is I felt like everything was just a little too low key. The original Pirates film was in your face, over the top, action adventure that held no punches and I just thought that On Stranger Tides played it safe, and didn't really let loose but maybe that was purposeful to try and pull the reigns back and stop the series from becoming a cluttered mess. Regardless if you liked the original trilogy this one will be welcomed as well. Kids will love the adventure and adults will love the characters. Worth seeing, but a far cry from the original film. 8/10"

","I absolutely love the POTC franchise because more than any other movies series, I've seen it makes me laugh. A lot. I own the first three and recently went to see this one. I laughed until I cried throughout most of the movie because of Jack Sparrow, of course. The writers are just brilliant. I loved Captain Teague's line ""Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?"" and really liked Jack's line after the mutiny: ""I can name fingers and point names."" It may not make sense to some, but that is just typical Jack, wonderfully portrayed by Depp. I think Depp is perfect as Sparrow; honestly and - I think other fans will agree - the franchise wouldn't have been anywhere near as successful as it's been if Depp wasn't a part of it. If the production team can keep up the good work, I'd say let's have two more, and make it two trilogies."
"FranklyMyDearIDontGiveADamn","6","0","2","23 July 2011"," A bit too long but very enjoyable
","The good thing with franchises is that you know what to expect when you go to the cinema. ""The Pirates"" bring the same good old mix of colorful language, Laurel&Hardy slapstick comedy, a feisty heroine who gives Captain Jack Sparrow more than a run for his money, rum, magic, sword fights, more rum and magic, and, of course, Captain Jack running and screaming like a girl. What's not to like? :) <br/><br/>My only complaint is that there were a couple of secondary stories that ran to long and did not bring too much to the movie. The beginning was a bit loose and the story took a while to really get started, and the Christian missionary story was kind of unnecessary, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Music was great, visuals were stunning, and Johnny Depp was his usual charming self. Very enjoyable."
"alidia-findley","8","0","3","22 July 2011"," Best of the four?
","Arguably the best of the series so far, P.O.T.C. 4 really lets Johnny Depp shine in his role. You can really tell that he's enjoying himself, but he manages to be excited without detracting from the character. Instead, it makes Captain Jack seem that much more believable (not to mention entertaining).<br/><br/>Visually, this movie was quite charming. I saw it in 3D, and it successfully takes advantage of 3D without being garish. It was enough that you knew you were seeing a 3D movie without making you flinch every five seconds when something leaps at you. The set and costumes, as usual, were great, some bordering on impeccable.<br/><br/>This movie really embodies what I think the Pirates series was all about--a little humor, a little romance, plenty of swashbuckling action and a lot of fun. At some point the writers may have gotten caught up in the love triangle brewing with Elizabeth, Will, and Jack but this movie successfully steers away from that. It would be enjoyable for audiences of many ages."

","This movie is way better than people say it is. <br/><br/>That is, if you're not expecting it to be a huge epic or a completely innovative work that'll keep you thinking. It's not meant to be that. It's a fun, good old adventure. <br/><br/>And it's in the spirit of the classic adventure film that Pirates 4 strives. The action isn't overdone, but there's just enough that it'll keep you alert. The conflict of the story also isn't overdone, which is a huge relief from the last two. I mean, don't get me wrong, I loved the last two installments. But after the incredibly complex story of Beckett and Davy Jones, it just feels right that it goes back to the basics.<br/><br/>Three ambitious parties all searching for the fountain of youth. Simple. Understandable. Adventurous. The perfect plot for the fourth installment.<br/><br/>Of course, however, the first viewing will most likely be A LITTLE disappointing. That's just because it's a sequel and I, for one, am always somewhat disappointed with a sequel the first time I see it. It's been that way with pretty much every big franchise I can think of. But then, once you get past that (which you will), you'll realize it fits quite nicely into the series and ought to be watched at least a second time or a third.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, it's not that innovative epic or the high point in the series. What it is, is a fun movie filled with laughter, love, and the many other things that make movies great. Don't criticize it if it wasn't everything you expected. If it made you smile, then it's a good movie. Unless you just like to complain.<br/><br/>And don't forget, there will be two more installments added before the franchise is done, so don't be disappointed that it's not as epic as the last two. It's not supposed to be the high point in the series. But it is entertaining. I'd definitely rank it as one of the best movies of the year. <br/><br/>And, oh yeah, I forget to mention the best part.

"Christian_Dimartino","8","0","1","17 July 2011"," The best since the original; Depp and Cruz are the main attraction.
","Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow once again in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Depp is really what brought life to this series, and unlike the last two films this one focuses on him. Which I was truly glad to see.<br/><br/>Sparrow teams up with an old fling, Angelica(the always likably feisty Penelope Cruz), who is Blackbeard(Ian McShane), to find the mysterious Fountain of Youth. Blackbeard is also after it, and so is Captain Barbossa(Geoffry Rush), who is now a soldier or something.<br/><br/>Occasionally in On Stranger Tides the film loses itself in the action sequences. I wasn't positive about what was going on. But despite that, its a lot of fun. Its almost as enjoyable as the original. Its even better than Dead mans chest and At worlds end.<br/><br/>The reason why is because there aren't too many subplots. Sure, you have to follow a romance between a dude and a mermaid, but at least you don't have to follow Will and Elizabeth. Glad they're out of the picture. Most of the film focuses on Captain Jack, which it should've done before.<br/><br/>The scenes with Depp are the most interesting. OK, the scenes with Depp and Cruz. The two starred together in Blow 10 years ago, and its kind of funny to see them here. Because in that movie, they hated each other, and in this film they sort of do but in a hard to get sort of way.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a lot of fun. I think its the second best in the series. But they are pushing it now. These are movies based on a ride. There is no need for four films, even if they are all enjoyable.

He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.<br/><br/>The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.<br/><br/>The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner.

","I hardly saw any previews and so went in expecting nothing and I was left surprised which is good, as I was really let down by the last part. At Worlds End was a bloated, convoluted special effect driven mess that had me hoping that there would be no more Pirates movies. Gore Verbinski pulled a Wachoswski brothers in destroying the goodwill they created with the first Matrix with two very poor sequels. While Verbinski had a better second movie the third is very comparable to Matrix 3.<br/><br/>The Positives: The humour is mostly back and it was funny, unlike the lame jokes from AWE.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz looked really amazing, till I realized later that she was 7 months pregnant at the time of shooting- what a glow! She also held up very well in her role and her comic timing was excellent. I hope she makes it into the next movie.<br/><br/>Less special effects and more real action. This is a huge step up from AWE whose ending was terrible.<br/><br/>No Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley! Yahoo! This deserves a 7 rating just for just positive alone! Slightly more focus on the story, even if it is still weak compared to the first movie The negatives: The story is still weak and not totally focused which let down the movie overall The opening action sequence was unnecessary, dull and overly expectant. It was a copy of the action from the first movie so it was just a matter of going through the routine. Not very funny either.<br/><br/>Sparrow being the focal point of the story was not handled well. In fact the more the story focused on Sparrow the less interesting he became.<br/><br/>Blackbeard's story was very dull and for a fearsome pirate...he was not. Ian Mcshane didn't do the character any justice and he could have well been left out.<br/><br/>The movie suffers from too many plot angles still...There's Sparrow vs Barbossa, Sparrow Vs Blackbeard, Sparrow and Barbossa Vs Blackbeard, Sparrow vs Blackbeard AND the Spaniards...The plot still suffers from the parts 2 and 3 problems. This needs to be toned down to one or two rivalries, not the whole world vs Jack Sparrow Barbossa was not interesting and it's time that this character is cut from the plot entirely.<br/><br/>Gibbs's role was really reduced which is a shame because he provided plenty of good humour in the first movie and he and Sparrow shared a really good camaraderie. He needs to have a bigger role in the next movie.<br/><br/>All in all it's still worth watching at the cinema. Ignore the opening and ending sequence. It's a good start to repair the damage done by AWE but it still needs improvement. If there are still 2 more sequels to come then they have time to get it right. So far the first movie still ranks as the best, even if orlando bloom and keira knightley are in it."

","I love this story franchise. It simply goes places and does things that no other even approaches. The casting/acting, filming, scripting, the soundtrack... it's all just impeccable.<br/><br/>In the first three installations, there was a great deal of continuity in characters and story line. It was all woven together to create one large movie tapestry. But this fourth one makes a number of departures... and as a devoted fan of those first three, it has taken a little bit of post-interlude retrospect to come to terms with it all.<br/><br/>One thing you notice almost immediately, but may need to consider before identifying, is the change in director... from Gore Verbinski to Rob Marshall. It's like having two chefs prepare the same dish, but each with their own personal touches to give it a unique signature. <br/><br/>So, while the basics remain the basics, the tang factor is noticeably changed... the seasoning is different because there was a new chef. Marshall's serving is a touch less charismatic-sweet and more bludgeoned-reactionary. <br/><br/>Now, none of this is to cast a disparaging light on direction or on those stranger tides. But for those who, like myself, submerse themselves into a good movie, there is also a forensic relationship that definitely missed the Gore Verbinski touch.<br/><br/>Here's keeping fingers crossed for episode #5!"

My main complaint about this movie is how after it is finished it feels like there should have been more to it and seemed like it was missing some scenes. Also the coincidences in this movie is way to far-fetched to the point it sort of throws you off a bit and I am not talking about the supernatural stuff.

I love the new villain, to me he was the best and most ""trustworthy"" so far. Just a guy who happens to be unusually cruel (and with the ability to control weather, but that's beside the point). I could actually bare some of the plot holes, because the rest was good enough for me ... I remember when we stepped out of the theater, and one of my friends said: ""I didn't believe in the story, there were too many holes"", and I replied: ""Come on, you just saw a guy get eaten by a mermaid. If you want something realistic, read Vilhelm Moberg, and leave my pirate movie alone."" And I'm gonna stick to that. I remember when I was ten and read ""Treasure Island"" for the first time.

Then I watched all the 4 POTC movies. I didn't quite understand the 3rd and though it was so confused. But after I watched 1 and 2 I began to know that the plot is so clear. Depp really has his magic. He's different and real in every movie he stared. I like his Jack Sparrow most. In the 1st Jack Sparrow is so clever. In the 2nd he's so funny. In the 3rd one i felt that he was hidden by the writer of the movie and only appears in a few scenes. But he's always the key element in every crucial moment. Jack can seek the core of a problem and solve it perfectly. Sometime he is selfish but in his veins he is a good man. <br/><br/>About what I feel in 4 1.In the 4th I found Jack is more kind, which is not the kindness after inner struggle as in other 3 movies. 2.He has a romance. But I agree with the opinion that there is not as much chemical as between Jack and Swan. 3.And it is more religious. That may explains the first to some extent?<br/><br/>All in all. Johny Depp is really the best actor I've ever known in the US. And his Jack Sparrow is so clever, so lovely, so free, so funny and sometimes so philosophical, even a little bit religious in 4. I hope that later POTC movies can keep his traits and never spoil his image."

They must have mobilized the whole Olympic swim team to take care of the flotilla of mermaids that attack the poor sailors. I must admit the love affair between the Catholic missionary and the mermaid is sentimental enough to be dramatic.<br/><br/>On another hand they always use some family connections which are both false and true, just like all the sworn promises are both truthful and fakes, and the promises are always respected and yet always turned around and broken, not directly, as if it were an accident. Here it is very useful to get rid of a couple of old pirates that will no longer be there next time and that will be a good thing. They deserve to retire or be marooned on some desert island.<br/><br/>So enjoy this long film the way it has to be enjoyed, like a beautiful piece of entertainment and a very well performed and acted piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

"deeprise1988","7","0","1","18 June 2011"," Better than third one.
","Fourth installment in the franchisee but it has nothing to do with previous movies. Captain Jack Sparrow is abandoned in the ship led by cruel Blackbeard with his daughter Angelica. There is prediction that Blackbeard will die soon so her daughter is seeking for the fountain of youth to give life to her father. And she has kidnapped Jack her former lover to explore the adventure. There are two more parties looking for fountain of youth. Movie doesn't offer you much until mermaids arrival. Film is enjoyable thats I would say. And better than third movie. Movie has nothing to offer new in the franchise but it surely entertains you. Jack is worthy."
"scouter2103","8","0","1","17 June 2011"," Best yet ....... i'm not being bi est
","Well well. I have been disappointed with a few films in my time and this film was not one of them. Depp acts as Jack, or rather captain jack to his usual standard. There is the same lighthearted humour that we have come to expect from the franchise. These comedy moments are actually funny. In fact I think it was funnier than even recent romantic 'comedies' such as ""Chalet Girl"". The Barbosa character is back, same with a new female lead who adds a Spanish flair, which suits Pirates very much so. The script in my opinion is good and there is a satisfying ending. Obviously they will be making more sequels. I do not mind the fact at all that Will or Elizabeth aren't in it; their story lines were finished more or less, and the film needed a new other lead to keep it fresh. if they had kept the same 2 actors then it still would have been the same old thing. I would recommend seeing this in 3D. All in all this film is worth seeing, especially if you're a pirates fan!"

It was not funny at all, the storyline is crap, most of the characters aren't in it that made the other movies good, there was no chemistry between the characters. Penelope Cruz got on my nerves. The ridiculous love story between that guy and the mermaid, what the hell was all that about. One of biggest disappointments for a long time. I'm afraid i won't be rushing to the stores to buy the DVD when its released, because if i have sit through this mickey mouse made movie i will have to kill myself. s**t at it's best."
"kellybubble","2","0","1","15 June 2011"," Surprisingly good - although focus was on wrong characters
","I was surprised when I realized I was actually enjoying this movie - the latest installment of the Pirates movies. I am a fan of the first film but found that the following two did not quite add up to the sheer genius that was the first one. So I wasn't sure I would like 'On Stranger Tides' either. Also, I thought I would miss the characters of Will and Elizabeth. I didn't, as it were. <br/><br/>Instead I found I was far more intrigued by some of the new characters. Philip the cleric (played by Sam Claflin), mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), Scrum (Stephen Graham) and Ian McShane's Blackbeard were all interesting characters. Ian McShane had the most fleshed out character obviously, being the antagonist of the story. Stephen Graham (Scrum) filled his role of comic relief well. I was however very disappointed that Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey weren't given more screen time.<br/><br/>I found the love story between Philip and Syrena very interesting. Yes, I realize they were there solely to fill up the void of Will and Elizabeth and to add a little romance to the plot for all the pining ladies and teenage girls at home. BUT it worked! (Apparently I too am a sucker for love stories - who'd a thunk?!) Anyway, by the end of the movie I found myself more invested in Philip and Syrena's storyline and fate than any other character in the movie - even Jack Sparrow's! <br/><br/>I wished their characters would have had more impact on the story. I personally could see several directions where they could have taken the character of Philip; him as a captive, as a missionary and as a ways of redemption for the pirates. It was a pity the Philip/Syrena storyline was so short and ended so abruptly. I sincerely hope they bring back Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey's characters for the fifth installment and give the actors more to do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film in itself has everything that makes for a good movie. Action, adventure, good acting (from most), beautiful photography etc. And Johnny Depp was fantastic as Jack Sparrow - as always. You all know why so enough said about him.<br/><br/>Dislikes: Two words. Penélope Cruz. First, woman can't act. Second, most pointless character ever! So what, Angelica's reasons for doing what she did were that simple?! Come on! The writers could've done way better than that. And the suggested sexual tension between Angelica and Jack Sparrow just wasn't there. <br/><br/>To finish off, I really missed some of the old characters. Ragetti and Pintel for example. And Gibbs should've gotten more screen time."
"romanoszak","7","0","1","13 June 2011"," A new era for our beloved pirates!!!!!!!!
","The first three films are now a big part of the history of cinema and no one can deny that. ''On Stranger Tides'' is a worthy sequel to those films.<br/><br/>Of course, Johnny Depp is once again incredible amusing as Captain Jack Sparrow, showing you his acting skills one more time and why he was nominated for an academy award for best leading actor for the same role in the ''Curse of the Black Pearl''. Every time he is on screen, his presence is so entertaining, you'll just want more more of Captain Jack. So we have our favorite pirate back -who is also one of the most iconic character from the 2000's...but what else?<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush returns as the cold-blooded pirate captain, Hector Barbossa. This time his story is evolved just like in the previous films. From an evil villain, a guest star, and a tritagonist he has becomes now a huge supporting character. His performance is of course excellent, the motives of his character are very interesting and I give you my word, you will love his last scene!!!<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is better than I expected, I'll give her that. She manages to appear as the complete equal to Jack Sparrow's cunning and her role in the story is extremely important. Plus, she is so hot!!!<br/><br/>But what is a good movie like this without a menacing villain? Ian McShane is perfectly cast as Blackbeard, the ''pirate all pirates fear''. Even from his first scene you realize that he's not messing around and that he will stop at nothing in order to get what he wants. The only bad thin about Blackbeard is that I expected him to be....more evil...don't get me wrong, he was very cruel, but still...<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is very good as well. Kevin McNally is funny as hell in the role of ''master'' Gibbs, just like he was in the ''old days''. Astrid-Berges Frisbey is incredibly cute, hot as the mermaid Syrena and she gives us a very interesting sample of her acting skills. Sam Claffin is also very good as the priest caught prisoner by Blackbeard and falls for Syrena and he has some very well written scenes. Stephen Graham is incredibly amusing as Scrum replacing Pintel and Raggeti as a comic relief and Keith Richards, Richard Griffiths, Greg Ellis and Oscar Jaenada all have small but important roles. The writers Terry Rosio and Ted Elliot give us a clever script based on the novel ''On Stranger Tides'' and Rob Marshall directs in a very good way, just like Gore Verbinski.<br/><br/>To sum it up, is very entertaining movie for every age and a worthy sequel to the previous films and it cannot be missed. It's not perfect, but it will make forget your problems and take a deep dive into the amusing world of the Pirates of the Caribbean."
"meeza","Null","0","1","12 June 2011"," The strange tide is not high, but it does the trick, thanks to its Depp waves!
","It is not a total shi*wreck like the last two installments, but ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" does not totally hook you in; even though it did have its moments. Johnny Depp returns as everyone's favorite pirate Captain Jack Sparrow in this fourth film of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. In this installment, Jack is on a mission to find the ""fountain of youth"", which seems like the 48 year-old Depp has already found. Sparrow is confronted by an ex-girlfriend Angelica Malon, which I am sure Jack la ""piratio"" from a fellow pirate. Angelica is portrayed by none other than Spanish bombshell Penelope Cruz, who actually does have some chemistry with Depp. Ms. Malon also happens to be the daughter of the pirate nemesis Blackbeard, played with a chilling disposition by Ian McShane. Blackbeard is also on the quest to find the Mr. De Leon ""oil of olay"" waters. Speaking of beards, Sparrow foe & occasional ally Captain Barbossa is back for this one, even though Captain B is gunning more to shave off Blackbeard than Sparrow in this chapter. Geoffrey Rush continues to give the Barbossa character that good ol' pirate swagger no matter the circumstances. There are even mermaids in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" which swimmingly look great but they don't provide much of a ""fin"" to the movie. I personally do not think that the character of Sparrow has worn out his welcome, and is still the best part of the franchise, and we have another Depp vibrant performance to thank for that. However, I still grrrr about the film's cheesy narrative elements when it does not have to be. Yes, Director Rob Marshall did not heavy-hand it as much as Gore Verbinski's last two Pirate films, but the ""fountain of youth"" storyline was more of a bore than a score, and after a while it really got old. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the action sequences and the introduction of Blackbeard into the movie totally rocked the house or at least the boat. I was elated that the hideous characters of Will & Elizabeth were finally axed out from the franchise. It is still Depp running the acting show here, so as long as we are not Depprived of the charismatic Johnny D. playing Captain Jack, then keep those pirate movies coming; but I do plead to the filmmakers to please spice up the plot. All in all, this swashbuckling flick is not GRRRRReat but not bad!! *** Average"

","With this fourth addition to the magnificent Pirates of the Caribbean series, passionate fans have seen a feeble rumour become a fully-fledged exhilarating reality. Whilst it may lack the solid and purposeful storytelling bravado of the earlier sequels, it is nevertheless a satisfying fourth helping of the irresistible Pirates spirit. What's more, the film succeeds in being a faithful continuation of this spirit without merely rehashing its successful predecessors. Plenty of new characters and plot lines are introduced, so much so that it greatly outweighs the old material, yet in the grand scheme of things this approach seems to work, taking this sequel as far away from redundancy as it could possibly go.<br/><br/>The story apparently picks up some time after the comical ending of the breathtaking At World's End (2007) at which time ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow (the brilliant Johnny Depp) has been travelling freely and solitarily for quite some time, and has now crossed paths once again with his old friend Gibbs (winsomely played by Kevin McNally) who finds himself in a very desperate situation. Jack's very erratically conducted rescue delivers some highly entertaining scenes of wacky dialogue and involving action sequences, displaying the filmmakers' expert utilisation of the winning technique used by many such comedy-adventure films, like Indiana Jones, in which a high-speed early subplot paves the way for the main events. After the incident, the two friends are divided by the intervention of some old acquaintances and the growing interest in chasing the myth of the legendary Fountain of Youth mentioned recurringly in the third instalment. Gibbs, in order to avoid the gallows, is forced into joining Captain Barbossa, (a sublime Geoffrey Rush is the only other returning member of the old cast) who has now humorously become an agent of his master's navy and since the sinking of the Black Pearl has been hobbling around with a peg leg. As for Jack, beautiful plucky Angelica (a sensational Penélope Cruz), one of the many hateful dames from his past, has gotten the better of him. He has been kidnapped and dragged aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by the infamous Blackbeard (a deliciously wicked Ian McShane) who as it turns out is Anjelica's long lost father. Both captains are headed for the Fountain of Youth with different yet undeniably intermingled motives. To reveal them here, prematurely, would rob future audiences of their enjoyment.<br/><br/>However, it would not be too harmful to say that, as with Jack's enigmatic intentions in the earlier films, these mysteries are deeply embroiled in the supernatural. Indeed, On Stranger Tides is just as excited about displaying new specimens of eerily psychedelic mysticism as Dead Man's Chest was five years earlier. Blackbeard is a semi-undead being with the satanic powers of magically manipulating a ship as though it were a living, breathing monster, making the ropes and the boards trap and strangle those on board, as well as forcing a raging burst of flames to erupt from the keel. He has many other instruments of sorcery at hid fingertips, but even he appears to be shaken by the viciously seductive, murderous mermaids that the crew must confront in order to reach the fountain. Another force that seems to be intimidating the fiendish brute is the Spanish, who have also joined the hunt, but whose aim appears to be the eradication of such heretical entities as the fountain and Blackbeard. In fact, we soon realise that Blackbeard is no fearsome, formidable tyrant, but a lazy characterless coward who would be nothing without his box of magic tricks. In this way, he is very similar to Lord Beckett from the second and third films, only without the sense of class and the sheer smugness.<br/><br/>Reflecting on the series as a whole, one does notice that much of the dramatic weight has been dropped by the time this most recent instalment is reached. However, it is doubtful that any more genuine pathos could have been mustered for the fourth chapter, and the new director, Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) has wisely not been too heavy- handed with the obvious cinematic strategies employed. The sweet blossoming of young love between a faithful Christian (Sam Claflin) and a more sympathetic mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) can be seen a mile away before it is finally acknowledged, but nevertheless it manages to win over the audience, and is quite reminiscent of the initial romantic sparks that flew between Will and Elizabeth throughout The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) before that chemistry lost its flavour. The purely lighthearted line of attack works perfectly, and this allows the splendid fantastical action sequences, as well as the other characteristic aspects, to be executed perfectly. This film is what it is and never pretends to be anything else. Fans will no doubt find it thrilling and refreshing, and as for those who don't share in the Pirates fever, one does wonder why they have still been following the series after eight years."
"cm_anon76","8","0","1","10 June 2011"," Very well written, characters not very likable though
","This movie started out with a lot of pirate lore. You might need to watch a few pirate movies to understand what the characters are talking about.<br/><br/>There were some great fight scenes and escape scenes. Some of the best scenes ever.<br/><br/>But this movie was lacking feeling. We don't really care about many of the characters. One of the most sympathetic characters in the movie was a man-eating mermaid.<br/><br/>There was also a priest character who was somewhat likable. But even the priest lost faith at times. And he even became close friends with a man-eating mermaid. I guess the mermaid Syrena was one of the most interesting characters in the movie, even though she had just a minor part.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow isn't a sympathetic character in this movie. Sure, he lost his ship. I felt sorry for him in the first film because Barbosa betrayed him and left him with nothing. But at this point Jack just seems irritable.<br/><br/>Gibbs is a likable character. He's still just a supporting character, but I liked how he stood up to Barbosa. Very brave.<br/><br/>I thought Penelope Cruz's acting was weak at times. Maybe she didn't have much chemistry with Johnny Depp? Penelope Cruz's character also was not likable.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was interesting as Barbosa. He became a captain in the British Navy. It was funny to see him try to act like a gentleman, as he spat when he talked.<br/><br/>Blackbeard was an interesting villain, as he rationalized and taught his evil to the crew, but he didn't show much feeling either. Even when he's killed at the end he's just an empty shell.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Gilette again, a navy captain from the first movie. He's an interesting character."

","I have been waiting for this movie ever since I heard there was going to be a fourth POTC. I was very excited to see it but when i found out that Gore Verbinski wasn't directing the fourth installment, I knew that On Stranger Tides would be different than the others, and it was. The film was somewhat disappointing. As far as acting goes, Johnny Depp steals the show again and Geoffrey Rush and Ian Mcshane deliver solid performances. The action was superb but I didn't like the fact that more than half of the scenes were shot at night. Unlike the others in the series, this one was forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it was highly entertaining, just forgettable. Even though its a pretty decent film, compared to the previous installments, this one looks like a pile of crap. Another problem with this film is that it is nearly identical to the previous ones, just a different storyline and a few different characters. Don't walk into this movie with high expectations, this is more of a popcorn flick. If they do another pirates, please bring back some of the old cast and please bring back Gore Verbinski to direct."

Whoever came up with a story like this is from another world and needs to understand reality. How can a man get stabbed and not get killed? How can a man simply pick up his sword and create magic like that? Also those mermaids were all wrong...I mean I have heard in other stories that mermaids (even though they don't actually exists) are peaceful and loving... In this movie they are shown as being evil which is completely ridiculous... Doesn't make any sense... Also the background score was repetitive and Johnny Depp has a lot of wrinkles on his face...He looks old...Plus Al Pacino needs to get a new job cuz he looks like a monkey..Overall I wouldn't recommend this film...Even the first film sucked because there is no such thing as pirates and no logic! Stupid movie..."
"philosophyking87","7","0","2","31 May 2011"," Decent... but not what I was expecting
","Ever since I saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in 2005, I have thoroughly enjoyed Captain Jack Sparrow and his many adventures with various Lords and miscreants. But perhaps more so than that, the musical themes of this first movie were simply extraordinary, and I would definitely be so bold as to say that it was in large part to the music that the movie was so successful, and that it is now very much a cinematic classic. <br/><br/>With exquisite titles like the ""The Medallion Calls,"" ""The Black Pearl,"" ""Underwater March,"" and ""He's a Pirate,"" Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer essentially did for Pirates of the Caribbean what John Williams did for Star Wars. With such beautiful, luscious music largely characterizing the film -- giving it an essential, strong musical identity, these brilliant composers managed to distinguish Pirates from all other movies in the industry. <br/><br/>On top of this, the screen writing was simply superb (so good in fact that I can easily read it like a play without actually watching the movie). And even further upon that, the decent casting involved actors very capable of executing their lines, not to mention the fact that the characters are very well-written and developed (which is probably one of the biggest elements aside from the gloriously well done music). Thus, overall, the first Pirates movie was very well done overall, with unique musical themes that set it apart from all other movies. <br/><br/>After that, you had ""Dead Mam's Chest,"" which while so similar to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" wasn't nearly as good. For one thing, the musical themes weren't nearly as strong as those of the first film (although a few stood out, such as ""Davy Jones""). And while the same essential characters were involved (with perhaps a few additions), the plot was somewhat underwhelming. And after this decent movie, you had ""At World's End."" Now, this third film wasn't very much tied to the first film (as it had many new characters, new musical themes, and a somewhat different feel overall). Yet, the plot was very good with music that was slightly underwhelming (even if the titles were decent overall). ""At World's End"" seemed a much better movie than ""Dead Man's Chest,"" although both weren't what I'd called ""disasters."" <br/><br/>Skip along to 2011 and you have the latest film of the series: ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."" Immediately, it's known that much of the previous cast is no longer present and so mean new characters have been added, with only a handful of the original characters still with Jack on his grand adventures. But this is a problem, because of the few still remaining, Hector Barbossa is a completely different character, playing an almost completely different role. Overall, it's as though everything that made his character charismatic and appealing was stripped away in some second-rate perspective of an otherwise great character. Joshamma Gibbs, as well, seems somewhat ""different"" in his role, while Jack Sparrow is perhaps the only character still available which seems to have his old flare. So suffice it to say, while the new characters (such as ""Black Beard"") weren't horrible additions, they simply do not compare to the very attractive and charismatic characters of the previous films. And even on top of this, the introduction to the movie was simply based on an absurd premise, while the plot itself was extremely underwhelming, and on some level, rather disappointing. And this doesn't even begin to get into the fact that music was largely rehashed versions of the original music (used in all sorts of new ways that didn't at all seem ""suitable"" or ""natural,"" but instead more ""forced"" or ""contrived,"" as if they just had to throw them in there somewhere). <br/><br/>And lastly, Black Beard, as a new character, was tremendously disappointing. When one thinks of Black Beard, there is often an image of a large, brawny man with a large face and body who seems ""larger than life"" and downright brutal. The impression of Black Beard in this latest Pirates movie was absolutely nothing like this iconic historic image; instead, he's somewhat weak, not very aggressive, older and shorter than one would imagine, on top of the fact that his evil, nasty nature is only ""implied"" and never truly ""demonstrated!"" <br/><br/>Overall, this latest pirates was somewhat underwhelming and disappointing, and I definitely think the first three movies were far superior. 7/10 (mostly because I can't help but enjoy a movie with a Pirates feel to it, the character Jack Sparrow, and some sense of the original music that made the first movie so great). But perhaps I am being too generous here, as this movie was really relatively poor (but just seems to have depended upon the ""brand name,"" ""famous stock character,"" and ""signature music"" to get by, and that's a shame)."

","So it's the first blockbuster movie weekend of the summer. And the reports are already in, it's official, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" has made a gazillion dollars and people are packing the theaters to see it. It's a hit! <br/><br/>I just wish I could share the enthusiasm. But I can't.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't love bravura over-the-top swashbuckling Saturday-matinée popcorn action movies, because I do. I've watched ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" more times than I can remember, and I still love it. ""Ironman"" was a great fun movie, I loved the first two Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movies, I even enjoyed ""National Treasure."" I don't believe that a movie has to be profound, or reveal some inner truth, or break new ground, or even make sense in a logical way in order to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>But I do believe that an action movie has to have more than a bunch of fight sequences strung together at random, that it has to have characters you care about at least on a superficial level, and if the plot doesn't make sense, it at least has to be good enough to make you suspend disbelief for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>""On Stranger Tides"" failed on all these levels. Oh, Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow has his moments; he's cute, and clever, and silly in a lovable way/lovable in a silly way. But when all is said and done, at least for me he wasn't, in this movie, a character I was more than mildly amused by. And that wasn't enough to keep me invested in the movie.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz makes a fetching Pirate (Piratette? Piratess?), but I just never bought into the back-story, which is that she's Blackbeard the arch-Pirate's daughter. She's pretty and she's fun to watch on screen, but there isn't enough plot/character to make me care about her.<br/><br/>There's a cute sub-plot involving a mermaid and a young male missionary, and as far as I was concerned, that was potentially the most interesting part of the movie. But it was a minor item, and the way it turned out was pre-ordained and obvious from the get-go.<br/><br/>Kevin McNally as Gibbs was actually the character that I felt was the most authentic, but he was just dragged along for the ride, as it were, and really didn't have a part in the action.<br/><br/>For the rest, there are Spaniards and British who swashbuckle and flash swords at appropriate moments in the movie, but that's all they're really there for.<br/><br/>I know I'm swimming against the tide in saying this, but for me the movie just didn't work. In the climactic action sequence at the end, I found myself more concerned with how cramped and uncomfortable I was starting to feel in my theater seat than in how the movie was going to end.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I really can't recommend ""On Stranger Tides."" My suggestion: if you're hankering for a good action popcorn flick, skip this movie and watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" either of the first two Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movies, or check your cable channels for any other big-budget action movie of summers past.<br/><br/>...Or do something really original, and give the action flicks a miss; go spend some time with your family doing something more fun and more memorable on a beautiful summer weekend than watching a movie that is, in the end, predictable and forgettable."
"darkraven_109","5","0","2","30 May 2011"," Pale and flat compare to the predecessors
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is the latest addition to a franchise that I personally think ended at part three. In one word, the whole film was forced. But to say it was bad solely on the fact that it was forced is being too rash, rather it was actually fine when compared to most any other sequel (TERMINATOR SALVATION, anyone?). Overall, the film was mediocre. <br/><br/>The plot takes liberty in setting up a new adventure for Jack Sparrow since things seemed wrapped up in AT WORLD'S END and while this looks promising, it's not. The expedition to the Fountain of Youth is admittedly interesting on paper since this would branch deeper into pirate lore but what we get instead is a mash up of random ideas most probably thought up by kids. Ranging from vampire mermaids, zombies, a flamthrower ship that isn't even used that much again after its introduction and flying ropes of doom (easily the worst weapon on screen in years), the creativity that once surrounded the POTC franchise with so much intrigue and mystique has been thrown out the window in favor of kid-friendly crap (the Kraken and Barbossa's skeleton crew were definitely not kid friendly). <br/><br/>The characters didn't help much; even Depp who as always plays an effective character on screen can't do much to salvage the film from already being a disappointment. The rest of the cast all seem to be cartoon characters from a TV show about pirates stuck into a live action movie; either that or they were forgettable. Instead of pirates, we get joke characters who rely on humor or two dimensional villainy to make their presence felt. Barbossa has degraded as a character compared to his previous appearances but was still fun to watch while Angelica just wasn't engaging enough. <br/><br/>The worst offender has to be Blackbeard; when compared to Davy Jones, he could've been a wonderful contrast to the otherworldly Jones since he would just be a normal human being who was feared by everyone on the high seas. He could've been the pirate world's answer to the end of the supernatural age that ended when Davy Jones died but instead we get a clichéd, two dimensional old man who's trying desperately to be the villain. Blackbeard just appears in the scene acting evil; all he does on screen is flaunt about how weak the good are, how awesome he is as the bad guy and that's it. Thanks to this his actions are pretty predictable right up to the end. <br/><br/>Even the action wasn't much; I don't mind the fact that there are no ship battles anymore since the story concentrates on the expedition on an island but watching a bunch of stunts isn't that exciting. To make matters worse, the music seemed recycled. I know this is a small detail, but it was the music that made the first three films come to life and now that they're just recycling them, the magic is lost.<br/><br/>The film does have its moments though, some in humor, good dialogue or in a decent action sequence or two but overall the film was still a big disappointment. As a fan of the original trilogy, I feel that while this film still manages to maintain the feel and spirit of a PIRATES film, it was a downer. There was so much potential in the premise and the characters but in the end, all those element just couldn't add up and make a great film. If all you want is a time waster, then go ahead and check this out. Otherwise, stay away from it."
"cthulu48","7","0","2","30 May 2011"," Christian overtones spoiled the film for me. I'm only writing minor spoilers in this review.
","NOT MANY SPOILERS HERE.<br/><br/>Whenever a film delves 3 sequels deep and adds a new director and shuffles the cast around with key players missing, things just aren't going to be the same. The film tries its best, but there are a couple elements of the plot that pretty much spoiled the film for me upon my first viewing.<br/><br/>I guess I'm going to ruffle some feathers with my main beef with this film: The perfect, can-do-no-wrong, always forgiving and merciful hero character of Philip the Clergyman. I realize this is a Disney movie, and morals play a big part in all of the company's films. However, I found the Christian character Philip the Clergyman to be over the top in his perfection as a moral crusader. Without going into too much detail, every character in the film is a complete scoundrel with the exception of Philip. Every statement or action taken from this character blatantly rubs your face in Christianity as infallible and the saving grace of every aspect of the ugliness of the pirates. It got to the point of being sickening when the mermaid was captured in order to use her tears to obtain use of the Fountain Of Youth. The ONLY character who has any problem with the way the mermaid slave is treated is Philip. He is her savior, so to speak (and literally), throughout the film, even though she tried to take him out earlier in the film (the forgiveness factor, of course.) He takes mercy on her and defies ALL the surrounding pirates in their quest to use the mermaid. I agree with the morals of Christianity for the most part, while I don't believe in the supernatural aspects of the faith. What I don't like is that the Christian element of the film is not handled subtly AT ALL. It's in-your-face, every time the character crosses the screen or speaks. We are introduced to the character as he is hoisted and tied up on the boat against his will (hmm... sounds familiar to a certain crucifixion to me), and then proceeds to defy and challenge all the pirates, including Blackbeard (who's supposed to be the most ruthless pirate on the sea), with no reprisals. The overall message: If you aren't Christian in this film, you're a scoundrel. Personally, I found it poorly executed and unnecessary. No need for religious overtones in this film.<br/><br/>Another small problem I had with the plot: When the crew meets with Captain Jack Sparrow to discuss Blackbeard (before we are introduced to him in the film), every crew member says that they've never seen him (or have hardly ever seen him) because he never comes out of his room. Shortly thereafter, Blackbeard emerges as chaos envelopes the ship (which is fine, since there was a ""mutiny"" going on at the time), but then he spends the rest of the film out of his room and alongside all the other pirates, quite contrary to the discussion that is being held by Jack Sparrow and the crew of Blackbeard's ship when we are told that Blackbeard is hardly ever seen. I think if we saw less of Blackbeard in this film, the character would've been more powerful and it would've made the pirate meeting make sense. I just kept thinking throughout the film, ""I thought he never comes out, what gives? He's everywhere!"" <br/><br/>If you are a ""Pirates"" fan, give the film a chance. The action is ever-present and well executed. Johnny Depp is on point again (although he is becoming a bit of a stunt-actor in these films as more and more sequels emerge), and although I personally cannot stand Penelope Cruz, I will give credit where credit is due. She has a good performance and has great chemistry with Depp. Blackbeard isn't as dastardly as I was hoping. This is a bit of a disappointment since he's supposed to be the most feared pirate on the sea. Geoffrey Rush is good in his role-reversal this time around, although I enjoyed his character much more when he was a straight-up pirate. And a small appearance by Keith Richards is great. My main problem with the film is a personal beef (the overt Christian message), which may not have any effect on your enjoyment of the film. For fans, it's worth a view for sure, but there are some disappointing elements. I'd call it the ""worst"" installment in the series, but that doesn't make it unbearable. In fact, it's a fun movie going experience. That's about as deep as it goes for me though, since I'm not digging the Christian stuff. Judge for yourself, but if you're Christian, it would be better not to judge the people who made the film if you don't like it. I here tell that there are severe punishments in your religion if you are judgmental towards people.<br/><br/>5 out of 10."

","This review will not contain any spoilers. I was very excited before going to this movie, thinking that it might bring it back to the original form with some 3d effects. The first movie was one that I loved more than anything but after getting through this movie, I felt that I left disappointed.<br/><br/>I ended up thinking about what they could have done differently. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has always been one of my favourite character in these movies. It ended up not working out so well in my opinion. FIt just felt like they just had the main character acting as a comic relief with no one good enough to make it work in the cast. The synergy just wasn't there. In the 3 earlier movies he had Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom by his side. It gave it a kinda flow and chemistry that worked. Now they tried the same thing with Penélope Cruz <br/><br/>Another thing is that the boat rides are just fantastically boring. In the first movie, it gave the viewers a kinda feeling, That the time and plot actually moved forwards. In this movie I felt more bored than anything, cause it was just being used as a way of transportation instead of taking into account that this actually is a pirate movie. <br/><br/>However the movie did have some good parts as well tho. It is funny from time to time, and has some decent special effects. It's a movie to watch, but I wouldn't go in there with high expectations. Just try and enjoy it for what it is, a blockbuster.<br/><br/>Hope this review was helpful, rate it for some unbiased critic. Christopah out 6/10"
"good-decision","6","0","2","29 May 2011"," Just for Johnny Otherwise Wait for Rental
","The movie lacks the ""wow"" moments of previous movies. It's completely lacking in imagination this time. In fact, at some points it was very boring. I love Johnny Depp and he had some very funny lines in this movie to keep it alive. Everyone else was acting as if they were bored or forcing it. The mermaids looked gorgeous but for some reason, the one that acted the major part as a mermaid was the one with the least beauty of them all. The twists in the plot ended right were they began and were completely needless/useless. If you are a die-hard Depp fan, watch it. If you love the effect, the fantasy, the adventure, the imagination that filled the first 3 POTC, skip skip skip away... Some of the few questions that really irritated me throughout the movie (all to do with the stupid writing I am afraid) are: - Why will the Spanish chase and scheme for the entire movie to find the Fountain of Youth even though all they wanted to do was destroy ""the pagan"" monument? Is this the best use of money they can think of? - Why did they not really decide if mermaids can live with or without water? (doh?), now she can walk, now she can't. Now she needs water, now she doesn't. - When the mermaid (who obviously has some healing powers and CAN live outside water) professes her love for the priest, why does she drown him to the depth of the sea? Or does he have gills we haven't been told about? - Penelope is a gorgeous talented woman. But in this movie, she could have been anybody really. In fact, Zoe Saldana was way way more impressive even though she occupied way less screen time. - With such an evil dad, who gives a heck if he is saved or not? Such a hateful character that nobody wanted him rescued nor cared if they found the fountain or not. - When the fountain was found, is this all the imagination they could come up with? Two columns and some algae? Well, Depp was great and the pop corn was good."

","I wanted to like this story, I really did. There were simply too many elements of the original story left out. The dynamics of the scoundrel in waiting in Orlando Bloom and the sexual tension of Kiera Knightly were both sorely missed in this film. Even the quirky interactions with the ships crew were absent, and took away from the charm of the film. Yes, Depp is the star but it is the interaction with those characters that express the greatness of the ""Jack Sparrow"" character. Without them the acting was flat. <br/><br/>Plus the constantly changing Barbosa character is making me dizzy and Penelope Cruz was just a pretty straw man. The ending was stuffed with feel good one liners.<br/><br/>The movie had a few laughs, but I missed the old characters and the new ones didn't make up the distance."

"TheRagingBull94","7","0","1","28 May 2011"," Entertaining but faulted installment that will please fans of the franchise
","As a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, I was anticipating this movie ever since the title was announced. I finally got around to seeing it yesterday and found that while I did enjoy it, it lacked the adventurous qualities of the first 3 films and had some flaws that really should have been fixed.<br/><br/>To keep the story brief and not give away spoilers, the film takes place after the third movie and follows Captain Jack Sparrow searching for the Fountain of Youth only to discover that a feared pirate named Blackbeard and his daughter, Angelica are after it too.<br/><br/>Naturally, Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Jack Sparrow. It's one of the defining roles of his career and one of the main reasons these movies were great. The other positives of this movie are an interesting new character in Angelica, played well by the gorgeous Penelope Cruz and she has and interesting relationship with Jack, an opening scene that pulls you in right away and good ending.<br/><br/>The negatives of the movie however are as followed. Ian McShane as Blackbeard. While he gives a solid performance, he simply doesn't fill the shoes of Barbossa, Davy Jones or Beckett from the previous installments. The film lacks a lot of the sword fights or ship battles that you'd expect from a movie like this and the movie also contains a subplot surrounding mermaids that is almost completely disposable. I also personally missed Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, but I can respect the writers for starting out on something more fresh.<br/><br/>Overall, the film has flaws and is the weakest Pirates of the Caribbean film so far, in my opinion, but it certainly does provide solid entertainment. Whatever problems exist here are likely just the fault of the new production crew. Rob Marshall is no Gore Verbinski. Just don't expect too much from On Stranger Tides and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>7/10."
"BigWhiskers","7","0","1","28 May 2011"," Somewhat disappointing
","The 4th POC outing while amusing in some spots is overall disappointing. The movie delivers some good action scenes but the plot and storyline seem to just be made up as they go along. Johnny Depp seems to be running out of steam , I mean how many times can he prance around and do the camp shtick when he has worked the best out of it already. We also have Geoffrey Rush at his ugly worst - I don't know why they kept Barbossa around since he wasn't much of a foil for Jack except in POC1 - he is more of a clown now in this movie and Rush's acting is well below his talent level. Ian McShane as Blackbeard also doesn't add much more other then to chew up the screen with his overacting. The chemistry between Depp and Penelope Cruz is non-existent and forced. At least with Keira Knightley it was much more wicked and fun ,with Cruz it's just going through the motions and getting paid. I read another review that Orlando Bloom and Knightley weren't missed at all. Maybe so but their chemistry was far better with Depp then Cruz,McShane and Rush are in this POC movie. The climatic fight at the fountain of youth is such a copout and also part of it with the Spanish Capt disbelieving it all and walking away after all that - makes no sense , nor does Jack and Gibbs walking away with a bag of ships in bottles with no clue as to how to get them out and of course that most likely is the setup for the inevitable sequel ,along with the fact that he left Blackbeards daughter on the same deserted desert island that he was left on with Knightley setting up her return as well , she has a voodoo doll of Jack that her father made so I'm sure that will figure into it as well. <br/><br/>7/10 - And that's being nice . This franchise may not be running out of steam financially as long as Depp is involved since he is the only reason people are going to see the movies however plot and story wise , they are really reaching - how many times can Jack go after mystical things and prance around - evidently at least 2 more movies ???"

","Jack is back. Which is not surprising seeing as the original trilogy racked up over $2.5bn in worldwide gross. Many, including myself, thought the franchise should've wrapped up after At World's End thanks to the increasingly convoluted story lines and the boredom setting in with a few of the characters. Well they've thrown Orlando and Keira overboard and now Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp – trying hard to be funny but failing) is setting sail on a new adventure. Chasing the fountain of youth, Sparrow must contend with Blackbeard (Ian McShane), old flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz – woeful) and the returning Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), along with bad dialogue, an uninspired plot and a massively bloated runtime. Fortunately the well-staged action sequences save this from drowning completely. Be sure to sit through the end credits if you're keen to see one final small scene. 2 out of 5"

I'll cut about six paragraphs of gushing by just listing what I liked and disliked.<br/><br/>Liked:<br/><br/>1. Johnny Dep. Gotta say it, he was brilliant. His chemistry with Penelope Cruz was perfect and was flawless as Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>2. The simpler plot line. The 2nd and 3rds' plot lines were so complicated it made the movie very difficult for me to understand. I had to watch them about forty times in order to get a vague thought of the general idea of the plot. <br/><br/>3. The fact they cut the old ideas and characters loose for the most part. They still had a few of the old jokes and the classic characters, but they didn't bring up the absence of some of the lesser characters like Orlando and Keira. <br/><br/>4. The fact that the missionary was shirtless for a good portion of the film. To say this film was with out eye candy was very untrue. Yum!<br/><br/>Disliked:<br/><br/>1. The slapstick stunts at times. There were several moments where I expected Jack to slip on a banana peel. <br/><br/>2. The apparent need to involve zombies in the plot. Really? They accomplished no necessary part in their roles.

As expected there is plenty of action from the start and Johnny Depp continues to fascinate me with his eccentric behavior and quirky accent. The storyline contains the usual elements of action, sword fights, romance and magic however for me, the visual effects did not amaze me as they did in the first two films.<br/><br/>The film lasts just over 2 hours and overall it was very entertaining and for a younger crowd I am sure it was fabulous but for me it was just a good film."
"Bungle-9","7","0","1","27 May 2011"," The critics get it wrong yet again
","I went in expecting to be disappointed, after the trashing the majority of the critics gave this movie. I came out quite happy actually, and so will you, probably.<br/><br/>While it's not on par with 'Curse' and not as humorous as the previous trilogy, it's still got more focus and less film-flam than the last two entries. At two hours it might seem a little long, but it's all full of story - a straightforward, focused story that maintains pace and direction throughout. The start is a little fuzzy, but by half way through the train is well on the right track.<br/><br/>Nice.<br/><br/>Most of the jokes fall to Depp who does a stirling job with Sparrow, whilst the tone of the rest is somewhat more adult, by which I mean ""grown-up"" as opposed to anything else. Less silliness. That's not a bad thing - I found the more adult nature of the film to be quite satisfying. There is plenty of adventure to be had here.<br/><br/>It also doesn't have Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom in it. Another plus.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz is feisty and sexy and everything Knightley wasn't, though if anything Ian McShane could have been a lot more intimidating than he was. That said, he was adept at barking orders and being reasonably menacing, though his relationship with his ship could have been expanded a little. Geoffrey Rush made the most of his diminished role, and the way his story is resolved, despite it looking a little silly at the start, is quite neat.<br/><br/>All in all this is a satisfying entry into the series and proof yet again of how the cynical critics are out of touch with the wider audience."
"dblade1","7","0","1","26 May 2011"," got rid of Bloom and Knightley but still not enough
","The movie is much like its predecessors. It is full of awkward comedy, many clichés and it has overlength.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Depp was always a great actor and in this movie, he has proved it. Some of the awkward comedy was really... awkward, but with his performance, it was forgivable. Cruz is amazing as well. She plays her role so well, it blows my mind. She is like a pirate women should be. The other cast from the previous movies are much the same they were. However, the biggest disappointment was the villain Black Beard. He was so boring. There are so many questions without answers about this character. He seems like a bad guy but i am totally not buying it from his appearance. But thumbs up to those mermaids, they looked freaking awesome. I like the fact that they completely changed the way people think of mermaids and turned them into aquatic vampires. big plus there.<br/><br/>returning to the story, it has many plot holes and ""action-movie-clichés"". First part, i am not a fan of people using their guns as a bat, and no i don't mean that flying screeching animals. That just makes no sense if they just hit people with those guns. Worst is the fact that the soldiers are stupid, they whether watch Sparrow escape or 6 of them get caught by Sparrow just running through them. The other thing are those unnecessary scenes. There are so many of them and they really don't have any point. They are just lengthen the long movie.<br/><br/>So, if you give a damn, for me this movie wasn't so good as Pirates 1. But to be honest, even though i didn't love 2 and 3 as much as 1, but i liked them. I had a good time watching them. I am probably not going to watch those again, but i enjoyed them. So i rate the 4th Pirates movie like 2+3, 7 points out of 10 are more than enough.<br/><br/>thanks for reading and i apologize for grammar mistakes, i am not a native English writer nor speaker."
"mr-brown01","7","0","1","26 May 2011"," A Successful Reboot, That Be Our Path!
","After the third installment of the ""Pirates"" franchise brought nothing but disappointment to the public, On Stranger Tides brings forth a fresh new sea breeze, and ultimately saves the series from drowning to Davey Jone's locker.<br/><br/>For starters, I highly approve of the editing of characters, from the introduction to brand new pirates, to the goodbye of some unneeded luggage from the previous trilogy. Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlanda Bloom) overstayed their welcome in the first three Pirate films, and now finally we can be reassured with new, more interesting characters in Stranger Tides.<br/><br/>Among the new crew, Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz) is brought on board. Her phenomenal acting talent, as well as her attractiveness successfully take over Knightley's position, and actually represents a believable pirate as opposed to Governess Elizabeth Swan transforming into a pirate lord. Give me a break.<br/><br/>Taking over for Davy Jones is the well-known, menacing Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Stranger Tides provides great depth into Blackbeard's true darkness, and in my opinion gives us one of the most truly evil antagonists in film.<br/><br/>As for returning characters, what's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Jack... Pardon me, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Sparrow pretty much continues right where he left us off: in search of the fountain of youth, without his beloved Black Pearl, and still causing nothing but havoc among everyone around him.<br/><br/>Also in search of the fountain is Blackbeard, showing no mercy towards his expendable men in order to obtain its power of eternal life. Sparrow tags along with Blackbeard, in hopes to somehow find the fountain before Blackbeard.<br/><br/>And wait, there's more! Mermaids and zombies and Spaniards, oh my! On Stranger Tides gives so many obstacles for Jack Sparrow to encounter, and overall provides a thrilling adventure that is just as good as Curse of the Black Pearl. I believe the filmmakers made just the right moves to use the proper characters and just the right amount of action and adventure, which ultimately creates a believable story to follow and enjoy. The only question is, will there be a fifth Pirates movie to come, and can this same, simple flow be kept still for a new trilogy? Oh, and as always, stay after the credits."

"nEoFILM","8","0","1","26 May 2011"," Return to form
","Based, believe it or not, loosely, on the Tim Powers novel, On Stranger Tides, Pirates 4 seemed about as appealing as hole in the head after the diabolical sequels to the excellent first outing. Then it was to be in 3D, scrap several key characters and shed the direction of Gore Verbinski, in favour of Chicago's, Rob Marshall. A recipe for disaster? It seemed that way.<br/><br/>Though saying that, Gore had certainly sealed his fate with me, turning what was a well conceived, action adventure romp with some very memorable characters into an unnecessary epic saga which seriously missed the point and derailed itself. One dubious decision taken in the production of Dead Man's Chest, was to keep Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly's characters, let alone giving them so much prominence.<br/><br/>Knightly was fine, for the first film,. in fact, she was spot on, but she couldn't carry the role any further and began to look ridiculous as the series progressed. This should have been the adventures of Jack Sparrow, so excellently portrayed by Johnny Depp, and Geoffrey Rush's, Barbossa was the perfect pirate. So I was more than pleased to see the continuing adventures of these two characters, with Depp, returning to form after I felt that he had lost it in the sequels.<br/><br/>Penélope Cruz was another pleasant surprise, as never being a fan of her's, I was dubious but this was casting done properly. She was more than convincing as a pirate and put Knightly's efforts to shame. But what of Ian McShane's Blackbeard? Well, another great showing from him, but the inexplicable magic displayed as he waves in his 3D sword around and points it at the camera to remind us that 3D is here, not so much.<br/><br/>But the 3D was pretty naff. You could watch most of the film without the glasses, with the effect being limited to several sequences. It looked good, it was inoffensive and unobtrusive but what was the point again? I don't think that this film will do 3D any real harm but that's because nobody really noticed it in the first place.<br/><br/>The sense of adventure from the The Curse Of The Black Pearl was evident here and long over due. I find it puzzling as to why so many reviews have been so harsh, branding it boring, overly complicated and not pulled together properly, but I would disagree. Granted, it is a bit scrappy, it's not going to be used as case study in tight scripting, or deep character development and it is somewhat derivative, but it was fun, flashy and flamboyant.<br/><br/>Isn't this what these films are all about? Depp created a classic character with Sparrow back in 2003, and tough I felt that he was a one trick pony, Sparrow that is, not Depp, this was a partial return to form, under new direction from Marshall. But I am left feeling that no matter how much I enjoyed this for what it was, the first Pirates Of The Caribbean was a film which successfully transferred a theme park ride into a career defining blockbuster, but I feel that it should have remained one film, a single triumph and not a franchise that has been saved in my eyes, by the fourth installment."

I gotta say, it's good, BUT, not that good. The goodness of the London chase sequence still had the pirates feel, but after that it falls short of the first 3 films, where the hell did Barbossa's leg go?, yes he explains it, but i would prefer to have seen it happen, give us a flashback even. The soundtrack still hits the high notes when it needs to, especially when Depp and Cruz duel, it reminded me of Jack and Will in the 1st movie when the music matches the sword play. Which leads me to the cast, the casting of Penelope Cruz is genius as Jacks love interest, she looks so hot in this movie its unbelievable, Keira who? Ian Mcshane is brilliantly cast as Blackbeard, but why the hell did they kill him off? Surely he could have been as prominent a figure as Davy Jones although he didn't figure until the 2nd of the trilogy, questions need answering, where did Blackbeard get his seamingly power to control his ships components? and where and when did he get the collection of ships in bottles? Sure, Jacks got em now, but how does he release em, so thats the next sequel in whats gotta be another pirates trilogy i guess. I have a theory, somehow bring Blackbeard back, because he's the only one who can release the ships in the bottles?"

This movie becomes darker with 3D glasses, I miss the splendorous view of the blue lit ocean and green islands here and there. The story lacks the Pirate kick barely involving Jack Sparrow as the lead artist. I miss the crew, the one eyed guy and his mate, lack of the usual wit in dialogs. The sea mermaids were making the story too much of a fantasy story rather than a Pirate action movie. What's the point in selecting Penelope Cruz with so little role tagged to her, any artist could have played her role and put the hype to rest.

","I was harboring a disappointed heart after watching this film in cinema, a 3D version, even though I had not laid a high expectation on this one, in any case it is the fourth installation within 10 years, together with the franchise's downhill path, On Stranger Tides doesn't have any chance to breakthrough and revive its fame.<br/><br/>Firstly, the script lacks its appealing vigor while the interwove plots are too disorganized to handle (particularly the limited screen time and omitted introduction of the Spaniard's team, which abruptly left the audience heads in the clouds), and I was also keen to find out how all the money had been spent, sad to say that only the man-eating mermaids bring some freshness and could be ranked as a gratifying discovery. The special effects are merely served to fulfill their original functions here (which simply attests that they really spent tons of doughs instead of appropriating them into their own pockets), let alone to be visually impressive or mentally inspiring. The 3D effect could not save it (like Thor, I don't know why the hue is always so dark as to some scenes are beyond recognition). <br/><br/>Speaking of the actors, Jack Sparrow's idiosyncratic personality is being way over-exploited, and his new love interest Penelope Cruz is not at her best state, the chemistry between was looming but never had really accomplished. a extended screen time of Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa solely causes him unreasonably abominable, Ian McShare has a dramatic opening as the evil Blackbeard, but very soon his character becomes preposterously ridiculous and will suffer the loss of credibility. Desperately, my only guilty pleasure comes from Judi Dench and Keith Richards' cameo. <br/><br/>Although I may pessimistically point out that the Pirates of the Caribbean series is on its own dooming destiny, the fact is that after its first week global release, its overall box-office is on fire right now (particularly overseas main markets and China is of course included), so predictably the fifth one will not be mission impossible, I have one suggestion, please fire director Rob Marshal, don't entitle him to further ruin the golden-signboard of Disney Films anymore!"

","'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The fourth Jack Sparrow swashbuckling adventure with Johnny Depp once again reprising the role. Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three 'PIRATES' films bowed out this time around. He's been replaced by Rob Marshall, who's former film experience is directing two highly acclaimed musicals ('CHICAGO' and 'NINE') and a romantic period piece ('MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA'). Also absent this time around are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert all returned (for the fourth time) to pen this installment. It's adapted from a book, 'On Stranger Tides', written by Tim Powers. The story revolves around a journey to find the 'Fountain of Youth'. Sparrow and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush also returning for the fourth time) are incorporated into the storyline and are pitted against Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz). The film is a little shorter and lighter weight than the others (the budget was a little slimmer and the film doesn't have quite as epic a feel). It certainly doesn't measure up to the fun of the first two films but I'd say it's equally as impressive as the third chapter.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Captain Sparrow attempting to locate an impersonator in London who has been ruining his 'good' name. He re-teams with his old first mate Gibbs (once again played by Kevin McNally) after rescuing him from execution, for crimes allegedly committed by Jack Sparrow. The two are captured though and Sparrow is taken to King George II (Richard Griffiths) who tasks him with the assignment of finding the 'Fountain of Youth' before the Spanish do. Barbossa is now working for the British Navy (after losing the Black Pearl) and is in charge of the mission. Jack escapes and soon learns his impostor is an old love interest named Angelica, who is working with her father (the notorious pirate Blackbeard) to find the 'Fountain of Youth' as well. They force Jack in to joining their crew (which includes men turned into loyal zombies) and help them on their journey. Will and Elizabeth are replaced this time around by a young missionary named Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), who is held captive on Blackbeard's boat, and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), also imprisoned by Blackbeard, that Swift falls for.<br/><br/>The film has most of the action and escapism thrills you'd expect from a 'PIRATES' movie. It's a little smaller scale and more simplistic than the other installments and therefore seems like kind of a step back for the series. Depp is just as quirky and funny as usual but Sparrow this time around is a lot less selfish and not nearly as much the antihero fans have come to know and love. Marshall's directing is adequate for this type of movie but it's not as impressive as Verbinski's. The film is not as convoluted a mess as the third chapter but it also lacks it's epicness and larger than life thrills. It probably won't disappoint die-hard fans of the series too much but it certainly doesn't live up to the first two installments. I've never been a huge 'PIRATES' fan but I've always respected the original two films as the fun classic swashbuckling adventures that they are. This film doesn't deserve the same kind of respect but it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the series.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5zRynRifs"
"griffolyon12","5","0","1","24 May 2011"," A Swashbuckler without the Buckle!
","Disney keeps sailing with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, sans-Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but the end result does little to change some of the underlying problems to the second and third installments. While the movie manages to keep from dipping into the levels of absurdity of the third film, On Stranger Tides lacks any real energy, excitement, character focus, or for that matter, character development. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns in classic Jack Sparrow action. His comedic beats still work as Jack embarks on an adventure to find the Fountain of Youth, where he runs into an old flame, Angelina (Penelope Cruz), who just so happens to be the daughter of the villainous pirate, Blackbeard (Ian McShane). As it is, this movie does not drown, but it barely stays afloat as the old characters do not go anywhere new, and the new characters are not given enough to do in the story. The potential in the relationship between Jack and Angelina was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie as we were supposed to start caring for these two new characters, a missionary and a mermaid, who just so happen to fall head over heels in love with just a few soap operaish looks to one another (I know, tough to believe). Series stalwarts, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush (Captan Barbossa from the first three) phone in their performances, while Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane look as if they had fun, and I guess that is what counts. Some of the action sequences are enjoyable to watch, in particular the spectacular mermaid attack sequence, but without strong sense of character, much of the action lacks excitement, thus it is hard to care anymore.<br/><br/>I give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides a 5 out of 10!"

I am not saying that the rest of the cast and crew don't give a great performance, I am just saying that McShane, and Cruz where excellent. <br/><br/>And the best part is, we finally got to see Captain Jack Sparrow having a little bit more of a spot light. And, again, don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the first three. But, I kinda feel like they where mostly about Bloom's and Knightley story, and without them in the way, we can get into more of a Pirate Tale.<br/><br/>If this turns out to be a new trilogy, I will gladly go out to see the next two films to follow."

Well its only Captain Jack Sparrow to be honest who has lived up to the expectation and Pirate Angelica also grabbed quite an attention from the spectators but rest of the crew somehow failed to impress, specially Barbossa in spite of being in the earlier parts. The new crew and members certainly could not make an impression on the viewers like the earlier crew.

"mimiisthename","6","0","1","23 May 2011"," Good but definitely not stellar!
","I must say, I had high expectations for this movie as there was a fresh new cast, a seemingly decently put together story idea and a new turn altogether.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is the one piece to this movie that makes it all worth while. Even with (in my opinion) a very lackluster script and apparently team of writers, Jack Sparrow and a few select others make it work. You will not be disappointed by the portrayal of his character. He is still witty Jack, getting himself into heaps of trouble and finding creative ways to rid himself of his own messes BUT other characters do not share the same quality performance.<br/><br/>I partially blame the seemingly lame, crappy and shallow writing for this movie for the sub-par acting. I also believe that there were TOO many new characters introduced in this movie at once. I do realize that the departure of Bloom and Knightly make it somewhat necessary to replenish main cast members but the new cast members could barely establish their characters with the large number of new people being introduced.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz (Angelica) leaves nothing memorable to the viewer. I was expecting more from her character but I was disappointed. The acting by her was underwhelming and the impression she left was non-existent.<br/><br/>Ian McShane (Blackbeard) while a menacing villain left me wondering ""What was so great about him? He is no where near a comparable villain to someone like Davey Jones."" The worst part about Blackbeard's actual historical impact is the fact that he was only a pirate for one year. They could have chosen a historical person more worthy than that I think.<br/><br/>Sam Claflin (Phillip) is a character I enjoyed watching but did not really fit into the story line anywhere beyond the fact that he was captured and basically tortured by Blackbeard. Phillip is the character that is sort of the good that balances out the evils of most of the other characters and the bad intentions they have. The only problem I have with Phillip is it's very similar to Davey Jones and Calypso being in love. Phillip falls in love with the mermaid which was kind of eh.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) is a character that I absolutely love and feel is a vital part (like Jack) to the Pirates movies. I was horrified and upset that they turned his character into one that is ""good"". I couldn't believe they made him a naval captain for King George II. That's not him as a character and he seemed almost uncomfortable being portrayed that way. I also think the wooden leg thing is almost too stereotypical pirate crap. I am, however, glad that they portrayed him in the proper light toward the end of the movie. He just seemed more in character and generally most comfortable.<br/><br/>The mermaids while a wonderful addition and a vital part to the story had me laughing when they turned into vicious man-eating fish. It's sad to say that's the ""scariest"" part of this movie. They tried to zombify Blackbeards crew but I felt that was a failure. It's not very comparable to Barbossa's ""undead"" crew from the first movie, the Kraken in the second or the crew of Davey Jones in the second and third.<br/><br/>The Spainard in the movie didn't really add much. It sort of reminded me of a repeat of the second movie where a bunch of different people are trying to get Jack's compass. The Spanish, Barbossa, Sparrow and Blackbeard are all trying to get to the fountain of youth... trying to get there first for different reasons.<br/><br/>Despite the hiccups and bumps of this movie, I believe the movie was solid. Captain Jack Sparrow is as charming and witty as ever. All the characters really bring something interesting (whether good or bad) to the movie. The storyline is solid... the fountain of youth idea I think is a great one and the movie itself is great to watch. It's action packed and the 3D was pretty good. I think they left the movie off at a good spot... they could continue it or leave it as is. There are questions to be remained answered... I hope they make another one. I would gladly see it.<br/><br/>By the way make sure you stick around until after all the credits! Pirates of the Caribbean movies are notorious for adding a clip to the end of the movie... leave you wondering if they'll be more of them."
"Bloodwings","Null","0","1","23 May 2011"," On Stranger tides
","I've always been a great fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, and this one surely didn't disappoint. Though I had to admit the Real 3D did tire my eyes after a little while, it was definitely worth it. It seemed like I was actually on the exciting adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow and company to find the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>The new characters--Blackbeard, Angelica, Phillip and Syrena--were a very successful addition. They created a whole new fresh feeling to Jack's adventure, and all the actors' and actresses' performances were quite exceptional. Johnny Depp's role as Captain Jack was brilliant, as he portrayed many emotions such as excitement, deceptiveness, comedic, thoughtfulness, persuasiveness and much more. Also, Ian McShane, Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush's acting fit perfectly with Depp's performance. All in all, the actors' and actress' work was simply fascinating and made the film all the more exciting.<br/><br/>The plot itself is quite exciting and interesting as well, with a few witty tricks pulled off by none other than Captain Jack Sparrow. He travels through inconvenient encounters and enchanting yet dangerous waters in search of the Fountain of Youth. Several others, including Blackbeard, the King of England and the King of Spain also race each other to the Fountain, each of them driven by different reasons. All of this accompanied by unique, interesting, and some evil characters, On Stranger Tides is surely a Pirates film you don't want to miss."

I then when to see it and I thought it was very good. It was better than Dead Man's Chest and a lot better than At World's End. I thought by taking out the Will Turner and Elizibeth Swan was a good idea because it brought new blood into the movies and didn't make it seem like a crappy sequel,but a whole new movie. This Pirates of the Caribbean was definitely as good as the first one. When I saw the movie it kinda started out slow for me,but it then quickly picked up the pace with Blsckbeard and his daughter.

","No one should expect Pirates to be a deep and thought provoking shocker. The franchise is one of light, slapsticky entertainment .

Johnny Depp continues to mince his way around the screen and enjoy himself in the process. Ian McShane enjoys being wickedly bad.<br/><br/>There are some excellent one-liners in this, particularly from Judy Dench and of course Johnny Depp , whose parting words to Penelope Cruz should be the slogan of every slighted person, and drew a sharp intake of shocked breath in every woman in the audience .<br/><br/>Well worth going to see."
"cooljishi","7","0","1","23 May 2011"," ""A light-watch movie, with scintillating performances . Don't die for watching it in theaters, although , if you are a Depp fan, then its another story !""
","Capt. Jack Sparrow is back , and this time , a good ensemble cast follows him...each character , be it Barbossa, Angelica or Blackbeard - each one has their own story to tell , and, as they all follow the quest for the Fountain Of Youth, they enchant you with their stylish performances!<br/><br/>Especially, a note for Geoffrey Rush : What a fine actor he is! Hard to imagine that this very person had delivered a serious role of a speech therapist in ""The King's Speech""....he is funny, witty and is able to churn out something classy whenever he enters a scene.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz was as enticing as ever-seductive and sensible. it was impressive to see her pull off those fight sequences amazingly. And seriously, I am bowled over by her accent!<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was as splendid . He really has a thing for playing weird characters on-screen(we are talking Edward Scissorhands , Sweeney Todd, The Mad-Hatter, and of course, Jack Sparrow , among many others.. ). The way he delivers those one-liners, his expressions and ability to put eccentricity in the character, is simply amazing. Got to say, Jack Sparrow flows in his veins!<br/><br/>Ian McShane was appropriate as Blackbeard, although his relatively smaller screen space seems to be responsible in failing to showcase him as the most dangerous pirate ever lived(the viewers are just made to assume that fact when he first takes entry in the movie). A little bit more , perhaps , could have just done the trick.<br/><br/>For the plot, well, don't expect anything grand here, as it might be a disappointment then. Just sit back , (relax if you want to!! :P) and enjoy as the top-billed actors play around the whole time. The low point of the movie is, I would say, the plot. It seems a drag many a times in the movie , and this fact remains there since the third part. They makers are not at all working on the plots of the franchise but are solely depending on the casts (primarily on Depp) to pull off the show, else this would have been a treat for both easy-goers and critics alike. A little lesser action than the previous ones, POTC: 4 lags at its plot, way too much, after all this hype and hoopla.<br/><br/>Not much effort was put in the 3D facet, with very less CGI effects to watch out for. Although it was a treat to watch some scenes- Jack playing with a dewdrop , the brandishing of sword by Blackbeard, Jack jumping off the cliffs and the climax sequence etc. Plus , 100 bucks for 3D, i won't mind! ;)<br/><br/>Finally, a special word of accolade for Hans Zimmer : HE HAS CREATED A MASTER-PIECE OF A THEME-TUNE! I mean, at the end of each installment, I would wait for the ending credits to roll, and when the tune follows, it simply gives me goosebumps!<br/><br/>The conclusion: Watch the movie if you are a Depp fan, more if you are a Jack Sparrow follower. Don't expect much in the action or the plot. And watch out the slapstick and witty humor of the movie ,(the hollow peg leg scene, the stealth sequences , the escape sequence etc.) and the one-liners. Sequel is a possibility(sit through the credits and in the end, you will get the hint!). And for the fun,it gives you!"
"sitonpickle","6","0","1","23 May 2011"," Entertainment At It's Best
","First Jack Sparrow and our favorite pirates dealt with a curse from gold that makes you a zombie under the moon(Black Pearl), next they dealt with creatures that looked like a sperm whale's puke(Dead Man's Chest), then our pirates dealt with... A bunch of random things (World's End). Now in Stranger Tides, it's a race for the fountain of youth. With a load of new characters, and not a sight of William Turner or Casey Jones.<br/><br/>The one thing that everyone wants to see in this movie is another enjoyable watching of Jack Sparrow, who captures the fun of being a pirate for us all like a master. Johnny Depp delivers the performance everyone knows and love, with a number of humorous moments given from screen writer Ted Elliot, who wrote the first classic film (Curse Of The Black Pearl).<br/><br/>There are two ways of viewing this movie, you can watch it and enjoy it at it's own terms or compare it with the 3 previous Pirate movies. On the movie's own terms, it's great entertainment with sword fights around every corner, and tactical situations solved in goofy ways. The movie is loaded with improbable moments, such as the idea of an English ruler letting a pirate loose in his palace during a discussion about the Spanish.<br/><br/>In light of the franchise, the film wont compete with Curse Of The Black Pearl, but will sit roughly around the level of quality as Dead Man's Chest. At World's End not only was cheesy, it was incredibly weird and the story didn't really know what it wanted to do. In comparison, On Stranger Tides beats At World's End very much. Stranger Tides actually had a plot that stayed on track and wasn't extremely desperate and confusing.<br/><br/>Dead's Man's Chest was heavy on special effects, especially with big objects. The directer was Throwing what he can that looks action pack. Stranger Tides doesn't fall into that tiresome routine. <br/><br/>I was entertained while watching this movie, and any Pirates Of The Caribbean fan will be as well. A fan will be disappointed if he or she expects this movie to up the level of the first, or for that mater, even be as good as the first. I walked in the theater with the expectations that this was actually going to be worse then At World's End, and it wasn't. So I was pleased and enjoyed myself."
"chicka91","10","0","1","22 May 2011"," Thoroughly entertaining
","I'm a huge fan of the ""Pirates"" series, and although I had my doubts, I must say that ""On Stranger Tides"" was wonderful. The movie had a COMPLETELY different ""feel"" to it, and the story is new, with lots of new aspects, but it actually worked once you got used to it. It will be very easy to add on to it, with a more broad open-ended story. The cast, although with many additional characters, worked very well together. Johnny Depp was phenomenal as Jack Sparrow as usual. He wasn't necessarily the strongest character of the movie, but his humor, wit, and acting style were just as great as in the last 3 movies. After seeing the first three, his audience feels like they know his character, so even little personality quirks are hilarious without him even trying. He truly shines as good ole Jack!<br/><br/>The plot was not as complicated as in ""At World's End,"" but it was interesting none the less. I feel like the movie definitely could have been EVEN better if the newer characters were given a little more depth, or even given the chance to show more of their on-screen chemistry with each-other. Sometimes, the motives of each character to get to the Fountain of Youth was a little blurry, and in a couple of scenes, the characters talked VERY quietly, or mumbled/spoke too quickly to understand what they said. <br/><br/>I absolutely LOVED the scenes with Jack and Barbossa together-- SUCH good chemistry + hilarious! Blackbeard was a good addition as a villain, although he wasn't near as ""mean/cruel/wicked"" as Davy Jones was. The characters of Philip and Syrena were a little on the weak side. Philip needed much more to his backstory to make me feel attached to him, but he still did a great job.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was GREAT. I loved it, and it went above and beyond my expectations. I will forever love CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow!! Go see it if you liked the others!"

So I had my doubts going into 'Stranger Tides'<br/><br/>In this new adventure, Sexy wonder of the World, Capt Jack Sparrow is off on a quest to find the fountain of youth. We see many characters of Pirates past and new faces with new villains. Ian McShane is superfluous as Blackbeard. His depiction in the movie is wonderful. Johnny Depp is on queue, as always. The Romantic story of a handsome religious zealot, falling for a beautiful and dangerous mermaid is AWESOME! <br/><br/>The last piece of the recipe, which remains to be scene (pun intended) is Penelope Cruz, as Angelica opposite Sparrow. I'm not certain I'm convinced of her caliber playing opposite such an icon. We will see as this franchise sets sail once again. I believe (and hope) that this film will run the course of the first in theaters, gaining popularity as time goes on with even bigger box office busters to follow. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie as someone who loved the first 'Pirates' film, still purchased the 2nd and 3rd.

That Johnny Depp (and every cast member for that matter) gave a poor performance, that the humor was lacking, and the whole darn thing just stale.......it wasn't until I realized that all the people trashing it had also trashed 2 and 3 that I decided to go see it and ignore what I was hearing. And I have to say, I was right to listen to myself.<br/><br/>Long story short for anyone who is on the fence....if you like the Pirates trilogy, then this movie is for you. Johnny Depp was fantastic yet again, and brings Jack Sparrow to life as no other actor could. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, and while Im generally not a big fan of Geoffry Rush, I have to say this one was in all likelihood his best performance in the series to date. Ian McShane did at times come off as a bit flat, but overall did a nice job of portraying a villain that I think is just different from what the series has had to date. If you ask me, I don't think Blackbeard was meant to be this highly explosive emotional source of pure evil that the series has seen in the past.....I kinda felt like they were going more for an evil character who is just flat out cold......cold and uncaring to the core.<br/><br/>The rest is as you would expect from this series. The humor was exactly in line with what the series has seen to date, and there was probably more action then you might expect as well. The Camera was a little off at times, but hell, if the Bourne Ultimatum can have the ridiculous camera work that it had and still be as great as it was, I see no reason why that should keep you from seeing this movie. If you were not so fond of the other Pirates films however......don't hold your breath, because this is more of the same."

While I have to say that I've enjoyed all of the films so far Dead Man's Chest and At World's End both felt entirely too long, convoluted, and overall full of pointless subplots that didn't go anywhere. On Stranger Tides is a remedy to this as it goes back to some of the principles of the first film as Jack Sparrow rushes to find the fountain of youth before the Spanish and British navies can get to it first. On Stranger Tides also introduces us to an almost entirely new cast made up of Ian McShane, Penelope Cruz, and Sam Clafflin who play Blackbeard ""the pirate all pirates fear"", Angelica; Sparrow's new love interest, and Phillip Swift; a missionary who falls in love with a mermaid.

Yeah, Geoffrey Rush was here in make-up that made him less recognizable but this was Johnny Depp's movie without any doubt because he was the most recognizable face in the cast, and maybe that was the idea. Ian McShane was the perfect Blackbeard. He was Blackbeard as one would imagine him to be. The other characters we've never met before and didn't feel a whole lot for. As in the first three the FX were spectacular and maybe a little effusive. We never had this much ""magic"" or fantasy before but maybe that took the place of the missing familiar characters. A lot more talky than we would like. In fact it reminded me a little of Matrix Reloaded. 6 out of 10 for me because it didn't have the same sizzle as we're used to in this franchise."

","What started amazingly with The Curse of the Black Pearl, was carried forward remarkably by Dead Man's Chest and ended astoundingly by At World's End (though many people may beg to differ), staggers a lot with On Stranger Tides. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides rests solely on Captain Jack Sparrows' shoulders, because its other characters are hazy enough and do not let their presence being felt. A huge disappointment being Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who fails to deliver as the feared pirate he's supposed to be. The movie opens with a map being found, and then we directly jump to London, where Gibbs has been imprisoned by the British. A major distress over here was Captain Jack Sparrows' entry, unlike previous movies, where Jack's entry oozed awesomeness, here it lacks big time. After it, for around 30-40 minutes, it's just swords clashing, people escaping, witty fight dialogs, and everything you had already witnessed in the previous movies. Half way into the movie, you wish it were less of fighting and more on content, but the clashing goes on and on. Except for a few sequences like the Mermaid Hunt, which is brilliantly executed, rest all somehow feels a repetition of the earlier movies in the merchandise. The movie does deliver on the story premise too, but only in the later portions, where you can actually guess (if you're a Pirate's fan like me) what is going to happen. The climax is somewhat anticipated, but not from far. And as always it leaves scope for another sequel. The witty one-liners of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) are quite few, which might bring chuckles to your faces, but still being compared to what we've seen earlier, one would be disappointed to a large extent. Angelica (Penelope Cruz) is a character which could've been explored further, but amidst all the gunshots she comes across just as another coat of gloss added to shine. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) makes impression and does deliver up to his wicked reputation. Blackbeard (Ian McShane) as I'd mentioned earlier fails to make you shiver as the evil pirate, whom all pirates fear. Comparing his image with what Barbossa had in The Curse of the Black Pearl, or what Davy Jones had in Dead Man's Chest, he does not seem someone who is even remotely feared. Philip (Sam Claflin) and Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), who are a part of a small sub-plot are okay and don't have much to offer. The only character which has been utilized to full extent seems to be Jack Sparrow, who is the only reason this film needs to be seen. He's excellent, in the escape sequences (which I believe were a little far-fetched) and does bring that quirky smile on your faces with his antics and his sharp lines. The romance between the lead pair is cold and one gets really confused whether Jack 'actually' loves Angelica or not. Overall the movie falters as it's got glossy action sequences but a weak plot and average performances. All it needed was a little character improvisation and crisp script, and it could easily have at least lived up to the movies prior in this series. Though I watched it in 2D, I doubt whether 3D actually does any good. There are very few scenes which portray good use of 3D technology. Director Rob Marshall clearly, bombed as compared to Gore Verbinski (Director of previous 3 Pirate movies). Even if one does not compare it with the previous three movies, this one is just an average masala gun-trotting fare. I would give it 3 out of 5, simply because it's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie and Johnny Depp deserves it, none the less!"

","Let me get this out of the way first: Pirates 4 is not a bad movie. It's just not as crazy, silly and entertaining as the other three are (yes i'm even a fan of the third installment though i had to watch it twice to get it). First: it is supposed to play in the Carribbean- but where is the Carribbean? Scenery-wise i felt at times i was watching an episode of Lost, all jungle-ish. Plus i expected a little more sea-action. Whats the point in watching a pirates movie if they don't do ""piratey"" stuff?!<br/><br/>""Johnny Sparrow"": this is not a typo. Johnny D. owns the part by now but he isn't really in his best form. My guess: all the crazy Sparrow is was enhanced by the presence of Will and Elizabeth (albeit to a lesser degree) who represented the ""normal"" world and especially wooden Will provided Sparrow with the moments to shine i.e. Wills naive approach to all things vs. Sparrows fiendishly cleverness . With these two absent the movie suffers from one big problem: it has no heart (and a lot less eye-candy)Concerning the Orlando/keira-stand-ins (aka priest and mermaid)Why not take the originals? They did a far better job than these two completely forgettable actors with the charisma of chopsticks. Blackbeard: so this is the most menacing pirate ever? Yawn. just because black is his favorite clothing-colour doesn't mean he is menacing. But he is a master at the wild eye-rolling technique. Kristen Stewart, take note. My summary: the filmmakers should have gone with what works: The chemistry between the leads. It's not like people expect a revelation from this movie they want to see the characters they come to love."
"oafling-1","Null","0","1","20 May 2011"," Poor Tim Powers
","It's a shame Tim Powers' wonderful book is in any way associated with this buffoonery. One of the most interesting, intriguing, thought-provoking, and engaging writers out there will remain over-looked by the vast majority if they think this is what he's all about. Powers has written a number of very interesting and very well-written books and people should try to find some of them and read them. Obviously, the great sausage factory that is Disney, as well as the majority of American cinema, used the book because of its compelling title. It would be wonderful to see some of his other works actually brought to the screen by someone not doing a children's movie-""Declare""; ""The Stress of Her Regard"";, ""Three Days to Never""; ""Last Call""; ""Expiration Date""; ""Earthquake Weather"", etc. are all great. Now THOSE are movies a competent, thinking person's director should make."

","Similar to the original in mood and tone,this movie is definitely better than the third movie in the series.But not the best in the series.<br/><br/>Its strictly average,even for hardcore Johnny Depp fans.<br/><br/>This movie has wafer thin storyline,little action,little comedy and nothing feels complete.<br/><br/>Everywhere on the screen you see Jack Sparrow and little of other characters.<br/><br/>Even his character has got nothing new to offer! Just the usual witty(is it still witty at all?) last minute escapes.<br/><br/>Even the Visual effects weren't awesome or anything,just OK.The third movie does a better job in that category. Just another movie sequel that is made for squeezing money!"
