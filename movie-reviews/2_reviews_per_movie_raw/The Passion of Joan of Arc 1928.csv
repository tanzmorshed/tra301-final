"Quinoa1984","10","123","135","7 February 2004"," an incredible directorial vision, and a devastating lead in Falconetti, make this one of the greatest achievements in all celluloid
","Carl Th. Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.<br/><br/>And it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It's all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.<br/><br/>There have been many before me who have praised Falconetti's performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must've felt watching Theron in the recent 'Monster'. I didn't even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer's guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti's eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion. <br/><br/>For me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That's the kind of effect that Dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I'm not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage. Love Joan or hate her, this is for keeps."
"nycritic","10","76","85","2 August 2005"," When Film Becomes Transcendental Art.
","It so often happens that some films take the long way to achieve their status of classics and worthy of being studied, frame by frame, by movie lovers who believe in the power of raw performance and skilled direction of cameras to depict a powerful visual set of images. When one sees films like VERTIGO which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century, it only shows that film, as an art, doesn't need a golden statuette to have merit, and when it's done exceptionally well, it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe.<br/><br/>Carl Theodore Dryer, to me, created what I believe is, alongside Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE, the most powerful black and white film in cinema history. It would be difficult indeed to say which one is better since both films are landmark in their own cinematic styles and have been dissected frame by frame. Dryer's film has been criticized for either being a pretty collection of still images or being pure visual power: I choose the latter, because in watching THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, I felt not only the extremely uncomfortable intimacy between Joan and her tormentors, but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked, cross-examined, humiliated, and burned at the cross. There is an unearthly beauty in Falconetti's face as she goes through the ringer of emotions not in the overacting style typical of the Twenties but in a completely modern way, as if she were living a reality so far removed from the corrupted priests who bash and condemn her, and her reality would therefore be dangerous to their own beliefs.<br/><br/>And what a stroke of genius, I think, to have the lighting on her face be soft, gentle, in contrast to her detractors who are always lit in harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness and betrays their ""devotion"" to God as mere politics. Dryer's style of cutting from one actor to the other is also different, and makes this film a surrealist experience, an unsettling, abstract tour through transcendental suffering. There are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is the story taking place (although we don't need to know after reading the transcripts), but we never are allowed as viewers a moment of rest from this suffocating intimacy between Joan and her inquisitors. Some bizarre shots and camera angles give the ending an even more disturbing and horrifying element of what we perceive as a gross injustice to what was a person who held her own beliefs and did not need the Church to sustain it.<br/><br/>Falconetti never did a film before this one and never returned to film acting after this. I have not read much about her, except that she lived in Argentina until her death in 1946. I sometimes wonder why she didn't act again (although she was known to be an accomplished theatre actress more known for comedies than drama) but those are the mysteries of actors who don't have the star ego and only make a few films. She came, only did this masterful performance, and left just as suddenly, and those who re-discovered this film and restored it to its full quality have to be commended for allowing us, who have come almost 80 years later, to experience the power of subtle acting."
"GulyJimson","10","144","168","27 December 2004"," When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror.
","What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it's importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film's technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer's direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d' Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.<br/><br/>""La Passion of Jeanne d'Arc"" is stark, radiant, exalted, simple, (but never simplistic), and ultimately sublime. The rest is silence."
"looneyfarm","10","108","128","1 March 2005"," Devastating but brilliant masterpiece
","It's easy to overlook this movie. For modern audience and especially my generation (I'm 21), this movie is just close-ups of a crying woman and grumpy old men. But of course that's like saying Mona Lisa is just a picture of a woman, or The Last Supper is dudes eating. If you experience it with open mind, The Passion of Joan of Arc will give you one of the most profound visions of devotion, faith and martyrdom.<br/><br/>I must confess, even I thought the praise of The Passion was too good to be true when I began to watch it. But when the film ended, I wasn't just impressed, I was completely devastated. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a downright amazing realization of Joan's last moments. There's not a hint of sentimentality, and still I was in tears. Yep. Call me a pansy, but this is one of the very few movies that had that impact on me.<br/><br/>I don't know what else to say about this movie, sorry. The Passion of Joan of Arc counts as the most upsetting movie experience I've ever had, but it's definitely a positive one. On the contrary to what the other commentators have said, you don't have to be religious to be receptive in front of this movie. Believe me, I'm a hardcore atheist. If you're going to see this film -- I sure hope you do -- make sure it's accompanied with the Voices of Light soundtrack, which doesn't just fit the film well, but is amazing as a standalone composition, too. I can guarantee you won't look cinema the same way again."
"judokid","10","56","65","16 September 1999"," timeless in every sense
","I saw this a few months ago on the big screen, just after Nosferatu, another silent classic. Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.<br/><br/>My eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense."
"edantes2000","10","65","77","21 May 2004"," Falconetti is amazing!
","A certain amount of credit must surely be paid to the director for the genius of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.' The daring camera angles, use of incessant close-ups and peculiar authenticity all may be attributed to Carl Th. Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer's gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti's mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne's native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr's reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti's Jeanne."
"zeph-3","10","60","71","11 March 1999"," Falconetti's face is sublimely human
","I saw this film for the very first time last week and was so tremendously captivated by it that I needed to share this rapture. The innovative camera-angles, the close-ups revealing pain and spirituality. It elevates the human condition and the Art of film. I would love to be able to go on into the whys or hows or technicalities. But my words couldn't do the film justice for the imagery still overwhelms me."
"checyn","Null","30","37","16 September 2004"," Sensory Shift
","This film almost leads one to believe that sound betrays the emotion the eyes capture. Just as the blind develop hearing far better than the average, the deaf develop a keen sense of sight. I am convinced that a lack of dialogue forces us to read the language of the face and body, a verbage unmatched in beauty and nuance. Though the accompanying musical piece (be careful not to identify it as a score), so deliciously inspired by the film, enhances the visual playground; it is the actors' faces that comprise this tour de force. Ms. Falconetti shifts from worry and doubt to unabashed conviction in a single shot, giving the viewer the luck of seeing one's thoughts in progress. She needs no response to the interrogation, it's all in her face. Renee is not superficially beautiful and the lack of make-up only reinforces how bare Joan is, but it is the uncanny ability of an incomparable stage actor to be a window into the soul that makes her so stunning, for the soul we see is one we only wish to attain for ourselves. The Church sees what we see, and they respond just as clearly to her unspoken protest with vehement pomp. The cinematography is so astounding for its time no comment could ever do it justice. Though many comments can be made, and are, surrounding the inspiration and detail for the set, it is at its core an incredible gift from Dreyer to the actors meant to inspire. It plays little part in the film, but to pull an inconceivable last drop of reality from the actors. A testament I can imagine will never be matched to the incredible power of silence."
"pooch-8","Null","36","46","29 July 1999"," Dreyer's masterpiece one of cinema's greatest artistic triumphs
","One of the last great silent films made during the advent of sound, Carl-Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a haunting, riveting portrait of the historical martyr based on documentation from the original trial.  Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations that doomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups to accentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the most grotesque qualities) of Joan's inquisitors.  Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt.  The consequence of Joan's conviction -- her burning at the stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","67","92","16 January 2007"," The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc'
","If you'll pardon the rambling, here are my thoughts immediately after watching this on DVD an hour ago.......<br/><br/>THE STORY - Many of the times, while watching this for the first time, I thought this was almost the re-enactment of Jesus' last day, seeing the phony trial, the trumped-up charges He endured by legalistic, power-hungry religious leaders of the day who had no clue who God is, and then the tragic end to the central character. Apparently, there were a lot of similarities to Joan of Arc's last day and of Christ's day. However, here it's the Catholic leaders who are the 'bad guys' while in Jesus' time it was the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin. Also, with Joan's story here, she is portrayed far differently in her ordeal than Christ did, the latter taking everything in stride stoically while Joan, without any physical beating, still cried constantly and signed some paper in a moment of weakness (although she later recants that, which costs the woman her life.)<br/><br/>Anyway, about this film:<br/><br/>THE GOOD - Wow, what incredible direction and photography. Scene after scene is pretty amazing and especially so when you consider this was made about 80 years ago! I would like to see the same director and photographer doing work with today's technology.<br/><br/>The expressions on Maria Falconetti's face throughout the film are memorable. A sadder, more pained look on Joan of Arc - or anyone else's - I have not seen in a motion picture. She also must have set a record that still stands for the most tears shed by one person in a movie! The woman's eyes were like faucets.<br/><br/>All of the faces in here - and the film is mostly a series of facial closeups - are amazing and kudos to Criterion for making a DVD that showed these faces with a clear picture and amazing detail. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer's camera angles still look innovative today. He and Orson Welles seem to share the same love of this kind of photography. I found myself numerous times just shaking my head in admiration for how these characters were photographed.<br/><br/>Another big plus for this film was the addition of ""The Voices of Light."" They made the music score in here fantastic. I can't recall too many films in which I have been so impressed with a soundtrack. The DVD gives you the option of watching this film with or without that audio. I strongly recommend viewers to take the audio.<br/><br/>Finally, the story itself is memorable, with a powerful ending.<br/><br/>THE BAD - I have to make these comments to be fair and honest. It's not hard to understand why many people will find this film almost impossible to sit through, especially those with no emotional or spiritual involvement with the story. That is because it is extremely slow and repetitive. Shot-after-shot of just Falconetti agonizing or crying and weird-looking men staring at her. If you aren't a devotee of cinematography, this movie could be extremely boring after about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>As powerful as the story is, it isn't a movie I would recommend for most people. I think most folks - of any age, frankly - would be turned off after 20 minutes. I understand that. As mentioned, this is not an easy film to view. This might be the longest 80-minute movie you'll ever see, if you aren't into it.<br/><br/>OVERALL - Visually and audibly: an astounding movie and one I am glad to have finally watched. If I was wishing to get into the movie business and wanted to learn how to shoot films, this would be a film I would study numerous times. Otherwise, one viewing is plenty. I can only recommend this film to a very select audience."

"heres-johnny-1","10","6","7","11 January 2018"," There are great movies and then there are movies at completely different level
","The Passion of Joan of Arc is on a completely different level than other great films. It's haunting, terrifying and will break you down psychologically, the same way Joan of Arc was broken down during her trial. This is a masterpiece that breaks all sorts of filmmaking conventions that are rarely broken even today. In fact, the breaking those conventions are what make this film as great as it is.<br/><br/>It must be stated the feat that Dreyer pulled off in a technical and story sense. The Passion of Joan of Arc solely centers around Joan of Arc's trial and execution, not the battles and wars, but the trial itself. It's a dialog-driven courtroom drama told without sound. It is almost nonstop talking and there are very few title cards, yet you completely follow everything that is going on and said, even if you can't read lips or don't know the language. It's almost all close-ups without any establishing shots of peoples' faces. On top of that, the only surviving version of this film was created from the film's outtakes by Dreyer because the original version was banned, and from the outtakes, it's STILL one of the greatest film ever made, arguably the greatest ever.<br/><br/>This isn't just a movie, this is way beyond that. This is at such great heights that it transcends the medium itself."
"tyson-hunsaker","10","6","7","17 August 2017"," A must-see for any lover of silent cinema.
","It's a true blessing that The Passion of Joan of Arc was not lost forever and was miraculously restored for the world to behold the incredible wonder this film is. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a French silent film based on the true story of the real woman by the same name who claims experiences of visions from God which angers the church. The film centers on the trial itself and ultimately her death at the stake. <br/><br/>The story was wise to focus on only these events provided the documents available about the trial are public and regarded as definitive history. Furthermore, the filmmakers were wise to not explore her life or speculate on the truthfulness of her claims. Instead, the film is a powerful, relentless character study on a woman who stands by her convictions even if it costs her her life. This is executed spectacularly by our leading lady Maria Falconetti who delivers maybe the single best performance these eyes have personally witnessed in a silent film. <br/><br/>Stellar performances aside, it's easy to understand why many considered this piece to be one of the first ""artistic"" films ever made. Cinematography reminds me of Tom Hooper style frame composition and its editing and lighting make some haunting and impactful moments. Despite not hearing any musical score for the film, it never feels slow or dragging. In fact, it's near impossible to take your eyes away from the screen. Every frame is a beautiful work of art that demonstrates Carl Theodor Dreyer's masterful hand with the camera. <br/><br/>Everything about the production and narrative on The Passion of Joan of Arc is masterful. It's a fantastic film that comes recommended to anyone who loves precise storytelling. If it's available (especially with the Criterion release), give this a thorough watch. It's well worth it."
"WriterDave","10","9","12","7 June 2008"," Dreyer's ""Realized Mysticism""
","*Note: This a review of the Criterion Edition DVD with the ""Voices of Light"" accompaniment. <br/><br/>Over the decades Dreyer's film was a victim of religious and politic censors, two fires that destroyed valuable prints, unauthorized cuts, and zealous editors working against his wishes to modernize the film. An original, uncensored cut was found miraculously in a Norwegian hospital for the mentally ill (ironic?) in 1981 and fully restored for the Criterion Collection. Famed composer Richard Einhorn created his libretto, ""Voices of Light"", in response to his own experiences viewing the film and researching the history of Joan of Arc. The film can be viewed with or without the accompaniment, though I can't imagine Dreyer would've objected as Einhorn with great care honored the spirit of the film and arguably of Saint Joan with his compositions.<br/><br/>Carl Dreyer's silent film, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", is a shocking example of the potential of film as art. No amount of scholarly critique can account for the raw power in viewing the film. It's one of those rare experiences that can only be seen to be understood. Dreyer's meticulously crafted aesthetics (the film is almost entirely composed of close-ups of the actors' faces) are perfectly married to the gut wrenching performance of Maria Falconetti (a theater star who never acted in another film) in the lead role. I think Dreyer was most accurate in describing her performance as nothing short of ""the martyr's reincarnation."" One need not be religious to understand what is meant or to feel for Joan as portrayed so humanely and exquisitely by Falconetti. Her face is beyond the realm of haunting, and Dreyer seers it into the audience's memory along with other stunning imagery like a window frame's shadow turning into a cross on the floor, worms crawling through a skull unearthed from a freshly dug grave, or a bored executioner barely able to hold up his head in the company of his torture devices. And then there's the burning at the stake and the brutal suppression of the peasant riot--unimaginable horrors rendered so beautifully and hyper realized onto a series of moving images projected onto a blank screen.<br/><br/>The genius of Dreyer's visuals and Falconetti's performance is that they create a deep psychological complexity that can engage a modern viewer on multiple levels. In their bold suggestions and through the artistic integrity of their respective crafts, Dreyer and Falconetti leave it to their audience (weather it be a French nation still celebrating and mythologizing their 15th century hero Joan a mere eight years after her canonization in 1920 or a more skeptical 21st scholar studying the history of film) to decide the veracity of Joan's convictions. Was Joan truly a mystic, a martyr, a saint? Or was she simply mad and the unfortunate victim of the time period in which she lived and died? Either way, she is presented here as human. And in relating to her, one thing is for sure: the mysticism of film was realized by the Dane Carl Dreyer and Maria Falconetti in the year 1928 with ""The Passion of Joan of Arc."""
"mayesgcm7","10","10","14","30 January 2008"," An essential work of cinema
","Carl Dreyer is one of the first and true masters of the art. His direction is always exceptionally controlled and crafted and for me this film encapsulates succinctly his dual expressionistic and formalistic approach to cinema. Although Dreyer succeeds in creating an extremely credible depiction of the trial and tribulation of Joan of Arc, he knew the filmic medium was not, and never could be, knowledge, fact or reality, and so he presents experience, truth and authenticity.<br/><br/>The film can be argued to be entirely shot from the mind's-eye view of Joan in relation to her locality to give the impression that we, as Roger Ebert said, are not watching a film but in fact watching ""fragments from Joan's own experience"". Hence, the reason why everything is filmed in either, close-ups or medium shots, the reason why there are no establishing shots and very few visual linkages. Filming in this way also created the intended affect of overwhelming claustrophobia and discomfort for the audience- a mediation of persecution one could say.<br/><br/>A lot has been said on Dreyer's inspirational use of the facial close-up in this film. His attention to the details on his performers faces, such as lines, warts, freckles, sweat and hair, and even on two occasions a fly, are used as revelations to their character and personality. The insignificant is made significant. Their faces are filmed in such a purist, ""microscopic"" fashion (no make-up was permitted by Dreyer) that their features and expressions convey a deeper more profound understanding of their emotions and thinking than words ever could. Renee Falconetti's face is also almost always seen in isolated shots and often filmed from a height thus accentuating her spiritual solitude and physical defencelessness. In contrast the trial judges and their faces are often shot from below, accentuating their threat to Joan and their dominance over her. Also her face is never in shadow and often captured in grey whereas the judges are always shot in shadow and have a more defined black and white composure, emblematic I believe of their inner good and bad. <br/><br/>The acting is superlative undoubtedly helped though by Dreyer's cruel and unrelenting treatment of his actors. Dreyer became a notoriously demanding and dictatorial director after this film. He reportedly drove its star Falconetti into a mental breakdown in order to get the right emotional intensity he desired for the film. His pursuit for total realism, or to be more exact total authenticity, knew no bounds. The scene were Joan suffers a bloodletting was in fact real, albeit from a stand-ins arm. Falconetti never made another film again, yet her performance, I among others, deem as being arguably the finest ever filmed. <br/><br/>Everything about this film is manipulated to convey the mind-set of Joan, her disturbed emotions and confused thinking, as well as her physical vulnerability and spiritual purity. Also anything that is not important to the conveyance of Joan's condition and situation is not included, hence the massive and very expensive set that was built but very little of it used. All the images presented conceivably convey what she could have seen and the way she might have seen it. Hence, the reason I believe for the upside down and backward shot of the English soldiers entering the gates of the castle, possibly a symbolic reference to St. Peter being crucified upside down, as allegorical parallels can be drawn with the historical story of Joan and the Biblical one of St Peter. Also, the swinging camera that makes the tower appear to be moving while she is burning is I believe a subjective representation of Joan's mental and physical suffering and the fact that she is about to depart from the earth. Either way these are certainly not just stylistic flourishes. The angular composition of the trial judges in relation to Joan and her relation to them, the off-kilter framing showing sometimes only half a head or at least only the head, and the fact that the judges are filmed moving in to and out of the frame only enhance capturing Joan's mental state of mind and her sincerity and honesty in the face of her Pietistic and duplicitous accusers. Furthermore, the weird and bizarre set designs from Hermann Warm, famous for his expressionist sets for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, only add to the disillusioning and disturbing overall effect for the viewer.<br/><br/>The themes of this film are also present in many of Dreyer's other works, namely his fascination with the incompatibility of institutionalised religion and individual faith, the physical dominance of the male over the female (somewhat dated now), and the power of the human soul over earthly ambitions and corruption. These themes appear to be of personal significance to Dreyer in nearly all his films. There is humanity and a desire to create sympathy, and not indifference, towards all his characters in his films.<br/><br/>The Passion of Joan of Arc is an aesthetically austere yet serenely beautiful, psychologically uncompromising yet spiritually moving piece of work. The 15 hundred cuts and the way the film is structured, in clearly defined chapters, and, as already discussed, the way it is shot in close locality to Joan and always in relation to her immediate surroundings, gives the deceptive impression of simplicity and naturalness, whereas in fact the film is highly sophisticated and stylised. It also makes what Jean Cocteau said about the film even more true. That was, that it played like ""an historical document from an era in which cinema didn't exist"". <br/><br/>Also, Richard Einhorn's 'Voices Of Light' musical score, first presented with the film in 1995, is an undeniably creative and truly inspired piece of work which adds to the intensely emotional, powerful and hypnotically engaging visuals of the film."
"EUyeshima","10","7","9","14 December 2005"," The Legendary Falconetti Anchors Dreyer Silent Classic
","I was completely floored when I first saw this movie in the basement of the San Jose Main Library sometime in the early seventies. The mesmerizing performance of Maria (Renée) Falconetti, filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups, is still the main reason to revisit Carl Theodor Dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. There is little provided in the way of background or context, as Dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. Using a minimum of sets, almost abstract in orientation, he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of Joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. The actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. There are never any establishing shots, so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. Instead, Dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. As the film builds to its climax, graphic footage of Joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry French peasants being brutally driven out of Rouen Castle by club-wielding English soldiers. Many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.<br/><br/>The overall effect of these creative and daring techniques gives the film a more contemporary feeling than a standard silent, and luckily, adding to the freshness of the treatment is a pristine print found in Copenhagen, the basis of the transfer in this Criterion Collection DVD. An effectively stirring enhancement is Richard Einhorn's beautiful ""Voices of Light"", an oratorio specifically written to accompany the film decades after its release. Falconetti was 35 when she played the 19-year old peasant girl, but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes and facial plains to build her character's spirit as it dwindles under the pressure of the French clergymen who rule her fate. One truly believes her assertion that she is a messenger for God. Never to act on screen again, she gives a truly legendary performance deserving of the hosannas received over the years. The DVD contains an interesting commentary track on which Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg provides a wealth of information. It also contains features on the film's unusually stylized production design, Einhorn's music, and the checkered history of the many versions that ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" has gone through over the years. In spite of its unrelenting tone and some scenes that will make you wince, it's a masterwork that still resonates 77 years later."

"Igenlode Wordsmith","7","18","32","30 March 2007"," Neither tedious nor a masterpiece
","I've heard that this film is notoriously unwatchable; I've heard that it is one of the greatest moving pictures of all time. Given my negative experience of other 'great experimental' classics -- ""Napoleon"", ""Metropolis"", ""Greed"" -- I had a suspicion that my own reaction might lie on the former end of the scale: but when the chance to see it presented itself, I felt I ought to take the opportunity. To further my cinematic education, if nothing else.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, while it seems to be a film that normally evokes a violent response in one direction or the other, I found myself left floating mildly in the middle. I didn't think it was the greatest film ever made, but I didn't find it unwatchable either.<br/><br/>On the most basic level, I can't help feeling that Dreyer picked one of the most unsuitable subjects for a silent film possible: a dramatization of a verbal transcript! I can see the trial of Joan of Arc being presented as an effective radio drama, along the lines of Dorothy L. Sayers' Christ-play, ""The Man Born to be King"", but trying to make a silent movie out of it produces a horribly forced format: the courtroom scenes consist entirely of mouthed dialogue shown on transcribed title cards, followed by incredibly prolonged reaction shots. The (no doubt unintended) impression given was that the reaction shots were only there to break up what would otherwise be an unbroken series of intertitles, rather than being an active artistic choice: certainly Joan must have been an incredibly uncooperative witness if it really took her that long to answer each question. The format just doesn't seem to fit the content: 'talky' silent films are generally a mistake, and this section was nothing *but* talk.<br/><br/>And tears. I've never encountered a Joan who cried so much -- I was left wondering if that was why Falconetti was cast, since she seems to have a decided talent for it. The endless weeping didn't actually seem in character for a girl who produces the sort of smart comebacks quoted in the script, and the director seemed to be wallowing in tormenting both star and audience. I was aware of my neighbours fidgeting.<br/><br/>But it picks up, unsurprisingly, when it shifts into more natural silent territory and actually allows the characters to move. The sets appear to be cardboard in the most literal sense of the term (the painted-on arrow-slits are particularly obvious), but I couldn't tell if that was a deliberate gesture at modernism or simply the result of budgetary limitations; it gave the whole thing a certain stage play air, but when we actually see the soldiers tormenting Joan rather than watching characters mouth words for the camera, the style becomes more fluid.<br/><br/>One technical device I found irritating was the repeated choice to film faces in three-quarter-length, with their foreheads cut off at the eyebrows. This is a mannerism I associate with the misuse of widescreen (which seems to have inherent problems with the fact that humans, unlike landscapes, aren't actually constructed in a letter-box shape), and the 'low-brow' result annoys me just as much coming from 1927 as it does in 2004. But that's just a personal quirk...<br/><br/>More audience reaction as we got to the blood-letting: there were audible groans and ughs, and I couldn't help wondering how this was done! Presumably they didn't *really* stick a scalpel into someone's artery, let alone Miss Falconetti's? I noticed that the whole thing was shot in tight close-up with no glimpse of Joan's face.<br/><br/>The finale, on the other hand, was more than gruesome enough for anybody, and the contrast to the unmoving opening scenes is stark: Dreyer seems to have gone into Mel-Gibson mode with full gore, writhing flames, etc. Perhaps the only common factor with the courtroom sequence is that it goes on and on: there was certainly no fidgeting at this point, or if there was I myself was too horrified and riveted to be aware of it.<br/><br/>But even here there were some consciously arty moments to break the spell: the repeated cut-aways from the bound Joan to free-flying birds were less than subtle, and I can see why the use of the 'pendulum shot' didn't catch on... However, it is certainly convincing, probably too much so to pass for a PG certificate in the modern world: the shots of the charred body slumping into the rising flames are particularly explicit. One is left with the impression of having seen someone burned to death.<br/><br/>I don't think I was impressed by the bits that I was probably intended to be impressed by, and I spent a lot of the trial being haunted by echoes of Bernard Shaw's play ""St Joan"", written a few years before this film came out: presumably both authors were quoting from the same sources, although it was distracting to recognise the retorts of Shaw's combative peasant girl while simultaneously presented with a visual of Dreyer's tortured saint. On the other hand, I wasn't nearly as bored as I might have expected to be. The experimental features either passed me by or were actively off-putting, but the film didn't lose my interest."

Shot predominantly in close-ups, the tight framing restricts us to narrowly focus in on her state of fear and immerse us right into the emotional turmoil through which she is suffering. POV shots of the French clergyman ingeniously add to this effect as we experience the fear of the dire circumstances through Joan's eyes. And the fact that Falconetti never acted again only adds to the eeriness of her performance. With cinematography that was way ahead of its time and an incredible score to boot, this is simply a masterpiece of cinema. Far and away one of the greatest silent films ever conceived."
"OliverBagshaw","10","6","9","28 July 2016"," A Film of Transcendental Beauty.
","A truly beautiful and powerful film of such an influential and admirable status that not many films could ever achieve such praise. Dreyer's vision with The Passion Of Joan Of Arc is still recognised as one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking in existence.<br/><br/>Falconetti's performance as Jeanne d'Arc is widely accepted as one of the greatest performances ever committed to film and it should be very clear as to why. Her performance is very restrained, subtle and mature, providing distinctive character development, understanding and empathy through only her facial expression. The silent era was one where over-acting had become common but her performance did not follow such a convention and even by today's standards it's still a beautifully restrained performance. Her face and eyes are so expressive and emotional that they speak louder than any dialogue ever could, and with the film's cinematography focusing on extreme close-ups of the characters' faces, it emphasises the power that Falconetti could harness through such acting. The close-ups also allow us, as viewers, to pay attention to every facial twitch of Jeanne d'Arc throughout the film, adding to the emotional torture that she must have faced.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful in every respect, from its cinematography's focus on extreme close-ups, its supporting character performances and even the few moments you truly glance at the set design and decorations. It all contributes wonderfully to Dreyer's vision of the trial of Joan of Arc, but the highlight for me, along with many other viewers, is certainly Falconetti's performance. It's honestly heartbreaking when the inevitably tragic ending is portrayed as for the brief time we, as viewers, have been watching the film, it certainly feels like we have got to know who both Jeanne d'Arc and Falconetti are and that she has opened herself up to the world - her performance is one of the most genuine performances I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film, whether you're curious about acting, cinematography or silent cinema, this should definitely be essential viewing."

","Carl Dreyer presents us with one of the greatest tests of an audience in the history of the movies. He forces us to look at Joan's face in a hundred fragmented close-ups, gaze into her steely eyes permeated with God's destiny, never sure of our surroundings. He makes us those that would judge her, gawking at her facetiously. She's the greatest angel we've ever had, and Dreyer doesn't make the mistake of turning her into a device for sympathy: when she bends, it's not because she's weak, it's because she's overcome with God's power. As usual with Dreyer, his film is something that we reflect ourselves onto: are we Joan, or the onlookers? When Joan cries, do we blame ourselves?<br/><br/>Individual scenes are captivating: the scene where Joan is tortured in order to confess to lying is one of the tensest in film, and when she gets her hair chopped off it's as if her soul is being hacked away. Dreyer never shows her as a warrior in battle; indeed, he just shows the chaos incited by her death. In terms of silent movie impressiveness, there's a cool scene with blood squirting out when Joan is bled due to her fever, and some jarring cuts to a mother milking her baby. There is a great sense of drama here, as well. The questioning of Joan is often brilliant: How do they know she wasn't hearing the voice of the Devil? She certainly looks possessed. All Joan can say is, ""To make me suffer the Devil has sent you."" Falconetti is magnetic, otherworldly, drained. You can see why she never acted again. Like all true artists, she lets us peer into her soul, and it's frightening. Dreyer uses her magnificently -- through each tear droplet, her soul pushes its way out of her physical body so we can see inside.<br/><br/>I personally don't believe she was the daughter of God, or a clairvoyant; instead, I respect that she didn't question herself, only those around her. It's what makes her human: God told her what to do, and since you can't question God, she's not liable. It's that maddening sense of childishness and purity and stubbornness and hypocrisy and a million other things that makes her someone you can't understand, makes her human. It's not so much that we believe she's hearing God as it is we believe that she believes she is. That kind of assurance is, of course, wildly admirable, but at the same time offensive and incredibly dangerous. Worshipping at the altar of Joan is foolish, I think, except for what it represents: trial by fire, and mankind's cynical, relentless attitude, comprised mainly of jaded non-believers. Dreyer's film is great not because it presents Joan as the greatest of martyrs but because it has the courage to show her as simple and human -- and probably as loony as the rest of us. 10/10"

","The Passion of Joan of Arc was a groundbreaking movie in its own time. Humongous set build just for the film, visionary camera techniques yet unseen, controversial subject matter, powerful role performances. Everything needed for a true classic.<br/><br/>The film has withstood the test of time remarkably well. True, the story itself is a bit bare boned compared to modern films, but the fact that it's based on true events, real historical trial manuscripts, gives it gravitas.<br/><br/>And it's simply shot so well. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer relies on extreme close-ups and harsh lighting to accentuate either the suffering or the grotesqueness of his characters, and it works wonders. Denying his actors makeup also helps, highlighting every pore and wrinkle on their faces.<br/><br/>Renée Jeanne Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc has been hailed as one the all-time best in cinema history. Not without merit, I have to admit. The fragility of Joan and her situation in the hands of English comes through crystal clear. Yet, her performance is perhaps too fragile. If you study Joan of Arc at all, and especially if you read the actual trial manuscripts, you're going to meet a woman perfectly willing to give as good as she gets. A woman of conviction, who laid doubt into the hearts of even her harshest critics with her piety and belief. That aspect of her character is somewhat missing in Falconetti's performance.<br/><br/>Still, it's a great film. A must see for all those that are studying cinema and for those that want to see the best films ever made."

","It is often said that Maria Falconetti gave the greatest performance in the history of film acting in this movie. That's nonsense. First off, I don't believe anyone can be said to be the single best artist in any pursuit. Shakespeare is not really the greatest playwright to ever live. But now that people keep saying he's the greatest playwright ever no one has the nerve to suggest perhaps he's just one of many brilliant playwrights.<br/><br/>As for Falconetti, she gives a rather stylized performance in a very stylized, visually striking, very artsy movie. Her performance consists of a couple of looks, suffering and rapture, and in both she looks a little nuts, although I was never clear if she was supposed to seem nuts.<br/><br/>The main power of her performance comes from a sense of pure exhaustion, and from what I hear the directory did everything he could to wear her down, so it may be less a great performance than just watching someone suffer on screen.<br/><br/>The movie itself is cool looking but artificial and not that convincing. Those looking to see a truly great performance in a truly great silent movie should check out Emil Jannings in The Last Laugh."

","Watching Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent film masterpiece, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences you will ever have.  Amazing direction by Dreyer, with extraordinary acting by Maria Falconetti as Joan, enable the viewer to sense every nuance of Joan's ordeal throughout her trial and eventual execution.  The experience is so realistic and overpowering that by the time the fire is lit under her stake, you can practically smell the burning wood.<br/><br/>Almost the whole film is a carefully filmed and edited sequence of close-up shots that emphasize every aspect of Joan's plight, and that enable us to share in the deepest of her feelings.  The masterful shot selection takes full advantage of Falconetti's unparalleled performance as she shows us who Joan was.  By keeping everything in close, we never take our attention off of what Joan is enduring, and the intensity of the experience is never allowed to dissipate.<br/><br/>After following Joan's lengthy trial and interrogation, the film climaxes with a phenomenal look at her execution.  It cycles through shots of Joan, the stake, her tormentors, and the crowd, and occasionally a shot of birds flying gracefully overhead, overwhelming us with moving sensations.<br/><br/>To be sure, this is not the kind of film that casual audiences would necessarily enjoy.  What Joan of Arc endured was an unspeakable combination of systematic humiliation and physical agony, and Dreyer's film makes us feel every bit of it.  And to appreciate fully some of the details in the film, it probably helps to have some basic historical knowledge of Joan's life - the film starts immediately at the trial, with little or no explanation of prior events.  But even if you had no idea who Joan was, watching this account of her would still move you, and you would still come away amazed at her great inner strength - the film is that effective.<br/><br/>If you appreciate dramatic cinema, whether you usually like silents or not, make sure to see this masterpiece when you can."

The camera work was SO tremendously magnificent, the cutting so exciting and the acting so good, that it passes Sunrise as my favorite silent film, which also made a tremendous impact on me. The extreme close-ups of the faces in the courtroom, the cutting during the torture scene are just two of my personal favorite things about this movie Falconetti's portrait of the french heroine was some of the most wonderful acting in a silent film I've ever seen. It even compares to the great Lillian Gish. I haven't been able to get it on Laserdisc or DVD yet though, but I hope it will be issued."
"Chance2000esl","10","5","8","25 December 2008"," Amazing Photography Carries the Film and Heightens Its Impact!
","This film is amazing on several counts. First, the cinematography is mind boggling: we've got tons of extreme closeups, lots of low angle shots, pans and swish pans, even upside down shots. Dreyer is using the camera to tell the story of Joan of Arc's trial for heresy and her being burned at the stake. <br/><br/>Second, Dreyer wants the viewers to really become involved in the reality of the story. Like other films with unconventional takes on Jesus or other historical figures (such as by Martin Scorsese or Ken Russell), Carl Dreyer is really doing his own thing here, by telescoping her trial and execution into one day, without much referencing to her historical activities or character. In fact, Maria Falconetti portrays Joan as a naive, simple farm girl of deep faith, hardly conveying the image of someone capable of having led the French against the English. She spends most of her closeups either crying or saying ""Oui,"" looking wide eyed like a deer caught in the headlights. Dreyer must have been saying here that Joan (actually Jeanne) was resigned to the inescapability of her situation. (The film is titled 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' not 'The History of Joan of Arc.')<br/><br/>Dreyer's whole purpose is to make the experience of her trial and death have a strong impact on the viewer. To further the reality of this, no makeup was used on any person, and the sets (when seen beyond the close-ups) were spare and almost bare, so as to not to detract from the interactions of the characters. Again, to emphasizes its reality, Dreyer introduces the story by showing that the dialogue in the film was taken directly from the real transcript of Joan's 1431 trial.<br/><br/>Dreyer's most formal contemporary critic complained that the 'irksome monotony' and 'maniacal' use of closeups resulted in a loss of spatial orientation for the characters, that is, you couldn't always tell who they were looking at or addressing. There was hardly any sense of the characters being in a room at all. In fact, Eisenstein's response on seeing the film was to call it 'a collection of pictures.' For Dreyer, however, his mostly all closeups approach was to show and emphasize the conflict between Joan and her interrogators.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: the impact of this film is undeniable. The intensity of the closeups accomplishes Dreyer's stated goal to shake up the audience and have them feel the suffering. Her being burned at the stake is equally uncompromising. As the scholar on the commentary track noted, this film makes most other films seem trivial.<br/><br/>The film is a compendium of French, German and Russian film making techniques. It gets a 10.<br/><br/>Note: The cinematographer, Rudolph Mate, who had previously worked extensively with Karl Freund, went on to his own successful career in the United States, showcasing Rita Hayworth and her hair in both 'Gilda' (1946) and 'The Lady From Shanghai' (1947)-- yes! the movie with the great Fun House Mirror shots, and as a director for 'When Worlds Collide' (1951), and the noir films 'Union Station' (1950) and 'D.O.A.'

Without one word, and only music in the background, this movie conveyed more feelings than alot of regular movies I have seen.

"Sculptor","Null","5","8","26 January 1999"," The Most Spiritually Overwhelming Film Ever Made
","I saw this film for the first time a year ago, and it was such an earth shaking, illusion shattering experience for me, that I have not been the quite the same since.  In fact, it left such an enormous impact on me that I have not been able to see it again since, not wanting to undermine the overwhelming, spiritual epiphany that I deeply felt I had experienced the first time.  A very stubborn and silly attitude, I know, and one which I hope to overcome in the near future, once I come to terms with the infinitely important statements it makes on the very extremes of human nature.<br/><br/>The Passion of Joan of Arc is work of art in the truest and purest sense of the term; it is a timeless expression of the eternal human conflict, namely the yearning for the ideal - the spiritual connection which binds all of humankind.  It is a statement without time or place, language or nationality, and set religious system or dogma.  I think that's where the true power of this film lies; in the fact that it concentrates on the exploration of universal human emotions and themes in a simple story, rather then having it's power and timelessness detracted from by an overly complex plot and other timely constructions.<br/><br/>Since this is one of my first reviews here, the first two being Tarkovsky's Sacrifice and Nostalgia, I'll arrange my thoughts as much as possible to not make this overlong and gushing.  Just want to comment on certain aspects of this film which particularly struck me.  First of all, was the sense that this was one unified work of art, every element of film working together seamlessly, to form a coherent picture with a unique clarity of spirit, which feels very unencumbered by excess.  The sublime orchestration of music and images overwhelmed me with its poignancy; it was like music for all of the senses, always keeping everything at a high plane of emotion, accentuating the transcendent feeling I had throughout.<br/><br/>Falconetti as Joan, as I've heard many times before, is the best performance ever captured on film, hands down.  Even before there was ""method"" acting, she embodied it.  You could feel every emotion she felt, because you sensed she was never holding anything back.  With the whole movie done in closeups, the indescribably expressive quality of her face only intensifies, making her's and your involvement much more personal.<br/><br/>It is not only Falconetti's relentless portrait of suffering that comes through to the viewer, but most powerfully, the spiritual glory and triumph which shines through her luminous eyes in the midst of the worst suffering, which shows her pure spirit and the strength of her faith.  That is what most stayed with me about this film, even after the horrifying closing moments of her burning body on the stake.  It was her triumph."

","""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer is simply one of the greatest films ever - silent or no silent and what considered by many critics, the greatest performance by any actress on the screen. Renee Maria Falconetti, a French stage performer, was persuaded by Dreyer to play the Maid of Orleans even though she had no film experience. From her very first shot, we can understand what a visionary Dreyer was. The director asked the actress to crop her hair and to strip her face of any makeup. Filmed mostly in close-up, the agonized face of Falconetti's Jean, free of all cosmetic artifice, appears more moving and human, and expresses so many emotions that it literally stays in a viewer's soul.<br/><br/>A German designer Herman Warm (""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and ""The Tree Lights"") constructed the austere sets for the film; the photography of Rudolph Mater also contributed to the films universal power. The composer Richard Einhorn wrote in 1989 the composition ""Voices of Light"" which is included in VHS that I saw and effectively enhances Dreyer's impressive images. With all that said, I couldn't help quoting Ingmar Bergman who said once, ""The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything is there"". Faces tell the tale of the Maid of Orleans in this movie, and above all, one unforgettable face - that of Renee Falconetti in her only film appearance."

","A powerfully moving & thoroughly compelling biopic that effectively utilises the human face as its storytelling device from the first frame to the last, The Passion of Joan of Arc is a cinematic landmark that still retains a mystical power despite being nearly a century old and also features one of the finest actings ever committed on film."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","3","4","5 December 2012"," Sublime and get the Masters of Cinema restored version
","Freshly re-mastered and restored by EUREKA in their collection Masters of Cinema, this film is phenomenal for a 1928 film and deserves our rediscovery of it. It is of course in black and white. But the camera still catches a rather circular image with shades in the corners. But the shooting and the acting, the editing and the text are first class.<br/><br/>The movements of all the monks, priests and other church people always in a small crowd in a limited space is impressive in movement and composition to impress the audience of course, but to create an atmosphere in which the little and only woman of the whole film has to feel surrounded and is impressed and even psychologically pressurized, put under duress, manipulated into fear and angst. That gives Joan of Arc a tremendous power in her very unimpressionable lack of movement, frozen reactions, emotional restraint and yet constant suffering shown by the many tears she sheds.<br/><br/>The camera of the time is better for close-up shots on one character, one face, one action or movement and Dreyer uses that camera to the utmost. No conventional emotional expressions. Everything has to look real and natural, even when it is the ferocious fierce authority of these doctors and higher-ups of the church. Most of them are grotesque older men who look absolutely devilish in their smiles, their laughter or their piercing looks trying to nail Joan of Arc on the spot.<br/><br/>Dreyer thus can naturally avoid the real torture scenes and can deal with that sequence in an allusive and indirect mental way. We can see the machines but we do not see the real brutality imposed to Joan of Arc? Our imagination has to compensate. That is good because Dreyer's art is emotionally evocative when he is dealing with physical pain and torments. He can thus concentrate on the faces and their expressions. Dreyer is thus able to avoid the symbolism of silent films at the time, that symbolical acting that was so conventional and we can find a lot in Fritz Lang (though Fritz Lang also uses metaphorical symbolism) and in Hollywood that is producing at the time more comedies and comic farces than dramas and tragedies. The Russians are in another style with Eisenstein, more demonstrative, more political and ideological.<br/><br/>And that's where Dreyer's film is slightly weak. The whole film is a miracle of human expressivity that builds up the real atmosphere in this old century when religion was the only reference, Jesus was a real being you could talk to, God was another real character you could easily see in your sleep. The whole social life was dictated by this clerical catholic faith. The film shows marvellously how the faith of one can become the heresy of the other, not because the other is necessarily vicious, but just because the one used the wrong word, a word that means the devil in the language of the church. The church and its official beliefs at any time (and these beliefs can change with time) are the only yardstick everyone uses, Joan of Arc as well as the church officials in Rouen. But her declared faith in Jesus and God becomes for the priests and the monks, the abbots and the bishops the evidence she is possessed because she uses a direct address to Jesus or God and pretends she can communicate with them, which is not possible in this church at the time since communication with God and Jesus could only come through the priest and mostly from the top to the bottom, from God to the people, but through the priest.<br/><br/>Was Joan of Arc announcing the coming of the Reformation and the Protestant faith? Probably. The Middle Ages were coming to an end and the new spirit that gave the individual a tremendously more important role to play was already coming up.<br/><br/>But at the end of the film Dreyer falls in the trap of a popular upheaval against the English and a political conclusion about Joan of Arc and the French. Joan of Arc started something important in Europe and not only in France. She announces, represents the birth of nations which are going to bring in due time the end of feudalism. In this case, the birth of a French national feeling that will take two centuries to become something stable and real. The defeat of the English on the continent with their defeat in the One-Hundred-Year war is going to push England back into its borders and the national feeling is going to develop there faster because it is an island and because the last feudal entity, the Holy Roman Empire of Charles Quint and Philip II of Spain will make the mistake of attacking England that had been the first country to nationalize their church and religion in the European world at the time, more than two centuries before the French Revolution does the same in, France.<br/><br/>That complexity is not captured by Dreyer in his conclusion though he shows marvellously well how the feudal absolute control of the church on the people is coming to an end because individuals do not follow rules but follow their conscience, their intimate conviction. That is new indeed.<br/><br/>Spend some time on this brand new restored version of the film. If you get the Masters of Cinema version, you will have a second version edited after Dreyer and you will have an important booklet explaining a lot of things about Dreyer and his films, and the cinema at the time.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","In ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" Carl Theodor Dreyer elects to tell the story of Joan's trial not through action or dialogue (or title cards, as this a silent film), but through faces. His simple but mesmerizing technique is to place the actors in rooms with stark white walls, film them in extreme close-up, and assemble the film by alternating images of Joan with those of her interrogators. The bare white set contrasts with the actors' faces, which are filmed in such detail that their flesh almost becomes tangible, and reveals everything you need to know. The craggy, warty faces of Joan's interrogators suggest human menace and evil, without the actors ever assuming an overtly menacing expression.<br/><br/>Renee Maria Falconetti, playing Joan, is required to go through the entire film with the camera focused tightly on her bare face as it registers all the infinite nuances of anguished but steadfast faith. Tears often roll down her cheeks, yet she never forces them out of her by sobbing, or tries to hold them back by closing her eyes. The openness of her face, the involuntary flow of her tears, help establish Joan's saintliness: it feels as though she suffers and weeps not for herself, but for the whole world. The moment when Joan, alone in her cell, realizes that she must become a martyr, is an extraordinary piece of acting.<br/><br/>Famous theater director and theorist Antonin Artaud appears here as a young, compassionate monk. At first I thought it ironic that the founder of the ""Theater of Cruelty"" should play one of the least cruel characters in the movie; however, after doing a little research on Artaud, I noticed similarities between his theories and this film. Artaud wanted theater to be an intense, cathartic, spiritual experience, relying on emotion and gesture rather than text, using physical means to achieve a metaphysical purpose. I can think of no better summation of ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" than to say that it is the cinematic equivalent of this. Its almost ritualistic evocation of pure suffering produces an emotional effect that few other films achieve."

","After years of hearing this film praised to the skies, I finally got to see this last night, thanks to our buddies at TCM.<br/><br/>For the benefit of you budding actors, the following is a blow-by-blow account of Maria Falconetti's portrayal of Joan of Arc, considered by many critics to be the greatest performance in the history of film:<br/><br/>Goes into Pop-My-Eyes-Out-of-My-Sockets Mode. Then cries.<br/><br/>Goes into I'm-Feeling-Sorry-for-Myself Mode. Then cries.<br/><br/>Goes into Lomotomized Zombie Mode. Then cries.<br/><br/>Goes into Bobbing Head Doll Mode. Then cries.<br/><br/>Repeats modes like a broken record. Then cries. A lot.<br/><br/>Joan of Arc was a female George Patton, someone who knew how to kick ass and take names. Falconetti's Joan is a blubbering wack job no one would follow into a pillow fight! Oddly, the only time Falconetti stops the blubbering wack job bit is when Joan is about to be burnt to a crisp.<br/><br/>The ending is a stupefying orgy of violence and bizarre camera angles. There is even a shot of a baby nursing, complete with full-frontal boobie! And the guy in the Mountie get-up lording over Joan's execution is a hoot! Where I can score some of that crack Carl Theodor Dreyer was smoking?"
"MartinHafer","8","7","14","6 April 2010"," Brilliantly filmed but with an odd performance by Joan.
","""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is probably the most famous work of Danish film maker Carl Theodor Dreyer. Unlike the typical biographical film, this one is based completely on the court proceedings in the trial of Joan--not some fictional or semi-fictional story written in 1928. This is pretty wild, as many historical films view truth as very flexible--with the real emphasis being on entertainment. If this means inventing characters or changing history--so be it! But, fortunately, not in this film! It's a history teacher's delight! When the film began, I sure was bowled over by the powerful soundtrack filled with Latin liturgical singing. While annoying normally, here with the intensity of the film and the subject matter is managed to work. In addition, the film is an artistic piece due to the director Dreyer's artistic vision. First, his choices of actors was truly amazing--as he chose some of the most amazing faces I've seen in a film--such character, such intensity and such acting from these people is truly amazing. Plus the camera pulls so much from the actors due to fantastic lighting and clarity of focus--you can even very clearly see the pores on many of the actor's faces! Second, unlike almost all other silent films and even sound ones, this one makes great use of closeups and inventive camera angles to heighten the intensity of the action as well as the impact on the audience. The result is a film that hits you in the face--hard, forceful and impossible to ignore. Especially strong in its impact is the execution itself--Dreyer chose to make incredibly vivid (so much so, some might find it very disturbing).<br/><br/>Now I must say that although I greatly admired this, there was, at times, a downside. The actress that played Joan (Maria Falconetti) often looked downright crazed--like she was off her medication and reeeaalllly needed it!! While this could actually be true (after all, she was seeing things and having conversations with dead folks), I doubt if Dreyer wanted his audience to think Joan of Arc was nuts--as she so often appeared in the film. This is sad, really, as at other times, Ms. Falconetti did a masterful job--showing great sorrow and crying most convincingly. But, in many cases, after crying and emoting wonderfully, moments later she was staring off into space like she was stoned. I know this film is considered one of the great films of the silent age, but I don't know how this can be based on the truly bizarre and inconsistent characterization of Joan. Yes, I dare question Dreyer's brilliance in this respect. Overall, there's a lot to love and a lot that makes you question the film's ""classic"" status. Very good...just not great."
"huckster-2","6","26","70","1 October 2000"," Vastly overrated
","After hearing the enormous amount of praise for this film, I was expecting to be swept off my feet.  However, I found myself incredibly underwhelmed by this incredibly mediocre movie.  Confused by my reaction, I asked two friends I had seen it with (both seasoned classic cinema fans) what they thought, and they agreed with me.  Together we worked out its three biggest problems.<br/><br/>1. Worst of all, Dreyer assumes we will automatically sympathize with Joan of Arc, so he does little to help us in that respect.  Some may argue that scenes with cruel guards/priests are enough.  However, this argument fails since Dreyer never convinces us that Joan is truthful.  In fact, he accidentally gives the opposite impression, with numerous shots of her so wide-eyed she looks like she's about to pick up an axe and chop up the judges.<br/><br/>2. None of the film's four most powerful scenes belong to Joan.  They instead belong to a torture device and various people who sympathize with Joan.<br/><br/>3. The music is too good.  Normally, great music isn't a problem, but since there is so little quality on screen, ""Passion""'s music completely overshadows the rest of the film.  One of my friends went so far as to say he felt as if he was hearing an orchestration accompanied by various images rather than a film accompanied by music.<br/><br/>Lesson: Not all critically acclaimed films are actually good."
"timmy_horner","Null","5","9","29 December 2000"," A seminal landmark for the artistic stylization of French film
","Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a seminal landmark for artistic stylization in French film. The Danish director champions individualism using the persecution of Joan (Renée Falconetti) as a vehicle. This is achieved with the uncompromising use of close-ups, low angle shots, quick cuts and the strong influence of the art movements of the early 20th century.<br/><br/>The trial and execution of Joan of Arc is condensed into a single afternoon. This revision serves Dreyer's primary theme of the struggle for autonomy between the individual and society. Joan represents a threat to the status quo and Dreyer plays on this binary opposition. Joan's direct communication with God undermines the rule of the Catholic Church. Traditional gender roles are questioned by Joan's refusal to take off her masculine clothing, thereby refusing to relinquish power to the patriarchal society. Her resistance to signing the written confession brings the church's hypocrisy to surface. The church's mandate is not to prove Joan a heretic, but to stop the spread of her insubordination.<br/><br/>To convey Joan's isolation, Dreyer employs a never-ending barrage of extreme close-ups. This unconventional technique serves to heighten the effect of individualism in Dreyer's rendition of Joan. This overuse of the close-up would inevitably falter, were it not for the remarkable performance of Renée Falconetti.<br/><br/>Joan's captors are filmed at sharp low-angles, ensuring an unquestionable level of authority. These low angles become increasingly oblique as the tension mounts towards Joan's execution. The result of this extremity is disorienting, creating spatial confusion and uncomfortable monotony for the viewer.<br/><br/>Dreyer is unrelenting in his use of fast cuts throughout the film. Touching on elements of French Impressionism and Soviet cinema, these cuts dart between Joan's exasperated close-ups and the austere low-angle shots of the French judges and English guards. The influence of German Expressionism can be noted within the stylized mise en scène. Joan is often disproportionately framed with the crucifix, displayed in the form of barred windows and their resulting shadows.<br/><br/>By employing these tactics, Dreyer successfully brings to light the humanity of Joan of Arc. Conversely, her persecutors are convincingly depicted for their insurmountable position of power. The result is an artistically realized silent film that has earned a deserved place in the history of French cinema."
"Reverend3000","7","4","7","7 June 2014"," Cinematography ahead of its time. Interesting recovered film.
","This movie, restored for the present day, is visually appealing to the modern viewer. The portrayal of Joan with bright, open eyes stirs up a variety of feelings. It also gives off the vibe of mystique and wisdom well beyond her years, a girl ground in her conviction, always cornered by dark forces in the room, yet remains a light.<br/><br/>It is rather confusing with no back-story,as not everyone grantedly knows the story of Joan of Arc. But like any passion play, the purpose is not so much the circumstances to the setting, but the actions and reactions of the people in the moment.<br/><br/>I found the film very ahead of its time in many aspects. Then dark tone in soon time became the staple of this director. The imagery of death and torture, though not graphic, seems graphic, and gives an illusion of terror in a way that may have seemed taboo in the more conservative 30's,40's, and 50's film making. <br/><br/>The age old battle of clericalism vs. authentic faith and the centuries old account of Joan of Arc, are told through this near-90 year old movie that has a very modern feel. It has a timeless quality rare for an old movie. <br/><br/>I do not think it ranks as high as the historians and students of film proclaim it. But is a must-must-see for any appreciator of film and arts."
"Cyke","9","4","7","18 October 2006"," Movie Odyssey Review #022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc
","022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) - released in Denmark 4/21/1928, viewed previously.<br/><br/>DOUG: We watched this silent classic a couple of years ago when we became interested in how historical figures, warriors in particular, are portrayed in the movies. This entry was part of a trio of films featuring Joan of Arc (the others starring Ingrid Bergman in 1948 and Leelee Sobieski in 1999). We watched this one last, and it's definitely the best of the three. Those wondering about the title may assume correctly: Mel Gibson took the same approach to Christ in his film Passion of the Christ as this film takes to Joan: The last part of their life leading up to their famous public execution. When one talks about this film, the discussion really has little to do with what happened to Joan herself; it's more about the unique, disorienting way the film is shot, lit, edited, and acted. The director isn't really interested in teaching the audience about Joan; her trial is just the setting for this little head trip. The whole thing is very disorienting; in the courtroom scene, you're not allowed a sense of where each character is sitting or how the room is laid out. Dreayer wants to immerse you in what's happening. Much of the film's strength also lies in the performances of the cast, particularly Maria Falconetti in her only film role. This is an essential piece of silent film history, which was winding down at this point in time.<br/><br/>Last film chronologically: Speedy (1928). Next film chronologically: Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928).<br/><br/>The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise."
"Anglobilly_Feverson","8","5","10","12 April 2001"," It's a shame silent films are rarely shown anymore
","Groningen's movie scene is always up to unusual and interesting things. I've seen La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc in a church (Martinikerk), with an organ and a latin choir providing the music to this silent film.<br/><br/>Jeanne d'Arc is played very emotional though very convincing by Maria Falconetti. Jeanne d'Arc was her only performance as an actress, but you can't see she hasn't done any acting before. She sighs, weeps silently and gazes beyond her questioners. You see her eyes wide open and staring into nothing. She does it all the time, and it might get a little irritating in the end.<br/><br/>The other actors too, are very good. Their looks perfectly match their characters, and in the many many close ups you can see through them by just looking at them. Very useful, because a lot of their dialogues do not appear in text screens.<br/><br/>Despite of a perfect Jeanne d'Arc and a very good crew of judges, clerks, priests and soldiers, the Oscar for best performance goes to the camerawork. Long and intense close ups, very modern framing and a few shots you can also find in Soderbergh's Traffic.<br/><br/>La passion de Jeanne d'Arc is a story with a very predictable ending: she dies. But it takes long before she finally gives up and I believe director Dryer has stretched the story a little too much.<br/><br/>It was a wonderful experience to watch a silent film in a church, accompanied by organ music and a choir. But even without those extra's, La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc is a very worthwhile, if not a beautiful movie. It's a shame silent films are rarely shown anymore."

I couldn't even watch the whole thing is one sitting but I will remember this movie as long as I live."
"Theflyace","10","3","5","5 May 2017"," Transcends all Generations
","Roger Ebert once said that ""to see Falconetti in Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is to look into eyes that will never leave you."" I cannot find a better statement for this miracle of a silent masterpiece. What has been mastered here is a view, taken from historical record, and put under a microscope figuratively and literally on screen to dive into the spiritual essence of destiny. This film is in a class by itself, and had a profound impact on this viewer.<br/><br/>The film begins during the 100 Years War in France. In its battle against its enemy England, a commoner rose through the ranks to lead France to many great victories. This great warrior was peasant girl Joan of Arc, not even 18 years old but commanded a presence among her peers and a reputation impressed upon her enemies. Joan has been promised French deliverance from the mouth of God himself. Captured and put on what is essentially a mock trial for the whole film (she would have most likely been executed anyway) she must stand firm against the cacophony of priests who at first spit at her and call her a demon who cries blasphemy. Soon however, when she is given the chance to free herself at the expense of her devout belief in God and refuses, the film becomes a tragedy of the rest form, a good person making the ultimate sacrifice to something bigger than anyone in this film can possibly imagine. <br/><br/>The mastery of this film's narrative is in its reliance on the extreme close-up, which i can only estimate takes up 95% of the film. Director Dryer and cinematographer Rudolf Mate take a radical approach to the film, which has stood the test of time as one of the most daring films ever made. Joan's face as well as the other characters fill the frame, and what was not normal for the silent films, the actors do not wear any make-up at all. What this gives is confinement in the audience, as wee are as locked in this small blank room as Joan is, thus helping us feel the emotions of the scenes and care for the main character in a unique way. We cannot look away from the faces, especially that of Joan's astonishingly beautiful eyes.<br/><br/>What stands out in this film is the central performance of Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. When she enters the picture, she does not look like a common heroine. She has short hair, no make-up, and no soft lighting to make her ""gorgeous."" In this way, Falconetti must communicate a visceral reaction and emotions through her facial expressions, and since she is always in close-up, this cannot escape and she cannot cheat. With this said, this is a truly flawless performance, in fact one of the greatest films I have ever seen in Cinema history. When she does stumble and ultimately does the ""morally right"" thing, I broke down in tears, quite rarely have I ever had so much respect and heartbreak over a person I never knew. This is a bravura performance that I cannot praise enough.<br/><br/>The Passion of Joan of Arc is a miracle, and when given again the fact that it was made in the 1920s, this is even more astonishing. Please see this film and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>Note: I am sorry I haven't written in a long time. College and work is murder and time must be put elsewhere quite a lot. But I intend to write more and this film helped me rekindle the flame that git me to doing this in the first place - Theflyace"""
"donob","10","3","5","10 September 2016"," A couple od details...
","I simply agree that this is one of cinemas true masterpieces, I'm with those who consider it one of if not the greatest film.<br/><br/>Two details that I always loved; when Joan sits in her cell taking comfort by staring at the image of the cross formed by the windowpane, then the priest who pretends to befriend her but intends to betray her walks in and his shadow covers the image of the cross - wow, is there a more haunting or effective use of imagery in all of film?<br/><br/>Also, I appreciated how at the end when she was about to be killed the same priest looked down on her, unseen, and bowed and shook his head with an expression of true sorrow. I think that was such a profound scene, showing that, though not exactly one of the good guys, he didn't really want her to die, he respected her strength and faith, it showed he was human - I thought that was an amazing, great touch.<br/><br/>Also I'd like to mention Richard Einhorn's inspirational soundtrack that matches the film so incredibly well that I can't imagine one without the other. I'd love to shake his hand and simply say 'Thank you! ...you lucky dog!"" ;) ... to now and onward be associated with and part of this great film. First time I watched the film, the style of the soundtrack struck me, a new sound, but I was engrossed in the film to think much about it. Second time I watched it, the moment the music started I began to cry, to my surprise! It had left such an affect on me the first time, I didn't realize!"
"kylereid-186-650176","10","3","5","25 May 2016"," If Perfection Exists, This is it!!
","Maria Falconetti's performance was life altering. If perfection in acting is possible, Falconetti would be the pioneer of perfection. I saw this movie the other day at an international cinema, having no prior knowledge about the film, just the fact that I love foreign films. I must say, it is now my all-time favorite movie. Period! The movie will stay with you forever. I was not merely watching the trial of Joan of Arc, I was experiencing it. <br/><br/>The lack of parallel lines and order in the set design adds to the surreal and nightmarish sensation of being falsely accused. However, Falconetti brings us back to reality from the surreal world with her movements and expressions of despair, hope, anguish, love, faith and devotion. All of which define the human experience. Seeing her on screen was like seeing myself, Falconetti's eyes were a window into humanity. I could feel what she felt, I could see what she saw, and I could understand what she understood. This emotional investment in the film had me in tears the entire time. Never have I experienced a movie like this. <br/><br/>Along with the powerful performance by Maria Falconetti (which I could discuss for days) was the incredible music score. ""Voices of Light"" by Richard Einhorn was perfect at setting the mood and helping the audience become emotionally invested in the film. After watching the movie I immediately bought the soundtrack. <br/><br/>If you let it, this movie can change your life, as it did mine."
"StevePulaski","9","3","5","2 December 2015"," A film so heartbreakingly realistic and brutally honest it might even bring tears to your eyes
","Part of what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc so bold and unflinching, for its time and its current state in cinema, is, much like its titular subject, how battered, beaten, and kicked around it has been in order to get where it is today. This is a film that, from its very inception, was a controversial subject that clerical authorities didn't want to be seen by a wide audience, for its portrayal of religion and politics. Nonetheless, writer/director Carl Theodor Dreyer pushed forward in a direction for a film on Joan of Arc that detailed the gap between religion and politics, in addition to insights into the complex of the fragile male ego that boasts assimilation and manipulation. After the completed and finalized print was lost in a fire, it was doubtful that a print even close to the original would ever resurface until one was discovered in a mental institution in Oslo, Norway in the 1980's. After some cleaning up and polish was added, the film was restored into an eighty-one minute cut, which is said to be very close to the original film's length and structure.<br/><br/>Dreyer's focus in The Passion of Joan of Arc was precisely what the title suggests; an intimate and often harrowing portrayal of the agony the French heroine (played ever-so tenderly by Renée Jeanne Falconetti) endured following her unfair trial after the Hundred Years' War. Dreyer sees no point or purpose in showcasing sweeping battle sequences nor does he see it fit to detail Joan of Arc's story in a series of ""greatest hits"" moments that ultimately ends in a corrupt sentencing. Instead, Dreyer places us, the audience, in an awkward position throughout; we are practically voyeurs into the trial and sentencing of Joan of Arc, who we witness subjected to enough physical and mental torment to shatter one's entire self-worth. As she takes a stand for her faith and her beliefs of her own personal sainthood and relationship with God, she is bludgeoned and abused by an all-male jury and various authorities before being sentenced to death by being consumed by fire.<br/><br/>The Passion of Joan of Arc can be viewed in two basic forms; in its original form, with no dialog, or a modified, Criterion Collection version that adds accompanying orchestration from Richard Einhorn called ""Voices of Light"" (which was my audio-track companion) throughout the film. Einhorn's score provides well-timed parallels in sound and musicality to events transpired on-screen, and the symphonic blend of instruments at various times adds to the cacophony of emotions and tones throughout the picture in a way that wouldn't be as impacting, I feel, with an empty audio-track. Dreyer's film has far too much potential for impact to be viewed in complete and utter silence.<br/><br/>Dreyer's decision to focus largely on facial expressions and the facial personalities of characters almost overshadows the complex work of his and Rudolph Maté's in the cinematography department. At the time of its release, The Passion of Joan of Arc erected one of the most expensive and immaculately detailed film sets in the history of cinema, with its construction of the famous Rouen Castle taking most of Dreyer's seven million franc budget on the film. Having said that, the detail in the background of the film is almost as important as the detail in the foreground, with hulking walls and set architecture towering over the characters in the film like a bitter and obvious presence. The walls are nothing more than helpless witnesses to the atrocious treatment of a very confident woman; so confident she makes her male counterparts squirm with inferiority and fear.<br/><br/>Out of eighty-one minutes, probably a good forty or forty-five are Dreyer's camera lingering and depicting the facial and emotional reactions of Joan of Arc. Dreyer allows us to zero in on Joan of Arc's emotional responses as a way of peeling back the events of this film and revealing a tender, more human side that can often get lost in the shuffle. This is also likely why Dreyer forgoes the conventional battle sequences the Hundred Years' War practically loans itself to on film; it doesn't work to detail the kind of grounded human interest in the film.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the concept of male ego that Dreyer subtly explores here. Consider how manipulated Joan of Arc becomes shortly after allowing herself to be tried for blasphemous remarks about her alleged sainthood and her relationship with God. Her trial was never intended to be fair, but instead, a circus for masculinity to triumph over a defenseless woman who was never going to be heard out on anything she had to say. As a result, the males of the court room decide to shame her, cutting off all her hair and physically and mentally abusing her in a barbaric manner that shows little else besides dominance over the meek and powerless in a cruel situation.<br/><br/>The result is a heartbreaking film that grabs you with an all-too-real depiction of a time period frequently obscured by the lingo of textbooks and droll college lectures thanks to Dreyer's human approach and intimate focus on facial expressions and steadfast realism. It's only fitting that The Passion of Joan of Arc endured such a brutal life trying to gets its message out to a wide audience; it perfectly replicates the struggle and fight of its titular character.<br/><br/>Starring: Renée Jeanne Falconetti. Directed by: Carl Theodor Dreyer."
"Irie212","10","3","5","20 August 2009"," The one thing everyone should know about this movie is...
","That the script was based on the transcripts of the actual trial of Jeanne d'Arc in Rouen in February and March of 1431. The same is true of much of George Bernard Shaw's play, ""Saint Joan."" <br/><br/>There is no question that the film would be powerful even to anyone who had never heard of Joan of Arc. It is impressive in every way-- the structure, the camera-work, the acting, even the fact that make-up wasn't used, which heightens the brutal reality of her story. <br/><br/>But the most astounding thing is the script. I can't think of another SILENT FILM with a script this important and memorable. All it takes is one look at the original trial transcripts to understand why both Dreyer and Shaw relied them. Joan's intellect is impressive, as is her faith, which embraces all that is good about Christ's teachings. In contrast, the ignoble church interrogators ask questions that expose the shallow hypocrisy of the corrupted Roman Catholic hierarchy-- blind, self-serving, intolerant faith that is still evident among too many passionate Christians today."
"jem132","10","3","5","5 June 2007"," Dreyer's ""Passion"" Has Rarely Been Equalled On Film...
","One of the single greatest performances in film history came from Carl Dreyer's amazingly powerful THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC. Renee Falconetti, in the only performance she ever committed to film, is just about as flawless as an actress can be as the persecuted French woman who is sentenced to burn on the stake, accused of witchcraft, after a highly unjust trial.<br/><br/>Dreyer's film was a huge gamble at the time and he pulled it off astoundingly. It is amazing that the director dared to film much of the the entire first-half in close-ups of Falconetti's face as she stands trial. Falconetti's facial expressions and tragic, yet hopeful eyes beautifully transcend silent cinema. Although the first-half of the film takes place in essentially one room and involves the audience essentially watching the thoughts and reaction of one actor, it is a compelling sequence.<br/><br/>The second half of the film focuses on Falconetti's resignation and preparation for her fate. Dreyer burns stark, profound silent images into the viewer's head and leaves them etched in the memory forever as Falconetti's dignity is corroded by her torture, head shaving and eventual burning.<br/><br/>Dreyer, in a sense, takes a very minimalist approach to filming THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1927) that seems to echo the German Expressionist movement (Dreyer was Danish). He instead chooses to frame the entire film around Falconetti's performance-as bare as the sets may be, her bare-boned performance towers above everything else.<br/><br/>It is an outstanding work of cinema and one that all cinema purists should see. However, it is painful to watch at times- not because it is a 110 minute silent film with minimal inter-titles and no extravagance, but because of the painful journey we witness Falconetti go on. The final look in her eyes as the flames engulf her on the stake is forever haunting."
"jameskinsman","10","3","5","22 December 2005"," An undeniable masterpiece
","What Dreyer has achieved with Le Passion De Jeanne D'Arc is nothing short of miraculous. Indeed, it is a miracle in itself that we are able to witness the brilliance of this film, as the original negative of it was destroyed in a fire. A second negative, re-edited by Dreyer from alternate takes was also thought lost to a fire. Then in 1981, after more than half a century, an original danish copy was discovered in a Norwegian mental institution, allowing us to view the film probably very close to its original form.<br/><br/>Dreyer was a master of portraying human emotion, and this film shows his artistry at the peak of his form, elevating him to the great pantheon of auteur's. In a very unorthodox technique, Dreyer refused to cast actors for the roles in this film, and refused to let anyone wear make-up, jewellery or facial enhancing products of any kind. He wanted to show humans in their simplest form, stripping them of all made up beauty, revealing our primitive emotions with true transparency, in order to display the delicate subtleties of our features and emotions. The relentless close ups in the film allow us to observe every flutter, every quivering lip and tear rolling down the cheek, displaying the aesthetic beauty of the human expression, using our faces as a window on our soul. Some silent films can be hard to watch, however like Murnau's masterpiece Sunrise (1927), these detailed human displays of feeling and suffering transcend any message that could possibly be spoken or written, and reveal endless levels of character interpretation.<br/><br/>Although this film goes into a lot of detail on Joan's devotion to Christianity, I don't think that it would take away from the experience for someone without strong beliefs. I am not a particularly religious person, however this film touched me in a way that only few films can. I found the realisation of Joans suffering and emotional torment almost unbearable at times, however the film, although deeply sad, left me feeling so very blessed. Le Passion De Jeanne D'Arc really is one of those transcending films, that proves cinema can be art."

","I rewatched this film shortly after viewing Robert Bresson's proces de Jeanne d'Arc, another film, made in 1962, also using the actual trial transcript. In both films, the English looked like soldiers from the First World War. In any event, the Dreyer film is superior (not to denigrate the Bresson film which is a must see). Added to the beauty is the score by Richard Einhorn with singing by the Anonymous 4. After composing for the film, Einhorn composed an oratorio called Voices of Light inspired by the film and it is a beautiful piece of work.<br/><br/>At the end, I was literally crying, not only because of Jeanne's death but because before her body became ashes, the citizens were crying ""Saint."" (Where were they before?) And then the English beat and killed them. The English kept invading France for the French throne and eventually, after many wars and tens of thousands dead (not to mention bleeding the English treasury dry) gave up. I think the reason Jeanne was destroyed was because she was a woman, encouraging the French to fight back. The English were too stupid to realize that they were making a martyr out of Jeanne. Had they been intelligent, they would have given up on the throne altogether.<br/><br/>A brilliant and haunting film. And buy the cd Voices of Light."

","I think this film is one of the most impressive films of silent cinema. The actress, who played the role of ""Jeanne d'Arc"", performed at a high level. Although the film is silent, the orchestral music playing in the background increases the power of the film. One of the main points that make the film legend is the use of a camera. Close-up is often preferred. These close-up scenes are like a cinema course. The camera angles used in the film are very brave and the reference point for someone who will learn the camera angles today. It was the right choice to tell not the whole life of her, just a small part of her life. It is impossible for even a stranger like me to be impressed while watching this film about a French and Christian cultural figure like Jeanne d'Arc. For those of you who don't know, I suggest you find out who Jeanne d'Arc is before you watch the film."

","Giovanna is taken to the Inquisition court. Her close-up is worried and pious at the same time. Giovanna in the close-up begins to cry. Then while she claims to be sent by God and the English will be driven out of France, the close-up takes a lateral angle, more painful and sharp as a knife that hits the viewer's heart. The editing alternates impassive close-ups of the inquisitors and the juxtaposition of Giovanna's close-up with the close-up close-up of a guard, which appears zoomed in his terrible look in the car: this is particularly disruptive. The process continues and Giovanna's eyes are estranged as if she were looking at angels and saints for whose vision she is also accused. After the accusation of blasphemy continues to pray in ecstasy as ""The ecstasy of Santa Cecilia"" by Bernini. A friar thinks that Giovanna is a saint, but is taken away by the soldiers. Giovanna sees a cross in the shadow and feels comforted. She is not considered a daughter of God but a daughter of the devil and is sentenced to torture. Giovanna D 'Arco says that even if she dies she will not deny anything. The eyes are twisted by terror in front of the torture wheel and faint. Giovanna is taken to a bed where they are bleeding. Giovanna feels that she is about to die and asks to be buried in a consecrated area. Giovanna says it is not true that she was sent by the devil but that they were sent to make her suffer. In a close-up, Giovanna turns her head in this ascetic and suffering moment and a quick, alternate editing correlates her with close-ups and details of the inquisitors, like their mouth whose words depend Giovanna's life. Giovanna suffers the final sentence while an image of a worm coming out of a skull in the common grave contrasts with the intensity of her close-up. Giovanna embraces death and on the gallows says she accepts death with a good heart. Giovanna burns at the stake while devoted ladies cry in a series of close-ups. The crowd rebels against burning a saint and the soldiers attack the people, who flee in an alternation of close-ups, filming from the top of the crowd that escapes attacked by soldiers and the silhouette of Giovanna burning on the stake."

","Oak Cliff Film Festival 2018
Greetings again from the darkness. It's a rare treat to watch a 90 year old silent movie. Especially in a remastered format. Especially on the big screen. Especially at a historic theatre. Especially with a nearly packed house. And especially with a live score! The 7th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival, held at the Texas Theatre (opened 1931), afforded just such a treat with its Friday evening screening.<br/><br/>Most know the story of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), a teenage heroine of France for her role in the Hundred Year War. She claimed that she received spiritual and religious guidance through voices and visions. Once she was captured by English allies, she was charged with heresy and burned at the stake in Rouen in 1431. A quarter century later, the Pope declared her a martyr and she became a symbol of France - canonized as a saint in 1920. Of course, here the story is as much about the film as it is the martyr and historical figure.<br/><br/>The eyes are what first grab our attention. The eyes of actress Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. It was Falconetti's only screen appearance, and though she spent the rest of her career on stage, this role cemented her place in cinematic history. Without the benefit of sound and voice, the silent era performer had to emote through eyes, facial expression and body movement. Few ever did it better than Falconetti. It's gut-wrenching to watch the church counsel attempt to break her resolve. Our minds hear the intensity of their voices though we only read the subtitles. <br/><br/>Renowned Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer directs the script from writer Joseph Delteil (taken mostly from the transcripts of the trial), and the cinematography is through the eye of 5 time Oscar nominee Rudolph Mate' (FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES). It's impossible not to notice a style so different from modern day filmmaking. The harsh lighting and almost exclusive use of close-ups and medium shots bring an immediacy of which we aren't accustomed. The single piece set is quite unusual and provides a stage aura. Another thing that stands out is the editing style. Continuity of scene wasn't important here. What mattered was the sense of frantic pacing and over-bearing stress brought on by the rapid-fire questioning. We share the claustrophobic feeling with Joan, though of course, we know where this is all headed.<br/><br/>As part of this special showing, the Oak Cliff Film Festival arranged for a live score performed by composer George Sarah, a 4 piece chamber orchestra, and a vocal group accompanying the music. <br/><br/>Perhaps this meant even more to me since I visited Rouen last year, and the lasting legacy (almost 600 years) of this courageous young woman is evident throughout much of France. The re-mastered film is stunning to look at, and even more historically important knowing that the film had long thought to be lost to a fire. The story and the film are quite something to experience."
"gbill-74877","8","2","3","8 June 2018"," Watch it for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance
","Director Carl Theodor Dreyer created a unique experience with this film, employing low camera angles, unique editing, and a ton of tight shots on his actors to get an intensity of emotion from them, Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) in particular. The story focuses on just her trial and execution, which has the advantage that it makes the film taut and Kafkaesque, but the disadvantage that additional context would have told a richer story. Do we really see Jeanne d'Arc here? I'm not so sure, historical transcript notwithstanding, though I did find it fascinating that she refused to change out of her men's clothing. While performances are strong and the film is ahead of its time, the content is dark, and not particularly uplifting, especially if you're a non-believer. There is of course a universal theme in a righteous person standing up to persecution - being mocked, threatened, and tortured - but at the end of the day, it's simple Jeanne, believing she was sent by God, standing up against the established clergy, who, threatened by her assertions, believe she was sent by the Devil. The film never ponders whether both may be deluded, and concludes with her soul being protected by the flames as it rises to heaven. Watch this one for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance."
"classicsoncall","8","2","3","15 November 2017"," ""You can claim that I am sent by the devil..., it's not true...""
","When the list of IMDb's top films include multiple titles given to animated features and a fair share of movies that are just downright goofy (""Life of Brian"", ""Groundhog Day""), it's reassuring to find a gem in the mix like ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". Originally released as a completely silent film, I opted to watch it with the accompaniment of the 'Voices of Light' soundtrack, which renders the story in a much more spiritual manner.<br/><br/>Accused of blasphemy, Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) is placed on trial for refusing to recant her assertions that she's had visions of St. Michael, and that she was directed by the voice of God to take charge of her country's army and lead it to victory. In that regard, the picture's principal negative is that it's not placed in historical context, and one does not know the events taking place during the period of time the woman lived. It actually occurred during the latter half of The Hundred Years War (1337-1453) between England and France. Jeanne's involvement in the conflict turned a long standing Anglo-French conflict into something of a religious war, as her importance to the French cause grew over the course of time.<br/><br/>One will be struck by the completely one sided nature of Jeanne's trial, one in which every theologian and judge mocked her replies and judged her responses as blasphemous. What's striking is the portrayal Maria Falconetti brings to her character, she is at the same time terrified of her ordeal, but sublime in the way she accepts her fate. It's one of the more impressive performances one would be fortunate enough to see, particularly coming from cinema's silent era. I think it's safe to say that even if one were not religiously inclined, there's an underlying spiritual power and presence that takes hold of the viewer while watching. It's an experience not to be missed."

","A must see even if one is not religious. The visuals in this film are stark and difficult to watch, the feeling of persecution almost causes the audience to cry out in Joan's defense.<br/><br/>Maria Falconetti is excellent in the title role, devoid of makeup, wan and parched, she is still beautiful and affecting.<br/><br/>Some of the inquisition scenes are noteworthy.

Maria Falconetti did a fantastic job in that regard. Even nowadays, I don't think many movies use the camera technique used in this movie. Because of the effectiveness, much of the movie is quite self-explanatory.<br/><br/>Although I do appreciate of its artistic quality and like it very much, it is still not one of my top favorite since I am more driven by the literary side of a movie than the photographic side.<br/><br/>I saw it only once at this time and much effort were exerted doing so because I wanted to pay close attention to the detail, especially for a silent film in the form of expressiveness instead of storytelling. I'm sure there is strong literary side to it as well.

","""The questions and answers between the judge and Jeanne are clearly recorded. After reading it, we will find a true Jeanne, a simple and humane young woman who removes her armor and died for the country.
This seemingly religious film has a very different narrative at the beginning. The whole passage does not involve the concept of God at all. Instead, it focuses on one word, that is, ""human nature"". Say it is the ""belief"" in human nature.
Over the past few hundred years, the image of Jeanne d'Or has long been mythical. She is a national hero of France and a goddess in the mouth of people. But it is ridiculous that such a Catholic saint with a strong religious meaning was due to political purposes. Burned to death for religious reasons. Such a fact makes people wonder: Is religion so ridiculous in some ways, and does God really exist? It can be said that at least in this film, the role of God is completely missing, and the close-up shots are very clear and belong to human faces. In the first half of the film, what we saw was just a face of a series of ridiculous interrogations, filled with desperate images of poor Jeanne, and the opposite, the laughter, ruthlessness and enthusiasm of most of the judges around indifferent. The atmosphere of extreme despair made people unable to catch a trace of God's existence. And halfway through the film, the three soldiers' ridicule and playfulness towards Jeanne reached its peak. The saint in the mouth of the people is being bullied like an ordinary prisoner of war, an ordinary woman at this moment. The crown she regarded as a sacred symbol was now reduced to a plaything above the sword in the hands of soldiers. When the only outside light on the floor was blocked by the shameless judges, all the divinities disappeared at this moment. In addition, in addition to a few distant shots of the perspective shots in the film, most of the angles of view come from the up shots. In other words, they belong to the angle of view that cannot belong to God.
However, when God seems to be gone, facing the persecution of power, is there no way as an individual, not so. ""True salvation is not a victory after fighting, but a strength and peace of mind that can be found in suffering."" So we saw in the second half of the film that the flinching, weak Jean was gone, replaced by a pair of stern eyes, an unyielding response, and a soul full of faith.
""I totally love and respect God with all my heart""
""He claimed that I was sent by the devil""
""That is not true""
""In order to make me suffer, the devil sent you""
""with you""
""And you""
This refusal, with all her power, sent out to the judges. It's just that this power does not come from the dead God, but from her own, from a person's inner, unbreakable faith. At this time, it is no longer important to whom the object of the belief is, and more importantly, this belief and the power it carries are burst out of a person and the heart of the person after the object has long been destroyed.
Although Joan of Arc had been shaken in the face of the upcoming fire punishment, it was the saint and the faith that never burned down in the fire. The director then expressed the scene that the French people were called by Jeanne d'Arc and immediately began to fight the soldiers, simply visualizing this power.
Since the two industrial revolutions, mankind has shouted the slogan of God 's death against the background of rapid technological advancement, but with it comes the heavy fall of souls from generation to generation, and the human spirit seems to remain after God 's departure A huge gap was added, and then a series of things that filled this gap added greed and sin that were left after the rapid development of many material civilizations. Maybe God is indeed dead, or not, but what mankind really lacks at this moment is not just an unknowable unknown force, but more importantly the faith, or rather, the faith itself.
Finally, the status of this film in film history is also commendable. Although the use of a large number of close-up shots is a reflection of the director's personal style, but the win is to win in the movie itself and the theme is very suitable. This film with almost no plot focuses more on the characterization of the characters, and the close-up shot becomes the optimal solution to achieve this goal under this condition. In addition, there is a very important point, the film was filmed in 1928, at this time, the sound film has just been born a year has not yet been popular. Instead of relying on the dialogue presented by the sound, the audience's attention is completely placed on the picture itself. The superb performance of the characters + the use of close-up shots + the clear-cut editing (the front and back contrast or the corresponding combination of pictures are used in the film many times The rendering of emotions) + the background music of the piano music constitutes the expression effect of the history of this vertical shadow. I have to say that this is really an art that belongs only to the silent era. The film fully embodies the unique charm of the film as a ""dumb art"" and truly achieves the so-called ""silent wins with sound"" effect.
""When the flame rises to the sky, it engulfs Jeanne's soul, Jeanne's heart has become the heart of France, Jeanne will be remembered and cherished by the French people forever."""

","This movie is such an intense experience, and if you are in the mood it can have a lasting impact.<br/><br/>There are two sides to this. First there is the intense performance from Maria Falconetti. It almost boggles the mind how well she can portray all shifts in emotion with relatively subtle movements - it is not necessarily a subtle performance, in its intensity, but it recognizes limits. This is no American (or German) melodrama from the 20s, the acting makes the movie come alive. A real Tour de force performance.<br/><br/>But then there is the directing and cinematography. It is visionary, honestly, the close-ups not letting up, in combination with interesting camera movements and at times a quick and intense editing style, which adds a kind of nervous atmosphere.<br/><br/>It adds more tension to the movie and almost makes you feel trapped like Jeanne was, it is impossible to escape the very small room that is put in the frame."
"davidmvining","10","1","1","20 November 2019"," Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made, Still
","When a medium is only twenty years old, what does it mean to be called the best of that medium? When The Passion of Joan of Arc was released, narrative film was really only about 20 years old. It's seems like a paltry selection of films from which to pull the best ever. I suppose the closest corollary in my lifetime would be video games. Mass consumer video games seem to have a birth in the late 70s and early 80s. When a game came out in the late 90s and early 00s that was considered one of the best ever, at the time, how long will that opinion last? Will people who play games in 2080 still consider that game to be one of the greatest ever?
Such questions come to me when thinking about the reception The Passion of Joan of Arc received upon its release. I've read contemporaneous reviews that called it the greatest film ever made. Seems like a small feat when compared to a movie called greatest ever now, with 90 more years of films to deal with.
And yet, I don't think anything has changed about this film's place at the height of cinema.
Film as an Emotional Medium
To really begin, here's a link to the entire movie with the Voices of Light soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, especially if you've never seen this movie, and at least bookmark it to watch at some point.<br/><br/>joan2<br/><br/>Film is really primarily an emotional experience. Storytelling in general asks people to connect with fictional characters, to understand who they are and why they do what they do. That's particularly strong in film because we actually see people's faces as they go through events.
The use of faces in The Passion of Joan of Arc is particularly important. Whenever people talk about this movie, the one thing that comes up most is the central performance by Renee Folconetti. She was a stage actress who had never worked in film before. She would also never work in film again. Part of that is probably because of what we actually see in the movie. She's obviously emotionally distressed, and there are stories that the direct, Carl Theodore Dreyer, pretty much tortured her to get the performance, and it was wildly effective.
Joan's eyes are wide with innocence as she navigates her interrogators' questions, making them seem alternatively foolish and unserious. It's both Joan's strength and fragility, all told through Falconetti's performance, that sells the conflict. We are with her from the beginning to the end, and it's quite an emotional journey.
Experimental<br/><br/>joan3<br/><br/>I revisited the movie for this post and I had completely forgotten how much the camera moves. I don't know about you, but when I think of silent filmmaking, I imagine hand-cranked cameras on tripods. The cameras used in The Passion of Joan of Arc were hand-cranked, but it feels like they were never on tripods.
The camera swings around, back and forth, and is always pushed right into actors' faces. The production company actually spent a significant amount of money building an entire French medieval town for the film, and they were angry at Dreyer because the audience barely sees it. The movie has wider shots here and there, but the story is almost entirely told in close-up, and often at off angles.
For those who think that filmmakers never really got inventive until that one movie that speaks to them personally but was released in the late 90s and they watched at a formative time, it's interesting to see them take in the fast editing and fun camera work in a movie from the 20s.
Preservation<br/><br/>joan4<br/><br/>I provided a link earlier to a free streaming version of the film. If you do just go over and watch the first few minutes, there's a bit (the copy is from the Criterion collection version) that includes a brief history of the film, including the fact that the original version was considered lost for decades.
I can't find any images of the comparison, but one difference between the cut Dreyer cobbled together after the original negative went up in flames and the one we have today is in a scene late in the movie where Joan gets blood-let. First of all, it's an actual arm, an actual knife, and actual blood. And they did it twice, to the same person (apparently not Falconetti), within minutes.<br/><br/>
The first version is what's in the restored, original cut. The spray is strong and jumps out of her arm. In the cobbled together cut, the spray is much less powerful. (I know I've seen that alternate take, and I think it's on the Criterion DVD as an extra, but I'm not reorganizing my attic to find it. I have the ripped version of the movie on my hard drive, and that's going to be good enough for now.)
I don't place film preservation on the same level of importance as someone like Martin Scorsese (whose movie Hugo is a celebration of film preservation), but The Passion of Joan of Arc and the fact that it was completely lost for decades, and could have been lost forever, tells me of the effort's importance. I never want to see that cobbled cut with alternate takes for everything. It's not what Dreyer had decided was the best representation of the film he had made. It was a lesser version. I'd never want that.
Greatest Ever
I only order my Top Ten based on either time or alphabetically. I'm not interested in pitting movie 5 and 6 against each other. I just want to celebrate them both.
The one exception to that rule would probably be this. I think that if I were to ever actually order the list from best to least best, The Passion of Joan of Arc would be number 1.
It was the greatest movie ever made in 1928, and I think it very well may be the greatest movie ever made through 2019 still."

It is true that some skill emerges if you wait long enough(The torture device, the revolt) but, frankly, I think it is a big mark against this film that we never see Joan doing any of the things that made her the important figure she is (lifting the siege at Orleans would have been nice, even if just in flashback for a few seconds)An insane person no doubt would be able to stand up to torture if they think they are in the right, so it weakens the image of Jeanne.

And it is, perhaps, the most spiritual film I have seen, quite apart from the obvious fact that it deals with god and transcendent faith.<br/><br/>Knowing this was altogether lost to us until very recently, and the chances it would be at all rediscovered really nonexistent, makes me feel like Nietzche confronted with the horse in Turin. So much beauty just a short step from being so casually erased from ever getting to know about it. But we did, and it wasn't. And how it was discovered is equally stunning, I mean can you imagine the chain of events? An original copy somehow ended up in a Danish mental asylum, and was it screened at all there? Did it mend some broken soul? Did the preacher let it do his preaching? And the cabinet opened 50 years down the line, the film is there. What are the chances?<br/><br/>And Maria Falconetti, the most mysterious figure in all of cinema with only this major role to her credit. Did she go insane from too much pain, as portrayed here? Did she open a brothel in Argentina, as rumored? Suicide? Or, so much more ingloriously, died from a crash-diet?<br/><br/>Further back in time, a teenage peasant girl in armor leading armies into battle and lifting sieges, guided by visions - god or madness, it doesn't matter, the words describe one thing. Her complete testimony before a mock trial survived and from the hands of her captors. Again, what are the chances? <br/><br/>So folks, let the multi-faceted story of this film being made sooth and guide you home. Because it is a stranger world than anyone captured on film.<br/><br/>Because all we have between us is testimonies of life, no doubt doctored, in our case by notaries at Rouen, the doctored version presented as truth, the truth always mediated by who's telling the story; we have blurred roles and so hard to surmise the real being, the woman as maiden, mad saint, icon, soldier, visionary actress, whore, real or imagined; we have staged fiction to frame our experience, mock trial, private dealings, confession, Sacrament, public execution, our film about these things, lost and foung again. And so, having caught a glimpse of this fabric that is chaotic, arbitrary life behind the images and stories we devise as scaffold to support a shape, we may concede at last that it's a world spinning madly out of orbit, beyond anyone's control except who writes the stories. Did god ever speak to her?<br/><br/>Except for one thing, that we have this film and performance about a woman having visions as our vision about her. This is our center, a woman appearing before a camera some time in 1927.<br/><br/>This is our spiritual center, and it is fitting that this maelstrom of a performance will be forever associated with and help explain a legend. This is where the divine madness of god speaks. In the utter, unbreakable, single-pointed concentration this woman and the man filming her embodied and sustained, this is the essence of spirituality.<br/><br/>I'm not just babbling here. I know of only one image where god appears, not the traditional god but the state of mind that might as well be described in those terms. It is the picture of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc's self-immolation at Saigon. A human being sitting calmly in the lotus position as flames surge out of him.<br/><br/>Oh, Falconetti is ravaged by emotion throughout and far from Guang Duc's meditative dispassion, a very Christian image of torment, a very Lutheran film, grim, recoiling under the gaze of an austere god, but it is very much the performance of a woman transforming herself into pure soul. In the end, she burns serenely. She burns and the world at her feet is torn asunder."

","when you think of a Jeanne d'Arc movie, you don't expect to see a movie based purely- and focusing just on the trial of Jeanne d'Arc. considering the entire life-story of Jeanne d'Arc, it just doesn't seem like the most likely and interesting thing to focus on. It however of course works well for a more deep, serious and realistic approach and or course also in an original way of retelling the story of Jeanne d'Arc. So don't expect to see a strong heroic female lead but a betrayed, broken, emotional one instead.<br/><br/>On top of that, it's a very artistic shot movie, which helps to at all times keep the movie interesting and great to watch.<br/><br/>I'd say that about 70% of the entire movie consist out of close-ups. The faces and facial expressions really tell the story of the movie. The movie was also originally intended to be released without any music, to even more empathize on the faces.<br/><br/>All of the original shots of the movie were considered destroyed and lost forever before release, which forced the director to completely re-make the movie through re-edits of previously rejected shots. But also this versions got soon destroyed by fire. Therefor this movie was long considered a completely lost one, until an original Danish copy of the movie was found again in 1981, in perfect condition, in out of all places, the closet of the janitor in mental institution in Oslo. How weird is that? Stories like this of course also contribute to the movie its legacy.<br/><br/>By todays standards all of the acting performances within the movie can be described as over-the-top. This sort of acting approach was of course however needed in the silent movie era, to make clear to the viewer what the story and the emotions within the story were.<br/><br/>I won't go as far as calling this one of the best silent movie out of history, but it's definitely among the artistic most successful ones!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"r-c-s","9","3","6","4 October 2007"," extremely good, artsy but dated movie
","this movie's drawback is that it gives no background. We are thrown right in the middle of the action. Perhaps the director wanted the public to take its autonomous stance, but when you start watching, you must either like/believe Joan or not. The quality of the film is excellent; by all means it might have been shot in the 1950s. Acting is very good for what it is (EG no outside action but a young woman tortured and then burnt alive ): the first few seconds hinted at Falconetti being a very brilliant actress; perhaps not the best of all times ever, but let's compare a few recent Hollywood big budget junk thrillers or psycho-movies to boot and this ages-old movie ends up winning. Scenes are careful and camera work innovative. ONE BIG GOOF: around the time Joan is taken out to be burnt, we see a priest WITH GLASSES. Now spectacles were centuries ahead of Joan's time. I tend to regard this movie as high theater on film, rather than a ""movie"". THE MESSENGER tries to psychoanalyze Joan too much, making her look like a complete fool. But face it, after all these centuries she is still a hero not because she might have (or have not ) heard god's voice (plenty of charlatans and hallucinating faddists claim they do everyday right now ), but because a young, illiterate peasant virgin could actually kick the enemy's hides and give her king a crown, being ready to die burnt alive to stand for her ideals. I wish I had a fraction of the balls she had, period. One might or might not sympathize with France, but her lesson is a lesson for everyone."
"Carl_Dreyer","10","3","6","12 June 2006"," The Passion of Renee Falconetti
","Much has been written about this film, so I will give some of my own perceptions on it. Mimicking the quote from Paulene Kael, I also think this is ""perhaps the finest performance captured on film"". The face of Maria Falconetti in the movie is indelibly etched into my brain. At first, she is enlightened, sassy and doe-eyed, then after several interrogations, threats of torture, a real bloodletting (actually an extra was used for the stabbing), and having her own hair clipped off to the roots, her eye lids eventually droop until she is barely squinting. Her performance is almost beyond acting, as Carl Dreyer's gentle, but almost unbearably stubborn persistence made Renee demonstrate her true pain and suffering.<br/><br/>The Criterion Collection restoration is superb. The beginning of the film is rather grainy, as is the beginning of each of the six reels. But as each reel progresses, the quality improves to a point where you forget you are watching a film that is close to 80 years old! One warning, this is not a movie for kids. Even though it is black and white, silent, with French subtitles (with English translations), the movie is one of the most intense I have ever seen. But it is well worth watching for those who are in tune with the history of JOA and are seeking a movie that goes far beyond entertainment. Dreyer's film is a masterpiece, and mysteriously, the only movie that R. Falconetti starred in."
"royale_w_cheez44","10","3","6","17 October 2005"," The Most Powerful Film of All Time: Silent or Otherwise
","This is quite the film experience. Not only is it an emotional film with outstanding artistic quality, but it's the most powerful and moving experience ever on film. Falconetti plays Joan of Arc, and she gives an emotionally earth shattering performance, leaving anyone who watches this film absolutely memorized. I believe it when I hear that her performance is the best of all cinema; I have never seen an actress embody a person on film as much as she. Truly powerful and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Why this isn't on AFI's top 100 list is beyond me, this is the greatest silent film that I have ever seen. Forget The Passion of the Christ; although powerful, it lacked some explanation for non-Christians. This film explains everything perfectly. That and the film is disturbing in a less in-your-face fashion. Watching Joan stand in front of the jury is hard to bear. Seeing her shaved like a dog is heartbreaking, and watching her burn at the pike is one of the most powerful moments in all of cinema. Dreyer made an absolute masterpiece. It was way ahead of its time, and let's just thank the heavens that this film wasn't lost for good. Please, people. Buy this DVD and watch this film. It's an experience; religious or otherwise, that you will never forget. Absolutely perfect."
"Aquilant","10","3","6","25 August 2005"," Tearing and cathartic report about every distortions in faith.
","The Tragedy is being consummated. The Passion is reaching its apex. ""You are burning a Saint!"", this is the scream of anguish of the people, witness of this poignant event, very deeply moved by the excruciating agony of Joan of Arc, flame beyond the flame. Very short hair, fine features in spite of her social condition of uncultured peasant, deep and large eyes burning of the same unquenchable fire bound to put an end to her life: this is our heroine, whose beauty is emphasized at once by her great faith in the infinite mercy of God.<br/><br/>She never staggers under the heavy burden of her charge in the presence of her inquisitors, unreal and monstrous entities whose hardheartedness shows up on their grotesque features and on their unnatural animal-like attitude, judging by their perverse faces distorted by extremely short focal length lenses. They look like personified devilish entities engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, their ugliness accentuated by a series of uncommon close-ups contrasting with Joan's wonderful face that shows the extreme dramaticity of her situation instead, compelled to endure her pain with great courage and to bear the heavy weight of her cross with resignation, without losing her steady disposition of soul, wanting to go through with her rigidity of principles at the cost of her life.<br/><br/>Satanic grimaces, devilish sneers, derisive laughters and spittle emphasize the ineluctable course of this absurd justice system while the vision of her holocaust hovers above the head of the sacrifical victim, so fragile, so vulnerable when fighting in defense of her behavior, so unheard when holding her own opinion, so unprotected when pleading her cause. She objects strenuously to everything they say because faith leads people to do things they never would have imagined themselves capable of, but her passionate words flow away like feeble whispers in a windy day, while her enchanting eyes scan an invisible sky, looking for something beyond her human strength, beyond every possibilities of the common mortals, maybe a divine sign from above, even if there's no question about her unshakable devotion to God, because ""God knows where He bring us"", she thinks, ""but we are able to know the road to Him only when we reach the end of it."" Every sequences are included in the above described oppressive scenario whose hypnotic suggestion expressionist style reminds us of the universal sense of pain ready to penetrate deeply into the substrate of our Christian and human consciences, in the inmost recesses of the soul, sharing our hidden emotions awakened by the vision of a defenseless face appealing for mercy in vain, without never losing her dignity.<br/><br/>Joan, of Arc, splendidly played by Renée Falconetti in this ""PASSION"", might be considered the symbol of the eternal suffering of human beings, adorned with an aureole of beauty and holiness, set on a supreme pedestal, higher and higher than every other female characters of the history of cinema, namely the ideal heroin per antonomasia especially thanks to the heart-rending final purification, moving and endless journey around the deep black of human soul, around the meanders of a faith itinerary stranded for ages on the sand-banks of a devastating fanatic pragmatism.

The lack of dialog keeps your attention to the performances of the actors and almost takes you back to the true events.<br/><br/>The history behind the film is just as important as the performances. The recovery of this lost movie brings together the history of Joan of Arc and the silent-movie genre for a new generation of viewers. This movie is a must-see for film lovers of every age.

It beats every single film I have ever saw. Current favourites like Lord of the Rings pale in comparison to this. The actress who played Joan is perfect, as her eyes tell the viewer so much and her fragile features in the face of the 'horned' judges makes you seem like you are there inside the trial. This film is also quite accurate, and that makes the film a whole lot more enjoyable. If you must see one film in your entire life, make it this one."

Maria Falconetti in the title role is captivating. Think of Sinead O'Connor in ""Nothing Compares To You"". Her close-ups can be heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Dreyer's use of the close-up was novel from what I've read (I'm more of a Hitchcock scholar).

Maria Falconetti expresses the pain and the anguish of a person who truly is being persecuted. Most of her shots are simply face or head-and-shoulder shots. Perhaps it is a reality of silent films that makes the images all the more compelling. Still, one can't help but wonder whether movies wouldn't be better today if the example set by this film and others like it were not followed.<br/><br/>Maria Falconetti is stunning.

Recently re-released on video with a new score by Richard Einhorn (this score is a separate work of music, entitled ""Voices of Light""), this movie is one of the most powerful films ever created. Falconetti gives a stunning performance as Jeanne, displaying both human emotion and saintly fortitude. Jeanne cries throughout her intense trials, but maintains her convictions and answers her critics with wisdom and humility. Falconetti captures the strength of Jeanne, while sacrificing none of her femininity nor any of her pain and sorrow. Truly a masterful performance."
"Sinnerman","10","3","6","12 June 2003"," Profoundly Faithful. Spellbindingly Hypnotic. Hauntingly Overwhelming. One of the best films ever!
","Finally got round to see, ""The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"" yesterday night.<br/><br/>
One word sums this film up, Woah!<br/><br/>This deeply spiritual film conjured up an indefinable state of breathtaking hypnosis, I sat spellbound and dumbstruck by film's end. I actually felt like an unstruggling insect caught on an entangled web of anesthetically luring movie magic. ""TPOJOA"" certainly now ranks as a shining example of cinema's suggestive power to touch and stimulate, to incite and inspire.<br/><br/>
On closer scrutiny, an intoxicating religious fervor was so expertly woven into the film's tapestry, it was inevitable that I too was swept up by the tumultuous mood swings and intense emotional momentum of this sensational work. Truth be told, I even felt like watching the whole film again to relive the cocooning comfort of this strangely uplifting experience. For the record, I was never this psyched up by an `old' film before, much less a silent one.<br/><br/>Of course, not to put a slight on Carl Dreyer's masterful direction, one single galvanizing element that held this film together was unarguably, Falconetti. This woman (reportedly having only acted in this one film) deserved every single critical accolades thrown her way.<br/><br/>
Her face, those piercing pair of eyes, every twitch and every grimace, haunted me in unimaginable ways. With nowhere to hide my arrested gaze, that extra-terrestrial face miraculously leapt out from its screen confines and stabbed me right where it hurt. It was not pretty. I was a rubble of my former self by film's end. It was like I surrendered my senses like a willing captive, overdosing on this woman's internalised angst and suffering, till my mouth frothed and my eyes bled.<br/><br/>Okay, melodramatic gushings aside, being more of an ""atheistic leaner"" myself, even I have to admit that the intensity with which Falconetti portrayed Joan of Arc's religious piety to God and her calling was shatteringly convincing. Viewed within the context of its filmscape, those ""clothed"" men and sundry characters during the trial must surely have been blind (or sinisterly evil) to not be touched by such enveloping sincerity.<br/><br/>
On a more introspective note, I was much astonished by this film's uncanny power to challenge my intellectual conviction. To claim that it did not even manage a superficial gnaw at my unwavering existential beliefs on that ""fabled"" man upstairs will be a complete disservice to the film and most importantly, to myself.<br/><br/>As such, not wanting to cap my exploratory swing in the great spiritual pendulum, I shall opt (for now), to appreciate this film on a purely secular level. Though this film did not completely convert my anchoring beliefs in the wonders of universal nothingness, it did expand my myopic view on mankind's struggle with something as abstract as faith and spirituality.<br/><br/>
Most importantly, I did just witness a great, great film, whatever its religious underpinnings or however potent its persuasiveness. Consider this then, my highest compliment for ""The Passion Of Joan Of Arc""."

","This film is a highly emotional document of the final conflict between the eventually sainted 'heretic' Joan of Arc and her interrogators, and Joan d'Arc's subsequent burning at the stake in the 15th century...(1437, I believe)  <br/><br/>
1.) By utilizing the actual manuscripts of the trial and Mlle. Rene Falconetti's empathetic talents, Dreyer quite possibly distilled the account of the incident to its authentic emotional content.  <br/><br/>
2.) The pitch is established through eyes, nose and mouth of Falconetti and by the arrangement of the others around her - before her, accusing; beside her, questioning; one alone, despairing; behind her, whispering.<br/><br/>
3.) The accompanying choral soundtrack (Einhorn's ""Voices of Light"") fits the syntactic framework perfectly.  However, I have never viewed it as it was intended as a truly silent film. <br/><br/>
4.) It is the embellished soul of both Dreyer and Falconetti that invoke the possibility of art in the soul of the viewer."
"mytoastiscold","Null","3","6","22 January 2003"," Passion is the correct word.
","The Passion of Joan of Arc strikes me right away as a film with so much to say that it is hard to contain on film alone.  Let me explain.  The pure, raw emotions expressed by Maria Falconetti as Joan burst off the screen. Her performance was the highlight of the film for me.  I never would have expected to see so many different shades of terror, loss, sadness, etc. expressed so expertly.  She just drew me in. The film style of Carl Dreyer also makes this picture stand out among others of the time and even now.  Notice how we never see a wide establishing shot.  Instead, Dreyer aggressively chose to shoot the whole thing with medium shots to extreme close-ups.  This technique, combined with a fair amount of camera subjectivity creates for the viewer a sense of intimacy with Joan.  At least it did for me.  I couldn't help but sympathize with her if not theologically, then purely visually. It is a terrifying thing to face death, but it is also an interesting twist for this story that Joan knows no matter what anyone says, that she is on the right side.  To be able to convey such inner turmoil in a character is a fantastic achievement.  Furthermore, the director shot her so well, that her performance needed to be as excellent as it was.  The viewer was going to get close to Joan and feel her pain.  That was a directorial decision, it was up to Joan to draw us closer. Also of note is the blatant reference to the `Odessa Steps' scene in Eisenstein's Potemkin (1925).  Dreyer's use of montage is appropriate and skillfully done.  However, I was a bit disappointed to see a repetition of what such a popular director had just done. Overall, this film seems to me to be a great example of film as art. Though visually stunning, the film's only downfall is that it may have been too long.  I feel the story could have been portrayed just as well in say, 30 minutes.  Something doesn't have to take an hour and a half to move us."
"snaz0001","10","3","6","5 September 2002"," there is no better film to begin a serious study of film
","The Passion of Joan of Arc, especially with the addition of Einhorn's score, is the best film I can imagine using as an introduction to film study. As a student/occasional-teacher of film studies, I tend to watch for all sorts of technical details and usually end up intrigued by films far more often than ""moved.""<br/><br/>Viewing this film is considerably different for me. It's something of a truism now that this is one of the best-acted, most emotive films ever created, and I couldn't agree more, which is why using this film to begin thinking about the myriad issues in film studies seems ideal.<br/><br/>On the most basic level, there is a wealth of topics related to symbolism and semiotics (silent films ""speak"" entirely in visual signs). There is also, as many others have pointed out, a use of camera angle and shot framing that is emotionally and narratively powerful, but also seems stylized to contemporary viewers, thereby simultaneously drawing viewers in and allowing a critical distance for examination of the technique.<br/><br/>The addition of Einhorn's score makes this film a wonderful case study in theories of textuality, textual authority and discourse theory. The various theories of authorship (Foucault's ""what is an author?"" and Barthes' ""Work/Text"" seem particularly applicable) can be studied at length considering that Dryer is not around to consult about the addition. Einhorn's libretto also raises a number of questions about the relationship between Dryer's film, the other stories of Joan of Arc (explored on the Criterion DVD), Biblical text and the female mystics. Biblical exegesis, textual criticism, semiotics and psychoanalytic theory can all be brought together to elucidate some of the most urgent questions any text can ask: what is the nature of humanity? What is the human relation to (a)god? What are the political/religious/ethical ways gender is dealt with? (or performed?) What is jurisprudence?<br/><br/>Usually, I would try to separate each of these inquires into film, if for no other reason than I know of few texts are both intellectually AND emotionally complex enough to support such a thorough inquiry without boring students. I'm not sure that this film could ever become ""boring.""<br/><br/>
I can recommend to film more highly than this one, especially to beginning students of film."

"EyeDunno","10","3","6","3 June 2001"," A silent film that speaks volumes (Criterion's Voices of Light version)
","What a beautiful and yet startling movie. I am currently watching it on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). It's outstanding, from the acting and cinematography to the words and music (""Voices of Light,"" performed by Anonymous 4 which was composed by Richard Einhorn who was said to have been inspired by the movie). This is a gem that needs to be seen by real film buffs (who would opt to view the film without sound, as director Carl Theodor Dreyer preferred) and current directors and producers. When I first began viewing it, I thought it had been filmed very recently. All the techniques used, from the placement of lights and cameras to the intimate close-ups of the faces of actors are stunning, almost shocking. As a still photographer, I feel the camera work by Rudolph Mate is tremendous -- there were angles used during the filming of the 1928 movie that still aren't used today. It's so powerful yet also unsettling; even with today's cinematography, Rudolph Maté's lens forced the viewer to see the pain up close, the insensitivity of the judges and guards... Maté's compositions must have been kept off-center to give the viewer a sense of imbalance. And when the film climaxed, camera movements rocked back and forth, or were swept upside down and even trampled on.<br/><br/>I wish I could have watched the making of ""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc,"" to see how the film crew and actors developed the movie. Word is that Dreyer insisted that no one wear makeup, which was unheard of in the making of movies in that time. He apparently was also obsessed with being factual and wound up relying on actual transcripts of the church trial. I am glad this movie has been released in video. Please, be sure to at least view this film with the ""Voices of Light"" music track, if not purchase it. I strongly recommend it, over what I recently saw in what may be the original music, a simple piano track. That version left me rather underwhelmed. <br/><br/>I had to save the best for last: actress Maria Falconetti. She never made another film from my understanding. Watch her body language and expressions, her tears and her eyes. One wonders if her heart was so involved in becoming her character, that perhaps she chose to not remain in films?"

From the first time you lay eyes on Falconetti, you realize that you're in for something special. I have never in my life seen an actor/actress express more emotion...with or without dialogue.  Falconetti demands your complete attention as she captures the martyr's torment beautifully.  A recent review on imdb claimed this film is depressing.  This may be true...but in a thoughtful way.  No, Dreyer doesn't explicitly *tell us* if Joan truly is a Saint.  The film would have been greatly diminished if he had.  But after watching the entire film, I think Dreyer's feelings on that matter are made very clear.  Bottom line: I'm not a big fan of silent movies, but I highly recommend you view this film.  And it's not just for ""art"" types, but anyone looking for inspired film making.  The DVD also includes Richard Einhorn's ""Voices of Light,"" music inspired by the film.

","I am selecting this french silent film as my initial user comment contribution to the IMBD. Viewing an average of 300-400 films yearly,I seldom discover a masterwork of cinema as ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". Dreyer's astounding directions, encompassing fluid camera movements and rapid editing techniques, are progressive for the era. Falconetti's intensive facial reactions appropriately convey bewilderment during the early investigation sequence, anxiety when faced with torture, and atonement in her final hour. Populated with an assortment of authentic faces, the motion picture transports one to the time period depicted. It is this documentary-like achievement which grants itself to the film's greatness. The fact that the script is based on the actual transcipts, leaves me to assume a high level of historical accuracy, something lacking from Besson's recent version. The print, seen on a videotaped TCM showing, was accompanied by an inspired music score which accentuates the imagery. I think the film is important in the history of cinema, and I look forward to viewing Dreyer's ""Vampyr"" and ""Day of Wrath"". 4 out of 4 stars"
"Andyh74","10","3","6","3 April 2000"," A Film That, Like Joan, Is Rebellious Yet Has a Soul
","WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is, for me, one of the top three films of all time.  I regard it very highly because the film is able to combine influences from different countries (e.g., the set design is part German Expressionism, achieved by one of the set designers, German-born Hermann Warm), communicates both Joan's disoriented state of mind and her spirituality (sometimes at the same time) and accomplishes both of these achievements by the film's third asset:  the cinematography, largely done by Frenchman Rudolph Mate.  Not even in a film by Sergio Leone (Once Upon A Time In The West, for example) was the camera used so adventurously with regard to its use of the close-up.  Dreyer is gutsy enough to violate certain film norms to convey a feeling of disorientation and yet intimacy, so that we closer identify with Joan's state of mind--that of intense devoutness and despair.<br/><br/>Dreyer has some shots canted (tilted) very severely, so that we're occasionally looking STRAIGHT UP at someone who looks down at us (such as Andre Berley's Jean D'Estivet, when he criticizes Joan).  Close-ups of people we've never seen before suddenly pop up, and we start to think: ""Who was that?"".  We lose our sense of what cinema calls spatial continuity, or a consistency in how objects are spaced from one another.  Because he uses so many close-ups, we cannot tell where one priest is from another, or where Joan is in relation to a priest who questions her.  We, like Joan, become confused at being interrogated (often the priests' questions are directed at US, as they look straight at the camera) from all sides.  The close-ups also emphasize contrasts in physical features (Dreyer made, as I understand it, his actors and actresses wear no make-up in the film), so that we see the ugliness of certain priests (particularly head interrogator Bishop Cauchon, played by Eugene Silvain) and the physical and spiritual beauty of Joan.<br/><br/>It is because of the rule-breaking cinematography, along with the superb acting--no one overplays their role as silent film actors often tend to do--that the film retains its' marvelous power.  Seventy-two years after the film appeared, it is still mentioned in reviews about a film where Joan of Arc is the subject (Luc Besson's ""The Messenger"" is the latest example), which attests to the film's strength.  Because of these virtues, I regard ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" very highly, and I strongly recommend that any filmgoer see it at least once, to experience a film that, like Joan, possesses a spirit that is timeless."

","For those who have seen Ingrid Bergman and later on Jean Seberg play the maid of Orleans in other interpretations of the Joan Of Arc story you might well do to take a look at what the French themselves have with their national heroine. The Passion Of Joan Of Arc made at the tail end of silent films give an actress normally associated with comedy a chance to give an astonishing interpretation of the maid. It also gives us the only recorded performance of Maria Falconetti to treasure.<br/><br/>Directed and written by Carl Dreyer, the sets are a bare basic item in this film, there only to establish a time and place. We see none of Joan's deeds of heroism, this film only concerns us with her trial and execution. And in an interesting and successful technique the entire film is told in closeups, more closeups than I've ever seen used before in any film. As she's interrogated by the Bishop of Cauchon who was in the pay of England's ally the Duke of Burgundy. The film cuts back and forth to closeup shots of the interrogators and then to Falconetti. Her expressions and her tears even without dialog create the image of the frightened and pure saint like girl just trying to do the right thing and stand by her conviction that she's been singled out to save France.<br/><br/>At least to my eye Falconetti bore more than a slight resemblance to Anna Magnani and I'm betting if talkies had been available she would have sounded like her as well.<br/><br/>There have been modern interpretations that Joan Of Arc might well have been a lesbian. What was really bothering her accusers was the fact that she was in male attire. Now leaving the question of sexual orientation aside, even if all that Joan was, was a symbol just getting around a battlefield might require the clothing that a soldier might wear. It wouldn't be practical to be wearing a farm dress. And certainly if one was participating in the battle it would be foolish.<br/><br/>But the male attire seemed to be what got the accusers going. They harped on it constantly during the interrogation. If this was proof that the Maid was a lesbian, than surely she was in league with satanic forces.<br/><br/>Depending on your point of view it could range from Joan actually hearing the voice of God to some hallucinatory ramblings from some kind of native intoxicant. Whatever it was she was convinced they came from heaven and more importantly she convinced others. It's why she remains France's national heroine and why she's such a challenging role for so many actresses. Maybe Meryl Streep will try that one next.<br/><br/>Until then Maria Falconetti takes her place alongside Ingrid Bergman and Jean Seberg. Watch them all and compare."

","Film is largely a religious experience. So when the narrative of a film itself pertains to a religious experience, it is doubly engrossing and cinematic.<br/><br/>What interests me here is Falconetti's face and how Dreyer uses his camera to paint that face. Faces are purely cinematic, perhaps the most cinematic things that have yet to be experimented with, probably because they are the most human. Falconetti's face is real beauty. Pure expression and conveyance.<br/><br/>The camera. It is static when painting Falconetti. It is moving, sliding, sideward-dollying when painting her persecutors. Falconetti is the fulcrum or the center-point, and the others are painted in a dizzying blur surrounding her that conveys the nature of the experience.<br/><br/>According to my ideas this is pure cinema."

","Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is a film that feels light years ahead of its time. Lean and mean, focusing its entire narrative on the interrogation of Joan that inevitably lead to her execution by burning at the stake, the film is kinetic in ways that most films even now aren't. Composed almost completely of tight close ups, Dreyer and crew cut rapidly between disconcerting, asymmetrical shots, giving the film a breathless, anxious, nearly frenzied pace.<br/><br/>Maria Falconetti gives an almost unbelievably intense performance as the title heroine. Her performance, and the film in general, does get a bit monotonous -- it exists primarily of impassioned gazes into the middle distance, giant, tearing eyes opened wide, an expression of passionate, nearly demented religious fervor on her face. It's not a film that concerns itself with characters and plot, so we don't get to know Joan as a person. It's difficult to care for her particular plight and we instead feel compassion for her as one human being feeling compassion for another. For that reason, the film left me remembering its striking images and formal style more than any emotions I might have felt while watching it. But it's no less of a remarkable cinematic achievement for that.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Watching a silent film made in the 1920s could be a jaded adjustment for people that are used to the storytelling methods of today, let alone one that abandons a score to aid the visuals. The Passion of Joan of Arc does exactly that, but with a purpose; the filmmakers want to explore a play by play of Joan of Arc's trial without inflicting their opinion onto the film. They urge us to draw our on conclusions on the happenings of the events. In their attempts of doing this, trying to connect with the character of Joan as a protagonist is difficult.<br/><br/>The film may have troubles identifying its heroine to the audience, however, the actress portraying the religious figure, Maria Falconetti, bares her soul through the eyes of the character. Never has authentic emotion been more present in a character than in it is Joan. Falconetti creates a stabbing ache in your stomach as you see the pain Joan has survived though and the state of fear she currently lives in.<br/><br/>Her performance is most famous for her glaring eyes that stare into space in what feels like every scene. My explanation for Falconetti's exaggeration is Joan's interaction with God (unseen in the film) was so overwhelming, it clouded her view of the world. Now every minute of her life, she sees those images of Him. It's a breathtaking performance that deserves to rank among the best in film history. <br/><br/>Carl Theodor Dreyer's mission to create something with is personal stamp of originality is found with The Passion of Joan of Arc's jumbled camera angles. He has thought up each cut, where the camera is placed, and how it contributes to telling this story. We, the audience, are just around to observe what's happening, we're not supposed to feel like a part of the history being told. It's usual editing for such a film.<br/><br/>The Passion of Joan of Arc is a religious-based film with a performance that will live on with Joan of Arc's legacy. The Passion of Joan of Arc is uncommon, and should be experienced. It gives Joan of Arc the credit as a Jesus-counterpart in the eyes of God, something that may not be understood to even deeply religious people prior to seeing the film.<br/><br/>Rating: A<br/><br/>Grade: 9"
"lreynaert","10","2","4","25 August 2013"," Revolutionary
","'Joan of Arc' is stylistically a key work in the history of cinema, through its combination of close-ups, camera angles, framing and movements of the characters and of the camera on this characters. Dreyer created a masterful visual sequencing with the movements of the heads inside the screen and of camera panning and tilting on these same heads (of the judges of Joan of Arc). This sequencing suggests an inescapable iron encircling of Joan of Arc (whose close-ups were filmed with a fixed camera) by her vicious judges. All these shots created the same effect as that of the painting 'Christ Carrying the Cross' by Jheronimus Bosch, where the serene face of Christ contrasts sharply with the ferocity of the visages in the crowd around him. The camera angles and the decentered and canted framing further accentuate the contrast between Jeanne's face full of grace and the grim facial expressions of her corrupt judges, a bunch of perfidious theologians and dishonest lawyers.<br/><br/>The film exposes blatantly the corruption of the Catholic Church, which slavishly defends the English crown and its interests. Instead of trying to stay above the political fray, it prefers to play an active role in a war of succession thereby choosing the interests of the foreign forces instead of those of the native population.<br/><br/>The character of Joan of Arc is interpreted sublimely by Maria (Renée Jeanne) Falconetti. Ongoing rumors of Carl Th. Dreyer's misogyny and sadism towards his actresses are contradicted by the testimony of the daughter of M. Falconetti in Torben Skjødt Jensen's documentary 'Carl Th. Dreyer: Min metier'. However, Carl Th. Dreyer put without a shadow of a doubt the quality of his shots and of the final product (his movie) above the fate of his actors and actresses (see the testimony of Preben Lerdorff Rye in the same documentary).<br/><br/>With 'Joan of Arc' Carl Th. Dreyer shot an eternal masterpiece. A must see."

But I cannot fault her acting.<br/><br/>The Criterion Collection comes with Richard Einhorn's ""Voices of Light"" as an optional score to the film. I strongly recommend this.

","The  Masters of Cinema series released their long-awaited restoration of Dreyer's ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" (1928) on Blu-ray last November. It includes the ""Oslo print"" in two different projection speeds, both 20fps and 24fps, as well as the ""Lo Duca"" bastardization. Highly recommended not only for the beautiful 1080p presentation but also for the booklet that comes with it.<br/><br/>It's been some 10 years since I last saw this, and intriguingly divergent films and memories have superseded Dreyer's film in the memory. I couldn't remember the stylized movement of the camera and the imaginative camera angles, and how they have likely inspired Eisenstein's ""Ivan Groznyi"" (1944) and Welles' ""Othello"" (1952). Dreyer's unflinching nerve, his clear vision, and the unity of that vision. Someone somewhere has called this the ultimate close-up, and it most certainly is. Nick Wrigley, formerly of the Masters of Cinema team, describes the release on Twitter as ""a magic death-defying fever dream. I can't imagine a luckier Blu-ray on earth. 20fps pure joy"". I really like the phrasing in ""death-defying fever dream""; this is exactly that, a fervent, dreamlike, atmospheric, never-consumed – much like his later masterpiece and for me his apotheosis, ""Vampyr"" (1932), his subsequent film.<br/><br/>And if you've never tried it, it's one of the most intimate experiences one can have, watching a silent film completely silent, without any music. I did this with the silent comedies of Ozu, released by the BFI on DVD, mainly because I didn't like the new scores they recorded for them. The experience is otherworldly.<br/><br/>The ""Lo Duca"" version now seems like a bad joke in its emotional manipulativeness. If you want to find out how to mistreat the beautiful passages of Bach and Albinoni, look no further and give the ""Lo Duca"" a spin.<br/><br/>I prefer the 20fps version, and I really have no interest in going back to 24fps unless for comparative purposes. It flows more naturally (to my eyes) and viewed silent has more flair to it (to my tastes).<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to many high definition fever dreams to come."
"rmax304823","8","2","4","23 December 2012"," Horrifying Masterwork.
","There's no doubt about Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" being a work of genuine poetry. Nothing like it had been seen before. The performances are nearly perfect, although Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc has few light moments, as you can imagine. Dreyer's direction was all new to the screen, mostly low-angle close ups. The set direction was similarly innovative. All the rooms are spare and brightly lighted. Even the torture chamber is clean and uncluttered -- no pots of oil bubbling over a fire, no hairy greaseballs going grimly about their tasks. We get a hypnotic glimpse of a spool of spikes whirling, and what appears to be some sharp and jagged farm implements hanging on the wall.<br/><br/>I don't know where the Dreyer managed to find such faces. Some of the bishops have warts that look like boils; some have handsome and earnest features. The dwarf-like low-lifes who tug her from place to place caper and giggle with glee at Joan's distress. BOY, does the church want her to sign that paper that will at once save her life and betray her belief in God's message.<br/><br/>But I can't watch it more than once or twice. There's very little in the way of torture -- nothing like today's movies with bath tubs of gore and screams so loud they launch your basilar membranes into a tarantella. Joan is feverish and faints and the good doctors bleed her, as is the custom of the day, and that's it for foreplay.<br/><br/>But when she burns, it seems to take forever, and Falconetti's face goes through one expression after another, like a chameleon changing its pattern. It's too painful.<br/><br/>Am I permitted to add a little note, not directly related to the film. In the last 1960s, the critic Stanley Kaufmann was teaching film appreciation at Columbia. He showed this movie and asked for responses. They ranged all over, comparing it to Preminger's movie about Jean Darc, the actual historical figure from both the French and English perspectives, and so on. It was one of the reasons Kaufmann was prompted to write ""The Film Generation,"" predicting that in the future classical movies would have virtually replaced literature as the principal art form. Within twenty years, he retracted his prediction, having found that in the intervening years the intellectual reach of his students had regressed to the mean, or perhaps dropped below it. <br/><br/>Anyway, you may not want to watch it often either, but you're not likely to forget it."

","A fairly well known religious story, French director Carl Theodor Dreyer made The Passion of Joan of Arc in 1928. Because it is silent and in black and white, facial expressions via frequent close ups must convey the sincerity of the subject. Whether she was insane and delusional or was actually hearing the voice of God is up to the viewer to decide. I have to separate my personal views as a retired Catholic from my review. <br/><br/>Joan is played magnificently by Renee Jeanne Falconetti, who so convincingly portrays the future saints' emotional character so well. Her performance has been hailed by many as one of the best ever captured on film. <br/><br/>The transcript of her trial is used as the basis, with judges on a panel interrogating Joan and doubting her message from above, to drive the English from France. Even under torture, she never relents, and it is not a spoiler to mention the burning at the stake, which is not a secret. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a work of art, regardless of ones beliefs about the supernatural. Ms. Falconetti's last role is a memorable one, which should be studied by everyone in the acting profession for a lesson in perfection."
"IMDBcinephile","Null","2","4","28 October 2011"," Compositions that will never leave you and emotions that will haunt me each viewing of the film
","I would like to note that I advocated Carl Theodor Dreyer way before I was seated in front of this film, which became to most critics, his crowning moment. He took cinema into sacrilegious areas and instilled ideas about the existence of a deity. These theocentric and glorious disembowelling of the truth of this and the truth of death are amongst a subject matter, which was picked up by Goddard, Bergman and Allen. It's good to know that it has been done, but Dreyer was ahead of this in condensing philosophical things to his films, such as this film, Vampyr and Ordet. What makes him more potent then Bergman (given that Bergman is a genius and undeniably knew how to make a film that tried to thwart any believe that he wanted to debunk. Powerful example of this is found in ""Winter Light"" (1963)), but let's just say Bergman tried a film that represented symbols rather than words. In Prison (1949), a film in which he dismissed as terrible, he uses visual ideas in quite crude ways. It's an anticlerical film in a way and it showed his passion in silent cinema, until he formalised his own approach head on. But he took ideas and brought them into nuanced complexity. Dreyer wanted to actually bring forth something as a standalone work and he never really wanted his opinion to be influenced into his films. I even think Bergman liked Dreyer; his works seemed to be influenced by him. Dreyer was a Danish director; he was one of the first masters of abstract images. It's bizarre to see overtly on his IMDb credits that his first film was ""The President"" made in 1919, even though it tackled similar ideas, it's unlike anything that his style encompasses. I discovered him by a feature that I fell in love with called ""Vampyr"" 1932; its mysticism, demythologising of the vampire and technological effects that set the way we move in Allan Grey's ventures, where he enters a world that we shouldn't have entered and he shouldn't have either is amazing and the demonology of the film is in my opinion really overlooked. It exploits death in such a way especially how Leone died by a ghost we don't see (similar to ""Blood of a Poet"" when Jean's character peaks through a painting to see a cowboy shooting a gun – the same nervous effect). The film is expressionistic, dominantly white and metaphorically about us as thinatophiles and in doing this, reifying legendary figures. When the Vampires Accomplice gets killed, the ending is perfect because it's a time glass and it symbolises the memento mori and again we want to see this guy die because he wants to see others die as well. And then it segues into the forest where Allan and the affected of woman go off into the sun, the first mammoth bit of life in the condition of the films environment. Enticed by the shadows of figures and interiors of cavernous places, it's no doubt a fantastic film and heavily overlooked. The power is understated, but gloriously executed. I had been excited about ""Passion"" for a long time; ""The President"" (1919), ""Mikhail"" (1924) and ""Master of House"" (1925) are the only silent films I was aware of that he made. I then dabbled into film documentaries (one of which was the episodic ""Story of Film"" by Mark Cousins) and I found out more about the realist film maker and this made me even more serious about getting it. It was a criterion edition I purchased and it came through last week. With those few films mentioned into consideration, Dreyer makes a foray into detailing Joan's story – The accuracy is diminished slightly, ultimately to accommodate the drama of the story, and instead Dreyer employs Marinee Falcolnetti as Jeanne D'arc and it's the most beautifully lit face in all of pantomime in cinema. There are a lot more that are probably better actors during that era, but it's an unequalled accomplishment to give such a resonance, simply with close ups (and it looks nearly like macro photography and this was during a time where these innovations weren't even around). I love seeing her response for salvation of soul, as if the apotheosis is manifestos. I don't believe anything that is said by Joan, but taking her impassioned words in this film, which are to me probably false and seeing how she goes against them, shows us the rigour of that terrible system. <br/><br/>The film interlinks objects with emotions and takes different accounts very serious. I nearly cried in the first half of it and as it culminated calamitously. Dreyer used a panning shot very infrequently when he showed the judges and there's one scene where the camera pans right down one of their faces and then it cuts to Jeanne in a state of despair about where she leaned the prayer from. The judges don't hate her, but rather that they hate her mendacity and hubris ways, which make them hypocritical just because she wants to help people. Two Judges plea that she is a saint and didn't stem from the Devil, but from God. As if by envy of her accomplishments in helping people, they refuse to accept any verisimilitude of the trial. Trust me, the subtle moments of cinematography such as when the people come in with the weapons or when they're getting out the stake and the unbelievable part when they tell her that the King wrote a letter just to get her to put down a signature to death, hits the emotional side, not because it's playing for poignancy, but because of the woe of it So while probably not the most accurate version of the story (I have yet to see Demille's ""Joan the Woman"" and actually read up on it), this is a bravura film and is close to being the best Dreyer film I have seen."

One of the greatest silent films ever made and among the greatest films of all time. Moving, unforgettable, and Maria Falconetti is mesmerizing. She is incredible, and lights up the screen in every frame. This is a must see film for anyone seriously interested in film and film history. Visually it is a remarkable achievement, especially the frequent close ups. Well edited and a film that is not easily forgotten, thanks to the extraordinary vision of director Carl Theodor Dreyer. He has created a cinematic piece of art."
"marcin_kukuczka","10","2","4","1 November 2009"," Something Only Silent Era Could Execute, Something Only Silence Can Still Achieve...
","When tormented by lots of noisy productions of modern cinema, blockbusters filled with effects and action so successful at the box office, it is easy to remain both blind and mute to true art that silently addresses human sensibility. However, though so often neglected, forgotten for years, considered 'lost', it appears to rise again after a few generations in order to overwhelm a totally different audience...<br/><br/>This film, having experienced a strange fate of storms and fires, had to wait for decades in the dust of forgotten past in order to be acclaimed one of the true classics of cinema, one of its most genuine achievements. And many people will perhaps agree with me that its story does not constitute the only reason for its success.<br/><br/>The most significant aspect that makes LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC so authentic nowadays are its humane depiction and realistic interpretation. It is not a hagiography of a saint who lived more than 500 years ago but a powerful insight into one of the most infamous trials in history when the daughter of God was found to be a daughter of Satan by...the 'holy' learned ecclesiastics. This trial, based on true notes, is presented in a unique, vivid manner where the viewer is stuck by merits galore characterized by profoundity of development, symbolism of visuals and simplicity of portrayals. Here, a necessary analysis must be made concerning the most significant merit of the movie, Marie Falconetti in the lead.<br/><br/>Considering Marie Falconetti, I would like to refer to the words entailed in the New York Times article which discussed the 'poignant' French film that premiered at the dusk of silent era. ""as one witnesses her (Marie's) eyes filling with tears or perceives a faint grateful smile crossing her appealing countenance, one feels that it would be difficult indeed to elicit from any other actress such an eloquent interpretation as she gives in this production."" Yes, Marie Falconetti gives a timeless, the most unique performance that appears to be as mesmerizing as it must have been in 1928. She executes the chain of various emotions from disappointment, shock, fear, sorrow, blissful hope, regret, to courageous dignifying faith. Her portrayal of a misguided lamb being found guilty, accused of heresy, tortured and executed by knowledgeable wolves is even more intensified by one more important aspect: close-ups.<br/><br/>Indeed, the film can boast an unusual number of close-ups --- ones, as Gary Morris nicely put it (2000), ""among the most harrowing, claustrophobic ever."" This strategy used so widely by director Dreyer makes the movie one ahead of its time, something innovative that introduced cinema to its more mature level of development. It also allows us to witness the whole drama on silver screen more intensely, feel sympathy for the main character while her bitter experience of the unjust accusations and satanic furies of the 'decent.' Throughout the movie, her face appears to represent the purity, upright heart, courage and holiness as contrasted to the wretched faces of wrath, corruption, hypocrisy and misery.<br/><br/>Besides, you can find lots of memorable moments thanks to Dreyer's masterful direction and Rudolph Mate's brilliant cinematography. Who can possibly skip such memorable scenes like the faces of the judges (the cast with no make-ups - so rare for its period), detailed symbolism of single images like torture chamber or mockery of Joan's Christ-like figure, the emphasis on various images of the Cross as sort of metaphorical manifestation of the main character's mind and heart. <br/><br/>I particularly liked the atmosphere close to the end when the viewer is truly led into the dramatic twilight of justice and, more to say, hope for justice. What seems to remain, what seems to be everlasting is... Love, the Love given by God, the Love that transforms and turns a dark night into a bright day: Joan takes the last Sacrament while the stake awaits her, the stake symbolizing earthly fire of destruction. These are the most powerful moments of the film. To make this experience even more unforgettable , I recommend you to see the film with Richard Einhorn's magnificent ""Voices of Light"" in the background. He wrote this music having seen the film and having been inspired by it.<br/><br/>Summing it up, I will again refer to the words of Gary Morris who reviewed the film at its DVD release (2000): LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC ""reverses the cliché that 'life imitates art."" Similarly to the Maid of Orleans, it was rejected, destroyed by fire, forgotten; yet, when everything seems to be over, the genuine power of honest art strangely triumphs, does triumph like Joan who was canonized 5 centuries after her infamous execution. Perhaps, it has a message for us, she has a message for us, a touching but universal message for humanity and about humanity: its rises and falls, its deaths and triumphs heard in the astonishing sound of silence."
"philipoffill-1","10","2","4","19 October 2009"," one of the finest works by a female lead in the history of Cinema
","Along side Marion Cotillard of la Vie en Rose, and Meryl Streep of Sophie's Choice, Rosaura Revueltas of Salt of the Earth and Jessica Lange of Rob Roy, Maria Falconetti's Joan of Arc is a masterwork of the cinematic arts.<br/><br/>Although it deserves to be rated as one of the best films of all time, let this beautiful work stay in obscurity to be seen only by those who seek it out. The price of admission is not enough to pay for the privilege to experience this film.<br/><br/>Additionally this remains an important movie. Joan's crime of consorting with God without the consent and supervision of His owners is the most dangerous crime of all. Politics, not spirituality, is the evil here. In this instance it was the Catholic Church used as the justification, but it happens constantly over and over any time those in power feel a challenge to their supremacy. Much love to the creators of this fine work."
"jzappa","10","2","4","15 October 2009"," The Overwhelming Power of the Human Face
","You will not appreciate the experience of silent film until you know the face of Renee Maria Falconetti. In a medium without words, where the filmmakers conceived that the camera seized the heart of characters through their faces, to see Falconetti in Dreyer's landmark is to look into electric, almost extrasensory eyes that will never relinquish you. She also embodies Joan with an unrelenting monastic guilelessness, moving as if in a dream, her body language so slow and meditative. She answers questions in taut earnest.<br/><br/>Dreyer had been given a large budget and a screenplay by his French producers, but he sacked the screenplay and turned in lieu to the archives of Joan's trial. They told the account that has become folklore: of how a rustic provincial girl, dressed as a boy, led the French troops in their triumph over the British occupation forces. How she was captured by French loyal to the British and brought before a church court, where her conviction that she had been emboldened by celestial apparitions led to accusations of blasphemy. There were many cross-examinations, supplemented by torment, before Joan was burned at the stake. Dreyer coalesces them into one trial, in which the judges, their faces wrenched with their alarm at her dauntlessness, hover over her with roars and charges. Men here who think they represent God are the cruelest to her. She remains undeterred. Believing her would compromise their beliefs. So she is punished for the same thing that drives them to punish her: Faith.<br/><br/>There is not one single establishing shot in all of Dreyer's passion play, which is filmed with eccentric, idealistic mystery by Rudolph Mate completely in closeups and medium shots, creating apprehensive proximity between Joan and her oppressors. Nor are there freely interpreted perceptible connections between shots. What does this signify to us? There is a lexicon of shooting and editing that we subliminally presume at the movies. We figure that if two people are talking, the cuts will make it appear that they are facing one another. We expect that if a judge is challenging a defendant, the camera position and editing will make it evident where they stand regarding each other. If we see three people in a room, we presume to be able to say how they are situated and which is nearest to the camera. Almost all such visual expectations are absent from this film, replaced by an all-encompassing disjointed effect.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the placement of cuts shapes the film into a sequence of surprising panchromatic imagery. The prison guards and the ecclesiastics on the court are seen in high contrast, frequently from a low angle, and although there are frequently knifelike structural shapes behind them, we are not certain precisely what the distance is. There is a shot of three priests, likely positioned from front to back, but shot in such a way that their heads appear piled on top of each other. All of the faces of the inquisitors are shot in bright light, without makeup, so that the clefts and blemishes of their skin appear to evince an ailing internal life.<br/><br/>Falconetti, in comparison, is shot in more delicate grays, instead of blacks and whites. Also without makeup, she appears austere and absorbed by internal certainty. Solitude proves her only on-screen companion in the whole film. Note an exchange where a judge asks her whether St. Michael indeed spoke to her. Her serene face looks to propose that whatever happened between Michael and herself was so far outside the compass of the question that no answer is possible.<br/><br/>Why did Dreyer splinter his space, obscure the visual impression and shoot in closeup? He might've wanted to eschew the refined snares of a historical drama. There is no landscape here, save walls and arches. Nothing was put in to look pleasing. You do not leave talking about costumes, granted they are all real. The preeminence of the faces asserts that these very people did what they did. Dreyer dismantles the church court of its ceremony and respectability and reveals its members as obese charlatans in the pay of the British. Their fixed eyes and mercenary mouths violate Joan's asceticism.<br/><br/>To us contemporary audiences, accustomed to films where emotion is reflected by dialogue and action more than by faces, a film like this 1928 sequence of expressions is a disconcerting undertaking, so penetrating we worry we will unearth more occult than we wish, although watching with the Visions of Light soundtrack makes a hugely profound difference. It is deeply moving music, and also allows a less demanding experience from a modern audience. It is a testament to the film's power that it also features a performance by Antonin Artaud, who wrote of a need for a ""Theatre of Cruelty,"" by which he meant a fierce, physical grit to eradicate false reality. He believed that text had been a bully over subject and implication, and wanted in its place a theatre comprised of a unique language halfway between concept and action. Our compassion is provoked so vigorously for Joan that Dreyer's visual methods don't even play like aesthetic decisions, but like the remnants of Joan's experience. Depleted, emaciated, frozen, in perpetual despair, merely 19 when she died, she lives in a chimera where the faces of her tyrants surge like savage nightmares."
"Lechuguilla","Null","2","4","22 May 2009"," Forces Of Darkness
","Historically compressed, this reenactment of the trial and subsequent murder of French martyr Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) is a famous silent film that has had a torturous past. The film was initially censored. Then the negative was destroyed. A second negative somehow survived but went undiscovered for fifty years.<br/><br/>The film is unusual in several regards. First, it has very little action. A big part of the film is the interrogation of Jeanne by Church hierarchy, hostile old men who fear her dedication and inner conviction. Second, camera shots are mostly close-ups, or of medium range. This strips images of background distractions in the interrogation sessions. Props and scenery are thus either absent or largely irrelevant.<br/><br/>The only consideration is the interplay between Jeanne and her tormentors. Camera lighting is bright when focused on the faces of the monks and judges. And none of the actors wore makeup, another unusual trait of this film. The visuals thus present these men as forces of darkness, looking hideous, barbaric, and cruel, unable to hide behind their righteousness or religious ritual.<br/><br/>By contrast, Jeanne comes across as sincere, courageous, honest, and unwavering in her convictions. Falconetti gives a really fine performance. Some critics regard it as one of the greatest performances in film history. Falconetti seems to have the ability to cry on cue.<br/><br/>After the interrogation, Jeanne is led outdoors where she is roped to a stake. The townsfolk gather to watch. Their sympathies, judged by their crying and grim faces, clearly side with Jeanne. The film's climax is uncompromising. The images at the end are quite potent.<br/><br/>This is a true story of a lone individual up against an arrogant, institutional bully. No wonder Jeanne d'Arc is now regarded as a Saint. The DVD provides a couple of options for watching this silent film: one with no sound at all, the other with the ""Voices of Light"" music track. I prefer the latter because the classical music instills a sense of historical majesty and grandeur to this simple, but powerful film."
"Golgo-13","10","2","4","7 February 2006"," ...and hope and faith...
","This silent masterpiece, based off historical records, reveals the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. It was wonderfully acted, with Maria Falconetti giving a particularly moving performance as the lead. And director Carl Theodor Dreyer really captures the detailed expressions and emotions of all the actors through a constant use of close-ups, which also added to the sense of distress and torment, and hope and faith, this picture intended to convey. The film is also quite stylish, with sharp editing, reverse camera angles, quick montages, and multiple instances of symbolism. Set design, or at least what was shown of it, was sparse but believably so, and gave several nods to German expressionism. The Criterion DVD does justice to this once lost work of art, giving us the option to watch it completely silent or with the Voices of Light soundtrack, an operatic orchestration inspired by the film, which I found to be very fitting. Also included on the disc is a comprehensive commentary track, a feature on the history and many versions of the film, and several other worthwhile extras. All in all, this is the best silent film I've seen and I'm glad I went ahead and purchased it."

","I should preface my remarks by stating that I am not a devout Christian, nor a Catholic, nor a film scholar. Yet, I loved this movie. ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is one of the most visually arresting feature films ever made. As I understand it, the film follows the transcripts of the trial of Joan of Arc. It is fascinating to watch the angst and anguish of this young woman. You really feel the strength of spirit that Joan had. As this young woman faces down the church and political leaders of her country without wavering from her convictions one cannot help but be moved and struck by the power of her devotion. The cinematography alone makes this film worthwhile."
"robbiedarkko","10","2","4","18 June 2005"," A Film For All Time
","I watched this film in complete silence because I wanted no extraneous input into a film I'd heard so much about. I think that might have been the right decision because I came away with a very high regard for it.<br/><br/>First things first: I didn't share the strong sense of anger - that many previews of the film evoked - about the legal and religious aspects of the plot. In fact, I didn't really see the plot as anything more than a subtext (in a literal sense) upon first viewing.<br/><br/>The real power of this film stems from the nuances and twitches of Maria Falconetti's face. Gazes clash - baleful against sorrow, defiance against pathic - frequently throughout the film, and it is in these clashes that the film's energy is generated.<br/><br/>Maria Falconetti, the lead actress, has been given so much praise over the years that you'd be forgiven for feeling just a little let down at the end... but that is not the case. Even though she is trying to convey raw, deep emotion in tiny segmental bursts, the times where she lapses into the huge trap of over-acting are minimal to none.<br/><br/>There were a few times I felt a little surplus from her work, but overall it deducted zilch from her overall performance.<br/><br/>This is a strange film - in the sense that it is the human and psychological aspects that overbear any other element. Don't get me wrong, though - considering how old the film is, the cinematography is wonderful throughout. The framing of Maria's face is awesome. So simple yet so forceful.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is why, even after all this time, and after all the advances in cinematic technology, the film still punches above its weight: there is no white powder or black eyeliner smeared across Falconetti's face, instead we see natural human skin in all it's porey glory.<br/><br/>It's very easy to sum up this film in a short line: it could be *likened* to a sort of Shakespeare of the screen. Highly recommended."
"shovlin1","Null","2","4","29 August 2004"," Look at the face.
","Look at her face. You can see it on the DVD cover. <br/><br/>Were you stunned, like me. Yes, the people living before 1928 had all the passion, the feelings and the beauty found in our present day society. Now brace yourself, because when Maria Falconetti animates that face in 'Joan of Ark' you'll wish she had continued on in at least one other film in her career. Her unadorned splendor in this film is unsurpassed by any other performance I have ever seen. The sparse geometries of the production set create a 'Picasso like' setting for this church sponsored judgment. Finally, the story is told within the realistic confines of Joan's trial, leaving her warrior past for a different movie script. I recommend this movie."
"sdl-2","10","2","4","17 August 2003"," The most powerful movie I've ever seen
","There is really nothing I can say about this movie other than to tell you to get a hold of a copy as soon as you can, and keep a few boxes of tissues nearby.  I've never seen any film, let alone another silent film, that sustains this level of emotional intensity for its entire duration.  The first ten seconds of this movie will show you why some directors chose to end their careers when talking-pictures became popular.  The expressions on the face of the incredible Maria Falconetti carry the drama in a way that no dialogue ever could hope to do.  My only warning is that this film is not entertainment; it is an overpowering work of artistic genius that could make a stone weep.  So make sure you are in the right frame of mind before watching it."
"pickwicknext","10","2","4","17 June 2003"," Absolutely stunning
","This is the most stunning film I have ever seen.  I first watched it on a test run where I work and could hardly take my eyes from the screen. (Which wasn't good as I was supposed to be working)  Dreyer's style for this film is unsettling and takes some time to get used to, but is entirely worth it. Movies like this aren't made anymore, nor do I ever expect them to be again. The cast conveys an amazing amount of emotional depth solely with their actions and expressions.  The film is both stark and moving and should be seen by as many people as possible.  It has an interesting history (you don't often hear about lost films being found at the bottom of janitor's closets in mental institutions) and deserves treatment as one of the true works of art of the 20th century."

I didn't know much of the details re the intrigues and political struggles over her situation so some of that was lost on me, but I knew they were sleazy rats who were attempting to manipulate her for their own ends.  I felt her suffering. Very powerful.<br/><br/>My girlfriend however thought it was way over the top.  Long, lingering cuts of a woman in extremis.

","Strikingly beautiful, the movie delivers even if you see without any sound. Surprisingly simple (only a few scenes, most of the movie is made of close-ups and shot indoors) it has nevertheless the characteristic that elevates a director to the height of myth. And here the screaming yet peaceful expression of Maria Falconetti is pivotal - she conveys all the emotions that the viewer feels, and therefore nearly expenses the need of other characters in the picture. Magnificently shot, amazingly acted, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, that has the power to make you really develop feelings towards it. Unmissable."

It was at times excruciatingly difficult to watch due to the incredibly believable, brilliant acting of Marie Falconetti. I was so drawn in by the image of her torment that I often found myself not breathing. The score accentuated the images, and was never overbearing or morose.

6. The dialogue, although it's in written form to be congruent with the silent film model, is captivating, and almost ethereal in its structure and delivery.
7. The pacing is perfect, despite the limited setting and constricting plot. The movie never once feels tired or outstays its welcome.
8. The death of Jeanne d'Arc is simultaneously enthralling, beautifully shot, and exceedingly sad.
9. The film serves as a fitting tribute to Jeanne d'Arc, by detailing her indomitable faith, the virulent church suppression, as well as her staunch French nationalism.<br/><br/>Cons:

It shows the prejudice of the religious community both in times long gone and now, and for the twenties, it's quite well filmed.<br/><br/>The cinematography is impressive in some areas, but the initial scenes are weak beyond description, the extreme and over-used close-ups becoming tiring and Dreyer's distaste for make-up results in some very unwanted glare from certain actors' faces.<br/><br/>But the thing that harmed this potentially perfect film the most is the fact that it lacks sound, had Dreyer waited a few years or attempted to get more or done anything to acquire sound mixing equipment, this film would have been better, the intertitles give the most obvious of the film's dialog and the minor chatter and several important scenes leave to read lips, this kept Passion de Jeanne d'Arc from being the religious epic to end all religious epics."
"rajah524-3","8","3","8","5 April 2010"," Very ""Hot Stuff"" in the France of 1928
","My theory on why we almost lost this one (most of the prints were destroyed in the '30s):<br/><br/>The Great War all but destroyed what was left of a French Enlightenment and democratic tradition that was little more than 150 years old. The culture that had spawned Descartes, Focault, Rousseau and Napoleon was in decline well =before= the huns charged across Flanders in 1914, but it was in a moral, spiritual and financial power-dive and headed down the road into a civil war between the urban socialists and communists vs. the urban and rural landholding, wealthy, ultra-conservative fascists in 1928.<br/><br/>The Holy Roman Church retained its power in the provinces, but as urbanization spread, France was splitting into a polarized culture of progressive, anti-clerical urbanites who watched films and listened to the radio and traditionalistic – and politically conservative -- peasants. The great landowners of the northeast had been all but ruined by the Great War, and it would be some time before they held the political power they'd had until 1914.<br/><br/>French politics involved endless battles between labor unions and manufacturers in the cities. Fascism was on the rise, but it was a listless, reactive, passionless sort, as opposed to all the excitement in Italy and Germany at the time. The modern viewer may do well to understand this as he or she watches ""The Passion"" For this is a film of metaphors.<br/><br/>The Paris intellectuals of the '20s saw Benedict 15th, and Pius 10th, 11th and 12th during the early part of the 20th century as the popes and anti-popes of Joan's day. <br/><br/>Joan of Arc had ""led"" the pro-papist (""conservative"") French forces that installed pro-papist king Charles 7th to the throne during the Hundred Years War against the English in the early 15th century. She may have been canonized for her role in ""saving France for Holy Roman Church,"" but she is also seen by many in France as the savior of the culture in the face of a very serious foreign threat. <br/><br/>Some saw French politics in the '20s and '30s as strikingly parallel to the politics of Joan's time. A prisoner of his very divided College of Cardinals (many from the Central Powers), Pius 10th stood on the sidelines as Germany and Austria-Hungary set about dismantling the rest of the Continent. <br/><br/>The urban French audiences of 1928, and indeed, the audiences in much of Northern Europe understood the ""message"" here, depending upon their point of view: Kill the threatening energy of French democracy and give us another ""man on a horse"" (and good churchman), in this case a war hero named Philippe Petain... the very same Marshal Petain who would head the puppet Vichy government for the Nazis just a dozen years later."

","While director Carl Theodor Dreyer is probably religiously motivated, the persistent usage of Joan of Arc's and the evil judges' Close Ups, which must be exceptionally innovative and progressive at the time, suitably conveys Joan of Arc's emotional intensity. Towards the end, several incredible external panning/tilting shots from extreme angles culminate the audience's emotion to the apex. It is hard to believe that the film was made in 1928.<br/><br/>The version I watched is scored by Richard Einhorn, who blends the Middle Ages-esque melisma with a contemporary post-minimalism taste. The score is composed in 1985 and performed by Anonymous 4, and is impossible to exist as a soundtrack back in 1928, but for the contemporary audience it appropriately accompanies the film."

On the one hand the facial close ups were pretty, but they got tedious for me, and I do feel that I have a lot of patience with movies.<br/><br/>	I feel that this movie could have benefitted a great deal from sound. Mainly because in a court room interrogation sound would be useful.  Given that the actors in the film would also have made as good voice actors as they are actors, this could have been very captivating.  As it is I found the most interesting scene to be the torture wheel.  The slower film speed makes it appear abstracted and dreamlike.  The interrogations still have their intense bits, and I feel that the supporting actors contributed very well to the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>	The main long term artistic merit of the film is the artistic cropping of the close ups of Joan.  The same close ups and cropping were used on Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3.  There is even a head shaving scene in both movies.  Alien 3 seems to be praised mainly for mood and cinematography by other imdb reviewers.  It borrows these from Joan of Arc.  This shows that these devices are still relevant today, which means that Passions of Joan of Arc has framing and set up that are considered good by a general audience today.  This also shows that facial close ups of a woman with a shaved head just do not necessarily make a good movie without substance to back the film up.<br/><br/>	What back up there is in Joan is excellent.  The story is based on reality which gives it distinctive twists, so plotwise the film is stable.  The actors who make up the court trying Joan are excellent.  They make the film worth watching.<br/><br/>	My final recommendation is to skip this, unless you like artsy close ups, or have some special reason for viewing it.  It was slow for me at bits, and I doubt that you be captivated by the whole film.  The excellent acting keeps the movie from being to tedious, but it didnÕt pull me in.  This may be due to grainy image quality on the edition I watched, and not due to the film."

","I watched the Criterion Collection from an original found in a Norwegian mental institution in 1981. The condition of the film looks crisp and perfect. It is based on the trial transcript of Joan of Arc. The film starts with Joan in prison. The religious authorities question and berate the young girl. They bring her to the torture chamber. At the breaking point, the priest guide her hand in signing a confession. She is eventually burnt at the stake. Renée Jeanne Falconetti stars as Joan. Her big eyes glow with passion. She is a bit old to play the teen martyr. Otherwise, this is an impressive acting performance from the silent era. The constant use of closeups is quite compelling. It's almost a piece of painting or art."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","5","12 October 2011"," If one picture is worth a thousand words, Maria Falconetti's eyes are worth a thousand frames ...
","Never had the torment of a woman been as beautifully portrayed, inspiring nothing but pure sympathy, as in Dryer's silent masterpiece, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", pure sympathy in the Christian meaning of the word, and I'm not even Christian.<br/><br/>I can't describe the emotion that tunnels me through Falconetti's eyes; words are feeble, futile, risible, such a performance can't be praised enough, it's like the divine touch of Joan of Arc really embraced Falconetti, she WAS Joan of Arc reincarnated on celluloid, it's even as if Carl Theodore Dryer traveled in time and shot the real trial of Joan of Arc  I know, this is from Jean Cocteau, but I'm only paraphrasing what is probably the feeling of a vast majority.<br/><br/>We will never know how God inspired Joan to resist to the English Invasion during the Hundred Years War, and it's only fitting that this unintelligibility is featured in a silent film. What we see is an ounce of divinity inhabiting the eyes of Falconetti, this life in her eyes is the guiding light that comes from the bottom of her soul, we see but we can't reach it, because Dryer doesn't deify the heroin, not even make a martyr out of her. Indeed, if one word could describe Joan of Arc in the film, it's a vulnerable, poignant and heart-breaking humanity. Her face provides such a wide range of emotions that she hypnotically embodies the weakness of a woman harassed by a bunch of heartless judges, scared to death, scared OF death, yet she stands for her convictions. Her body betrays her emotions, but her eyes resist, her eyes mirror the true strength of her soul: an unflappable faith.<br/><br/>Dryer's directorial work also deserves praises for the significant part it plays in the film, if you combine it with the editing and the screenplay. The movie is a period drama, but there are no castles, no riding knights, no feasts, no battles, except for the chaotic execution's aftermath. And the trial is only an excuse for probably the first cinematic character study, centered on one of the most legendary heroin that even graced the course of humanity's history, and God knows not enough women did what Joan did. Joan of Arc defines the very word of heroin as someone who's anything but a victim, choosing her fate, her destiny, not out of bravery but despite her fears. It's easy to die when you're not afraid of dying, but never heroism can be displayed without something precious at stakes. In the case of Joan, how could have she discredited her belief that God came to her ... to save her life?! What was the point of living after that? <br/><br/>Like for any hero, there's the pivotal test, when she's subtly lured into signing the infamous paper that would saved her from excommunication, from the bonfire, at her integrity's price. But when she realized she signed out of fear, she immediately retracted and symbolically signed her own death warrant. How could she lie to herself when her eyes breathed the truth in its purest form? This is what the story is about, Joan's passion, a passion transmitted to the crowd when her head was shaved, when she carried the cross, when she burnt on the bonfire. Joan embodied a Christ-like martyrdom, sadder than inspiring, we feel sad because she's human, mortal and vulnerable. For the judges, the crime isn't even blasphemy, it's pretension. They mock her, shout at her, even condescendingly laugh, but there's always one moment where her eyes manage to penetrate the soul of one of them, and for a brief instant, one heart is touched by a sort of ephemeral light betrayed by one imperceptible facial expression.<br/><br/>On that department, the movie is a school case. I said it's not a period drama made on a epic scale, it's not even on the scale of a trial film. The whole film is made of countless cuts and close-ups with a close to perfect capability to convey the right feeling. The film is a masterpiece, not just by silent films' standards, it reaches a level of artistic greatness independent from any attempt to tell a story. Look at the film even without that haunting medieval music and you'll still find yourself transported by these eyes, these facial expressions, even the wrinkles on the faces, the severity of a closed mouth, emphasize the nightmarish feeling endured by Joan. The camera is always kept low with the antagonists as to reinforce their powerful position, while Joan is under the camera with her eyes looking in God's direction. Whenever she feels weak, she looks down then turn her eyes to God, at times, her eyes move in every direction, when she's panic-stricken as any 'weak' woman, but ultimately, she recovers the extreme serenity of a privileged human being touched by the divine grace.<br/><br/>Yet, at the end, she's still scared, and when she finally meets God, you can tell on people's eyes, the guilt carried on their heart, to have allowed such a martyrdom to happen. What follows is a chaotic violent battle, that leaves us almost emotionless because Falconnetti drained all our emotions, and we're simply exhausted after such an intense and disturbing experience. Again, you can analyze and make all the essays of the world, it always comes to this : Maria Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc is the soul of the film, and the greatest cinematic performance ever, and the fact that it's her only role, makes it even more legendary, Falconetti and Joan of Arc are almost equally iconic.<br/><br/>And in these recent days where the growing success of ""The Artist"" revived the interest for the Silent era, movies like ""Joan of Arc"" are vital to understand how silent films, beyond their nostalgic value, elevated cinema to its truest essence as maybe the most powerful artistic medium, to convey the universal language of the soul."

","Starting with Eisenstein's ""Ivan the Terrible,"" I began to be comfortable with these early films and their incredible focus on faces. This is like an 80 minute slide show, using some of the most wonderful expressiveness I have ever seen. I know this could be boring to some, but even in shots that seem repetitious, there are subtle differences that express the absolute summit of emotion. This story has been done so many times and it usually falls on the hopes of the character to express, usually in words, faith. Here Joan is so human and yet so saintly. She is devoted to her faith but also afraid. We need to remember that this person came from humble beginnings, unable to even read. Perhaps she was delusional. Personally, I have trouble with any of this, but she certainly could not be more heroic. When she recants her confession, she does so in the shadow of the stake. I was intrigued by the soldiers and the villagers at the end. Did this really happen? I don't recall this in other treatments though I may have forgotten. It is also wonderful that this film was restored. It is crisp and bright and needs to be to show every wrinkle of its characters."

","I go to the movies to feel more human. I want to see on screen what I feel inside my heart, and when a film expresses emotion so authentically--so real--that I am moved to tears, then that is the highest praise I can give.<br/><br/>Falconetti's portrayal of Joan is what everyone else has said: powerful, sensitive, and moving. Her eyes burn up the screen. In them, you see Joan's struggle for truth and justice, and her love of God. In a less capable actress, Joan would come across as vapid, insane, or fanatical, but Falconetti takes you to the precipice of your emotions and it is a mystical experience to watch.<br/><br/>Dreyer's direction is visionary. Unlike most silent films, it is wonderfully modern in its use of close ups of Falconetti. Beyond these remarkable closeups, Dreyer has a great visual sense, most notably in two pivotal scenes: the torture chamber, which gets your heart pumping, and the climax/finale, where you feel for Joan and then it rouses you (like the crowd) to anger. The film's sets are spare and white, not unlike a sanitarium, which gives you a sense of the trapped sensation that Joan must have felt in her last days on earth.<br/><br/>Buoying this work of art is Richard Einhorn's score, ""Voices of Light,"" which although not the original musical accompaniment to the film, it was inspired by the film. The score is worthy in its own right and it adds considerably to the film's impact.<br/><br/>The backstory how this lost film was ""found"" in a mental institution is worthy of further investigation. I commend the Criterion Collection for producing a superlative DVD with nice features normally not reserved for silent films."

It is a good movie regardless of what you believe because it draws you into its own world, and keeps you shackled there until the end.<br/><br/>If you're the type of person who notices little details in movies, that's definitely a bonus, because there are a lot of visual metaphors (ex. there is a shadow of a window on the floor that looks like a cross. One of the priests steps over it covers it with his shadow).

"Foxxpix","2","4","15","15 September 2016"," A missed opportunity by a pompous filmmaker
","A number of challenges arise when attempting to produce a film based on historical events. The primary challenge being the decision of whose version of history is to be told. Another of the monumental challenges facing the filmmaker is deciding what resources to use in the design and execution of the film. By the late 1920's, advancements in cinematic equipment and technique were becoming more refined to include many of the basic cinematic innovations that are commonly used today. Careful filtering of different styles over the course of several decades led to these refinements. However, when it comes to methods of creating personal style, there are always those who want to spend time reinventing the wheel or those who decide that they know better than those that came before them. This often leads to artistic revolutions that last a short time before dying out and the art reverts to the basics. This essay will analyze the flaws in The Passion of Joan of Arc in both cinematic composition and narrative construction. <br/><br/>Before film, audiences were used to going to plays and seeing the action from one vantage point. As the art of cinematography was developing, filmmakers realized that the action had to stay on the same axis for continuity. This has become known as the 180-degree rule. This is a common rule of axis that allows the audience to orient the characters' relationship to one another regardless of the compositional framing. The Passion of Joan of Arc frequently breaks this rule, which has the effect of disorienting the viewer and giving no firm frame of reference to the geography of the Mise-en-scène nor to the positions of characters. This issue is compounded by the overuse of close ups and washed out background that is bereft of any compositional detail. This was an odd choice considering the overwhelming abundance of magnificent architectural constructs available to those filming in Europe. <br/><br/>This film is also hindered in the area of narrative construction. Although the historical figure of Joan of Arc might have been very familiar to European audiences due to her sainthood in 1920, it is no doubt true that some who may view this film might have no firm understanding of the events of the story. The lack of any expositional context is unforgivable even during this early period in cinema. The film opens with the book that supposedly contains the historical transcript of the trial from which the story is based. The text is written in two languages, one of which was swiftly fading from common use by the time of the production of the film. Another flaw in using this document as the basis for a story, which culminates in the burning death of a teenage girl, is the singular perspective of the transcript and the treatment of it as reliable. There exists no counterpoint to this trial therefore no advocacy of the defendant. <br/><br/>These issues point out the basic artistic and technical flaws of filmmaking that had been weeded out by most in the industry by the time this film was made. The single redeeming characteristic of this film based on these criteria is the acting. Thompson and Bordwell say, ""Renee Falconetti gave an astonishingly sincere, intense performance as Joan"" (Kindle Loc. 5896) It can be said that the performances in The Passion of Joan of Arc are beyond any negative criticism. However, this sole exception cannot compensate for the overall poor execution of this production. Therefore, it can be argued that had the filmmaker used more fundamentally cinematic techniques, The Passion of Joan of Arc may not have fallen into obscurity only to be discovered in a sanitarium in Oslo back in the 80s."
"arturmachado-29588","4","3","10","28 August 2017"," Dogmatic religious fervor
","Silent film about the trial of Joan of Arc. The film begins with the description of the discovery of the records of her trial affirming that it is based on these. From there we are transported directly to the trial, from the trial to the torture and from there to the bonfire. In between we have many facial expressions close-ups from the various protagonists involved in the process, from the glumness and fury of the clerics who accuse her of heresy and witchcraft, to the passivity and lack of presence of mind from one or another monk and Joan herself. Scenarios and environment are relegated to a secondary plan practically nonexistent. At the end of the film, the population at first anxious for the inquisition circus, only and just after Joan is burned, begins a riot of redemption against the guard, a historically fantastical event without any source that proves it.<br/><br/>The film, in cinematic terms, is very crude, with nothing innovative at the technical level. However, it achieves its goal of managing to transmit the unfairness of the trial and conveying Joana's sense of connection to God, especially in the accompanying music version that nicely complements the expressions of actress Maria Falconetti throughout the process, making the viewing experience a little more sentimental. But the history of this martyr goes far beyond a trial that here represented does not capture the essence of her personality or the remarkable achievements that led her to this fateful point of her life. Assuming that the spectator is already familiar with the story of Joan of Arc, it lacks the character development in the historical context so that we can identify with it properly, which portrays a trial purely for rancorous and patriarchal reasons, and although this is true, there were also political interests that are never mentioned, revealing an obviously biased work that tries to acerbate dogmatic religious fervor even more. Therefore, this film fulfills its tendentious goal in a very crude way but nothing more than that, leaving much to be desired, and only out of respect for this historical figure I do not score it less than 4/10."
"tieman64","Null","3","10","3 January 2010"," ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" vs ""The Trial of Joan of Arc""
","This is a very brief review of Carl Theodor Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" and Robert Bresson's ""The Trial of Joan of Arc"".<br/><br/>Some thoughts...<br/><br/>1. What's immediately apparent when comparing these two films, is how focused Dreyer is on showing the opposing forces present at Joan's trial. Who was the chief architect of her martyrdom? The English invaders who imprisoned her? The French clergy who tried and condemned her? God? The girl herself? The people who identified with her and gave her martyrdom political purpose? <br/><br/>2. Dreyer always keeps Joan isolated within the frame, plumbing a solitary soul's duress under persecution. Elsewhere he deftly shows the transformation of the witnessing masses from a crazy mob into a responsible voice of moral protest.<br/><br/>3. Maria Falconetti, who plays Joan in Dreyer's film, is given some of the most celebrated close ups in cinema history. What became of her? One legend claims that she so identified with her one major film role that she ended up in an insane asylum, convinced she was Joan.<br/><br/>4. Unlike Dreyer's film, Bresson's is filled with non professional actors. His is a dry, almost distant film.<br/><br/>5. Whilst Dreyer's film oozes grand emotions, Bresson's is modern, minimalist and existentially blunt.<br/><br/>6. Bresson avoids the circus and stresses Joan's solitude. His Joan is defiant in court, but privately she is at a loss, constantly praying for answers.<br/><br/>7. Dreyer's Joan (a kind of instinctual folk hero) acts according to her feelings, while Bresson's acts according to her conscience, which fluctuate as she broods.<br/><br/>8. Bresson's Joan is actually reluctant to embrace martyrdom. She's in over her head, unsure, confused.<br/><br/>9. In Dreyer's film, the audience becomes both Joan and the masses supporting her. In Bresson's, however, the audience is positioned as an outsider. We're the prison guards, the jailers, the priests, always ""seperated"" from Joan (by holes, by walls, by bars). The poor girl's kept at a distance.<br/><br/>10. Bresson's film is filled with visual echoes. Joan's hands, chained across a bible, resemble a pair of wings. At her execution, her hands, now tied behind her back, reappear in closeup. When doves appear, shot from below, we are reminded of Joan's ""winged"" hands to haunting effect. The point: an image of confinement has become one of ultimate liberation.<br/><br/>11. Bresson's film begins with two sounds: the ringing of church bells, followed by a drum roll. It ends only with a drum roll. Joan silences the Church that has put her to death.<br/><br/>12. Bresson has criticised Dreyer's film on numerous occasions, stating that he found the acting ""grotesque"". He's right. Joan was a hardened warrior who fought with men. Why then does Dreyer portray her in such a melodramatic fashion? On the flip side, Dreyer's images do tap into something almost primal.<br/><br/>13. Bresson's film abounds with delicious ambiguities. Was Joan really receiving messages from God? Is she deluded? Was she a crazy freedom fighter or holy saint? Was she simply a 15th century terrorist, opposing the English occupying army and the tents of the Catholic Church? <br/><br/>8.9/10 - ""The Trial of Joan of Arc""<br/><br/>8/10 - ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" <br/><br/>Both masterpieces, though I personally prefer Bresson's austere approach. Worth one viewing."

","I haven't seen many silent films, they always seemed remote & dull, unable to muster the kind of sensory battering 21st Century Schizoid Men like us are used to. I've begun to see hyper kinetic visuals as lazy and impoverished in their own way, though. Mellower efforts from bygone eras offer much on their own terms. Not so much boring & old as...different. Like reading a book a silent film lets more of your own imagination fill in the blanks; there's more participation. I think that's key to helping people feel less numbed-out by all the excess stimulation now but that's for another rant.<br/><br/>A filmed interpretation of the final days of Joan of Arc, this movie just *has* to come up in a lot of feminist classes. The whole thing is the prolonged torture of an innocent maiden, her refinement & beautification through pain lovingly administered by the Man.It just wouldn't work as a modern movie either,the dreamy disconnect of all silent flicks is essential in maintaining the strange religious hysteria without the stark repugnance of the situation overwhelming it.The spot-on music & Maria Falconetti's mesmerizing features evoke real intensity; who knew silent films could be so moving? (Then again,I thought that once then saw ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT).<br/><br/>So little actually happens just the camera lingering on the agonized reactions of our heroine with haunting choral music plugging away in the background. It gets at something pure few movies today would.So intimate, so epic. There's an undeniable awe, all from lingering shots of near-demonic patriarch faces, doe-like Joan receiving the officially approved Galgothan experience.<br/><br/>You can see why the central performance is still regarded as one of the best. The saintly Joan's wretched pain & stark terror, broadcast loud as day over her elfin face is etched into our heads by the movie's end. She glows brighter the worse it gets,humiliatingly shorn of hair, abused and at last- martyred.The horror is foremost but also gut wrenching sadness,the torment of a lamb abandoned by her Shepard to a den of wolves in sheep's clothing. Especially in the scene between her and the sympathetic priest Artaud (the only other person here that commands a fraction of the same magnetism)does the utter brokenness of Joan and her hopeless situation hit deep.I can't think of many actresses who looked more ethereally beautiful over the course of a movie in direct proportion to how much awfulness is dredged on them.The whole experience is Maria Falconetti's agony & ecstasy; her sad,wasted, haunted face."

"gentendo","7","2","6","8 March 2009"," Standing for Something
","The Passion of Joan of Arc is a deeply moving story about the last vindictive trial of Joan's life before her martyrdom at the stake. Joan's story is uncannily similar to the story of Christboth were viewed as extremists; both were thought to be a threat to political power; both were told to deny their beliefs by a group of tyrannical clergymen; and both were ultimately murdered for their convictions. Joan, like Christ, becomes more and more at a loss of words as she is vehemently interrogated, knowing full well that her words are futile and that death awaits her. Her silence, in many instances, parallels the silence of Christ and is perhaps the most powerful testimony she gives against the brooding Englishmen who enslaved her.<br/><br/>Her story is also strangely similar to Joseph Smithfor why else would such a seemingly insignificant character as nineteen-year old girl, Joan, attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling? Some would argue that it was due to Joan's military status in the French army, and though indeed that might be partly true, I don't believe it's the full truth. There must have been something more in Joan's testimony that caused such ""great ones"" to behold her as a threat to the entire English government. I mean, why would a mere denial of her ""vision of God"" be enough to satiate these blood-thirsty hypocrites? There must have been something else driving their motives. Nevertheless, I find it very peculiar that she was greatly feared amongst such ""powerful men."" Extreme close-ups are used quite abundantly throughout the entirety of the film to help show the exhaustion of Joan. I believe this technique was used to capture how violated she must have felt: nothing but angry faces ranting and railing up-close against her, as if Dreyer was purposely trying to attack the audience so that they could live vicariously through her torment. One close-up after the next, we see the deterioration of Joan as her life is fed to entropythe audience feels equally as deteriorated by the end too. I think the use of close-ups was incredibly powerful. They allowed for a type of transcendence to occur. This transcendence takes the form of seeing the life in Joan's face fade more and more; concurrently the audience prays for her spirit to transcend the pangs of her body and be freed from the hell she experiences on earth.<br/><br/>The film, in this sense, has a very transcendental quality. Though the audience may never have to experience a martyrdom like Joan or Christ, they will feel the desire to want to be freed from their own physical bondage, pain and suffering. The film is silent, and as such, creates a sparse-style of transcendencesomething that speaks softly to the soul, unlike DeMille's abundant-style in The Ten Commandments. It offers a lot of room for reflection as we sit there beholding these intense images in holy silence.<br/><br/>Having mentioned transcendence, I believe the film has much to say about the relationship between salvation and man. As Joan is being savagely questioned about her ""vision of God,"" the clergy keep reminding her that her sins can be forgiven in and through the Church. Never once do they mention that salvation comes through Christ, let alone Godit's always through the authority of the Church. I think Dreyer is merely trying to remind the viewer what history books have already enlightened the world with: that there is something strange about salvation coming from a ""learned"" group of men who appear pious and holy devout to the Divine, but who lack inner-conviction and act as wolves dressed in sheep's clothing. ""By their fruits ye shall know them,"" seems to be the underlying theme to this film. These men do not emit the qualities of goodnessthey are depicted as fearful and angry; they stop at nothing to force Joan to confess a false testimony. They are like the Pharisees of old who attacked and stoned the prophets all to maintain and secure the appearance of godliness. Their fruits, however, reveal who they really are: tyrants of a brute nature.<br/><br/>One quality I really respected and identified in Joan was her humanity. She wasn't depicted as some sinless warrior, let alone saint who was constantly in God's good standing, but at one moment succumbed to the frailty of her mortal condition and fell before God to preserve her life. In this moment, she renounced her vision in order to acquiesce to the Englishmen's desires. It was contrived though, and she knew it. Feeling the pangs of a guilty conscience, she immediately called back the guards and repented of her sin. I loved seeing this character arc in her because it made her even more real; more relatable; more human. This sequence demonstrated the power of repentance, and how even the noblest of God's children are not immune to the temptations of the body. All must immerse their lives in the principle of repentance (i.e. change from man's will to God's will). Though God's will is often very personal and nebulous, it is not to be determined by the will of ""learned, erudite scholars,"" but from careful adherence to what one considers is the right path."

","I have read all the other comments and agree with all of the favorable ones. This is the best film I have ever seen. There is not much I can add to what has been said.<br/><br/>I was surprised, however, that there wasn't more mention in the comments of the connection of this movie with at least two of Sergei Eisenstein's.<br/><br/>The last portion of the movie shows that Dreyer must have seen Potemkin. The similarity to the Odessa steps scene is striking. This is not to take any thing away from Dreyer.<br/><br/>I had always thought the Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible has the most amazing closeups and interesting faces. Having seen this film, I think that Eisenstein must have seen this.<br/><br/>Thus, I see a two fold connection between Dreyer and Eisenstein. Dreyer taking from Eisenstein's Potemkin and Eisenstein using Dreyer in Ivan the Terrible.<br/><br/>Of course, since both directors are in my cinematic pantheon, it just could be that genius often expresses itself in similar ways."

","Remember when in ""Sunset Boulevard,"" Norma Desmond asserted that in her era, the silent era, ""They had faces!""  Well, this film certainly has faces. Carl Theodore Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" indeed ends the silent era on a high note by projecting, like none before, its strongest attribute - the visual.  <br/><br/>In a way, this is how Bach brought the baroque era in music to its culmination.  Once he had made his statement, there was nothing left to say. I think the same can be said about Dreyer and his ""Passion""<br/><br/>Moreover, I think Dreyer's ""Passion"" can be compared to Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion"". Both were created by Lutherans, who took their religion seriously. Bach used music as the idiom of his devotion, as I think Dreyer did with film. In fact, Dreyer's frustrated ambition was to make a Life of Christ, which he had finally begun just before his death. I would suggest, that what we are seeing in ""Joan of Arc"" and Dreyer's other films is - as we are hearing in Bach's music - the passion of a great master.<br/><br/>By the way, Pauline Kael says that Falconetti's Joan may be the greatest performance by an actress ever filmed."

"truemythmedia","10","1","2","11 September 2019"," The Greatest Silent Film Ever Made
","A magnificent film. The story itself so simple yet languorously explored in a series of long tracking shots, close ups, and dutch angled or lopsidedly framed scenes which seem to unfold a presence inside and hovering over Joan and the Church/Civil court proceedings. That presence or inescapable fullness is a marvel of filmmaking. How does one show the presence of what is unseen in a visual medium? Ironically the answer for Dreyer is often, to film nothing in particular and detach the camera from what the eye most wants to see.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with the story portrayed in the film, Joan is accused by the English of heresy and blasphemy, claiming that God has sent her an angel, commanding her to lead an army of the French to defeat the English. Of course to the English this seems impossible because that implies that God loves the French more than the English and so the question her, attempt to trick her, and even torture her before she is eventually executed by fire.<br/><br/>For a movie without sound, it is remarkably easy, through the performances, to interpret the roles of each of the court officials and priests as well as what degree to which they sympathize or abhor Joan. It is a testament to the development of cinephilic language to which Dreyer contributed that with the aid of only a sparse use of title cards, the audience is not only never lost but somehow transported into the bare court which Joan of Arc was forced to endure. I never felt like I was just watching something happen. I felt more like I was in the crowd, sitting next to a wicked priest condemning her, in her stead as she approached the instruments of torture, or even a member of the crowd, come to watch her death. That is quite a feat in a film where there is no sound to aid in that immersion.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that it isn't work on the viewer's part. Intentionally, I think, Dreyer has directed a film in which you must be an active participant. It is easy to wander off in your mind or find yourself glancing down at your text messages. Just as Joan must actively submit herself to her death, we the viewer must make an effort to join her.<br/><br/>For this reason, I find this film to be an excellent companion during this particular time of the year: Lent. During a season in which we deny ourselves forms of comfort and go beyond mere attempts to 'not commit sins' and find knew levels of resolve, weakness, and faith, I am reminded of how easily I stumble, even as Joan does, and hope that I may too, endure whatever trials I will face.<br/><br/>It is a constant reminder that the faith which men may see as silly or weak is in fact, as Marcus Vinicius of ""Quo Vadis"" claims, a faith of courage."

What unravels is a meticulously paced film that, hopefully, should delight viewers.<br/><br/>The film is completely silent and black and white, unless you listen to it with Voices of Lights, a orchestra that performed just for this movie. I have not watched Joan of Arc with it, but it is highly acclaimed. Renée Falconetti is the leading woman and gives one the most amazing performs, despite not talking. This is because the film is shot in almost all close ups, and she portrays such brutal emotions throughout the movie. By now most people know how this film ends, but it still comes has a shock, and so does the whole movie.<br/><br/>Joan of Arc will leave you speechless, and the director, Carl Th.

"ZildjianDFW","10","1","2","20 May 2011"," A Haunting Masterpiece
","When Carl Theodor Dreyer made this film in 1928, he wasn't yet the fixture of European cinema that he would be in later years. He had made several films in Denmark, now rarely seen. But this film was a revelation, and single-handedly put him on the map – four more great films followed (at long intervals): Vampyr, Day of Wrath, Ordet, and Gertrud, establishing Dreyer as one of Europe's predominant filmmakers.<br/><br/>The Passion of Joan of Arc, based on actual court records from the time, tells the story of Joan of Arc's trial and execution. It says little, and shows nothing, of her earlier exploits, and in that way, it works very much as a passion story (as its title implies). Stylistically, it's a striking film, showing images that will burn themselves on your memory. It makes heavy use of close-ups, highlighting the subtle facial expressions of the characters, who didn't wear makeup for the film. Many of the camera angles are unlike anything I've yet seen in silent films.<br/><br/>Maria Falconetti gives a mesmerizing performance as Joan. The raw emotion she conveys is remarkable, and it amazes me still how much she was able to say with her eyes. It's a shame that this is the only movie she made that can be easily found today (she made two minor films about a decade earlier.<br/><br/>Another haunting characteristic of the film is the fact that it has no musical accompaniment. This is the way Dreyer wanted it to be seen, and luckily, the version I saw held true to his intentions. The stark silence was unsettling at first, but was soon forgotten, even seeming to heighten the experience.<br/><br/>The film seemed to almost fly by to me, right up to its haunting and powerful final minutes. This film is a true masterpiece. Highly recommended."

I saw this movie back in the summer of 1990 and I hate to sound like one of those people that always say a movie is boring unless there are lots of special effects, or predictable action every ten minutes, or if it was made before 1990.  But I'm not going to say it's boring - it's not -, to me it's something else: It's DEPRESSING!<br/><br/>I remember reading all the positive write ups about this film before I saw it. I must've looked for it for probably 5 years before I finally found it and rented it from an out of state video distributor.  I can't believe someone could make a depressing silent film, but they did! When it was over I couldn't wait to mail it back to the video distributor. I can't imagine any part of a sunny day that I would want to give up to see this movie. Or any part of a rainy day for that matter.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying the people who like this movie are depressed individuals, on the contrary I admire them for taking the initiative to see and appreciate a ""difficult"" film like this.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's a extremely well made film and some of my favorite films can be considered to be ""sad films"", but sad can be surrounded by beauty (Read: ""It's a sad and beautiful world""), but depressing is beyond sad, it's hopelessness, there isn't any beauty around that.<br/><br/>See the odd camera angle as the English soldier reaches back for his weapons to be later used to beat the heck out of the peasants who support Joan. See the English soldiers beat the heck out of the charging peasants. See the birds fly from the trees as Joan is about to burn. Hear the hectic staccato organ music as she burns.<br/><br/>It's also amazing but after seeing this film I have less respect for Joan than before. Is she truly a Saint? I don't know this film doesn't help. And to make matters worse, after I viewed this film I went to bed and had the strangest nightmare I've ever had.<br/><br/>There is one interesting line in the film. As one of the peasants in the film says as they're about to torch Joan: ""If they're not crucifying 'em, they're burning 'em!""<br/><br/>If you want to see something a little more uplifting by Carl Dreyer I recommend you check out ""Ordet"" (1955) instead. It's a much better movie and it's not depressing, just puzzling. I finally saw it about 3 months ago and I didn't have any bad dreams after viewing it!<br/><br/>If you want to see another depressing film like this one then you may want to check out ""The Devils"" (1971).

","Here is a film which is easier to understand if you bring some prior knowledge to the viewing; most obviously, it helps if you know who ""Jeanne d'Arc"" (aka ""Joan of Arc"") was, because the film really only shows the last part of her story. It's like watching a stretched out final act of a movie; probably, the intended audience knew about the events preceding the drama. For film viewers not interested in doing homework, but possessing some familiarity with Christianity, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what is happening. Think of it as a ""second coming"" Jesus Christ story, ""updated"" to a woman in France.<br/><br/>The film picks up with Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) on trial for her crimes. Ms. Falconetti is teased and tortured. She is not able to read, and provides little information to the wicked judges. She says she is nineteen years old, ""Je pense,"" elle dit, but looks older. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer films Falconetti almost entirely in close-up. She widens her eyes, and emotes fiercely. It almost looks like a close-up screen test. Falconetti suffers well, responding to the director's commands. But it's hard to tell what she is emoting about; at times, she could be sitting on her toilet. Since she brushes a fly away from her face once or twice; it is likely true this film was made from originally rejected footage, after the original Dreyer edit was ""accidentally destroyed"".<br/><br/>That this film is a compilation of outtakes explains (in part?) its flaws in style and storytelling. Although no substitute for the supposedly superior original, this ""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is worth a look.

"VertigoOne","4","3","13","22 July 2019"," A Test of Patience
","One could say that this film functions as a sort of 'rite of passage' for art film aficionados. As they say, 'If you can make it through this, you can make it through anything.' However, ""Jeanne d'Arc"" does not function as an overall great film in its own right, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>Honestly speaking, I would have found it nearly impossible to tell whether or not this was a so-called 'great film' had I not seen it on '100-best' movie lists. Certainly, I admire the creative camera angles and other directorial achievements of the film -- in this sense, it is somewhat interesting. However, no one, not even the most pretentious film snob should claim this film is interesting in terms of 'entertainment value.'<br/><br/>Now, don't misunderstand me. Great works of art do not 'have' to be entertaining; but, all great works of art are 'fun' for one reason or another. I will explain.<br/><br/>First of all, this, of course, depends on one's definition of 'fun.' The most basic, fundamental definition of fun -- mindless amusement -- is not that to which I am referring, though some great films do have this sort of appeal. (All works of art should make their audience think). Rather, the kind of fun I'm referring to is best described as a feast for the senses. One reason why I particularly love ""Citizen Kane"" and view it as my ideal 'great film' is because, if one engages every part of their being as they watch the film, the film will open itself up to them. It comes at its audience from many angles: it is an absolutely hilarious film, a dark film, a frighteningly ambiguous film, etc., depending on the perspective of the viewer.<br/><br/>The problem that great films often pose to their audience is that they first REQUIRE that the audience think -- even be willing to suffer -- before they begin to give back in their feasting of the senses. Truly great films give back on one's investment of focus, engagement, and meditation on the film. I just don't believe that ""Jeanne d'Arc"" gives back enough. I can only take so much of Maria Falconetti's exalted expressions before my sense of logic tells me, ""Okay, now! That's enough! I get the idea!"" I feel like nearly half the film is spent staring into her pupils. To some, this might mark greatness; and yes, I admit that it makes the viewer think. But to me, it does not make the film watchable; and ultimately, I do not believe it pays off.<br/><br/>These are my thoughts about the film. Sadly, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was ready for another feast of the senses, to have some fun, like with so many other great films; but sadly, this film could serve only as punishment to a sort of 'frenemie,' someone I am trying to wear out or impress via my film knowledge. This is not my version of a great film and it's one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent in front of a screen. (2/5)"

","The saint Maid of Orléans' legend has been filmed many times, but no version can hold a candle to Dreyer's groundbreaking silent take on the subject matter. What the ingenious Dane himself dubbed ""psychological realism"" and ""realized mysticism"" is a masterfully shot close-up feast generating an overwhelming flood of imagery, a lead that Dreyer called the ""martyr's reincarnation herself"" (the incomparable Renee Falconetti) and powerful re-enactment of original dialog transcribed at the trial in 1431. But it's also a forthright picture sans make-up, sound, not even a backstory is there, but all of it is lacking for a reason. ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is completely focused film-making, minimalism in its purest form, centering entirely on a core theme and thus radically eliminating all other elements that hinder the primary endeavor. Even the sets only seem to exist merely on the fringe of the spiritual drama and tragedy, which unfolds through the eyes of the actors via glimmers, flickers and stares. Confronted with piercing questions again and again circling like vultures above the torn state of mind of the famous maid, Joan's soul is revealed to us. Enlightened or a lunatic is not for the film-maker to decide. However, simplicity elevated to a film-making method makes our own observations a devastating and spellbinding journey at the same time, a journey into another world from where there is no escape. What we witness is indeed timeless mysticism founded in stark realism, and that's why it shakes us to the bone.<br/><br/>Dreyer preferred the picture to be shown in dead silence, which makes ""Joan of Arc"" work as a highly contemplative, almost tangible spiritual experience of the first rank. Nevertheless several composers have tried to provide a score to this masterpiece, giving the scenes a completely new spin - all very diverse attempts, ranging from piano accompaniment to very modern interpretations. The definitive one of these is Richard Einhorn's orchestral choir supported ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack (1995), a masterpiece in itself, but together with Dreyer's intimate rendering of Joan of Arc's devotion to her belief an entirely new sublime work of art emerges. Completely silent or with the Einhorn score: there's no way around Falconetti's soulful portrayal in one of the greatest films of all time."

","Expressive eyes, tense lips, closed mouth, and the stare that just looks ahead and farther away from the desolate mundanity to settle to the glorious chants of heaven, Maria Falconetti easily and without a doubt gives one of the best performances found in the era of silent film. The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the most influential French films of its time, and still continues to inspire today. It focuses on the last days of Joan of Arc's life, and dives right into her trial immediately after being captured and accused of being a heretic.<br/><br/>Being banned in multiple countries as it was controversial during their time, this film is a strong testament on how far human nature can go, how humanity can easily shift towards ""sides"" depending on number. Likewise, this film is a spiritual experience that explores the idea of faith, and how much sacrifice one can put in just trying to protect or restore one's beliefs. It doesn't show Joan of Arc prior to her days at the trial. It doesn't show her victories, her accomplishments, nor her success in leading the English out of France. Instead, it completely strips her to a character undergoing through a strong crisis as she goes through a questioning of fate that ultimately decides life or death.<br/><br/>I have seen the version with music in it (and am currently interested in viewing the completely silent one), and it is truly transcendent. Considering the fact that it was done way back in 1928 impressed me, and the metaphysical journey that this may bring to the viewer—religious or not, may take one to utmost beauty, even up to the brink of tears. Personally, the psychological power of the close-up made me sympathize much more with Joan, and the fact that Falconetti only acted once in her entire life is just stunning. Even without words, Falconetti is still able to display a performance of outright vulnerability while still being confident and at one with God.<br/><br/>As per usual with silent films, I still did have some problems with this, and these are more personal ones that I found affecting my entertainment value of the film. As great as this film was, I found this one to be a difficult watch not just because of it's bleak subject matter, but also because of the way it was shot. I do understand the power of the close-up and I actually praised it a while earlier, but for me, using it for most of the film's shots was a mistake. There were barely any background pans or shots to establish the character's placement, so it's quite difficult to follow the location of each, making it sometimes a burden to watch. The wooden transitions between each scene also made everything jarring and dizzying. It's easy enough to forgive the film as it was almost made a hundred years ago, but I found myself occasionally distracted enough to pause the film, which isn't a good thing.<br/><br/>In all, The Passion of Joan of Arc is easily commendable because of the technological advancement in film it made during that time, but the low rewatchability and abusive use of close-ups make this a difficult recommendation. Maria Falconetti's passionate performance may still make this film worthwhile, and the influence that this had on preceding films stretches out over many generations, but basing this on entertainment value, this film doesn't really hit the mark and, at times, feels outdated."

One has to say the film is very theatrical, but that makes every scene a painting in itself, and the camera angles and the empty scenery is there to emphasize the messages.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie was heavily influenced by the transcript of the actual events, can be seen in small details which today may not be in the knowledge of the public, or at least were not known to me.<br/><br/>From my experience in movie arrangements, not many directors have managed to use the scene as good, better for this can surely be named a number of Russians and Nippons, but not the mainstream Western directors, with the mention of Bergman.<br/><br/>This is a movie to be seen, for the power it transmits the message without words, and might have lost that power if sound was present."

","It is hard to judge the quality of a movie like this.  Any comparison to later films is doomed at the start because the techniques and features are so different.  I did not feel the acting was at all remarkable, but the total composition was quite moving.  I appreciated Dreyer's blend of cynicism, faith, hope, anger, and pity in the performances of the judges. He showed Joan's piety more in their changing reactions to her than in Falconetti's performance.  I could not imagine her leading troops in battle. The trial probably did take a lot of Joan's self-confidence away, but Falconetti's wide-eyed woebegone tentative Joan, doing her duty despite her fear, generated only pity and respect for her courage.  Who would follow a person like that?  Christ after his betrayal kept a commanding presence.  It was almost as if Dreyer looked at all the martyr sculptures, created a consummate victim for his film play, and forgot about the real person who caused the controversy in the first place.  Falconetti's Joan would fit in well with the Children's Crusade, but was no Deborah or Boudicca leading troops, or even the Joan who passed muster with the King's counselors before being sent off to battle.<br/><br/>The ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack and the composition as a whole worked beautifully together on the DVD as a fascinating work of art.  The end result was like a Ken Burns special or a video catalog of images, giving a two-dimensional detailed look at a time and place.  Is it the best Joan ever? Perhaps it is more authentic than some, but it has a clear emotional bias that makes it no different than any other well-made agenda-driven film. I purchased it rather than seeing ""Messenger"" because of the almost universal praise for the older film from critics reviewing Besson's version. I am not sorry that I bought the film but would not recommend it except to those interested in the craft of filmmaking or attuned to medieval music."

","From director Carl Theodor Dreyer (Vampyr, Ordet, Gertrud), this is a Danish silent film I was really looking forward to watching because of all the critical acclaim I knew it had, including of course it's placing in the 100 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. Based on the real authentic records of the historic trial, this film depicts the last few days of Jeanne d'Arc, better known as Joan of Arc (Maria Renée Falconetti), on trial for the crime of heresy, because she believed it was her mission from God to support King Charles VII and fight or lead in the Hundred Years War, the battle between France and England. In court she is questioned by Bishop Pierre Cauchon (Eugène Silvain) and supported by some as a true saint, and she remains dedicated to her beliefs, and in her cell, while judges try to find evidence to convict her, she is interrogated by priests and attempts to convince her to change her views fail. These attempts include a false letter from the king, and she is denied a Mass, Jeanne does become visibly emotional during trial, with those speaking ill of her strong religious beliefs and the antagonism, she also faints at the sight of the torture chamber, but she does not give in to any demands of a change to her statements. However Jeanne is threatened with the penalty of being burned at the stake, and she finally breaks, allowing a priest to have her sign a document of confession, and she is given communion, but then again Jeanne recants and in the end as punishment is publicly executed in the courtyard at Rouen castle, burning at the stake while a crowd protests. Also starring André Berley as Jean d'Estivet, Maurice Schutz as Nicolas Loyseleur, Antonin Artaud as Jean Massieu, Michel Simon as Jean Lemaître, Jean d'Yd as Guillaume Evrard, Louis Ravet as Jean Beaupère and Gilbert Dalleu as Jean Lemaître. Falconetti gives an extraordinary performance as the title character, you can see all the emotions in her face with the many closeups, it is the only role she ever had as well, this film goes to show that not all films need sound or dialogue when you have a magnificent leading performer, and there are some really good camera angles, zooms, tilts and pans that create the intensity, this really is a compelling and must see classic silent drama. Very good!"

","Since it's all been said, I just wanted to check in with my comments on 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"". I saw it recently and I am glad I did so. For all movie lovers, this is a must-see. I will try hard to avoid clichés and corn, as many reviewers have already used the thoughts I wanted to put down - and I am a movie-lover not a movie critic.<br/><br/>It is difficult to remain detached from Joan as portrayed by Ms. Falconetti. She gives an extremely sympathetic and powerful performance and draws you to her. You cannot watch her face without feeling as she does and this, combined with Carl Dreyer's direction creates the illusion of reality and the 'suspension of disbelief' is complete.<br/><br/>I thought the use of close-ups was very effective, as much of the film is comprised of them, particularly the harshness of the faces of her tormentors contrasted with the softness of Joan's. I have seen one other of Dreyer's films, ""Days of Wrath"", and felt the same stark realism and authenticity as depicted here. His films are more than character studies, they are in a sense soul studies. ""The Passion Of Joan Of Arc"" is the depiction of a true-life tragedy brought back to cinematic life by superb filmmaking."
