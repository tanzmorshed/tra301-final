"MR_Heraclius","9","38","41","21 February 2020"," great movie for the whole family to enjoy
","Much funnier than the first one, Despicable Me 2 actually has me liking the second installation in a series much better than the original. A lot of sequels add in new characters. Some serve a purpose. Others not so much. This movie adds in new characters that are important. With funnier lines, funnier actions, and tons of minion madness, the movie has us focusing less on Gru's villainy, and more on the love life he never had."
"claudio_carvalho","7","22","26","1 February 2014"," Delightful Family Entertaining
","The ex-villain Gru is raising his daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes and researching a legitimate jelly and jam business with Dr. Nefarion and the minions. Meanwhile, a laboratory in Arctic is stolen by a powerful aircraft using magnetism. The Anti-Villain league (AVL) agent Lucy Wilde recruits Gru to help her agency to discover who has stolen the laboratory and its research. They know that the thief has a store in a mall, and Gru suspects that the owner of the Mexican restaurant Salsa & Salsa, Eduardo Perez, may be the villain El Macho that is presumed dead in an accident. <br/><br/>""Despicable Me 2"" is a delightful family entertaining. Who can resist to Gru, Agnes and the minions? And now, with Margo growing up and interested in boys and the clumsy but heartwarming Lucy Wilde, it is a great fun for the whole family. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Meu Malvado Favorito 2"" (""My Favorite Wicked 2"")"

","I went to see this film this morning and found it very enjoyable. I can't really remember the 1st so I can't really compare. <br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, funny, feel good film that keeps you entertained from the 1st minute to the last. The pace of the film moves along nicely and keeps the audience attention very well. It has many laugh out loud moments, a decent mix of children humour and adult humour. <br/><br/>The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell)is likable and funny. The minions however are the main stars, they had me laughing on multiple occasions during the film. The language created for the minions is very well done as they speak in a fictional language but you can always gather what they are saying.<br/><br/>I found the visuals very impressive, it was very colourful and very imaginative. The action scenes we also very well done.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend seeing this, no matter what your age. I am 22 and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not just for kids!"

","In all honesty I can't remember the first film that well, so I found it hard to compare to the sequel. On the other hand this film is completely memorable and so enjoyable.<br/><br/>I saw the preview and I absolutely loved it. I was worried that all the good bits were in the adverts but the film was full of exciting and hilarious parts that aren't in the advert. <br/><br/>The minions are so funny, I was actually crying with laughter at some parts. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I am taking my little brother to see it again (mainly so I can see it again! Hehe) <br/><br/>The characters are lovable, hate able, and hilarious, the film has evolved from the first one (from what I can remember) and its such a heart warming family film.<br/><br/>I COMPLETELY Recommend THIS FILM :)"
"Scottfarmer778","9","11","13","28 July 2013"," Great Fun!
","So Despicable Me 2 is a very family funny/friendly animated comedy which at points really does make you laugh! If you are reading this now and haven't yet seen the trailer, I would recommend you don't watch the trailer and just go straight to the film, Some of the best parts are shown in the trailer. To watch this film you don't really need to have seen the first however I would recommend you do as at points the film refers to Despicable Me (1).<br/><br/>I'm going to keep this review short and simply say, I gave this film a 9* rating as I found it strongly entertaining, not as funny as I thought but still a great film! The story line was also very easy to follow and keeps you engaged throughout.<br/><br/>Would recommend this film to anyone! I would say most people will enjoy this film, find it entertaining and recommend it to there friends! <br/><br/>This film is perfect for any family to view!"
"almanjit25","10","24","33","12 July 2013"," Riotously hilarious, sugary sweet, absolutely adorable and most of all marvelously miniontastic!
","I saw Despicable Me 2 in the cinema and when i left i did not like it all that much. If i do not take to a film on the first watch then i am unlikely to change my opinion on subsequent views. This film is one of the rare exceptions. I have many 'perhaps' reasons of not liking it the first time from spoilers to mood changes. Well that in neither here nor there. I decided to see it just to pass time after a strenuous day at college followed by work. And i was blown away. Then i saw it again yesterday and it was even better. <br/><br/>It has its goal set out from the very start. It is family entertainment in and out. And great family entertainment. <br/><br/>It is contemporary ingenuity coupled with zany cartoony fantasy to produce a feature that is so much fun and so exciting. It is the first animated feature in a long time to move away from serious or emotion filled animation and instead aim for the imaginative wild completely unrealistic feel and fun of the cartoons of yore. That is a great thing as it feels like something new and in this case new is awesome. I adore emotion filled animation but sometimes you just need to smile and laugh and laugh some more with crazy comedic toon antics and this film provides that. The animation is so colorful and delightful, so pleasing to the eye in its adorableness. <br/><br/>Whoever imagined the minions needs to be awarded a medal. They are the most adorable, most cute, most sweet, most pure laugh and smile inducing creations to grace animation in a long time. They made me laugh out wildly and smile all through the film until my cheeks were hurting and i felt like bursting with pure happiness. They are just fun and amazing. Oh and they sing too, hilariously.<br/><br/>The films posters said as their tagline ""The Spy who Lover Her'. An obvious reference to the James Bond flick, The Spy Who Loved Me. So obviously espionage and spy craziness is thrown in for a satisfying story. A story that in fact feels like an updated cartoon version of an exaggerated James Bond film of the the 70's and 80's. <br/><br/>Gru really is an amazing father and his relationship with the girls is something very precious. I like how family dynamic is explored in this film. Rarely do we have films of adopted children coming into a new family dynamic. The last time i saw that type of dynamic was in Tarzan in 1999 before seeing it once more in the prequel to this film. The girls are just great in this film. Agnes who is just so adorable wishes for a mother and Gru sees that and he can see it is saddening her. Gru is also lonely and goes out into the dating world resulting in hilarious consequences and sweet surprises.<br/><br/>Agent Lucy Wilde, nice pun since she is a huge dose of wild fun, is just a great character addition that adds to the looniness and excitement of it all. She is so weird in the best way possible, quirky, funny and absolutely amazing. She is a remarkable character. And her vivid personality just adds to the sweetness and captivating charm of this film. Thus she provides the perfect romantic lead for Gru.<br/><br/>Pharell Williams needs applause for the music. The songs are just so upbeat and fun and in the distinct style of Mr Williams. They are just so warm and the animated sequences accompanying them are just marvelous, fun and dream like. Adding to the smiles galore of the film. <br/><br/>It is a film for the family and the hilarious humor is divided into slapstick hilarity that adults too will thoroughly love, some jokes that will go over kids heads and some really sensational references mostly aimed at adults such as The Spy Who Loved Me and many more including other James Bond references and references to Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, The Incredibles, Get Smart as well as The Matrix and Superman among others.<br/><br/>I feel this film will become what the film Up is to me. A film so sweet, so heartwarming and imaginative and so smile inducing that it will just keep getting more amazing with further views as the years go by and become an absolute all time favorite. <br/><br/>I like that they mix humor with sweet awkward and adorable romance. Then they stir in the Minion Factor of pure awesomeness. Toss in great gags and action packed and imaginative excitement. Sprinkle some sweetness and finally folding in a dollop of fun. A very fun movie for everyone."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","50","75","9 July 2013"," Fantastic family fun, on par with the original
","The first Despicable Me was a wonderful film, so while there is the worry of whether a sequel would work you can't help wanting to see it anyway. Despicable Me 2 was just as good as the first one, maybe not as fresh in terms of plot but what worked so well in the first works equally well here. The animation, also having the advantage of staying true to the style and look that the first had, is bursting with vibrancy and colour without looking too over-saturated as well as having a lot of detail to it. The retro-futuristic designs and gadgets are inventive and very striking to look at, while the music has rousing energy and is also memorable. Despicable Me 2 in the writing and gags is peppered with humour, and this is of the laugh-out-loud hilarious kind, though because there's a lot and that you may be laughing so hard you may be at a risk of missing something. To counter-balance the hilarity, the film also incorporates a message, it is a heartfelt one and doesn't feel cloying and out-of-place. For what the story may lack slightly in freshness in correlation with the first, it more than makes up for it in wit, heart, excitement and how briskly it moves without feeling rushed. Having more of the minions- one of the best assets of the first film- was a masterstroke also, and their subplot also gave the story an increasing sense of jeopardy and threat(though theirs is a little more interesting than that of world domination). Gru is a lovable character, whether a villain like in the first or not, and adds a lot of charisma and energy to the film. The top-notch vocal talents of Steve Carrell, Steve Coogan, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt and even Russell Brand are a further advantage. All in all, like the first Despicable Me this sequel is fantastic family fun and equal to it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","I went to the cinema preview with my friend for this movie, and its even better than the first film! I only saw the first film recently, and I really liked it. I wasn't sure I wanted to go and see the film at first, but my mate wanted me to go and see the preview yesterday with him, and reluctantly, I said yes. Usually, the second films aren't better than the first, but boy was I wrong! I was laughing through out the whole film, and so was everyone in the audience, it was full to! Steve Carrell's character, Gru, was hilarious. I think everyone could agree though, the minions were the best characters in the film. My friend told me the directors made up a little language and did the voices, and I was very impressed, for you could hear a hint of English in every word they said. <br/><br/>So, if you have seen the first film and liked it, don't hesitate to go and see it when it officially come out on the 28th June. And if you haven't seen the first film, why not?"
"VisionofHope","8","100","167","21 June 2013"," Better than the original!
","It's not often that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film. Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases. From the moment it appears on the screen to the end of the film, Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, fun film that never ceases to be entertaining.<br/><br/>This film has you laughing quite often, contains humour that both kids and adults can appreciate, and had at least one moment that was worthy of clapping out loud to.<br/><br/>The character development is to be praised, as is the warmth and soul that Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud put into this film.<br/><br/>This film leaves you feeling joyful and satisfied and happy for the characters and the new direction their lives are taking.<br/><br/>This film is not to be missed and I can't recommend it enough."
"nazanya","10","12","16","3 July 2013"," A must see.
","This movie will honestly have you crying of laughter. It's as if this franchise will only continue to be better and better! With lots of lovely little twists and silly little gags Despicable me 2 will warm your heart and leave you smiling like silly! Definitely something to watch if you're upset, definitely will cheer you up.<br/><br/>The movie has you smiling straight from the start with the cuteness and the willingness emitted from Gru when it comes to the kids. <br/><br/>Despicable me 2 was absolutely worth the wait. With lots of highs and lows Gru has managed to prove to the audience that we should be able to put our faith in him, much like our common superhero movie Gru is put in difficult situations we question how he will get out of, but of course, he does.<br/><br/>This is not just for children either, people ages 30 could easily be caught smiling at this heart-warming movie."
"princedelapau","6","19","28","6 August 2013"," A certain degree of disappointment
","I totally fell in love with Despicable Me. It's probably going to be on my list of Ten Best Films, so naturally I awaited with eagerness the premiere of Despicable Me 2. I watched all the trailers, teasers and Mini Movies with Minions - loved them all. Then I watched the film in full 3D.<br/><br/>Oh dear...<br/><br/>I always thought that there might be a problem with transforming Gru from a villain into a good guy, and I was right. Half of the humour in the original film was based on the fact that Gru is not a nice person.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he has now been sanitized, virtually recreated as a good suburban father, albeit with some extremely strange habits.<br/><br/>Two of the best protagonists from the original film were ignored: Vector, last seen on the Moon with a polythene helmet on his head, and Dr. Nefario, who vanished for 95% of Despicable Me 2. Even Gru's mother, who had some wonderful cameo appearances in the original, was visible only once.<br/><br/>So, continuity from Film 1 to Film 2 - virtually none.<br/><br/>One of the great charms of the original film were the incredible inventions: the Farter Blaster thing, the Anti-gravity Serum, the boogie robots... This time there was nothing to take their place.<br/><br/>With Vector and Pointy-haired Man from the Bank of Evil Gru had worthy opponents, but the villain of this film was an absolute non-entity - I can't even recall his name without looking it up. All of the tension and interplay between the characters in the first film were missing in this one.<br/><br/>Another of the highlights of the first film was the music. Unfortunately, the soundtrack this time was completely forgettable, with the exception of a reprise of one of the songs from the original - Pretty Girls, I think it was called. Something like that... I was a bit busy yawning to note exactly which of the good songs it was. I just made a mental note and then went back to being slightly bored again.<br/><br/>Yes, I enjoyed it, for a given value of ""enjoy"". Who could help but enjoy watching those darling little minions? But I left the cinema feeling cheated: Despicable Me deserved a better sequel, better music, a better story line and far better characterisation.<br/><br/>I'm wavering between 5/10 and 6/10, but I'll plump for 6/10 because I actually liked the 3D effects. Without them I'd probably plump for 5/10"
"goofyball","6","33","53","5 July 2013"," it's OK... funny but a bit boring
","i wanted to love it... i really did... i love the first one... told many about it... clearly lots of people saw it after it's theatrical run and are excited for part 2... but i saw it last night and it is a little dull... story is weak... predictable...<br/><br/>spoilers the main plot is that gru has to find a villain so gru's a good guy now... that's about it... not a bad idea but most of the movie is him stuck in a mall looking for this villain who is one of the shop owners... just not that interesting... and obvious and it just doesn't feel like a lot is at stake.<br/><br/>he points to the actual bad guy immediately... we all know this is the dude but the movie keeps going... the bad guy is kind of boring and not much is done... he's pretty generic... the villain (beyond gru) in the first one was so much better.<br/><br/>the oldest daughters thing for boys is cute... kristen wiig's character is fun and while their romance is obvious it's still OK the minions save the day... i mean the film.<br/><br/>not a bad sequel at all... still funny... carell and wiig are great... movie's just a little dull"
"almighty_kyra","6","45","78","16 July 2013"," It was okay, I guess
","I was really looking forward to this film, but to be honest, it wasn't all that amusing. It made me smile a couple of times, but no real chuckles. The story was a little messy. Gru wasn't as convincing. Neither were his interactions with some of the new characters. Pure good doesn't suit him very well. The minions weren't as funny - in fact, they were a little annoying - and the villain's master plan was rubbish. <br/><br/>The graphics were okay, but visibly low budget (compared to Pixar's Brave, for instance). It was as disappointing as one must expect from a sequel.<br/><br/>If you don't have anything better to do and just want to be mildly entertained for 98 minutes, go for it. Otherwise, just re-watch the original Despicable Me, it was a lot better."
"sydjenks","5","48","87","12 July 2013"," Average
","I don't understand how this is 7.8. I am a fair reviewer and this is at most a 6 by IMDb standards.<br/><br/>It is well rendered, and there are some innovative parts, the characters which were excellently formed in the first one have now no consistency, the subplots clumsily come together, and no matter how many reviewers say this has adult and child appeal, it really is aimed at very young children.<br/><br/>if I was to compare it in standard, you are looking at a Ice Age/Madagascar standard instead of the Kung Fu Panda/Toy Story 3 level.<br/><br/>Worth a watch but 7.8 sounds a bit fishy to me"

","CAREFUL! I went to the cinema yesterday to watch this movie because I liked the first part and because I trusted in the good rating here on IMDb which was a mistake. Maybe you like Despicable Me 2, but if you are looking for a movie like Despiceable Me 1, I want you to know that THIS MOVIE IS NOT COMPARABLE TO ITS PREDECESSOR. I liked the predecessors extraordinary and impressible sense of humor - which has become damn silly in part 2. I also liked the story and its message in part 1 - which has become ordinary and cheesy in part 2. Sad that they did not put half the effort and love into this movie compared to Despicable Me 1."
"ShelbyTMItchell","10","8","11","20 July 2013"," Cute and Adorable Second Film!
","Really a cute film as it is once again the Minions stealing the movie. As it puts in a sense more of a focus on Gru as a father and the Minions become part of a sinister plot.<br/><br/>Now with raising three daughters of Agnes, Edith, and Margo at youngest Agnes birthday. And trying to go straight. But when a comedic but determined secret agent named Lucy tries to recruit Gru into the Anti-Villains League. He refuses saying he is raising his kids and trying to be selling jelly and jams, although he is failing at it miserably.<br/><br/>But she gives him her card nonetheless. But also after his assistant and friend, Dr. Nefario leaves to find work after missing being a villain, Gru reconsiders and he and Lucy are undercover.<br/><br/>While his three girls try to find him a date. Which he does not want but soon has feelings for Lucy but tries not too good to hide them. Same with Lucy. As both think that a Mexican restaurant owner named Eduardo is behind mutating chemicals. Along with getting his minions kidnapped due to Eduardo wanting them to help in his scheme.<br/><br/>To be honest I kind of liked the second film better than the first film. As it shows a little more character development in the three girls plus Gru and his love life. Plus the Minions being part of the plot.<br/><br/>Cute and adorable second film!"
"jcl541","4","30","53","29 July 2013"," A disappointment
","Sigh!<br/><br/>I don't get to watch too many movies, and even fewer on the big screen. So after watching Despicable Me (the original) numerous times at home - and loving it to death, this movie was a big disappointment for me and my daughters at the movie theater. It's been hard for me to put a finger on exactly what was missing, but I think it is mostly the lack of clever, witty dialog that filled the first movie. There are many fun moments in this movie, but they are predominantly sight-gags and one-liners. And sadly, the space between those moments was just not too intriguing. FYI, my girls (10 and 7) were also underwhelmed - though my younger one asked to get it on DVD or iPad, so she could replay the few parts she really liked.<br/><br/>I thought this sequel had a lot of potential - especially in the Lucy character, but most of that potential was just squandered. The villain is portrayed with a very stereotyped and non-PC caricature, and unlike Vector (the villain from the first movie), didn't seem to have any motive. The evil plot was actually kind of scary instead of being funny, and the characters seem to spend a lot of time doing things that were just not that interesting and saying things that were just not that funny.<br/><br/>All in all, a real let-down for our once-in-a-blue-moon trip to the movie theater."
"Vincent_B","4","16","26","6 July 2013"," Fell Short of the Goal
","This movie might be worth the rental and then it is just something to toss at your kids about 6 to 8 years old. The first movie was hit with both young and old but this movie is just clichÃ© filled with tropes and idioms. Unlike the first story this one lacks humor.<br/><br/>The writers completely lose sight of the good characters from the first movie such as; Vector, Dr. Nefario, and even Gru's Mom. They bring in a new villain who leaves a dry taste in your mouth. The only thing original and funny about him was his premature demise. Instead the comedy falls on the shoulders of his minions. The plot is far too predictable for any adult. <br/><br/>The moral of the tale? Apparently single parents are just no good at raising children."

"emmathomde32","3","18","31","28 July 2013"," Mediocre in every sense
","There is nothing much to say except that this movie which is now the 2nd biggest blockbuster of the year is plain. I guess we are in the Twilight age when mindless, depth lacking films are blockbusters and beloved by the drone masses while great films are never given their just dues and forgotten. As the Twilight saga proved, intelligence and substance is dead.<br/><br/>Now for this movie. Animation sucks, poorly done CG and very off looking. It is so obviously poor quality but since that is what the public is used to, of course it is beloved.<br/><br/>Story is childish. This film is JUST for kids and a few really really kiddish adults. Heck i watch loads of animated films and consider myself a kid at heart but then again the animations i like actually have depth and emotion and story and most of all SUBSTANCE! This film lacks it all. No story (fit for small kids), no substance which actually was there in the first one, no emotions and no depth. In fact it is so bland, i am in shock at how far public tastes have fallen to make this a hit. Some dumb-ass i saw wrote how very Pixar and adult this film is. Intelligence and substance is falling way too quickly in our society as proved by this person. Apparently substance-less, beyond childish drivel with a few minor references to movies is considered a coup in film making. Wit, intelligence, emotionally driven stories that actually have a message and soul are a taboo in society these days. <br/><br/>Character development is near 0. And the minions silliness drives this film. Perfect for people who hate thinking or who are shallow and these people number in the millions as the twilight saga has just proved."
"Metromom","3","27","50","10 July 2013"," Really Bad.....(which made us sad)
","Okay, I have children so we ran out anxiously to see Gru and co.,after watching previews for a year. I have to say that we are huge fans of the first movie so it pains me to give the following review.The movie was a bore. Sadly, the previews that we watched for a long time that made us want to see the movie ironically turned out to be the movie! There was such a lack of story that it amazed even my children. Gru was not a kindhearted villain anymore and his character lacked any depth. Even the villain was not characterized well. The first half- hour(at least) was exactly the previews(in order). The rest of the movie failed to develop and left us wishing that we had saved money and saw this sequel on DVD. Very disappointing! Save your money and wait for this one to come out on DVD!"
"DJKwa","8","27","51","25 June 2013"," If you liked the first, you'll like this one!
","Even more Despicable! Actually this is a sweet turn for the lovable anti-villain villain, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who is comfortably back as a bona fide family man, to the three adorable orphans who melted audiences hearts alike in the first film. Gru would seem like a fun father, but he takes his responsibilities overbearingly over the girls as he has trouble accepting them growing up. Not only that, but he struggles to find contentment with no longer being a villain, with his laboratory now transformed into a jam-making factory. Through expected plot development, advocated from a sequel, it is not until a love interest comes along, Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig), that Gru loosen his shell and the plot moves into action. She takes him to the aptly titled 'anti-villain league' who recruit Gru, with Lucy as his partner in anti-crime, to take down a new villain who has taken disguise at a local shopping mall. What better way to take down a villain than with a post-villain. However Gru is not as proficient as he used to be, he is divided and distracted between his responsibilities to his girls, his love for villainous antics and his mixed emotions to his new partner.<br/><br/>The plot moves efficiently and effectively, moving briskly but taking special care with the characters whom audience enjoyed the first time around, while injecting a few new ones. Of course this means the minions are back, if ads didn't make it obvious. The uniformly dressed but motley shaped crew seem to have grown exponentially in number, as they are ever present in the film. Even their antics in the background over petty things, prove hilarious, but the pint size helpers also take a pivotal role in the plot. This strikes an interesting point in the films advertising. Hardly any plot was divulged, beyond set-up, meaning that there are plenty of surprises to be had in the film. In fact the minions took the foreground of marketing, being funny without substantiating into crass or being overtly annoying. Not only are they ingenious supporting characters but also act as an ingenious means of marketing the film, without spoiling much of the fun of the film, similarly like Scrat in the Ice Age films. If you only liked them in the first film, you'll love them now. <br/><br/>The bottom line (hahaha 'bottom'- you read it in a minion voice didn't you :) is that this is a very comfortable flick. It lives up to the adage, if you liked the first you'll like this one. Colorful and cheerful animation, that is quite impressive, with more minion madness, as expected, punctuated by heart warming sentiment, in good measure."

From the word go, you start laughing and till the movie ends (and it gets only better during credits). There is no special intro to Gru this time but his 'Angel' costume really sets the tone. Agnes is cuter than ever and watching her run like the unicorn makes you smile (atmosphere gets better if you have kids in your theater, I had quite a few and makes you laugh when they imitate Agnes!). Margo is growing up and Edith is just the same. Gru is also looking out for a date all through the film, not knowing he has one right next to him, Lucy. She is the Agent from AVL (Anti Villain League) and her first job is the way she brings in Gru. (Lipstick taaaser!!!). And then there are the Minions. They actually are the focus of this film. You get a load of them throughout the film but you never notice. Every single one of their scenes make you laugh so hard that at one point I couldn't stop!!!(Minion Fire Brigade!!) And then there is El Macho and his son(and his chicken!) who give the twists in the end. You wont miss out Dr.Nefario who seems to leave Gru and plot the crime but helps save the world in the end. So the final verdict: if you want to have 90 mins of real hard laughter, you can close your eyes and go for it!"

","This was better than the 1st film which I saw and enjoyed. This is fast paced and funny because I laughed throughout. There are loads of potentially funny situations and they exploited them all instead of the disappointment of not taking things that little bit further. I'll be seeing it again and again as there is so much to catch the 2nd and 3rd time around too. The new characters, bad guy and gal spy, the spicy Latin flavor all enhance the storyline and enjoyment of the film. Minions are all throughout the film so if you wanted more you got more. I saw the 2D version which was brilliant. 3D would be quite a ride with all the action scenes. Check it out !!!"

","""Despicable Me 2"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the lovable ""Despicable Me"". It was fairly unique as instead of the typical good guy as the main character, they put up a villain as the protagonist (although he ended up good) which made it more refreshing and more fun to watch. Aside from his pointy nose and hilarious accent, we were also invited to spend some time with the extremely adorable and mischievous yellow Minions, who speak almost entirely incomprehensibly in their own unique language. There were also the three little girls that have the movie heart (Margo, Edith, and Agnes). <br/><br/>This time around, Gru's no longer a villain. He's devoting his life to being a father and raising his three adorable little kids. (He dressed up as a fairy for Agnes's 6th birthday.) He's also managing his business of manufacturing jellies. But when there's a villain who just stole a secret formula (named PX-41) that could threaten the entire civilization, Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League, headed by Silas Ramsbottom (""bottom"" read in a Minion's voice), to stop this new villain. His partner is an orange-haired funny woman named Lucy Wilde. <br/><br/>Gru is facing with different kinds of experiences now. He's raising his three girls and has become a father. He's managing his jelly business. But he's also for the first time in love, which is haunting him due to a past experience back in his days at school. Love is a central theme to the story this time around. Gru is in love and a fun love storyline comes in full effect. Not only is Gru in love, but Gru's oldest daughter Margo also experiences the rush of falling in love. Even Dave, one of Gru's many Minions, falls in love. This love theme is what sets this sequel apart from the original. <br/><br/>We have an array of new characters now. The first one is Lucy Wilde, the orange-haired woman who works for the AVL and eventually becomes Gru's love interest. Her funny actions and hyperactive behavior makes her a fantastic addition to the wide range of vibrant characters here. There's also Silas Ramsbottom (emphasis on ""bottom""), the leader of the AVL. His elegant personality and unique appearance makes him a lovable addition to the diverse cast. The final main addition to the character list is Eduardo Perez, the owner of a Mexican restaurant whose real identity provokes the saying: ""there's more than meets the eye"". <br/><br/>While these new colorful characters add a delight to the screen, none of them compare to the lovable army of yellow Minions. Hands down, they stole the whole film. They have fantastic chemistry with just about anybody and they're funny as hell. Every sound that comes out of their is just damn hilarious. I have no doubt that children will enjoy the Minions' mischiefs. This time, the Minions have more scenes dedicated to them too, compared to their appearance in the first film. Oh, and don't forget Dr. Nefario too, who sadly has his appearance minimized. But every time he appears on screen, he's a delight. <br/><br/>The comedy here works too. The jokes are humorous and most of them work for all ages. Some of them may not be original or repetitive, but they're still able to give you a laugh. And it doesn't hurt that an incredible cast was behind the delivery of the jokes here. Steve Carell was charming as usual and he never fails to impress with his excellent voice portrayal of Gru. Kristen Wiig was energetic as the energizing Lucy Wilde. Benjamin Bratt also gave a satisfying performance as Eduardo Perez. The rest of the cast was superb too. <br/><br/>The visual effects were incredible. The sets were also very vibrant and colorful. They're so wonderful that they make the film come to life. Everything is splendid about the setting. They're also very detailed and it's just a treat for the eyes. The animation too is just eye- popping. All the characters' movements are extremely detailed and very smooth. The 3D is more of an optional choice though, but some scenes are especially tailored for 3D as they literally pop out of the screen, especially the end credits. Don't miss that one. <br/><br/>Despite the beautiful visuals, the film only explores several locations which is kind of upsetting. A big chunk of the film is set in Paradise Mall, a colorful mall. Some scenes take us to other places but I feel that it's kind of limited. I feel that it's kind of a missed opportunity because the animation here is just irresistible and they could've given us more sets to feast our eyes on. <br/><br/>But despite some setbacks, ""Despicable Me 2"" is a satisfying sequel to the excellent original. I won't say that it's better than the original because it lacks the freshness the first film possessed. But this sequel comes really close and this should be an entertaining 98- minute adventure. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It's not as fresh as the original but ""Despicable Me 2"" nearly matches the first one and is highly entertaining for all audiences, with plenty of laughs and a superb cast."

","The first film was genius. Everyone loves the bad guys, & there were plenty of them in the first film. Squid gun.. Oh Yeah! But this film not only had no purpose, but it destroyed the personality of ALL the characters. <br/><br/>It starts off rather promising, with the mystery crime taking place. A giant magnet? Genius idea! They could have gone somewhere with the technology of that concept. Stealing the Eiffel Tower, ships at see, Rockets & weapons. But we never see or hear of it again. We don't even know who the villain is until the film is almost over. The first film was bold, edgy, had great ideas about the style of being bad. And Gru was a mad genius who was different, self aware, & refused to conform. He took advantage of how dumb other humans were, & he had a deep passion for his concepts. ALL that is gone in this film, & he is reduced to a bumbling idiot, desperate to get hitched. He is made to look a fool by an annoying woman from the start, & everyone just makes fun of him for the rest of the film. The eldest girl was smart, mature, responsible & lovable in the first film. In this film, she leaves her two youngest sisters on their own in a mall to go & have it off with a young boy who was taken straight out of the book of clichés. That's what this film is.. one long list of endless clichés. It's an insult to all who made the first film so intelligent & unique. It was a clever spy mad professor movie. I hate how it has been reduced to a soap opera chick flick. <br/><br/>It puzzles me how this film has such a high rating. I suspect that IMDb is now fixing ratings for promotion techniques. And can no longer be trusted. Either that, or people have lost their standards today. After all, the films being made today are the worst kind of disposable trash imaginable. This one is no exception. AVOID."
"estreet-eva","5","11","18","2 August 2013"," Meh, about what you get with sequel
","Much like Cars 2, Despicable Me 2 relies too heavily on secondary characters meant to be the comedic leavening to the main protagonists the first time out. Much like Mater gets nauseating in large doses, the minions (or allergy pills with eyes) get to be more annoying than cute when brought to the fore. This main issue rises from generally flat writing that attempts to stick too closely to tropes presented in the first installment rather than trying to break new ground. In fact, the only real laugh comes from Agnes asking Gru dressed as a fairy princess why a fairy princess would be fat and he responds: ""because I live in a house made of candy and I eat instead of facing my problems."" Beyond that most of the humor comes from minions doing slapstick which just isn't that funny unless you are six years old. The voice talent does an admirable job lead by Steve Carrell doing his non-specific Eastern European accent. Unfortunately, we never hear from Gru's mother whose complicated relationship with her son drove a lot of the interest for adults in the first one. In short, watch the first one again instead."

I fell in love with Despicable Me and was a bit worried when I heard they were releasing a second one as sometimes they ruin the film as the first one is so good but I can now say it definitely didn't ruin it. It was amazing and just as good as the first. Still loads of laughs and the cute little minions get even better. The love between Gru and the girls gets even stronger which just improves the film even more and the story line is fantastic. Great credit to the writes who have managed to pull off yet another good film. It is a definite must see for everyone, not just children but adults too.

","I was so excited about this movie cause i loved first one. The story was very complex and funny, it didn't need childish Tom and Jerry jokes with minions to be funny. This movie is complete opposite of first part. Story is no better than mediocre action movie with absolutely no dynamic. Since beginning i knew whats going to happen. Also, violet zombie minions? That was the worst decision in all animated movies i have ever watched. Boy charming girl and then breaking her heart, two partners getting in love. I don't even know who approved this story. I think that 12 year old child who watched few mediocre movies could write it same. Lame movie."
"frogusmaximus","1","17","32","12 July 2013"," How to Ruin a Great Idea
","A dull tedious love story featuring Gru, now a retired villain and single dad with three kids, rather than a clever evil genius. They created one of the best animated characters for a good while then wasted him on this woeful script. Avoid at all costs unless you've got your kids with you.<br/><br/>The theme is quite childish really and they have lost all appeal to an adult. Gru is often embarrassed around his new lady friend, the kids are sickeningly sweet and the minions make more silly noises and dress in ridiculous costumes, aiming for cheap laughs. Great for kids who laugh loud and long but it's a poor ending for poor old Gru. A kidnapping of the kids would have been a better option, forcing Gru to go back to his evil ways, the strengths of his character, but they chose a weak option."
"ratemymovietoday","3","5","7","1 January 2014"," Just one word ...Boring
","Why did they do it? Seriously man, the first movie which came out in 2010 was pretty good with a charm of its own and this time they have killed (almost) all the joy and the fun.<br/><br/>The love story in the film felt so forced, the dialogs were clichéd and scenes were so predictable. I watched it on my PC and have to literally fast forward some of the scenes. The plot was so lame that even a 3rd grade kid can figure out what's going to happen. No to mention that they pretty much blew the suspense within the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Though i have to admit that animation was top notch but then, which movie doesn't have that nowadays? .The fundamental problem with this sequel lies in the script which can't hold on its own even on the solid foundation of its predecessor.<br/><br/>This time Gru reluctantly agrees to help Anti-Villain League in finding out a criminal mastermind who is stealing research stations from Antarctica and doing other shitty stuff. Well thats pretty much of the story!, and I don't even want to talk about the love angle. But, one thing which IMHO the director has done right is to give more focus to minions this time. At first it looked unnecessary but in the end I realized that whatever funny moments this flick had were those with minions in it.<br/><br/>Anyways, I can only say that much about this movie. My genuine advice to you guys would be to wait for it to come on TV, don't waste your hard earned money to watch it on Netflix."

"avsroxbronxfan","9","6","9","24 July 2013"," One of the funniest movies I've ever seen
","***NOTE*** I only check-marked this because I say one joke from the movie. Other than that, this review is spoiler-free.<br/><br/>When I saw the first Despicable Me movie, I liked it a lot, but I was expecting a really funny movie with serious moments in there. I personally believe the first one is a film that has a first priority to make you care rather than just go for laughs the whole time. It does that, and has a few funny moments. I felt that the sequel would be similar in that aspect, but I was wrong about that. This film is loaded with funny moments. You saw some of it in the trailer, but I still expected the movie to be like the first. I'm glad I was wrong though, because the more funny moments in this film really gives us something new and unique about it. This was the big comedy I was expecting with the first film. There are so many humorous moments in this, you'd lose track easily. I think the joke that made me laugh the most was at the beginning of the film when Agnes is having a medieval-themed birthday party. The minions are playing along and one of them keeps hitting the wrong thing, and all the other minions just attack him. That was just awesome. Speaking of them, I love how creative they've become. There's so many great jokes with them, it's hard not to enjoy them.<br/><br/>As for the characters, all your favorites from the first are back, plus they introduce a few new ones, like Lucy, and the villain. I'm not going to say who the villain is, or what he does, but I will say that his build-up in the movie is really clever. He kidnaps most of the minions, but you don't see his face, or even any of his body. It's not revealed who the villain is until around the end of the movie. I think that's really clever, but I don't think the villain is very threatening, or even funny.<br/><br/>I'm also not a fan of Lucy. She always seems to be in a laid-back mood. There's one scene where she's strapped to a rocket, and she's not even acting like she's freaking out. Why is she happy about everything? I can understand that they're trying to make her a fun character, but I think she was overdone.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about this movie, however, is that when I was watching the trailers for it, I felt this may just be Gru trying to stop a bad guy. For the most part, it is, but there's another story going on (I know I check-marked spoilers, but I'm not saying it) that is balanced very well into this movie. It's more than just Gru trying to save the world.<br/><br/>I personally liked this movie better than the first one, although that one was good too. I may even put this as one of my favorite comedies. Go see it when you have the chance."
"Wirxaw","2","7","12","18 October 2013"," One of the worst sequels of all time.
","WARNING: A lot of spoilers, basically a step-by-step story dissection.<br/><br/>Where to start... perhaps with reassuring that I am a fan of the original, and I was excited when this sequel finally came out. The premise, the soundtrack, voice acting plot... of the original - was really good. Worth getting about 8\10 and an animation classic call. So let's put it as a starting position for the sequel - 8 stars. First thing in the movie that revolted me - is the image of Lucy. Nya- ish, perhaps. But a red-haired Barbie-Xena, specifically surnamed Wilde... is like a pile of excrement that you licked just to make sure it's... well, excrement. Perhaps having a Nikita-styled agent in a children cartoon is too much, but this eye-candy is something even My Little Pony haven't done. But, well, tastes vary. Second was absolute cliché of ""falling in love"" with a black-haired slender guy, specifically in leather. What kind of target demographic was this aimed at, exactly? Then again, not the first, nor the last ""miracle"" of modern romance. When I almost decided to delete the subject and spare myself - was Antonio's line: ""My dream is to play video games for living"". Being a rock-star, singer, millionaire, pimp - all of those I could take. Again, not the last of modern dirty clichés. But whether this line was a promotion of gaming, or, as I took it, a totally mental attack against gamers, who would think that now even such animals could be gamers? This is personal... but not false, either. After all this, I could try to be merciful... and deduct 2 stars out of 8. Party couldn't end without arousing Mexican dance. In children cartoon. That has to make it 5, no, really. But even that could be safe for children, compared to Gru's date. What do little girls have to think of that... what was her name? I'd call it horse. Do they have to have nightmares? Fear that they could become like one, or perhaps that they all are Lucies, while the rest of them females are exactly like that - horses? The manner in which they returned her - makes the clinical humor of Tom and Jerry look like Award-winner. It gets to 4, no mercy. Unfortunately, it's not over. Gru's ""in-love"" street walk could last for a couple minutes more. People probably haven't got the idea what and why he is doing. And he should've been more cruel on his way back. Afterall - what gives? Remaining plot could be summed up into the diluted garbage of hero being left a fool, his babe flying away, while realizing that she is in love in such a proper time and place; damsel in distress; totally heroic and unpredicted behavior of Dr. Nefario and... well, happy end. To add one last thing: I think Macho has clearly elaborated that serum makes the subjects virtually Supermen. How is it then that a... Monster Inc escaped and drunken Sullivan-sized ""injected"" Macho could be zapped like a pig with a mere lipstick-taser? Very, very convenient. So I guess it's not 4 anymore. If you are a fan of romance and don't quite have the taste... or brainpower(as rude as it is) to contemplate the failure of this movie - give it 3. It deserves it. I don't have such weaknesses, so I would give it 2, because there can't be less than 1, and, for all we know, it's Despicable Me! It deserves a star for the franchise.<br/><br/>TL;DR: If this review even makes it in(since it's not much of a review, but then again I ain't a critic with obligations of quality), I could just say: If you like the original - Don't. Watch. This. Spare yourself and your braincells, let alone your time. Trust me, you can imagine much better plot and continuation of the story all by yourself. If there is ever going to be the Third part... leave your hopes for it, and don't let them be destroyed by this sequel."

","I've been watching a lot of movies this year, and making a list. So far I've seen 85 movies, and it's safe to say Despicable Me 2 is the funniest one of them all. The movie theater was composed of teenagers and college-aged people, surprisingly no one younger than, say, 15. But the room was never quiet with laughter. The jokes just kept coming, and they stayed funny, which is rather rare for a sequel. Often a sequel is simply a re-hashing of the same story, with some details changed, or else a completely different story just with the same characters, but Despicable Me 2 was neither. The story was a continuation of the characters we came to love in the first movie, with character development.<br/><br/>I'm serious. If you need a 2 hour laugh, go see this movie."
"ghost_dog86","3","11","22","8 July 2013"," A Comedy for Small Children
","Standing as one of the most uninteresting protagonists to grace the world of animation in the past few years, my only question is: who really cares about Gru? And after watching ""Despicable Me 2"", I can't for the life of me figure out why the original even merited this sequel if the character of Gru was going to continue to be at the helm. Expecting to see a story about the reformed villain Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) ""getting back into the game"" (by which I mean being recruited by the Anti-Villain League (creative name I know) in order to help with the capture of the next super villain bent on world domination) but instead getting a throw-away love story, with forced sentimentality and a final battle sequence which comes up terribly short.<br/><br/>OK, so if you know me then you understand that I don't care for the Minions. But I do get why small children enjoy their incoherent babbling and slapstick antics. And the youngest girl in these films is one of the cutest animated characters outside of any Pixar film. But again, I don't get the appeal of Gru outside of the well conceived plot of the original, which took a lot of people by surprise and which I even gave a positive review to.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Watch Gru make silly faces, watch the cute kid be cutesy, but most of all watch the Minions beat each other senseless. This entire movie seems to be the result of a focus group that when asked what they enjoyed most about the first movie responded with a resounding: MINIONS! And so that's essentially what we get here, Minions at every turn. But as the most annoying part of the original, in small doses said Minions had been tolerable. But when said Minions appear in nearly every scene (as they do here) in conjunction with the relentless Minion-centric trailers we all had to sit though lo these past few months, ""Despicable Me 2"" only becomes more tiresome as it moves forward. Well, unless you wanted to see a Minions movie. And honestly, that is what many fans of the original are going to buy a ticket expecting to see. So, what do I know? Highlights: There is one funny character in this movie and it's not Kristen Wiig, who voices Lucy, an agent of the Anti-Villain League and the only character more annoying than the Minions. Clearly the best character in ""Despicable Me 2"" goes by the name of El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt). But between this character, the little girl being cutesy and the two Minion covers of well known songs during the finale which is sure to get a rise out of audiences, the overall entertainment factor is still low if you are going into this film not a Minions apologist.<br/><br/>Side Note: Do you know why the Minions aren't funny? Because their style of physical comedy is not at all clever. In fact, I don't believe their style of comedy is meant to be clever, but instead bait cheap laughs. For example: Have you ever seen a grown man hit himself in the face in order to make a crying infant laugh? Well, the Minions are kind of like that. Displaying the most infantile physical humor designed to send a room full of small children into hysterical laughter. So why millions of adults laugh at these antics is beyond me.<br/><br/>Final Thought: While it is true that I believe the Minions are the most annoying group of animated characters since the Chipmunks, if you read this review carefully my dislike of ""Despicable Me 2"" goes deeper than a simple hatred of those freaky little tater tots with eyes. ""Despicable Me 2"" is a supremely well animated, predictable and incredibly uncreative shell of the original, with every comedic moment playing for cheap laughs. And unlike most things in life, not even Pharrell can save this production. In short, there is really no reason to watch ""Despicable Me 2"" unless you were dying to see a Minions spin off or you are under 10 years of age.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","9 July 2013"," It's despicable if you haven't saw Despicable Me 2 yet. It's awesome fun!
","2010's Despicable Me was a huge hit that year, that from its success, a sequel was pretty much inevitable. Despicable Me 2 is truly just a fun movie to watch at the theater with your children or by yourself. The animation from Illumination Entertainment was pretty good, but I have to say that the movie trailers and promos will ruin it for you. I felt like I've already watched more than half of the movie in Youtube promos. So don't watch them. I do have to say that the sequel's story seem to be domination by the side characters Minions. I know that they will end up making a Minion movie for sure because they are just so damn adorable, but I thought they could have cut a little bit of them in the film to make more room for the love story. This is a 'Despicable Me' movie, not the Minions movie. While they may be a good marketing ploy, I really can't stand their chipmunk like noises after so long. Anyways, Despicable Me 2, has former super-villain Gru (Steve Carrel) being recruited with Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) by the Anti-Villain League to help deal with a powerful new super criminal who stolen a secret formula that cause a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde reaction to whomever drinks from it. It was a cute little family movie, but nothing really new in my opinion. It's a bit clunky as the story of this movie isn't as strong to begin with. It felt like the love story was force too hard. One minute, he doesn't like Lucy, and then he does after she save him from a horrible date. It was painfully obvious right from the start who Gru would end up dating. The whole movie felt like the same old movie formula of a single father cliché storyline. Lucy can be a bit annoying, as Kristen Wiig acts like a spazz most of the film. Wiig also played Miss Hattie in the first film by the way. There is also a subplot of Gru's daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) falling for his enemy's son. While, it could have work as a Romeo & Juliet type of sub-plot; the movie went a different way, and it was quickly resolve by the end of the film. Benjamin Bratt was brought in as a last minute replacement for Javier Bardem and Al Pacino as the movie's antagonist, El Macho. Al Pacino left the film due to creative differences. In my opinion, Benjamin Bratt does well. It must been hard for him, since he was brought in at such a late stage of animation. Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. I love that El Macho has a crazy pet chicken. He wasn't annoying like Vector was from the last movie. Back story of the villain El Macho, the most manly villain ever, was just funny as hell. Is the Hispanic stereotype jokes, a bit racist? Maybe, but it's all for fun. The ending fight with the villain was a bit disappointing as the secret formula that supposed to transform living things into indestructible killing machines was quickly end within a minute of fighting through nothing more than electricity. It was previous establish earlier in the film, that electricity doesn't stop them, so why did it work now? There is a lot of slapstick humor that the children will love, and some adult might enjoy. I do have to say to make sure to watch the 2010's short films such as Home Makeover, Orientation Day, and Banana as there is a number of running gags from those films in this film. There is a lot of adult jokes that the children will never get like the Minions dressing up like the Backstreet Boys. The movie is a lot of fun however. A lot of good supporting cast like Steve Coogan, and Russell Brand is an awesome addition to the cast. Glad that Ken Jeoung's role was cut to a few lines in the film. He would had ruin the movie. Even though you know how the movie's going to end, you really want her and Gru to end up together. Agnes (Elsie Fischer) continues to be one of my favorite animation kid character ever and the Minions are ever so funny. Like I said before, a Minion movie will come out and also a Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem ride at Universal Studios will be set to open soon. So check out this movie, and the previous one. It's a charming fun film."

","Despicable Me 2<br/><br/>**1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>98 mins / U<br/><br/>Cast: (voices) Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Miranda Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Ken Jeong, Steve Coogan, Elsie Kate Fisher, Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, Moises Arias<br/><br/>Directors: Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud<br/><br/>Plot: Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to stop a new evil super-villain from taking over the world.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: Although it is definitely flawed throughout, Despicable Me 2 gives audiences exactly what they wanted; more minions.<br/><br/>The film no longer shows us the original Gru: an evil villainous criminal trying to steal famous objects, but a somewhat dull and loving father trying to please his three children. Both versions of Gru want you to empathise with him but only the original makes you care about him due to his total vulnerability. In Despicable Me 2, he seems almost faultless (apart from when it comes to women) which is something I dislike about this one in comparison to the original 2010 film. Gru is recruited by an irritating Agent from the Anti-Villain League who gets him to search a local Shopping Mall for a new super-villain who has developed a potion which, when entered into a living species, turns them into purple killing machines. From here Agent Wild and he try to discover who the baddie is. <br/><br/>The most annoying thing about this film is that the moment you see the villain, you know it is him, and although the entire film keeps telling you it isn't him, it is so obvious it is. Every character seems to be completely stupid and without any logic at all. Gru is supposed to monitor the mall from a cupcake shop but there are no scenes expanding on the shop and it seems a waste to include what could be a great place for the minions to create mayhem. In the mall, there are forgettable supporting characters who aren't expanded on at all. I know it is a children's film but, considering its length, they really could have done something with all the under-developed characters the film leaves you with. <br/><br/>The saviours in the film actually are the characters that are expanded on. Benjamin Bratt voices a fun villain whom I will leave unnamed and Kristen Wiig's Agent Wild, although starts off annoying, grows on you as the film passes and develops a cute relationship with Gru. The minions are back and better than ever with jelly growing and hilarious dream sequences. The little noises they make fail to grow old and keep you entertained throughout. Adults will feel unsatisfied with all the potential but the kids will love it. Stay tuned for a wonderful 3-D set of post-credit mayhem which gives us a nice hint to a Minions movie in 2014, which follows Kevin the Minion before he meets Gru."

","The first Despicable Me was like a potential for a childhood favorite of the new generation by showing a memorable set of characters, and themes that contain a right amount of heart and sweetness. The existence of a sequel is obvious, by the way, there may be more things to explore in this villainous world. The charms and laughs return, but dealing with the story, it's cluttered with subplots that feels episodic and messy. However, many would still find it very entertaining and hilarious. Despicable Me 2 is okay, but its ambition needs to be more than their obsession with the minions.<br/><br/>Just like the original, the film sets Gru to a simple mission, then he suddenly gets some distractions by his family building issues. But those certain distractions helps the film to be more than just a silly James Bond parody adventure and eventually gives a heartwarming message. We can accept this way of being more interested in the family stuff than the spy action, but now this sequel doesn't have much of the consistency from the first. There isn't much going on in the main plot, letting the subplots do most of the job. The subplots, as always, are tend to build a theme, but the story didn't dig enough to make all of that compelling. In the end, some twists are suddenly revealed and almost all of their problems are immediately solved.<br/><br/>The voice performances still fill some life to these delightful characters. The best parts, without a doubt, are the minions, since they are the biggest reason why everyone wanted to see this. Their humor and antics are priceless and there is no single scene that you won't giggle. Here, they are a lot crazier than you would hope, because definitely that is what any kid or fan wants. The animation and action scenes are as lively as the comedy running around.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 spares some good laughs, but it's still sort of disappointing. It indulges itself for focusing too much on the cute stuff. That's not bad, but the film quickly loses interest at the bigger picture. As much as it's terribly entertaining and funny, people will leave the theater lacking enough heart. The central plot is not energetic compared to the comedy, and the protagonist's distractions, which are supposed to create themes, are now plain distractions. Thinking aside, how worse could have been? To those who root for the characters(other than the minions) will somehow like it at least. A less bland blockbuster can be beneficial in this era. Still, the film would've been way better."

","Move aside, Pixar. We've got our animated film of the summer. The less-despicable- more- lovable sequel provides non-stop laughs from start to finish all the while maintaining the wit and charm of the original.<br/><br/>In the sequel to 2010s unexpected success that was Despicable Me we find our former baddie Gru (Steve Carrel) living the single dad life, more focused now on his jam/jelly business and making sure the fairy princess shows up to Agnes' birthday party rather than freeze rays - though he does hold onto his villainous past. It's not too long into the film before Lucy (Kristen Wiig) unwillingly drags Gru to the headquarters of an organization known as the AVL (Anti- Villain League) where he is asked to use his expertise as a villain to track down a new bad guy who has stolen a top secret liquid that turns any creature into a mindless, indestructible killing machine.<br/><br/>As much as the plot takes its time getting to, the story ultimately here is Gru finding love; this time in that of a woman. Between the constant set-ups by his neighbor and some flashbacks of his childhood we get the idea that Gru isn't really good with women. Throw in a girl like Lucy that's just as wacky as him and we've got an interesting love story.<br/><br/>The film does a great job introducing new characters and gadgets yet still referencing enough from the first film for the audience to ease into the changes. Just like the original film the amount of physical comedy is off the charts, it's really what differentiated it from the other animated films. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of dialogue–based humor but there is also consistent slapstick style comedy happening throughout the film like a repeated montage, one of Gru giddy with love and the other dismal with heartbreak. This is also the best use of repetition I've seen all year, constant running gags some of which are still running from the first one.<br/><br/>One running gag I'm sure the studio didn't expect to have the impact it did was the Minions. Those little pill-shaped babblers were crowd favorites in the original and are now back and bigger than ever. They receive just as much screen time as any of the other major characters and succeed at being tremendously hilarious both off-screen and on-screen. While there isn't much to quote from (mostly because they don't speak English) it's fair to say they make the whole movie.<br/><br/>The voice work is great; Steve and Kristen both have great unique tics in their voices, which the animators played off of extremely well. It was nice to see Russell Brand return as Dr. Nefario as well, a voice that has always astounded me, being so far different from his natural one. Steve's is clearly different as well but it's quite easy pick out verbal cues.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is enjoyable on so many levels, it does a good job of giving the adult audience plenty of shout-outs and still being kid-friendly. Tons of euphemisms I'm sure kids won't understand but the adult humor is almost always delivered along with a piece of slapstick for the kids so no one in the audience ever feels left out.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is one of the most anticipated movies this Summer and it has lived up to the hype. The plot is rather predictable but there are enough surprises to keep people intrigued. It has its heartfelt moments with the kids, and with some of the new characters but what makes this run smoothly from beginning to end are the Minions and their ridiculous antics. They'll have you crying with laughter from the opening scene to the sequence during the credits. While being far from despicable, Despicable Me 2 is just as much fun as the original.<br/><br/>Our Rating: 8.0/10<br/><br/>Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Despicable Me 2!"
"Rendianami","6","5","9","19 July 2013"," 'Meh' at best
","I'm slightly confused as to why this ranked number one in the box office. It's an OK movie, but it's not great enough to beat movies that should have claimed number one, such as Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>The movie itself has many good intentions, but it focuses too much on the minions rather than around Gru's life with his daughters, and bonding with them. Sure, it pans to the fans' obsession with these yellow Minions, but for those who aren't in love with them, it can lead to a mediocre experience.<br/><br/>I've watched it four times. The first two were with other friends, and the other two were alone in the audience. I can't say it's a movie that you should watch alone, because you won't be laughing as hard as in a crowd. The movie starts off great, but after Lucy shows up, the act with the Minions has me a bit unfocused. The skit there is drawn out too long, and even the scenes after that don't keep me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>The scenes at the mall brought a chuckle at the most from me, but overall, pelvic thrusting from Gru made me feel awkward surrounded by parents who may think that it's inappropriate for their children to be watching. And it sort of is. It's embarrassing. <br/><br/>It just gets more and more drawn out, and I really wanted to leave the movie at the halfway point (at the fourth time watching it), because I know I'm not going to get any pleasure watching the rest of it. <br/><br/>I do watch movies repeatedly, over and over, but I won't be seeing this movie again. I won't say that I was ever a major nerd for Despicable Me, so maybe that's why my review isn't ecstatic over this movie. I don't feel it earned its place as number one convincingly enough, but hopefully it will be the last of this Despicable Me series."
"j-s_thompson","3","4","7","4 September 2013"," Confused waste of potential
","I enjoyed the first Despicable Me quite a bit. Especially the minions were great fun. This is one reason I was really disappointed after finishing DM 2.<br/><br/>The film had almost no plot to speak of. There was no tension or excitement at any point. If there was an issue, it was resolved within minutes or even seconds. None of the characters went through any sort of gradual personality change. The ones that did change did so from one scene to the next, often with no explanation or a only single line to let you know why.<br/><br/>The first minutes offered several laughs and chuckles. After that, I may have smiled slightly four times. I did consider leaving the cinema twice, and I noticed about 15 people who did so. Most jokes fell flat and were overplayed, overused, embarrassing and annoying. Lucy was clearly supposed to be found annoying by Gru, but she was also unbearably cringe-worthy to the audience at all times. The minions constituted more than half of all the ""funny moments"" in the story and surprisingly failed completely. It was if they had brain stormed ""funny minion costumes"" and ""100 stupid situations minions can get themselves into"" and then just selected them at random to plop into the film now and then. I don't know how they are going to do a Minion film now that we have already been bombarded with unfunny repetitive sketches throughout all of DM 2. All I know is I will not watch it.<br/><br/>The animation was quite good. It was smooth and at times fairly pretty. Some characters and animals were designed in a pleasingly humorous way while others were exaggerated to the point of being silly and aggravating.<br/><br/>Overall the story was a mess with no direction, no excitement and mostly shallow, irritating characters. It was a weak foundation for many tired attempts at squeezing out the last cuteness and comicality of the minions."
"Kane41","6","7","15","22 June 2013"," LIGHTBULB! Not so bright. REVIEW with SPOILERS!
","Back in April I posted a reply on the boards indicating a sentiment of anticipation that I could not wait to see Despicable Me 2 having loved the first.<br/><br/>I take my words back.<br/><br/>It was enjoyable but I could have waited!<br/><br/>Not as fresh, not as funny, not as simple or as visually fantastic or as big hearted as the first.<br/><br/>Suffers a classic case of 'the sequel needs to be bigger' - which lays the way for busy visuals and too many subplots, in turn over complicating the story and cooling the focus of its heart.<br/><br/>Is it fresh? No - what main plot of villainy there is, is boring. Although Gru and Agent Lucy Wilde's relationship is predictable it is handled efficiently enough that you hope boy gets girl and vice versa if only for Agnes' sake.<br/><br/>It is funny? It's a mixed bag lacking the warmth of the first film, so the myriad of gags try harder in this (unsuccessfully) through added comedic violence. The main laughs are, for the most part, made up by antics of the Minions - these little yellow guys are no longer the side show to the wit of Gru and the delicious voice delivery of Steve Carell.<br/><br/>Is it simple and visually fantastic? I'll say no - that's not to say the CG animation is not fantastic - it is as you would expect dazzling! But is it way too busy and that was the joy of the first.<br/><br/>Is it big hearted? I think you can manage an answer from the observations above and your own feelings once you've seen it. I'll put it this way - it does try - but there is nothing in DM2 that comes close to Gru's bed time storytelling.<br/><br/>The story arc of 'family' is now complete for Gru and the girls - moving forward I hope Despicable Me 3 is a prequel - of a time when Gru, Dr Nefario and the Minions were still up to no good.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>I didn't mean to call you a meat loaf, Jack !"
"Pinaymlc","5","5","10","17 July 2013"," I don't get the hype..
","Literally the only thing my whole group of friends could do after the movie was stare at each other and wonder what we just saw. It was funny at times, yes. But the plot was lacking in originality. Most of the supposedly funny parts were more like annoying attempts to being funny, but not really succeeding. The new woman character was nowhere near appealing and flat out unlikable. Pretty disappointing. I have no idea how this gets anywhere above a 6. I usually don't rate movies, but I really felt like I wasted my money on this one. A lot of minion action but I feel like it might have been too much. The ending was just disappointing... I feel like they could have made it a lot more thrilling but it was way too predictable. There wasn't much of a buildup of a plot, and the way they solved the problem was just too easy. There was inconsistency and some more inappropriate scenes that would require some explanation for kids.. I don't know. This movie was definitely one I wouldn't waste my time and money on. Much rather just watch the first one again."
"christiesmillie","5","5","10","1 July 2013"," Animated Comedy Kids Movie, lacking in imagination
","Newly turned good-guy Gru ""joins"" some anti-villain program, where he meets his future wife- Lucy. I found her unlikable, just annoying and she didn't really have a purpose. There is a distinct lack of chemistry, not romantic, one minute they don't get on, then the next, they are getting married,(they do need to keep it PG). The movie itself; Despicable Me 2, was not as good as the first one. If you didn't laugh at every last joke in the original, then don't bother. Despite the movie having some funny moments (some light humour for the parents made to watch) and the adorable Agnus being even more adorable, the movie is still a ""take it or leave it"". The animation is very high quality, and the minions are even more immature as they gain more screen time. Looks like the creators realised how to appeal to the masses. To be fair, it is a movie aimed directly at kids, and if it amuses them, then hey-ho."
"amastron","5","7","16","5 July 2013"," Weak rehash of ideas from the first one
","The animation is good, and actors have done a good job providing the voices. However, the movie remains a confused and weak rehash of the same ideas of the first one. Shark? Check. Missile? Check. Crazy contraptions? Check.<br/><br/>This second installment begins many plot themes, but none of them materialize into a story. Not enough time is devoted to get any story line going, and the movie jumps from one to the other. Sometimes when the movie gets back (for example, to the hair club), that's when you remember 'Oh, yeah! that happened"".<br/><br/>In the end, there is not much time for a climax, and it ends up being silly, but not in an entertaining way.<br/><br/>Where the movie really fails is in the expectations set by the first one. The richness of the various characters are missing, even that of Mr. Perkins. Ultimately, the girls don't have much to do, nor Dr. Nefario, Gru's mother, or even the minions.<br/><br/>Sequels often fall short of the first, but with the imagination shown in the first one, you would think that they would have enough left over for making another one. Unfortunately, it looks there was just enough imagination left for the Trailer."
"randomhacker-762-412971","5","3","5","11 August 2013"," Sequelitis strikes again!
","If you're expecting a gripping plot and thrilling action sequences, this is not your movie. It's lighthearted, whimsical, and funny, but it lacks a compelling plot and lost some great characters from the first movie.<br/><br/>For example, Gru's mom (an important part of the last movie) made a three-second cameo near the end. Dr. Nefario, a hilarious but old scientist, is absent for 95% of the movie before he comes back miraculously to pull our heroes out of the frying pan. Finally, no closure or reference, aside from a single line said in passing, mentions the first movie. Did Vector die on the moon?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the advertising led us to believe that Gru was going to save the world again from a threatening villain while trying to be a good dad. Instead, we get him tramping around after an overweight Hispanic man who manages to nail nearly every supervillain cliché in the book. Needlessly complicated plan? Check. Survived certain death with no plausible explanation? Check. Wanting to take over the world for no reason other than taking it over? (That is, as opposed to avenging a loved one or establishing a new empire). Check. Even Vector was a better villain than El Macho.<br/><br/>More importantly, I feel like the romances (Gru and Lucy and Margo and Antonio) were extremely forced. I saw no chemistry between Gru and Lucy at all, and the whole '147 dates later' thing just won't cut it. It seems like the whole movie was just set up to give the girls a mother, because it didn't make much sense otherwise. <br/><br/>The Anti-Villain League is barely mentioned again after its introduction, no mention is made of Floyd (the wig man) after his arrest, no elaboration on El Macho's survival or overall plans are made, no closure is given to the giant, indestructible monster!El Macho at the end, and so on...<br/><br/>Worst of all, the entire solution to the problem is completely a deus ex machina, meaning that they pulled it out of their *** in order to neatly resolve the mutant problem. I mean, seriously? An anti-mutagen that Nefarious just HAPPENED to have on hand, much less created in the first place?<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie for me was Gru himself. It was shocking to see how much he had changed from the first movie to the second. The entire gimmick behind the franchise was that Gru was evil, but still trying to be a good dad. The movie even has the word 'despicable' in the title, for crying out loud! Yet, Gru was nowhere near his deliciously evil self like in the first movie. Yes, he broke into a mall, and yes, he torches his phone with a flamethrower, but that's about it.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, look elsewhere if you want a compelling movie or a plot that makes sense, but this movie is still a hilarious one for the kids, with some references that their parents will enjoy, too."

There some shows and movies that should be left unmade since conception like THE ANNOYING ORANGE (because it is infantile and stupid) or DAN VS. (please read my comment).

","DM2 is definitely a competitive movie to its prequel,you may not find the stealing of moon this time though. Except the plot,sequel is way better than its prequel especially in terms of comedy. Steve Carell has outdone himself really. There is more importance to Elsie Kate Fisher(Agnes) here as the directors know well what we'd like to see. I bet you cannot find any other animation films this much funnier. Both the directors are the smartest ever i've seen. Budget is low as movie already soars in Box office. They knew exactly what to do to make the Box office come their way. Yep,I am talking about the minions. When I watched the prequel I never thought they were making a sequel giving more value to minions. But they found a way. That was spot on! What I still wonder is whatever they tried to give us a comedy,it never failed anytime. That is never easy. Great stuff! May be here, we need Tom Hanks' voice to get a lot of votes for this wonderful movie. Come on! All go see this. Don't waste your life by being miss this funniest flick. When it comes to music, Happy song is just amazing. Its safe to say that background music is brilliant as always. Minions at its best during the climax.

Of course,we can anticipate more from them as Sandra Bullock (Richest Paid Actress) is pulled for their next one."

The minions are so silly that they got me chuckling many times. However, the charm of the film ends there. Maybe I am not the right age or the right demographic, but I find ""Despicable Me 2"" just a little to silly. It is a simple hero versus villain film, with very little to engage the adult viewers. The emotional subplot the search for a mother is just too thin to make any emotional impact.<br/><br/>In recent years, animations are so good that viewers are completely spoilt.

My only quibble would be that the story turned into a lover rescue mission at the end. There has not been an animated comedy in recent times that does not contain some serious scenes for a considerable portion of the run time. I was hoping Despicable Me 2 would be the first to not do so, but it was not, sadly. However, it's not so bad if that's the worst aspect. It lived up to and exceeded many of my expectations. There are many laughs to be had for people of every age (and some for only the grown ups). It was definitely worth my time and I will be watching it again in the future. Watched 07/02/2013, written 08/12/2013."

","Even more Despicable! Actually this is a sweet turn for the lovable anti-villain villain, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who is comfortably back as a bona fide family man, to the three adorable orphans who melted audiences hearts alike in the first film. Gru would seem like a fun father, but he takes his responsibilities overbearingly over the girls as he has trouble accepting them growing up. Not only that, but he struggles to find contentment with no longer being a villain, with his laboratory now transformed into a jam-making factory. Through expected plot development, advocated from a sequel, it is not until a love interest comes along, Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig), that Gru loosen his shell and the plot moves into action. She takes him to the aptly titled 'anti-villain league' who recruit Gru, with Lucy as his partner in anti-crime, to take down a new villain who has taken disguise at a local shopping mall. What better way to take down a villain than with a post-villain. However Gru is not as proficient as he used to be, he is divided and distracted between his responsibilities to his girls, his love for villainous antics and his mixed emotions to his new partner.<br/><br/>The plot moves efficiently and effectively, moving briskly but taking special care with the characters whom audience enjoyed the first time around, while injecting a few new ones. Of course this means the minions are back, if ads didn't make it obvious. The uniformly dressed but motley shaped crew seem to have grown exponentially in number, as they are ever present in the film. Even their antics in the background over petty things, prove hilarious, but the pint size helpers also take a pivotal role in the plot. This strikes an interesting point in the films advertising. Hardly any plot was divulged, beyond set-up, meaning that there are plenty of surprises to be had in the film. In fact the minions took the foreground of marketing, being funny without substantiating into crass or being overtly annoying. Not only are they ingenious supporting characters but also act as an ingenious means of marketing the film, without spoiling much of the fun of the film, similarly like Scrat in the Ice Age films. If you only liked them in the first film, you'll love them now. <br/><br/>The bottom line (hahaha 'bottom'- you read it in a minion voice didn't you :) is that this is a very comfortable flick. It lives up to the adage, if you liked the first you'll like this one. Colorful and cheerful animation, that is quite impressive, with more minion madness, as expected, punctuated by heart warming sentiment, in good measure."
"Heffernan99","7","2","3","10 August 2013"," The minions still make you laugh, nothing new to offer.
","The first movie was widely acclaimed for its relevant humour, animation that appeals to a different audience and of course, the minions. With such a big burden on it's head, this movie had a lot to live up to and like any other sequel it is always difficult to recreate the first magic. Gru (Carell) has finally given up on being a villain and now has started focusing his resources on making jelly and jams. He lives with his three adopted daughters, Margo (Cosgrove), Edith (Gaier) and Agnes (Fisher) and all of them are happy with their lives. A laboratory gets stolen from the arctic circle and nobody has any idea who did it or why. Agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig) from the Anti-Villain League, recruits Gru to help them identify the villain by thinking like one and be on the good side for a change. A big evolution in the movie is the character of Gru who has turned good from being bad. That has not only not made him despicable but also affected the movies humour content to some extent. Yes, the movie fails to live up to the standards of the first movie but having said that, it is not exactly a bad watch. You would get more than one occasion to laugh heartily but maybe not as much as the first one. Since the audience is more or less familiar with what Gru is, there is nothing appealing about him anymore and in that sense, the movie lacks innovation. Great movie to watch but could have been far better."

","Without a doubt, this is one crazy, clever, and outrageous bullet train of an animated movie that does its energetic best to wring out the laughs (and mostly succeeds). Part of ""Despicable Me 2's"" (hereafter DM2) success are its inspired plot borrowings such as ""The Incredibles"", the Bond movie series, ""Lilo and Stitch"" and even ""Cars 2"" to embroil everyone's favorite Uncle Fester/Dr. Evil hybrid ex-supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) in a world dominance plot using cute beasties turned into purple, fanged wrecking balls.<br/><br/>Another part of its success is the gradual revelation of Gru's more positive qualities such as his growing, more tolerant, and sometimes excessive compassion towards his adoptive children Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the eldest and a budding teenager, tomboyish middle child Edith (Dana Gaier), and button-cute unicorn fanatic Agnes (Elsie Fisher), the youngest. We also must not forget the winning, ebullient return of resourceful Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, using her Lola Bunny voice from ""The Looney Tunes Show"") who recruits the somewhat reluctant Gru to go uncover with her at a mall bakery to uncover which of the mall proprietors is behind the purple mutant plot. The flabby but suave and mysterious Eduardo Perez/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), the mall Mexican restaurant owner with an alluring son (Moisés Arias) involved with Margo, also keeps the proceedings hopping. All of the aforementioned stuff, in my opinion, works as smart, coherent entertainment.<br/><br/>But what powers and keeps this bullet train together is one of the most insidiously and surprisingly endearing creations of any movie - the little old Minions. These slyly captivating characters prove the old adage that introducing lots of cute, fun, silly, little people in a movie is a surefire, lucrative way to lure people to an animated film. Characters such as the Smurfs, Pokemon, and the 627 experiments from ""Lilo and Stitch"" have certainly proved that. They can easily capture young children's interest.<br/><br/>But unlike the Smurfs, etc., Minions have crossover appeal to parents as well. Sure they babble childishly and otherwise act like overstimulated, quarrelsome brats. But the Minions are also industrious, satirical and hip assistants with some adult sensibilities, always eager to help Gru with his radically new espionage job, parenting, and love life predicaments. These Twinkie-shaped, blue over-all wearing dynamos keep DM2's pace from ever flagging.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the Minions completely detract from the main storyline. I think we want to see Gru surmount childhood disappointments, his uncertainties and his sinister past to be a good do-gooder, better parent, and perhaps a suitable match for Lucy. But DM2 wouldn't be quite the same without the Minions serving as Greek chorus, comedy relief, and (mostly) trustworthy Gru sidekicks AND foster children. No wonder Illumination Entertainment plans an exclusive feature for them. Now if they can only introduce a Minionette."

","Hilarious. I thought the 1st Despicable Me was hard to beat. I was wrong. The film was epic. I loved the opening and how it related to the first film, something was stolen in another country. I thought the film forced the ending and the evil minions were a bit to, maybe insane, but those were maybe the only bad things about it. You could feel Gru's care for the girls, Dr Nefario's plead for evil, but the real stars of the show were the minions (non evil). They cracked me up. Their mischievous mishaps, quarrels and missions lead to mania. I actually thought it was a comedic and family fun version of Mission Impossible.

","Usually sequels are better than the original; and sometimes not. DESPICABLE ME 2, a CGI giggle riot, proves well worth waiting for. Gru(Steve Carell)is more sedate this time, leaving his villain image behind to taking care of his three adorable adopted daughters. His little yellow minions now work with Gru's accomplice, Dr. Nefario(Russell Brand),making jam. The Anti-Villain League wants Gru to go undercover to seek out a new super-villain traced to a local mall kiosk. Gru is assigned a partner in the form of eccentric agent Lucy Wilde( Kristen Wiig). Gru's mind is occupied with planning a birthday party for daughter Agnes(Elsie Fisher). The identity of the hunted villain proves to be no real mystery at all. And becoming obvious is agent Lucy's affections toward her rotund partner. Daughter Margo(Miranda Cosgrove)also seems to be bitten by the love bug.The minions bring about most of the giggles and knee slapping comedy. This animated feature has all the elements to keep the whole family entertained. Other featured voices: Benjamin Bratt, Dana Galer, Steve Coogan and Moises Aria. Those lovable minions are voiced by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud."

But his arc develops further and the film, thankfully, goes exactly where you want it to go. Even more thankfully, it does so with a great deal of humour, colour and action on the way. The 3D is good and the voices are excellent.<br/><br/>And the minions are, again, wonderful as they take delight, at child level, in mild rudeness and slapstick violence.<br/><br/>This film is a delight - charming, very funny, and with a lot of heart.

","""Despicable Me"" was a big summer hit grossing a surprising number 251.5 million dollars on the box office. It was ranked tenth on the all-time animation movie chart. Three years later, the sequel released wishing to make a blockbuster as great as the first movie.<br/><br/>In the first movie, Gru, a super-villain, planned to steal the moon by adopting three girls for his personal benefit. Slowly, these kids changed his heart. As a result, Gru turns from ""superbad"" to ""superdad"".<br/><br/>This sequel begins with Gru who has quit being a bad guy is invited to help the anti-villain league. Gru and his partner, Lucy are searching for the top secret formula which makes a cute, fluffy animal turns into a purple, savage monster. Through the cooperation, Gru and Lucy made an unexpected chemistry reaction, but when he saw his eldest daughter, Margot hanging out with another boy, he opposed like every father does.<br/><br/>This sequel comparing to 2010's ""Despicable Me"" is nearly as entertaining as the original, although it may not be as fresh, it still brings big laughs in this sequel. For example, after the first movie successfully caught the audience with the colorful vision and the charming characters (especially those cute, yellow minions), the appearances of ""Gru's cousins"" increased. The minions were a highlight since the first movie. This time, minions are everywhere! They sing, they dance, they make fun with each other, but most important of all, they sure make the audience enjoy the 98-minute movie.<br/><br/>There is a big difference contrasting to the original. The first movie shows the father-daughter love which makes us feel warm and cozy, this time, ""Despicable Me 2"" adds some romance into it. For example, the ""Gru-and-Lucy"" love and the little crush between Margot and Antonio. These all make the plot more interesting.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me"" is my favorite animated movie ahead of ""Wreck-it Ralph"" placed in second. Although the plot of ""Despicable Me 2"" is not as great as the first one. It is hilarious, adorable and enjoyable. In 2014, the minions will have their very own movie. Though we might not understand their language through the entire movie, I am still looking forward to that movie."

","""That's right, baby! Gru's back in the game with cool cars... gadgets... and weapons!""<br/><br/>There might not be that much of an interesting story in this sequel, but I have to admit I had a blast with these lovable characters and laughed throughout the entire movie. I don't think I laughed as much with any other movie all year so I have to say this is the funniest film of the year so far. It has several clever lines and I was glad to see all these memorable characters back. Once again the minions steal the show along with Agnes who is as adorable as ever. There were also some new characters that brought some freshness to the sequel. I can understand why some adults might not have liked this film because it is predictable and has some very stupid moments, but I know kids will have a great time. They will love this sequel because the minions have more screen time and they steal the funniest scenes. I couldn't help but laugh at all the funny and adorable situation, and perhaps hearing the kids laugh at the theater made me appreciate the comedy even more. This is a very family friendly film which reminded me a lot of the old comedy from the Looney Tunes. I could sit through this film many more times without hesitating because it is a very easy watch. I think I'd even prefer to see this over the first Despicable Me, but they were both great and funny films. <br/><br/>In this sequel we see how Gru (Steve Carell) is adapting to family life as he has put his villainous life behind him. He seems to be enjoying his life as a single parent to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher). Everything seems to be going well for him as he has his minions working on a jam business. Meanwhile a secret Arctic lab has been stolen and the Anti-Villain League decide to contact Gru for his expertise in order to catch the person responsible. After recruiting Gru they team him up with Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) and together they begin to look for suspects. Gru is convinced that the villain is Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), who used to disguise himself as the villain known as El Macho, but he has been presumed dead for years. During their investigation, Gru's minions are being kidnapped, and the question remains as to who is the person behind all this.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the animation from the guys at Illumination Entertainment and thought the 3D worked nicely. I really loved the underwater scene and thought it was really breathtaking. There were some great animated moments, but the lovable minions are the ones that steal the show with their funny voices and mischiefs. I also liked the addition of Lucy who despite being a bit wacky seemed like a perfect fit for Gru. I had a great time and I'm sure kids will love this extremely entertaining movie"

I was aching to see the sequel. And the sequel is even better in some parts then the original. They were right to dedicate more time to minions in the movie then Gru. All the people (well, mostly kids but still) went nuts during the scenes with minions. And we were all applauding at the end of the movie. And I think it says something.

"zkonedog","7","1","1","6 March 2017"," Silly Fun (With A Little Emotion Thrown In)
","The first ""Despicable Me"" effort introduced audiences to the goofy, rambunctious Minions as well as the relationship between villain-turned-good guy Gru and his three little girls. The second movie plays to those same strengths and offers more Minion mayhem and more heartfelt moments.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Despicable Me 2"" sees Gru (voice of Steve Carell) recruited by secret agent Lucy (Kristin Wiig) to join the newly-formed Anti-Villain league. Though at first nonplussed by the offer and content to be just ""Dad"" to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and sweet little Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher), Gru begins to feel the tug of adventure once again (as well as perhaps a bit of a romantic fling as well?!) and is quickly caught up in the world-saving game again.<br/><br/>In terms of comedy and adventure, this movie provides it in spades! It's amazing that it took this many years of human history to think up such hilarious characters as Minions, as they can make even the most sourpuss among us crack a smile (and have most of us rolling in the aisles!). Their crazy antics are unrivaled in the history of animated feature films.<br/><br/>There is also a nice little touch of emotion in the movie involving Gru finding a partner (or mother, as asked for by Agnes). I actually wish the movie would have focused on this movie, as a more developed and focused emotional aspect could have easily vaulted it to five-star status.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Despicable Me 2"" is fine comedic fare for anyone who enjoyed the original. The girls might touch you, the Minions will have you laughing throughout, and Carell's Gru is such a crazy character that he is a joy to watch. A fun film for the entire family."

"eric262003","8","1","1","11 October 2015"," A Sequel That's Just As Fun As The First
","The original ""Despicable Me"" was a rather eccentric, but quite an engaging family film. In the original, we see Gru (Steve Carrell) as an evil doer who's master plan was rob the moon. The antagonist in the movie was even more deranged and diabolical. In most animated cartoons, the heroes come across as cute and timid characters who come out on top in spite of the dangerous obstacles they must prevail to emerge victorious. Gru on the other hand has a more anti- hero characteristic rather than the typical soft fuzzy heroes we loved over the years. I guess this kind of characteristic in find a darker toned character as the hero was the reason why this film fared so successfully at the box office; along with the Minions mind you. ""Despicable Me 2"" may have been one of those not-needed sequels, since in the end of the first one, Gru does become nice. With his ability to utilize his evil savvy as an advantage to service heroism contributes the movie to work its way this time around.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Gru living peacefully with his three adorable daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Believing that he's lonesome with no companion in his life, but seems ardent at times when they start looking for companions. One day, Gru gets captured by an undercover agent of the Anti-Villain League named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). The AVL depends on Gru to ascertain a possible fiendish criminal genius who's coming off as an owner of a shopping mall store. Gru declares that the villain is El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) a man who appears to be almost unbeatable. He has invented a concoction that provides for him super-strength and has arbitrarily tried it on some of Gru's Minions.<br/><br/>Even though Gru is more of a protagonist, it's still wonderful that his edginess wasn't completely watered down. He still get easily cantankerous towards people who irritate him which includes his three daughters. He still has the knack for being evil and the film takes great pride in proving that point. One of the better scenes is when Gru tries to outsmart El Macho and pinpoint his next moves beforehand. This kind of methodology is what keeps this film true to the original even if Gru is not as despicable as he once was. <br/><br/>The storytelling elements in this film are the main weakness here, just like the first one. The narrative is way too loose contrary to other animated films of this generation (""Madagascar"" and ""Frozen""). I think ""Despicable Me 2' had the potential to pitch more ideas over with Gru striving to become more adept at pushing his heroic integrity even further. There are moments midway in the film that drags a bit at times. and even though the Minions are cute, their functions tend become at times lacking in significance. Every so often these little guys need some moments to themselves (thank goodness for the summer spin-off movie this year). <br/><br/>I would be lying to your faces if I told you the Minions were not the best things in the movie. In fact every time they're on, they put a big smile on my face. They really are quite magnetic. Sure they might distract the gist of the movie, but they're just too adorable and funny to neglect. Some of the more funnier scenes was when they morph into purple demon-like critters. I guess the film- makers knew how immensely popular the minions were so they added more just to please the viewers. And surely they didn't disappoint. They're manic and crazy antics will surely have you laughing out loud till your head explodes. <br/><br/>The Minions weren't the only funny ones here. Gru is exceptionally funny as the leading hero and El Macho makes one hell of an exciting villain. He kind of reminds me of Carlos from ""Hop"" that has morphed into a sumo wrestler. The characters are very delightful in it creation and the visuals are just simply stunning. ""Despicable Me 2' isn't the best animated movie out there, but it's still offers lots of humour and warmth for a family film the whole family could enjoy."

","A fine sequel but not as charming as the predecessor.<br/><br/>Many sequels get lost or get rotten by showing the same thing over again in a new package. The packaging is different but the contents are more or less the same. This film too, follows a similar path just that it deviates to introduce more themes or plots. Like, the sub plot of Gru (played by Steve Carell) and his girlfriend Lucy (played by Kristen Wiig). <br/><br/>The villain is new, the gags are new and the action is also new, yet the soul remains unperturbed or changed. So that's a bit of disappointment if you expect something radically different in this. If you loved the earlier one indeed there are higher chances that this one shall also be loved. I am saying this, as actually there are more moments of laughter and fun. <br/><br/>The minions, who had a lesser role in the prequel play a big role in holding the film together and helping the hero achieve to win over the villain. I ain't gonna reveal anything more than this, concerned to the plot. Of course, the kids who were there in the earlier film are part of this too. <br/><br/>I like it but not to an extent as I liked the first one. Yet, it's watchable and hilarious too. I am going with a 3/5. Yes, it's surely a well done animated film. But for me, I got a feeling of been there and seen that."

Despicable Me is so average, even when compared to the original, which at least tried.<br/><br/>Despicable Me was about a misunderstood evil villain, and his misadventures as a single father. Despicable Me 2 doesn't have themes beyond its adventure. Side characters from the original are missing or reduced to cameos. Gru is no longer a villain. His single father issues are trite. The lone development in this film is Gru's romantic relationship. Its typically cartoonish, with little romantic chemistry.<br/><br/>At least the movie is funny. The characters are outrageous and often engage in slapstick. If you like what you've seen of the minions, you'll probably like the film's humor.<br/><br/>Its a decent rental, if you're just looking for laughs. You don't need to watch the first."

Although in this movie one eclipses the other by a large margin, Despicable Me 2 is as good a story as any. Now a family man, Gru has given up his evil ways and is stuck in sort of a rut. When he is recruited by the Anti Villain League he grabs the chance to once again experience a thrilling life, but at what cost is the question. Steve Carell reprises his role and shines yet again. All of the mannerisms in Gru's character are very well played and you laugh and cry along with him throughout the movie. Newcomer Kristen Wiig is a very welcome addition to the saga. Her quirky agent Lucy is a delightful character and provides a few giggles herself. However all of these great roles are overshadowed by those crazy yellow creatures known as the minions. In every scene they make an appearance they steal the show and leave you wanting more. Cuteness is also a factor played out very well by the Gru's girls with Agnes leaving a white smile in your face every time she speaks. Probably not a masterpiece of a movie, Despicable Me 2 is a hell of an entertaining piece of blockbuster cinema and feels fresh every time you watch it. Personally I find it to be one of the funniest movies of all time and overall a fantastic way to spend 1 1/2 hours without any worries at all.<br/><br/>Rating 9/10"

For instance, its ""Gangham-Style"" dancing (by lipstick-tasered victims) are just hilarious homages to Chuck Berry's guitar-playing and John Travolta's dancing, elevated to a perfect blend of homage, music, and joy, thanks to megastar franchise composer Pharrell Williams. One half of The Neptunes, Williams wrote charting hit ""Happy"" for Gru's DM2 montage; it's now available online as 24hoursofhappy-com.<br/><br/>The same creative team is back from DM1, ensuring a sensitive sequel tonal change. ""It's pretty clear that by the end of DM1, Gru was no longer a villain"", claims co-director Chris Renaud, so DM2 concerns itself with the sacrifices of matured fatherly love, beyond merely falling in love with one's children, as Gru had in DM1. In the process, Gru (Steve Carrell) undergoes emotional changes needed to complete his family.<br/><br/>Disappointingly, ""fans"" of the original charge that DM2 has ""no plot"" since it's missing ""serious villains"". In not getting this sequel, they disregard Gru's character arc (business losses, a mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League, and the minion-nappings) as plot. The prologue comes out the gate like a serious James Bond film, although the film soon begins to wink; by the first act all pretense to real danger is dropped, and the tone refocuses on Gru's put-upon fatherhood. The Disappointed Brigade can therefore be referred to Megamind(2010) and The Incredibles(2004), both of which specifically explored villain battles. The DM franchise explores the reformation of a self-centered guy (villain) via 3 little girls once he began to love them as they needed. Steve Carrell himself is quoted about the future of Gru: ""You want this character to soften up and that there would be just this sense of joy and love at the end.....As crazy as this character sounds, and diabolical and mean and awful, there's a humanity to him that comes out in little bits....that's what drew me to (this franchise)"".<br/><br/>DM2 cheekily lays bare the challenges of mature dating, especially when pushed by daughters. Both Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and little Agnes (voiced again by exuberant child actress Elsie Fisher) enjoy being daddy's girls, but Agnes in particular senses the costs of missing a mom. The minions are an insufficient substitute.<br/><br/>DM3 is rumored to be a minion origin feature, but DM2's minions are still a mysterious bunch of naughty little yellow goofballs serving as Gru's amoral army (""humans are just meat to them"", explains chief animator/co-director Pierre Coffin). Not actually evil, just dopey, mischievous and always squabbling, they're meant to remind us of annoying but lovable little brothers. Once co-writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio hit upon DM2's plot to turn them truly evil via a secret formula, their Dr-Jekyll-and-Mr-Hyde scenario was gleefully animated with an insider's grin, adapted from old-school (Looney Tunes) short Hyde and Hare(1955)), mashed-up with Rocky and Bullwinkle's Metal Munching Mice(1960), Season2.<br/><br/>Since the main plot revolves around mysterious minion-nappings, the sequel's villainy pivots on what the yellow goofballs turn into: purple, hairy, knuckle-dragging, underbite-sporting, vacuous versions of themselves who cannot speak. Evil minions only do a hilariously dumb, sharp ""Baaa!"" screech, pointedly recalling the last scene from Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978).<br/><br/>Pierre ""say-'Casket'-instead"" Coffin and Chris Renaud, the franchise's sweet co-directors so far, were understandably heavily influenced by cartoon classics: Dripalong Daffy(1957)'s Nasty Canasta is the unacknowledged inspiration for the ""tough homber"" villain El Macho (sizzling drink, gurgle-gurgle, ""Bartender, bartender, WHERE's MINE?""), with added ""lucha-libre""/Nacho Libre(2006) Mexican wrestling costuming. Renaud's minion-compressor idea for DM2's jar-headed minion was borrowed from Hillbilly Hare(1950); Coffin's fruit-basket minion is a spoof of 1940s popular South American songstress Carmen Miranda; the Afro-wearing beach bartender spoofs Isaac(Ted Lange) from The Love Boat(1977-1987), and the white-overalled, white-jacketed group of minions are spoofing marshmallow 1990s boy-band All For One, whose chart-topping ""I Swear"" lyric is cheekily minionised by Coffin as ""underwear"". Last, but not least, the film's wildly energizing closing track YMCA is a minion makeover of THE Village People perennial 1979 hit.<br/><br/>Much of the humour is realised with group scenes sporting ""easter-eggs"" in their backgrounds. They begin at Agnes' birthday party (a tormenting little boy is re-educated by a clever little girl, and a stumbling woman gets plus-conked with a game ball). Later there's an easily missed 22nd fart gun salute; sundry mock Minion-on-Minion-violence which once gets hilariously out of hand in a vat; and evil minions gnawing each other in cages. Even the climactic villain scene sports an ""easter-egg"" homage to director Chris Renaud's home townall very funny.<br/><br/>But there are two fall-down-funny jokes I'll never forget: little Agnes' interpretations of Gru's wild pantomime for pushy neighbor Jillian(Nasim Pedrad), and the entry of two incognito minions to the evil lair using nothing but a raspberry-enhanced password. This latter one is funniest to me personally for a real-world analogue that works equally well! The parental dating subplot is also riotous, satisfyingly skewering society's shallow and obnoxious ""bodyproud"" women who are only successful in the confines of their own noggin'. DM2 gives its Shannon(Kristen Schaal) character the right-royal ""Weekend at Bernie's(1989)"" treatment: she's flopped upside down, legs splayed apart, her indignities fully deserved.<br/><br/>A final word about homage: DM2 draws from pop culture going back 60yrs, even referencing Toy Story(1995) itself in Act1, yet it's all done with love and understanding: its homages are ""organic"" (arising naturally). Unlike other functionally lesser Hollywood creatives, DM2's storytellers never rip off decades of work by others calculatingly. Instead, DM2 so bristles with finely observed behavior in this story of love in all its forms, that it might be termed the Wrath of Khan(1986) of its own franchise.(10/10)"

","I had the chance to watch both the first and second film on a flight from Seoul to Singapore. The first one came out in 2010 and I was busy doing my national service hence I never had the chance to watch it. The first one was a pleasant surprise and I loved the idea of focus on a bad guy turning good of sorts. The second installment tried to expand on the story and foundation based on the first one. It worked alright, but it was predictable at times. Also, I always felt that the minions steel the thunder from Gru. It could have been better if the bond between Gru and his adopted daughters were explored further. In the end it's natural movie goers will get a spin off of the minion movie. It's a fun movie to watch with a child, but there is was no two times the charm."

The first one made me laugh out loud and was heart-warming.<br/><br/>The movie was not good, it was GREAT. Even better than the first film. I admired the voice talents of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Steve Coogan, and of course: Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin as the Minions. I loved the story. The humor blew me away especially the Minions. The character, Lucy Wilde, is a perfect character.

","Gru (Steve Carell) is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to help deal with a powerful new super criminal.<br/><br/>Opinion is mixed on whether the first or second is the better film, and this is ultimately a personal and subjective decision. For me, however, the second is better than the first and it is easy to explain why: the shift from the kids to the minions as the secondary characters. Some people prefer the kids, while others (myself included) prefer the minions.<br/><br/>In 2013, the strongest animated film is certainly ""Frozen"" and that will likely be the film to take home the Oscar (just as they snagged the Golden Globe). However, ""Despicable Me 2"" is a strong contender; while not quite as inventive in the animation department, or musically, it still manages to be the most entertaining film and that should count for something. Of the two, this is the one that will probably get more repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Mysteriously, Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"" was nominated for best original song. As great as this film may be, the music is not its strong point. Not that ""Happy"" is a bad song, but it does very little to stand out and seems an odd choice. Two songs from ""Frozen"" could have been chosen and this would make more sense than ""Happy"" (though there might be rules against two songs from one film being chosen).<br/><br/>Some have alleged anti-Hispanic bias, or even blatant racism, presumably because one character is named El Macho and he runs a Mexican restaurant. A bit stereotypical perhaps, but there was nothing outright offensive. In fact, El macho is shown riding a shark into an active volcano, which is just about the coolest thing anybody could ever do. And the voice actor (Benjamin Bratt) is half-Peruvian...<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a great film and deserves a shot at the Oscar, despite the likelihood that ""Frozen"" has it on lock."

Gru is then recruited by the agency whom serve to protect against evil where on the amazing adventure he makes new friends, memories and family.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth your time to watch with your family, friends or just you."

","Despicable Me 2 by Walt Disney Movies is great for so many reasons. It is pretty much viewable to anyone aged from 3 to 103 and they would enjoy Despicable Me 2 especially in the cinema, on the big screen. People mostly will love the minions' riot of anarchic slapstick with their antics and their strange delighted helium-induced jabbering's which are really the heart of this Disney movie. Best of all, the minions are mostly sweet and innocent, and represent so much the joy and exuberance of living in the moment that it's impossible for anyone to watch this film or give a film review and not be happy or give a positive review. I'm pretty sure that they will get their own movie at some point by obtaining DVD releases. The new DVD releases of the Despicable Me 2 movie is a must see after Despicable Me (part 1). Walt Disney did an outstanding job as usual and added the perfect touch Despicable Me so that Despicable Me 2 could be even better on DVD release."

"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","1","13 December 2013"," The Despicable Me franchise lands its second outing on both light-weight feet.
","The Despicable Me franchise may not be necessarily better than Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks, but it certainly has a breezy quality to it that's refreshing to see. I really enjoyed the first film for light entertainment. While it has the standard something-for-kids and something-for- adults, its charm comes from really not taking itself seriously as it could almost be an update of the absurd Looney Toons cartoons but still having a small gut punch of emotion. The first film hit with the bonding of the three girls and Gru, this film is about the one gap left in their unconventional family - the mother and wife. This new addition, Lucy, unfortunately feels more like the grating Kristen Schaal than the frequently endearing Kristen Wiig. They force the quirkiness on her character and it's incredibly irritating. As much as I want to see Gru find a partner and the girls find a mother figure, the way they had everyone, even minion, adore her unconditionally backfired entirely. However, she doesn't drag the film down that much. Everything else is on top form, perhaps even better than the first film. While it's nice to have such an unlikely likable and resourceful protagonist in Gru, the series does seem to suffer from its lack of antagonist forces as the film glides through the narrative with ease. But then, this isn't supposed to be heavyweight stuff like Pixar.<br/><br/>6/10"
"kickbuttpotato","10","1","1","26 November 2013"," Absolute Minion fun the second time around.
","""Despicable Me 2"" succeeds as one of the best animation sequels of the year, bolstered with a great voice actor ensemble reprising the role of Steve Carrell as Gru, the uncanny daddy dangerous, and his little cute girls Margot –played by Miranda Cosgrove–, Edith –Dana Gaier–, and Agnes –by Elsie Fisher–. Of course, the Minions are back and even crazier and gibberish, it's an absolute howl.<br/><br/>The film offers vast improvement from its predecessor. It will always mold an impression to its general patronage for it's seldom they encounter such animation feature which is not from the hands of Disney- Pixar or Dreamworks. And now that the sequel has come out, Despicable Me 2 is even funnier and sure get your money's worth.<br/><br/>A top-secret headquarters called AVL, or the Anti-Villain League by Agent Lucy Wilde –voiced by Kristen Wiig – and the league director Silas Ramsbottom –voiced by Steve Coogan– hire Gru. The investigation leads to a mutation serum that make creatures go purple and berserk. So Gru and Lucy's job together is to locate the remaining serum.<br/><br/>Another character is Eduardo –voiced by Benjamin Bratt–, whom Gru suspects as the El-Macho. Whether he has the serum or not, he may still be recognizable enough to be villainy as Gru suggests. Benjamin Bratt as the El-Macho is unrecognizable at first because of his Mexican accent, and so is Gru's mad scientist assistant Dr. Nefario –played by Russell Brand– who's voice as a grumpy old man may seem odd but acceptable.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 works on its slacker humors involving Gru with his lanky stature and pointy nose and his spy gadgets. Aside from the Minions, the film made sure his jokey dialogues and the gibberish language of the Minions are sensible. Steve Carrell still has the impending voice-over as Gru. The irony of his tone in the character makes me laugh just as I did in the first film, and it still doesn't spoil my liking. <br/><br/>The new characters on board such as Kristen Wiig as Lucy gives an elusive improvement in Gru's anti-social but odd humor as a loner. Wiig is the perfect voice-over for the character and matches Gru to be the exact partner, better yet the perfect lovey-dovey. However, Ken Jeong is the odd one out in the mix. His character as the wig man Floyd is pretty thin unlike the other ones. I'm obliged that he were able to voice act in the film though.<br/><br/>Finally, the Minions are here to stay. They look adorable akin to the previous film with the same babbling offbeat and gibberish dialogue. There're too many too count, but I didn't care much as long as plenty of them keep the laughter piling up.<br/><br/>Kudos to production company Illumination Mac Guff (the company behind the VFX of the film), if they're planning for a Despicable 3, I don't see 'why not?' If this animation feature became of a franchise, looks like I will be counting Minions to laugh with. But as for now, I'm telling you that Despicable Me 2 is even funnier and affable to be one of the best animation films of the year."

"ajit2106","7","1","1","23 October 2013"," A fun ride_ not great but entertaining
","The first part was about Gru, a rather unsuccessful villain, who cultivates himself into a loving father in the course of the film. In the second part there are all those elements that made the first part such a good film. But now these elements are weighted differently. There is one rule: More Minions at any price. That means there are only a few allusions to other films (For example, the homage to Star Wars Episode 2), the story is less exciting and Gru is not that substantial, but the Minions get more space to unfold.<br/><br/>The story of Gru and his children is no longer as interesting and touching, not so strong too, but who bothers. Actually the story of Gru and his children was indeed told in the first part. Although this also means that the story of ""Despicable 2 ¨ is not as exciting, but this film was incredibly funny.<br/><br/>The best thing is that the minions work wonderfully as role models. This may be because that they are presented as minimalist as it could have been. All information has been conveyed by gestures and facial expressions. Simultaneously, the Minions are very easy knit and behave like children. This is always something going on, we forgive them every stupidity, and it includes these little creatures straight to his heart. ""Despicable Me 2 "" is considered a work of evolution , if you really want to give a correct term to the film, as it is a sort of next step in the first film, which was , however, already important issues such as parental responsibility and the problem of children orphans.<br/><br/>Themes like love, the desire to build a family and friendship are treated with a certain maturity, thanks to the valuable work of the writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio.<br/><br/>The graphics and animations are one of the strong elements of the film and it is a true pleasure for the eyes. Somehow even the music manages to carve out as a living in the movie.<br/><br/>In terms of the narrative, the film is beautiful and engaging, in some respects even exciting, great to spend an evening in total relaxation.<br/><br/>From the beginning until the final sequences are witnessing a great ""show"" that manages to entertain the paying public in an efficient manner , but this is still a feature of the new generation of cartoon in which the U.S. we are accustomed in recent years .<br/><br/>""Despicable Me 2"" is further proof that the U.S. animated family film works quite well , and it is an industry that still manages to dazzle the viewer with fantastic stories and lovable characters.<br/><br/>(7.4 / 10)"

The purple color for the evil minions are also good, but the yellow color suits better :) Very funny and enjoyable as the first one. The action is great. Doctor's bike is amazing.

","As unphased as I am by the imminent departure of Louie Walsh from the X Factor, he did coin a memorable phrase during his tenure there.. 'The Likability Factor'. And that's what this movie has... Despite the by-the-numbers plot, and sometimes questionable attempts at humour, the relationship between former bad guy Gru and his three (whisper it) adorable daughters is real and affecting, just like in the first one.<br/><br/>When a hardened cynic such as myself falls for the love between three adopted children and their new dad, you know it must be doing something right. Equally productive is the addition of a new love interest for Gru... A crazy redhead with a thing for gadgets and talking non-stop. Voiced by Kristen Wiig of Bridesmaids fame, she is a great addition to the franchise and you can tell her and you-know-who belong together.<br/><br/>But let's face it... ALL the marketing for the movie is based around those little one-eyed yellow guys called Minions. They're as dumb as posts, speak utter gibberish and kids love 'em. I found them all rather hit and miss, sometimes their antics were cute and hilarious, on other occasions they were a real pain in the... neck. But at my screening whenever they arrived, there was an audible coo from the assembled TTF ( Tiny Tot Federation) so what do I know? Let the small fry have their fun...<br/><br/>Overall, an impressive sequel that manages the impressive feat of being comparable to the original... But the question is, where do we go from here? The conclusion is pretty finite, but if this has made enough money... You can guarantee Hollywood will find someway of making a follow-up. After all, if there can be a sequel to Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, ANYTHING is possible... 7/10"

It is funniest movie I ever seem, the characters are impressive and the quality of special effects are stunning (special attention to the scene where the big rocket take them away of the castle, great perspective!!!) Probably, most of the people never noticed or don't pay attention, but how clever is that minions language!!! It is a mix of several terms of different languages which it is extremely well constructed and exceedingly funny. A person with knowledge/notions of 3 languages or more will have a great time trying to understand what the minions are talking. It gives authenticity to the movie and it is a great effort of the team responsible for the text in the movie to make it even more enjoyable, even if apparently people will never understand what they say.<br/><br/>Well done and an amazing job!!!"

If they made an entire movie out of nothing but minions I would be on cloud 9, but the makers of the entire Despicable me series are pure geniuses when it comes to both comedy and timing.

Though something was missing... and I can't even figure out what is it. Maybe it is the lack of villains. I mean, compared to the 1st one, the villain took most of the part of the movie. But on this one, only a little about it. But the way the minions delivers their actions, I can totally say that this is a good movie.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","7 July 2013"," It sets out to be just a whacky comedy, and on that it succeeds.
","It might be reasonable to approach ""Despicable Me 2"" with a sense of trepidation. The original 2010 film was a sort-of enjoyable animated romp that wasn't exactly screaming for a sequel. That film, about the misadventures of a supervillain named Gru whose attempts to steal the moon were thwarted when he adopted three adorable orphan girls, was a cute but admittedly lackluster animated comedy. The sequel is a nice surprise. It's better. It opens up the idea and introduces a few new characters who give this (now) series a much-needed boost.<br/><br/>This time Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) has given up his life of evil deeds (thereby negating the title) and opened his own business (he makes jams and jellies). He's also a full-time dad. As the movie opens, he's suffering two hardships that every parent must eventually endure: First, the fairy princess that he hired won't show up for the kid's birthday party. Second, the oldest girl is beginning to take a healthy interest in boys.<br/><br/>*** (of four) Gru's kids, it can be happily reported, are only a sideline in this sequel. The main plot involves Gru being called upon by the Anti-Villain League to help to figure out why an Arctic Research Station was pulled off its foundation and went missing. Gru thinks that the villain might be the nefarious El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt), a Mexican villain who is so tough that he once leapt out of the back of a plane while riding a shark strapped with dynamite. The purpose behind this has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>The plot is a lot of fun mainly because the writers have decided this time around to stick heavily to the gags and pull back on the emotional stuff. They've also given a lot room in the plot Gru's little yellow minions, whose babbling speech and funny dress-ups have become so popular that they are getting their own origin story called ""Minions"" next Christmas. <br/><br/>The minions are cute, but the most joyous element to ""Despicable Me 2"" is the presence of AVL agent Lucy Wilde, a high-energy, skinny redhead whose bright personality gives this movie its legs. Voiced by Kristen Wiig and looking a little big like Carol Burnett, Lucy is so much fun, she could have a movie of her own. Yes, a romance develops between she and Gru, but it there isn't a predictable straight-line to get there.<br/><br/>The movie has individual moments that not just amusing, but very funny and inventive. The best is a date that Gru is force on with a dimwitted neighbor. What comes of the date won't be spoiled here, sufficed to stay it is the stuff of great slapstick.<br/><br/>The sequel works better than the original simply because the energy level has been cranked up. Animated comedies these days lose their comic fortitude by getting too sappy and dreary. This has been the downfall of ""Megamind,"" ""ParaNorman,"" and the Ice Age sequels; all of which got so emotional that they forgot the laughs. ""Despicable Me 2"" never loses its comic zeal. Even the love story has a certain momentum. Let's put it this way: A meet-cute here involves Lucy trying to stuff an unconscious Gru into her trunk. This is funny stuff."

The little kids are screen candies, very funny and cutes. It is not a Shrek 2 but for sure is a terrific second part for a surprising franchise. For sure deserves a sequel."

","Like many sequels, this one falls short of the original. The first movie is set apart by its originality, and the transformation of the arch-villain Gru into a soft-hearted father.<br/><br/>This time around, Gru and the kids are already settled, and he's retired from villlainy. The only thing to do is bring him out of ""retirement"" to do battle with yet another villain, who wants to take over the world (don't they all?).<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, minions abound, providing comic relief (in a comedy).<br/><br/>But most of the action is only a little more than ordinary. Some sight gags work well, but not enough to make this sequel stand out. some scenes just run too long - the Cinco de Mayo party, for one.<br/><br/>There's a possibility of a third movie, and with a partner for Gru, the stage is set for something completely different. But I'll wait and see."
"Joemalone-249-244242","6","6","16","23 June 2013"," The formula didn't really work this time!
","As I write this Despicable Me 2 sits with a score of 8.1 on IMDb, an unnaturally high score in my opinion due to the 'recency effect' surrounding the hype and excitement surrounding its release. I saw the first screening today in my local cinema and took the opportunity to see it in 3D. I loved the first movie, it was an amazing movie with a big heart that worked both for kids and adults alike. I think the makers sat and made a list of all the things people liked from the first movie and the list probably looked something like this...<br/><br/>1. Minions- lets have more minions. 2. Agnes- more shouting, he's so fluffy, or words to that effect. 3. Gru's stubborn resistance to opening up his heart. Already for the kids so how do we fit that part of the formula in? 4. Gru's moment of resolve when nothing can stop him.<br/><br/>The problem as with many animated movies is that the storyline was incredibly weak, yes all those things listed were cute but the first movies greatness came off the back of a great storyline. The storyline in this movie was so thin that I found myself having spells of 10 minutes or so throughout the film where I was completely disengaged. Lets also not forget how great the soundtrack was for the first movie and there was no real attempt to better or even match that, in fact they used much of the same soundtrack from Pharrell Williams. Sure there were occasional nice moments throughout because the characters are great but I'm disappointed that they didn't continue the franchise with a equally strong storyline. I predict that the score for DM2 will level off to about 6.5 and on the strength of this movie I'll happily watch DM3 but I won't be rushing to the cinema to see it. As I was leaving I caught a guy saying that the best thing about the movie was the 3D bubbles that came out the screen during the credits. I suspect the gimmicks will be remembered long after the plot which was instantly forgettable."

","5.4 of 10 vs. 8.25 for the first. Sadly, like the spy hero gadget-tech films it's intended to satirize, this is little more than a spy gadget film. Unlike the first, this gets tiresome and even boring. They really seem to be forcing ideas and plot developments. It's still relatively entertaining, but nowhere near the story depth and inventiveness of the first.<br/><br/>Original and sequel both borrow a lot from other cartoons in terms of the look and characters, so the story is the key to making it into something more than a bunch of cartoon images and quirky sounds/images. Quirkiness alone can work for up to a half hour, but definitely not beyond 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Stick with the first or the more recent Wreck It Ralph (2012) if you're feeling like a villain. As fun as genetically modified minions might seem, they aren't worthy of a theater trip."

","Summary: Fun movie for kids. For movie goers, just boring !<br/><br/>It is one of the most anticipated movie of the year. First part was a huge success with Gru, Minions & Girls. So this movie was a must watch for me. <br/><br/>It is obvious that you expect a lot from the movie. Let me tell you, if you haven't seen first part go and watch the movie though you won't get the references about who is who. But it's OK. You will like it.<br/><br/>For those who have watched first part, guys don't watch in theaters. Yes, I am saying truth. It is not the worst movie. It will be good entertaining 90 mins. but the excitement with which you will try to see, you will get bored. For children it is OK, they don't care about story, direction. For them it's absolute fun.<br/><br/>Here are my thought about the movie.<br/><br/>Why Watch: Fun of minions - First part revolved mostly around Gru with some short but best minions fun. This time story is WITH the Gru but with breaks of funny minions (which is not always) it's like watching a boring movie with really good commercials.Same here, Gru's story with some snippets of minions shorts. Agnes - Agnes here got some focus due to her funny cuteness. Other part - This is the actual story. which is funny at times but boring as well. It doesn't take you to the peak of fun but there are ups and downs.<br/><br/>Why not: Boring story. This movie doesn't have the soul. Direction: Story doesn't focus on the story. Instead takes some minions shorts & other funny shorts. It's just not continuous.<br/><br/>Overall score: 5/10"

Unfortunately the world is not ready to forget him, he's hired by the Anti Villain League to investigate the disappearance of an arctic lab. Together with Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) on the investigation trail it looks likely that El Macho is behind the crime - and he's supposed to be dead. Evidently he's not dead and to make matter's worse, El Macho's son is taking a fancy to Gru's eldest adopted daughter, Margo.

This is not the case; the film stands up on its own merit and is amusing for all the family. Given the choice I prefer the first film because it gave us something fairly new in its characters, plot and set-up. However this is by no means a failure of a film just because it's got familiar characters in it, there has been growth and development - which is more than some blockbuster films have. It's colourful and creative, beautiful to look at, has action and humour in the right places too.

","Again, 'Despicable Me 2 (2013)' is a very passive experience that fails to engage on almost any level. This time, though, there's this odd, almost meta-textual edge which has the feature fully embrace its animated format to the point where characters will just break-out into dance, or even song at some points, while strangely leering at the camera. The plasticity has also been at least doubled so that people will flail about all over the shop and take ludicrous amounts of bodily-harm without so much as a scratch. All this adds up to this bizarre combination that makes it feel much more like a self-aware cartoon than a proper computer-generated film. What doesn't help its credibility either, is that the central character's arc has been entirely excised and almost all development gutted from the feature, leading to a series of skits featuring nothing but caricatures in slap-stick situations desperate to make small children chuckle. The movie skews very young throughout, with only one or two jokes that made me laugh, and yet it still passes the time as adequately as the first even though it isn't as competent in terms of its story. Its a different beast, one that isn't as mature or even quite as competent, but it is still just as decent because it is almost exactly as passive an experience. 5/10"

","If you've been reading my reviews like a good follower, you'll know I'm not a fan of Illumination studios. A mass marketing animation group who clearly milked the first successful film they created. And here we are with its sequel. Gru is recruited by the 'Anti Villain League' to stop an evil villain from unleashing a serum that turns anything into a weird monster-like purple maniac. Meanwhile, his adopted girls try to play matchmaker and find him a girlfriend. A consistent sequel is one would ask for, and fortunately we received it. Returning cast members, directors and script writers resulted in a perfectly good animation that all the family can enjoy. Well...somewhat enjoy. This main plot is unfocussed in comparison to the first instalment, trying to balance a ""save the world"" situation with kindling a romance did not always work effectively. The two plots occasionally blended but the main plot seemed to be the love story as opposed to the former which ultimately left me underwhelmed. The villain was memorable atleast albeit his world domination plan was underdeveloped. Steve Carrell and the returning voice actors clearly had fun, and I consistently smile when he says ""girls""...it's more like ""guuurlz!"". Kristen Wiig was a welcomed newcomer and a definite highlight to this sequel. The animation was fluid, vibrant and always colourful. At times, the film felt like a music video for all of Pharrell Williams' songs, and if I have to hear 'Happy' one more time I will shove a minion up Illumination's...*cough* you get the idea. The minions provide slapstick humour aimed more towards the younger viewers, they are still annoying as ever hoisting fart guns and singing songs incomprehensibly but what can you do...just go with it. Liked the countless film references, a minion screaming and pointing reminiscent of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' did make me smile. A fun light watch that is no where near as good as the first."
"Animated_Antic","9","0","0","20 February 2018"," A very funny and charming sequel.
","Some sequels don't have the charm that their predecessors had. If anything, most of them fall apart and mostly lead to a sequel that really don't make any impact to the story as well as not evolving its characters and or story. Luckily, ""Despicable Me 2"" is not one of those sequels. This is a film that carries the same charm and humor the first film had back in 2010, but gives us bigger laughs, funny new characters and also evolves the older characters which is something a good sequel should do. Want to know why it works? Well, here's a little brief synopsis which I'll try not to spoil as the trailers weren't exactly that revealing.<br/><br/>Some time after the first film, Gru (Steve Carell) has been living a new happy life after he gave up being a super villain and instead became a father to Margo, Edith and Agnes (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher). Although he is a great father, he has been unsuccessful to do anything new as he even attempts to create new jams that leads to some humorous moments. Then he is recruited by agents, and partnered with one named Lucy (Kristen Wiig), who work for a secret organization known as the Anti-Villain League, an agency that tries to hunt down and eliminate top super villains. Hoping for something to do to impress the girls, Gru accepts the offer and is put on a big case involving a toxic serum while not realizing that his Minions are mysteriously vanishing as part of a master villains plan. That's all I'm going to give you guys because I think you need to see the film to figure out where it will go.<br/><br/>The thing that works best about this movie is that it continues the story and not repeats it. It also does the same to the joke which Illumination gives us newer and fresher content and not the humorous moments of the first movie. Trust me when I say that some of the scenes are so hilarious that I was laughing so hard, I sometimes had to constantly catch my breath. Not only are the jokes made better, but the characters are also improved as well, particularly Gru. The reason why is because he fully stands by his word and saying he won't return to evil and actually does certain scenes that are different from the first movie notably scenes involving Margo and a boy she has a crush on. The new characters are also a lot of fun as well. Lucy might be my favorite character in the movie. I really liked the funny and quirky personality she had which was brilliant brought to life thanks to Kristen Wiig's fantastic performance. However, one thing I'm pretty pleased at with the film is actually not in the film itself, but rather the marketing. It was very clever by not showing the villain and keeping certain story elements to a minimum which allowed us to guess where the story would be going. I was very pleased by this desision. As far as problems go, I could have used a little more screen time with Agnes and Edith. Although both characters got some laughs and had a considerable amount of screen time, I didn't think they got enough.<br/><br/>""Despicable Me 2"" is easily one of the funniest animated sequels I've seen in a while. It steps up what made the first film great while also adding some new elements that make it stand out as a good sequel. I can easily say that this was a great sequel I've been waiting for and I hope I can get more in the future."

This assignment will prove to be quite a challenge for him as his new partner Lucy isn't the ordinary kind of girl anyone might expect.<br/><br/>I have to say (and I honestly didn't expect this) that this sequel is actually better than the original. The way it introduces its story and the way the minions are used for comedy is really impressing. Gru's change of attitude is even more dramatic while sudden turn-overs keep the suspense up and running. Although it manages to be a little dramatic which combined with some romance give it a special feel, it isn't as profound as other titles in its category.<br/><br/>But never mind that, its true Pièce de résistance is actually its comedy. The way all aspects are put together supplied with a whole bunch of minions create the most pure comedy I've seen in an animation.

","As this sequel opens an unknown villain steals a polar research station for reasons that become clear later. Meanwhile Gru, who has left the supervillain business and is now attempting to make an honest living making jam, is kidnapped by Lucy, an agent of the Anti-Villain League (AVL). It turns out that the AVL believe the best way to catch a supervillain is to use a former supervillain. It is explained to Gru that the research station had been working on a mutating virus that turns harmless creatures into ferocious killing machines. The virus has been traced to a shopping mall so Gru and Lucy are to open a shop there to undercover who is behind the crime. He suspects Eduardo, the owner of the Mexican restaurant who looks remarkably like El Macho, a villain who had apparently died some years ago he suspects him even more when his son starts to show an interest in Gru's oldest daughter. AVL believes somebody else is involved though. Eventually the identity of the villain is revealed and many of the minions are captured and mutated into purple creatures! If all this wasn't enough one of Gru's neighbours is trying to set him up with a date but over the course of the film he develops feelings for Lucy.<br/><br/>After the success of the first 'Despicable Me' film a sequel was inevitable; thankfully this one was a lot of fun too. The story was entertaining with some decent twists however it is the funny moments that make the film such a joy. The minions are as funny as ever; they may be childish but that is what is so funny about them. Sadly the three girls Gru adopted in the previous film have a smaller role this time; mostly involving the subplot about finding a girlfriend for Gru and the eldest's involvement with Eduardo's son. The romance between Gru and Lucy won't surprise anybody but it provides some good laughs especially when she helps Gru get rid of an unwanted date. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first film; I hope the third film proves to be as good."

","Picking up right where the original left off, evil genius Gru has seen the error of his ways and transitioned into life as the single, adoptive dad of three young girls. The sudden reform has left everyone (an army of minions, a long-time collaborator and Gru himself) a bit stir-crazy, so he seeks new thrills as a turncoat, tracking and identifying his former rivals for a stuffy government agency. Illumination has leveled-up their equipment since the first film, which makes for a far more polished visual product, but the story is less lively and fuzzy than its surprising predecessor. Of course the minions are everywhere, getting the star treatment before their inevitable spin off, but the girls are relegated to watery secondary story lines and there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. Gru's job with the g-men, for instance, seems like a ready-made setup for introducing all sorts of wacky new characters and enlarging the world, but instead it merely hones in on a single new villain and ventures no further. The introduction of a love interest is hesitant, overly convenient, and never really clicks. There's plenty of fun stuff for younger audiences, of course, and some of the sight gags are clever, but most parents will find themselves daydreaming through the bulk of this one."

","This film is the more than expected sequel to ""Despicable Me"", which is naturally motivated by its huge box office success. The script revolves around a theft of a chemical formula that turns the most harmless creatures into monsters. The central characters of the first film are back, but the entire script is a poor excuse to make a sequel and revolves around the Minions, clearly the stars of the film, almost obscuring the main character. It's worth watching this movie just because of them. It was a conscious bet of the production team, given the explosive popularity reached by these little yellow creatures similar to cheese snacks. It worked. He managed to make the film a success. But the quality of the movie lost with that.<br/><br/>The plot also plays with romance involving Gru or his eldest daughter. This is a more interesting and appealing subplot but its not enough to make the film truly interesting. This is an adventure movie, not a romantic story like ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or others. And the truth is that this film has a lot of funny, it's very romantic but it has little adventure and action, and the public that hoped for it later felt disappointed in their expectations.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad. But it's also not as great as the first movie was. The first movie was a good story, with good characters, an excellent comic vein and good animation. This movie had all of this except the good story, which should be the center of everything else. It's still funny, but that is not enough to make it a great movie."

","In 2010, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment brought us the critically-acclaimed animated comedy, Despicable Me. I originally was not a fan of it, but in anticipation of number two, I went ahead and saw it on DVD. While far from my favorite animated movie of all-time (I think you already know which two are my favorites), I really enjoyed it and there were some parts in the movie where I actually chuckled and laughed. As they say in the trailer for this long-awaited sequel, ""Guess who's back?"" Despicable Me 2 re-introduces us to Gru (again played by Steve Carell) as he takes care of his three kids - Edith, Margo, and Agnes. One day, Gru is recruited by secret agent Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig, who also lent her voice to the original movie) - and yes, even ""lipstick-tased"" - to join the Anti-Villain League as a new villain resurfaces. Eduardo, the owner of a Mexican restaurant (voiced by Benjamin Bratt from ""Law & Order""), has developed a serum that turns the minions into purple ""basically-anything"" eaters. Before Gru is ""kidnapped"" by the A.V.L., he finds out Agnes desperately wants a real mother along with Gru as dad. And also, Dr. Nefario (Gru's right-hand scientist, played by Russell Brand) is ""retiring"" in order to find a more suitable job for himself, where he can ""do evil again"", only to come out of retirement and help Gru defeat evil in a surprising, yet also entertaining, fashion.<br/><br/>Gru notices Eduardo is actually a famed masked thief named El Macho, who, 20 years earlier, faked his own death by doing a ""Dr. Strangelove"" kind of stunt - riding a shark into a live volcano with dynamite strapped to himself. Gru's grudge against Eduardo grows even bigger when Margo - one of Gru's three kids - falls head-over-heels with a young boy named Antonio (voiced by Moises Arias), who just happens to be Eduardo's son. This subplot actually adds to the hilarity of the whole movie, in my opinion. And at the same time that happens, Gru himself falls for Lucy! (Who would've thought?) Can Gru and Lucy work together to stop El Macho from taking over the world with his evil minions - who are actually Gru's minions after the dose of the serum - and save the day? After the 2010 original, I had pretty high expectations for number two, and the guys at Universal nailed the comedy aspect of the movie - IN SPADES! Like the original, it takes a while, but as the movie progressed, the jokes got funnier and funnier, and I laughed harder and harder. I was just basically laughing out loud at the very end! Gru is NOT the only big star of this hilarious sequel. We get more screen time for all the supporting characters, and of course, we can't forget about the minions! Those little guys ""bring it"" with the comedy, and they're slightly funnier than in the original! While still far from an animated classic, Despicable Me is getting more and more popular, and the minions themselves have all become iconic characters - so much so, that we got a Minions spin off this past summer! Look out for a long - yet also hilarious - 3D gag during the end credits that sets up that said spin off.<br/><br/>Again, not nearly my favorite animated movie of all-time, but the comedy is off-the-charts in this long-anticipated sequel. Go ahead and see this over-the-top and entertaining animated adventure with your family!"

","In terms of box office, it may be difficult for 'Despicable Me 2′ to beat its predecessor, which made over $543 million just three years ago. Nevertheless, the directors and writers are back again with Steve Carrell as the wacky former criminal mastermind Gru, who we last saw stealing the moon. How can one top that? This fun sequel may lack the heart and soul of the first film, but it's still highly entertaining for both kids and adults with its amazing animated visuals, laughs, great voice cast and those lovable Minions.<br/><br/>A small amount of time has passed since the last movie. We see Gru happily living his new life, free of any villainous activity. Sure, he still has his weapons, but he uses them more to get rid of annoying neighbors who constantly want to set him up with their single girlfriends. Gru still takes care of his three adopted daughters: Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). In the middle of a BBQ birthday party for Agnes, he's kidnapped by the Anti-Villain League to help find a new dastardly criminal who has stolen a top-secret research lab, by way of a giant flying magnet.<br/><br/>Gru gets paired with the incredible new AVL recruit Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). They're told to set up an undercover operation at a frilly cupcake shop in a fancy mall. Their Intel says that the villain is also undercover in the mall. The two will have to find out who the mystery man is before the world meets its impending doom. Gru quickly suspects the boisterous Eduardo Perez (Benjamin Bratt), owner of a wild Mexican restaurant and a dead ringer for the evil villain El Macho, who was thought to have died a long time ago when riding a shark with tons of explosives into an active volcano. (Take note, Syfy Network!)<br/><br/>These types of situations make the new installment a bit more bonkers than the first movie, but the creative team makes it work, even if this one seems to be more about the action and adventure than telling a story. It's nice to see Gru's daughters help him out in a side-story about dating. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments when Gru goes on a blind date. And of course the Minions are back in full force.<br/><br/>Carrell and Wiig do stellar jobs lending their voices to make these characters truly come alive, but the real star of the show is Benjamin Bratt as El Macho. Al Pacino was once attached to play this part, but dropped out for creative differences. I'm so glad this happened, as Bratt just owns the voice role. Russell Brand returns as Dr. Nefario, and Steve Coogan and Ken Jeong have minor but hilarious parts as well.<br/><br/>'Despicable Me 2′ is quite enjoyable, despite lacking the emotional pull the first film had. It's packed with laughs, terrific visuals and great voice work. The Minions are amped up to 11 this time around and perform a few musical numbers, which will certainly make you laugh out loud. Don't forget to stay through the credits, as our little yellow Minions hold auditions."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","27 July 2015"," Good watch, but inferior to the first
","""Despicable Me 2"" came out three years after the first film (and is maybe five minutes longer) and this may have been exactly the right time frame as this film was a gigantic box office success, even a much bigger hit than the already pretty successful original. And also in terms of awards, this one got more recognition. Just like the first, it was nominated at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes for Best Animated Feature, but also got in at the Oscars this time. Twice actually because Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"" became the possibly biggest hit of 2013. Unfortunately, in terms of the story, it did not reach the heights of the first film. The reason is very simple. The female character in here did not add as much to the movie as the three girls did in the first film and she also takes away quite a bit of their screen time. Coffin and Renaud really took the safe path in this film and repeated several aspects that made the first film such a success. One example would be that there is one major change in Gru's life brought by new human characters (or only one this time). That character gets abducted by the villain again in the end and Gru has to save her. A crucial difference here is that we have no idea until minute 70 really who the main antagonist is this time. Still, there is a father-son connection again just like in the original as well in terms of the villain, only that the father is the really bad guy this time. I have to say the villain was one of the pros this time, in my opinion superior to Vector.<br/><br/>The voice actors in crucial roles are the same again as in the first. Carell returns for the lead role and the three child actors are the same too (well, I should maybe say teenage actors). Steve Coogan joins the cast and so does Benjamin Bratt. Kristen Wiig is back as well and she voices a different, much more important character this time. Oh yeah and how could I forget about the Minions. They are great fun as always and the ""evil minion"" plot added a lot to the story, Nefario's resignation not so much really. In general, I liked this film, but it was missing the heart that the first delivered so nicely with the three orphans. I am generally not too big on the character of Lucy in this one here. All in all, I guess I would recommend it and I am curious about the new ""Minions"" film that I am going to watch soon. I hope the downward spiral does not continue with that one."
"trooper5783","5","0","0","25 July 2015"," Not as funny as the other two movies in the franchise, but alright.
","I highly enjoyed Despicable Me and the recent spin-off with the Minions, but I have mixed feelings about DM2. Granted, the animation has greatly improved since the first DM and some of the jokes are REALLY funny(the Minions at some parts, mostly Agnes), but there are some characters that were obnoxious and/or underdeveloped(Lucy, Margo, Edith) and even some of the humor is simplistic and childish(fart noises, pratfalls). What sucks is that in the other two DM movies in the franchise, the kid factor was very well realised and one of the many things that made them entertaining. But here, there is just way too much of it and it's often in your face. Other than a handful of hysterical gags and some detailed animation, DM2 is just an OK movie that doesn't hit the mark with me the way it did with DM and Minions. I did like the 3D conversion and the minion knight fight gag(I laughed so hard I cried on that one), as well as Agnes being cute and funny along with the Minions sometimes, but it's an overrated film that is strictly for the kids. Watch the first DM or go see Minions 3D,both movies I thought were great animated comedies and should be recognized more than this average film."
"siratlas1968","8","0","0","20 July 2015"," A defense of Al Pacino
","Looks like that this animated full-length film by Illumination Entertainment became successful thanks to Al Pacino's ""creative differences"". On the other hand, the voice of Eduardo/El Macho sounds like an animated character from a Latin American cartoon and definitely not the real Al Pacino voice I expected for a while. Actually, I supported him, but someone else became the voice of Eduardo/El Macho. Was Al Pacino as the voice of Eduardo/El Macho a deception from Illumination Entertainment? Or it was just a lie? I have no idea, but any attempt to make an animated or a video game character with Al Pacino's voice failed. Anyway, I support Al Pacino's ambitions as a voice actor."

","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Frozen. There will be spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>This film more or less picks up where the first one left off (though you can watch it even if you haven't seen the first one). Gru is no longer a super villain, instead opting to raise the three girls (Margo, Edith and Agnes) he's adopted and going into business making jelly and not being all that successful.<br/><br/>His assistant, Dr. Nefario, takes another job, preferring the old evil ways to the new ones. Gru is recruited by Lucy Wild, an agent for the good guys, the Anti-Villain League, who brings him in after tasing him (""lipstick taser!"") and essentially kidnapping him. Gru turns them down at first and then decides to accept.<br/><br/>Gru finds that he and Lucy have been teamed up undercover at the mall, running an operation out of a cupcake shop (Lucy has more and cooler toys than James Bond). They meet two suspects, one man Gru is convinced is one-time super villain El Macho and one named Floyd Eagle-san. Gru and Lucy break into El Macho's Mexican restaurant and run afoul of Macho's chicken security guard, Lucy ultimately foiling the bird and the two making their escape.<br/><br/>Lucy and Gru hit it off after she rescues Gru from his blind date from hell and it sets up a beautiful sequence utilizing the song ""Happy"", showing Gru as just that-happy, because things are going so well with Lucy. But events intervene.<br/><br/>Eventually, the AVL finds evidence that Floyd is who they're seeking and they shut down the operation, with plans to drop Gru as an agent and send Lucy to Australia. So Gru deflates, starts moping around and winds up at the Cinco de Mayo celebration at El Macho's restaurant because Margo is infatuated with Macho's son Antonio. Gru learns that he's right, this is El Macho and he's the super villain AVL was looking for. Dr. Nefario is working for El Macho now and has taken (Minion-napped?) a huge number of Gru's Minions (who are all over this film) as part of his scheme, which I won't spoil here.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Gru winds up a hero by derailing El Macho's plans. The resolution of the subplot with Lucy is perfect and there's room for a Despicable Me 3 (not to mention a financial incentive, given the success of the first two films and the most recent prequel's success at this writing, Minions, a film featuring the Minions).<br/><br/>This film is available on Blu Ray and DVD and is worth watching.

","Hilarious as hell thanks to total Minion madness, but also completely hollow at its core due to the absence of the very ingredient that made its predecessor an unexpected success of its year, Despicable Me 2 is an unabashedly funny ride when the screen is occupied by the little yellow henchmen but apart from that, everything about this sequel is a step down.<br/><br/>The follow-up to Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2 continues the journey of Gru as the ex- supervillain finds himself adjusting to a normal family life with his three daughters & is also attempting an honest living in the jam business. But when he is recruited by the Anti-Villain League for assistance in their latest investigation, his prime suspect turns out to be a legendary supervillain, presumed dead long ago.<br/><br/>Co-directed by Pierre Coffin & Chris Renault, Despicable Me 2 features an action-packed plot, more characters & major upgrades in minions screen time but it still ends up finishing as an inferior sequel for the charm, freshness & heart of the original is sorely missing. Even its attempt at humour feels forced at times, the plot follows a generic route & the new voice cast don't bring any sort of novelty to their characters either.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are pretty much the same as the original. Cinematography adds more colours to its palette, Editing could've used a little more trimming for there are scenes that don't contribute to its story at all, background score has the feel of the original, and the 3D animation also offers a slight improvement over its predecessor. But its writers are always trying to conceal its paper-thin plot by sugarcoating it with more minion segments.<br/><br/>It's in the moments without the minions where the film's shortcomings are clearly exposed. Gru's arc is demoted from a cool supervillain to a boring hero although Steve Carell does chip in with another impressive work. However Gru's three daughters are sidelined for the most part. The minions once again steal the show effortlessly with their slapstick antics & hilarious impressions and it's only because of them that the film isn't a chore to sit through.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Despicable Me 2 is a passable sequel to Despicable Me that may lack the heartfelt emotions of its predecessor but makes up for it with its roller-coaster minions madness. A delightful, light-hearted & crazy fun ride for viewers of all ages, this follow-up chapter will manage to leave most families satisfied but for those who were looking forward to something more than the usual minion mischief are bound to leave with a slight feeling of incompleteness."

","Despicable Me 2 (2013): Dir: Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud / Voices: Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Miranda Cosgrove, Russell Brand: Sequel to the entertaining and popular 2010 animation. Ex-evil mastermind Gru settles down with his several adopted children until he is tasered by a female agent and abducted. Apparently he is set up on a mission to find a villain who has set up shop in a shopping mall. Typical setup is actually well written with a number of neat twists. Steve Carell returns to voice Gru, who is celebrating a birthday party for one of his children in the film's opening. He knows the rules of villainy when his predictions at the mall turn out to be correct. Kristen Wigg voices his new partner Lucy, who is a resourceful agent and eventually becomes Gru's romantic interest. Benjamin Bratt plays an Italian restaurant owner named Eduardo AKA El Macho whom Gru views as a suspect. Miranda Cosgrove voices Gru's oldest daughter whom begins seeing Eduardo's son and Gru resents this. Russell Brand voices Gru's wheelchair bound scientist who resents that Gru is now making jellies and jams as oppose to resorting to his former villainy ways. He leaves Gru's residents and resurfaces later to realize where his value truly belongs. Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud make what appears to be a basic sequel but at least the screenwriter has fun with details such as Gru's yellow minions being kidnapped and transformed for the worst. If families enjoyed the first film then they will likely enjoy this sequel as well. Like many sequels, this film avoids being despicable. Score: 7 / 10"

","This is a tough one to rate and review. On the one hand, the rendering and quality of the CGI is up to the highest standards (animated films seem to be getting more beautiful with each year that passes); the minions provide the core comedy of the film, being cute and lovable idiots who at heart are really just immoral, child-like agents of chaos; and there are plenty of nods to sci-fi and horror that I found littered about the film.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, it seems tired. It doesn't feel like it's added anything new to animated films. Gone are the days of The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, where our heroes aren't complete and utter idiots, but intelligent beings with flaws and emotions we can all connect with.<br/><br/>Although the minions are fun, I found this film to be another addition to the ""Let's Dumb Down the Human Race and Little Kids with Silly Idiotic Secretively Violent Characters"" sub-genre of the animated film industry, and the film industry at large. Villains and stupidity have become all the rage.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 was on my watch list, and I'm glad I gave it a whirl, but I'm hoping one day we get an animated film that brings the same emotional impact the classics used to bring to the table instead of the increasing Hollywood addiction to making stupidity and violence fun by hiding it within seemingly harmless characters in kids movies."

","Compared with Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2 is boring and I could predict its story line. The same as the first movie, Gru was a good father and got along well with his children. Lucy is a new character and there is no doubt that she will be a great mother in the future. Agnes was a very lovely small girl that she knew Gru pretended to be a princess in her birthday party but did not tell other kids. She wanted a mother like normal children. As for Margo, she gradually grew to be a teenager and was rebellious. She played with her phone in bed and ignored Gru's warning. Margo fell in love with a boy, which enraged Gru. The two girls' personalities in this movie are clearer. Although the story is boring, some scenes in Despicable Me 2 are really funny. El Macho's head was triangular and he wore a red mask on his head. The idea about becoming a villain is profoundly ridiculous but it seems in the movie everyone thought that becoming a villain was a big thing, which they were proud of. And the technology in the movie was so advanced that many people owned strange vehicles that could drive, fly and sail, and the mutagen made creatures crazy. There are so many interesting things in Despicable Me 2."
"filmfanperspective","5","0","0","5 May 2015"," Occasionally funny, but hyper and unnecessary
","Every once in a while, a movie made for children will surprise me, either because I'm moved by the emotional richness of the script, or something visually astounds me. The original ""Despicable Me"" wasn't entirely either of those things, it just made me laugh. OK, so the scene in the original centered around the three girls and the finger puppet kittens was heartwarming, but not in the same way that Disney or even DreamWorks does 'schmaltz'. It's fair to say that the sequel has even less heart, and more hyperactivity than the first.<br/><br/>The story centers around Gru, the former supervillain turned 'legitimate business man and single dad, who gets pulled back into the mix by the 'AVL' (Anti-Villain League). They need him to use his vast knowledge of nefarious ways to pinpoint a new villain that's using a 'serum' that turns things into purple-hued monsters once injected. He's partnered with Lucy (Kristen Wiig), an intense AVL agent who (mild spoiler alert) might just be quirky enough to accept Gru for who he is! Cue the awkward 'getting to know you' moments between the two, the hints from the three adopted girls about getting their dad out on the dating scene, and weave it with the search for the supervillain behind the purple serum, and minions doing their thing, which includes fart guns, singing 90s R&B ballads in minion-speak, and occasionally smacking each other. The villain is fine, and occasionally funny while playing up the cultural stereotypes. <br/><br/>Getting back to hyperactivity on-screen, I know that 'kids these days' possess tiny attention spans, enjoy 'shiny' things, and opt for fart jokes or colliding minions to genuine humor, but I've reached my limit. The octogenarian part of my conscience tells me the sugar-induced, ping-pong style of animation lately exceeds acceptable levels, to the point of distraction, and ultimately, boredom. Lately, my child doesn't remember the personalities of most animated characters, or the story arcs, but reminiscing about fart noises and minion speak is easy. It's possible that because he's a boy, those types of silly things are top of mind. I know that ""Despicable Me 2″ isn't around to do anything other than make money, and it has already succeeded greatly in doing that, but I don't know exactly what it accomplishes other than existing as a bloated blooper reel. The creator, Chris Meledandri, has made a name for himself creating beautiful animation that farts, dances, and plays nostalgic or trendy music to get our attention, in an attempt to steal some thunder from the Disney/Pixar machine. The minions sure are initially funny- the first few hundred times they have a slap fight. After that the slapstick humor turns into tired humor. Then they struggle to make someone laugh, then throw in some hyperactive moments. There's nothing truly original here. It's the same idea as ""Three Guys and a Little Lady"" with the math switched around, mixed with some moments reminiscent of ""The Incredibles"", and enough new faces to sell more merchandise at Universal Studios.<br/><br/>My last thought- the filmmakers created this universe, but appear to have only a smattering of villains, and no 'heroes'? That's depressing; I figured at this point we'd hear about the 'Superman' of this particular world. If this individual doesn't exist, then how do they define who the villains are? How does the Anti-Villain League operate- is it like MI-6, with Double O agents, or do they call on individuals with extreme intelligence and engineering skills to combat the evil people? Maybe I'm just too caught up in traditional definitions of good versus evil and worthwhile animation and blah. Maybe I'm thinking too much about it (likely). Either way, just like ""Monsters University"", ""Despicable Me 2″ is unnecessary, feels incomplete, but isn't terrible."

He is hired by some vague super secret organization to track down another super villain and has secret agent Cindy to tag along. I am absolutely *in love* with Cindy (played by Kristen Wiig). She has the right amount of professionalism and competence mixed with humor and<br/><br/>an off-the-wall enthusiastic personality. She plays along with the weirdness because she herself supplies a lot of it. Usually I'm hesitant to accept a female co-lead after becoming so used to a male lead but the characters played off each other and enjoyed the camaraderie they shared throughout their adventure, which I did so as well.<br/><br/>I will say the second act is a *little* weaker and less memorable, but it makes up for it with a over-the-top sing-along of famous songs in ""Minionese"" and the overall satisfying happy ending.

","I love this movie. It's better than the first one. <br/><br/>Once again, Gru is our main character, other than the minions, of course. He gets recruited by the Anti Villain League, to help stop a villain. This time, he must use his knowledge of evilness to find the bad guys, whilst raising his three adopted daughters. The minions are of course my favorite part in the movie. They get more adorable with each word. And the fact that they have evil purple minions in this movie, just makes it better.

","Despicable Me 2, the sequel to the 2010 smash hit, is an entertaining film and quite funny at times. It's not as good as the first film as it lacks the creative dialog the first film possessed. That being said, the Minions were funny and adorable as usual, the animation was crisp, the characters were worth getting to know, but it lacks the fresh feel of the original. Kids will adore this film and even most adults would like it somewhat. If you're a fan of the first film, you may come to enjoy the sequel.<br/><br/>This film marks the return of Gru. But this time, Gru is not a villain as he is trying to work on his parenting skills. But he gets recruited by the Anti-Villain League to go undercover and find out which person stole a secret Antarctic lab. Along the way, he gets help from Lucy, the awkward agent from the League.<br/><br/>This film has a respectable voice cast. Steve Carell returns as Gru and does an effective job. Russell Brand and Miranda Cosgrove also return and they did a good job. Kristen Wiig is a good addition to the cast and I think she's perfect for Lucy, instead of Ms. Hattie. I wanted to see Al Pacino voice the villain, but I think Benjamin Bratt did a fair enough job.<br/><br/>Overall, Despicable Me 2 does not feel as fresh as the first film, but it still makes for a high-quality piece of entertainment. The visuals are excellent and this movie makes good use for the music. The story seems a little stale, but then isn't that the case for many sequels? But I had a fun time and I'm sure many children did too. I rate this film 8/10."

","After the success of 'Despicable Me' (1) a sequel was only a matter of time. If you didn't see the first, it was about - what most people would describe as - you 'pretty clichéd Bond villain,' (aka 'Gru') complete with lair and army of incompetent minions. Only his plans for world domination and chaos are thwarted when he adopts three orphan girls. If you can believe that, you probably enjoyed what followed.<br/><br/>Now, we find him making jelly instead of nerve gas and taking his girls to the park. However, because he's turned good, he's recruited by the good-guys to take on a 'real' supervillain. And, naturally, this time round he meets a 'love interest' along the way.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that the kids will love this. It kept my nine year old daughter entertained for hours. It's silly, colourful, loud, easy to follow and packed full of delightful animation and visual gags. Plus it contains a healthy dose of spoofing of Bond-type films which will be picked up by the adults.<br/><br/>If you have kids, they'll love it and you shouldn't mind watching it with them (a few time, too!). I have to say that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't think it was up to the (high) standards of the Toy Story and Shrek franchises. Even thought I love Steve Carell, if I had my way, I wouldn't watch this more than once. However, that's not an option as my daughter is currently wearing out the DVD in the player.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","I really enjoyed the original film but had serious doubts that they could do much with a sequel. However, the trailer made me quite hopeful so I actually walked into this film with high expectations.<br/><br/>But within minutes it was obvious that this film was falling into all the obvious traps for bad sequels. In the opening party scene it was clear that these were not the same characters from the original but just caricatures of them.<br/><br/>Why did they have to make Gru such an incompetent idiot this time around? Makes it hard to root for him. The introduction of Lucy, as a potential love interest, could've added a lot to the story if they had not made her so irritating. Instead, she is just an annoyance.<br/><br/>The only bright spot for much of the film would be the minions, though even they wear out their welcome in a prolonged musical interlude towards the end.<br/><br/>The action climax is so good that it almost allows you to ignore the rest of the film's flaws but in the end I am left imagining the great film that this could've been if the story had received even a fraction of the imagination that went into the visuals."

","I came into this film with great (but realistic) expectations, 'cause it is after all a sequel. Still this film hit just below the bar I had raised.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot was not as creative and original as the first. Second of all, neither was the dialogue/script. They both lacked depth, proficiency and pioneering. They really had something amazing to build on from the first film and I don't feel that they seized that opportunity.<br/><br/>The jokes weren't as funny, the characters weren't as well written. They just took all the good stuff from the first and added some cheap new characters to complete the cheap plot. And when I say cheap, I just mean they took an easy way out on this one.<br/><br/>And what disappointed me the most was that the emotional depth that blew me away in the first, was gone. All that misery and evil that really made the characters who they were and really made you feel with them, it was just gone.<br/><br/>But it did contain a great amount of laughter. So in the end, you did receive a very entertaining film for the entire family (mostly children on this one), but don't go into this one expecting the copious amount of emotions that you got from the first film. It was the typical automatic sequel."

"rcolgan","7","0","0","19 June 2014"," When a Sequel Is Done Right
","It seems unfortunately common for a good film to get a sequel and for that sequel to be a grave letdown. Sometimes they will change too much and lose the qualities that made the first film so likable and at others they seem to do nothing but rehash the same ideas that we saw the first time round. It's probably because it's tough to make common ground between these two possibilities to make the sequel worthwhile. Luckily Despicable Me 2 falls into neither of these categories, remaining as fun as the original and continuing to entertain us with the same visual based gags and ludicrous premise.<br/><br/>The premise this time around being that Gru has given up being an evil doer and has instead begun to make jam (the jam causes the minions to run in disgust) so he can spend time with his three girls. But he is quickly recruited by the anti villain league and partnered with the secret agent Lucy to track down a new super villain. In the meantime his minions slowly begin to disappear being taken under various mysterious circumstances. It's a nice ridiculous plot that does have time for moments of real sentiment as we see Gru being a father and his attempts at finding love. <br/><br/>Of course whilst sentiment and emotion are all well and good, just like the original film it is the comedy that never ceases to entertain and keeps us watching this franchise. It's a kind of universal comedy that can be loved by all through its focus on visual gags similar to something like Mr Bean or Tom and Jerry mixed with some hilarious dialogue (the name Ramsbottom still makes me chuckle). It doesn't matter if you're young or old, the silly nature of the film continues to make you laugh just as it did the first time round. The humour does die down towards the end with far fewer jokes being packed in to the climax, but it's still a film that knows how to make great comedy. <br/><br/>But what is able to make the film so funny? The minion's of course! These little guys have become the franchises mascots, with the marketing being entirely focused around those little things. The next film's even going to be a prequel entirely devoted to the minions. I don't know whether the writers ever knew that these characters would become so big, but now they are instantly amongst the most recognisable figures in modern animation with their large eyes and squishy yellow body becoming a regular fixture within many children's bedrooms. All this because every second they're on screen you'll be assured some great laughs with their silly voices and their adventurous nature. <br/><br/>After gaining 970 million dollars at the box office, this is a franchise that is not going to die down anytime soon. And I'm glad. It may not create the same feeling of fantasy as Kung Fu Panda does or the sense of adventure in the Toy Story films. Instead it makes you laugh at every opportunity and through this it is sure to become a classic as one of the best feel good franchises. I can only hope that all the future instalments have the same level of charm and enthusiasm that have made these first two films so incredible."

","Despicable Me 2 (2013) is about the ex-supervillain Gru, who has already denounced his evil deeds to become a loving father of three adopted girls. He is currently adjusting to his new family life and attempts to be a legitimate business man which is in fact, admirable. However, Anti- Villain League kidnapped him and later, put him back in action (as a spy though) because they believe that he would be helpful in solving a crime as Gru should know how a villain thinks and acts. Nonetheless, this sequel also reveals more antics of their characters and minion mischief, where we'll be able to observe their true selves throughout the film and they are all so hilarious! <br/><br/>In brief, this is most likely my favorite 2013 American animated film even though there are a couple more that I haven't watch. I watched this film on theatres last year; it is fun, adorable and it lift up my mood! Some of the scenes are epic and funny; I certainly have had a good laugh watching this film and most of all, there are also plenty of moments that made me go aww! If you liked the first Despicable Me film, you'd find yourselves liking this film too. Most audiences would be amused at the character's antics and the plot twists; it is really a fun and adorable film to watch. And of course, minions fans would love this film to death! I'm definitely anticipating their upcoming films!"

","Whenever a sequel is announced, it is safe to assume that filmmakers are coming after your money in an attempt to milk the success of the original film. From a movie patron's perspective, there is always a risk of being victimized should pre-ordained expectations go south. This risk is amplified when returning viewers expect an equal or greater experience in comparison. While not quite as unique as the 2010 original, I am happy to report that Despicable Me 2 is an equally entertaining encore, just as long as your expectations are tethered to a stick of Acme dynamite. Yes; dynamite.<br/><br/>Returning directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have brought along few tricks that are seamlessly blended into the visual quality of this animation. And of course, the use of 3D is one of them. That being said, the real treats come from returning screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cino Paul, by injecting the story with heavy doses of the most likable aspects from the predecessor — adorability and hilarity. The story is also altered where Gru (Steve Carell) is now a fervent father to his three adopted girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes, having abandoned his villainous ways of the past. But when new super-villain El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) threatens to turn Gru's lovable minions into aggressive monsters, the latter is recruited by the ""Anti-Villain League"", a secret agency whose only purpose is detecting and eliminating super-villains. All of a sudden, Gru is back to juggling again — this time as a hero and an overprotective father, while actually falling for AVL colleague and sidekick Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).<br/><br/>For a spy-spoof animation, the story does not do much to hide its high level of predictability. Instead, the screenwriters have clearly focused on slapstick gags that are well written for viewers of all ages. There are several references to heist and spy movies that adults will mentally tick off to, while kids and toddlers are more than likely to get off to a rollicking ride from the start. Making this possible are zany new characters that add extra pizazz with plenty of loony-toon moments. One such character is Bratt's El Macho, a two faced super-villain with a psychotic chicken for a side-kick and a son that steals Margo's heart from right under Gru's nose. And while Carell's Gru takes a backseat as a reformed villain, Wiig's Lucy brings out a wacky side of Gru that is straight out of the Acme crate I had mentioned earlier. But amongst the various characters and voice talents at work, nothing can prepare you for the incredibly adorable Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Also returning from her debut role in Despicable Me, Fisher's voice acting is the essence of cuteness each and every time her character is on screen.<br/><br/>Besides a string of jokes, both adult and juvenile, the best moments in the film are when we get to see Gru's minions indulge in screwball mischief, including singing pop music with a French twist. These are also the moments when 3D is at its intentional best, so stick around for the end credits where minions audition for their 2015 movie spin-off called The Minions. But before we get there, I recommend Despicable Me 2 for the loads of fun, joy and laughter it has in store. It is easily one of the funniest animated films of the year."

","I am a sucker for modern day animated movies. This particular form of art has outgrown its previously targeted audience, the children. I have not seen recently a single one of them that was not layered and thick with contents that only adult audiences can fully grasp and appreciate. This is even more the case with Despicable Me 2. From the very beginning of the movie audience can not but fall in love with the main character Gru and the army of his little helpers, the Minions. The gags, the language, grimaces and the tempo of narration ads up to the enjoyment and fun this movie is so full of. The scene at the restaurant when Gru goes on a date with the shallow gum chewing ""lady"" in a tiger patterned dress is alone worth the ticket money. The smartly placed scenes where Minions are the main cast made me laugh so hard that tears ran down my face. I genuinely loved this movie and can only say that if you feel down and depressed these gray Autumn days, watching this entertaining piece of art will definitely bring some joy to your life. I give it all five stars."

","Just like the space dolls on ""Toy Story"", in the Despicable Me films, the supposed supporting players, ""Minions"", are now running the asylum.<br/><br/>Gru (Voice - Steve Carrell) is now officially retired from devising dastardly plots to steal the moon and so forth. He now lives peacefully at home looking after his cute as a button animated kids Margo, Edith and Agnes, life is good and world domination now seems but a distant dream.<br/><br/>Enter stage left Lucy Wilde (Voice - Kirsten Wiig) from the AVL (Anti Villain League) tasked with finding out what occurred in the Arctic Circle where a Mutagen PX-41 was stolen using a giant magnet, as you do.<br/><br/>Re-activating a villain to catch a villain is an old trick but Gru is not that interested, he enjoys his life as a devoted father, the kids, the minions, all is good.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Dr Nefario (Voice - Russell Brand), Gru's devoted crazy boffin type, decides to leave Gru's employment, he ""missed being evil"" and leaves in quite spectacular style, as long as you have time to wait.<br/><br/>Eventually Gru bows to the inevitable and partners with the under cover Wilde, in a shopping mall Bakery ""Bake my day"", enabling them to stake out a possible uber villain, El Macho (Voice - Benjamin Bratt).<br/><br/>As you can imagine the plot descends into chaos from here and nothing runs smoothly. To detail the plot would be an exercise in pointless surrealism, so safe to say this is used as a framework on which to hang some great visual and voice gags whilst providing a convenient stage for the star of the show, the Minions.<br/><br/>Poor old Gru, upstaged in his own film by the very characters that should be his underlings, never mind, the audience gets the benefit.<br/><br/>From vacuuming French maid minions, to YMCA outfitted groups, followed by an almost surreal song, sung in a made up language ""frenchstyle"", it is obvious the writers were given free rein with their favourite characters. At times it feels like the writers and animators were fuelled by more than diet coke but overall this works a treat.<br/><br/>There are real laughs and you may never be able to say the word ""banana"" or ""bottom"" without thinking of a yellow minion in the future. This is inspired, daft fun.<br/><br/>There is a downside in that the story, however silly, does get to play second fiddle to the Minions ever increasing screen-time and arguably the film does lose it's heart somewhat. This will be of no concern to the ankle-biters but apart from good laughs, this misses the under the cover adult depth, so beloved of Pixar movies.<br/><br/>With world wide box office of $918m, second only to Iron Man 3 in 2013, expect to see more despicable behaviour on the big screen sometime soon.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Great family fun, pushing the minions to centre stage provides great laughs, occasionally to the detriment of the movie as a whole but most will not care. When the supporting cast are this cute, funny and adorable, redundant super-villains are the least of our worries"

","Despicable Me 2. After the high popularity of wonderful Despicable Me, it was expected that they will push the envelope again but disappointing that sequel was written and directed just to cash in the charm of original's characters and lovely minions. After Gru has turned good, writers just do not know what he shall do. New villain and side characters are so one dimensional and boring. Only real fun you have is from minions. It just lacked the sharpness of original. If you haven't seen the original, you might like it but for who have seen the original and adore it are just going to feel that huge potential was wasted. I am going with generous 7 out of 10 for Despicable Me 2. It's not great fun like the original but not a complete let down either."

","Having already enjoyed the original, I really wanted to see the sequel, which I'm renting out as I type. It has a slightly different plot from the original but it has more funny moments than the original as well.<br/><br/>The animation is just as good as that in the original with the same quirky character designs (one reviewer has previously said that Lucy looked too much like Audrey from 'The Lorax' but to me she looked quite different from her) and futuristic visuals plus some completely different backgrounds such as the shopping mall like no other and the minions' island inside a giant flask. The incidental music is similar to that in the original and Pharrell Williams's 'Fun, Fun, Fun (the song that accompanied the original's thrilling roller-coaster scene)' was used again in Agnes's birthday party scene near the beginning. Despite these musical similarities, I like Pharrell's other song 'Happy (which I heard before seeing this film due to it being a massive chart hit)' as well as Mungo Jerry's 'In The Sumnertime,' David Guetta, Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj's 'Where Them Girl's At,' Bob Marley's 'Jammin' and Pitbull's 'Don't Stop the Party' plus also the minions' hilarious renditions of 'I Swear' and 'YMCA' during the wedding scene at the end. There are also certain elements from the first that are present such as the freeze gun and the fart guns (there are more of them in this film) but I liked the fact that there were differences such as the minions becoming mutated into vicious purple creatures. All the characters from the first film are just as entertaining here while Lucy is sweet and a great companion to Gru.<br/><br/>Overall this is another worthy sequel to an original film with its soundtrack, animation and funny moments being its best elements. 8/10."

It's so fun to see them in activities other than assisting Gru - having fun on the beach, in a ""bar"", etc.<br/><br/>The message is, as usual, about love and family - a father protecting his children, a wayward member who returns to the family fold, fighting for the one(s) you love...<br/><br/>The music is much better than the first's, to me anyway.

But what this sequel has that the original lacked is a stronger screenplay with sly humor, better developed characters, and sight gags that are very funny. Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud create an off- kilter world that winningly pokes fun at the spy genre and make the film very family-friendly for any age demographics. <br/><br/>The computer animation is top notch with brilliant colors and strong details. Voiceovers by Carell, Wigg, and Bratt make their characters come to life, as do the fine support by Russell Brand, Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Fisher, Dana Gaier, and both directors who create the Minion- speak language throughout the film. The exaggerated characters, their subtle expressions, and the inspired farcical movement add to the festivities. One can't help but delight in the mindless antics and slapstick, especially whenever the Minions are on screen. They upstage everyone in the movie and are given more screen time in this film, a wise decision. Their vocal mash-ups and visual traits are the perfect antidote to chasing the blues (or purples) away.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is fun from the start to finish.

","I adored ""Despicable Me"" and my wife and I could never agree which we liked more--that film or the similarly themed ""Mega Mind"". We liked them both but she preferred ""Mega Mind"". Regardless, both films are excellent and entertaining for all ages. Because ""Despicable Me"" made a huge amount of money, it wasn't surprising that soon after they announced they were making a sequel. And, when the early teaser promos arrived in theaters, they stressed the minions and said nothing about the sort of story the sequel would be. This was, apparently, very prescient--as the film turned out to be exactly that--a film with a vague plot but which was worth seeing just for the antics of the minions. In fact, my wife decided to see ""Despicable Me 2"" simply because she heard me laughing many times at the minions.<br/><br/>The film picks up pretty much right after the first one. Gru has adopted the three little girls and they, along with the minions and Dr. Lethario, are one big, happy family. However, trouble is brewing. Some super-villain has stolen a top secret formula that transforms nice creatures into killing machines--and a top secret international organization approaches the ex-villain, Gru, to help the locate the formula. They give him a spunky female sidekick and eventually romantic sparks fly. As far as the secret formula and the villain are concerned, this really seemed secondary to the romance and antics of the minions--and this plot seemed to wrap itself up quickly and easily.<br/><br/>As I said, the plot, for what it is, is minimal and seems to be just an excuse to watch the minions as well as the romance. And, for me, this was enough to justify recommending the film. Clearly not as good as the original, but filled with fun nonetheless."

","Steve Carell is back as the voice of Gru. In the earlier movie, 'Despicable Me', he prides himself in being the most despicable person. His grand crime is to steal a shrinking machine, rocket to the moon, shrink it and steal the moon. <br/><br/>However in his quest (in the earlier movie) he has trouble getting into one place, but notices that 3 orphan girls get in easily. Through that story he ends up adopting the three orphans, and in the process changes from despicable to a genuine nice guy.<br/><br/>This movie is a continuation. The three girls take more important roles. The evil guy here is El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who is using a serum that changes living things into purple monsters. He has plans to capture all of Gru's Minions and convert them. Gru must get the antidote and reverse the transformation. <br/><br/>Gru gets a partner to fight crime, she is Kristen Wiig as the voice of Lucy. When you put Wiig's excellent voice acting with the superb animation that goes with it, the character makes the film come alive. <br/><br/>As well as the Minions, who have taken on a more prominent role. <br/><br/>My wife and I saw it at home on DVD, a loaner from our public library. The sight gags are inventive and very funny, we were entertained the whole way. Plus the several very interesting extras, including several short (ca. 5-minute) movies featuring the Minions."

","Despicable Me 2 was a sure box-office success in 2013 along with Iron Man 3 and Catching Fire. Here are my ups and downs with this movie.<br/><br/>Upsides: The Minions are hilarious. I think this is one of the reasons Despicable Me 2 succeeded. I also liked the mix of spy fiction and comedy here. The characters are pretty likable and interesting, even though Agent Lucy Wilde started off a little annoying.<br/><br/>Downsides: Some of the plot points involving the characters feel sporadic, like Dr. Nefario turning from evil to good and just able to make an antidote to the monster serum. Also, it was a little weird how Antonio, the son of El Macho, just disappeared from the film near the end.<br/><br/>Verdict: While not as strong as the first movie, Despicable Me 2 is still fun for the family and will continue to entertain fans of the first movie."

","""Despicable Me 2"" provides us with the further adventures of Gru, the arch villain who, at the end of the first film, had given up his evil ways to become a doting dad and a respectable business man. However, because he has insider knowledge on how evildoers work, he's been tapped by a top-secret spy organization to go undercover and help save the world from bad guys who are not quite as reformed as he is. Gru teams up with Lucy Wilde, an attractive agent who also becomes a love interest, to find out who absconded with an entire research laboratory in the Arctic with the use of a giant magnet.<br/><br/>While it's true that Gru, as a character, is probably more interesting and fun when he's plotting a crime rather than fighting it, ""Despicable Me 2"" is still an entertaining and colorful diversion for audiences of all ages. Steve Carell, Kristin Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan and Ken Jeong are some of the better-known actors who provide the voice work for the film."

The AVL, headed by Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan), had tried to recruit Gru (Steve Carrel), a former villain-turned-businessman and busying being father to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Gru would change his mind after his friend and assistant Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) decided to leave for new employment, and he would reluctantly work alongside AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).<br/><br/>The bakery shop 'Bake My Day' at the Paradise Shopping Mall would be Gru and Lucy's headquarters while they go undercover to investigate who might have been behind what happened at the Arctic Circle.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","10 January 2014"," No surprises - ""Despicable Me 2"" measures up
","They've done it again. The 2010 hit ""Despicable Me"" offered up a kind of family-friendly entertainment that only a cold-hearted cynic could actually despise. Its ""Looney Tunes""-like slapstick offered light and lovable counter-programming to the visually stunning and emotion- filled animated films of the big studios such as DreamWorks and Pixar. In ""Despicable Me 2,"" Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures apply the ""if it ain't broke..."" approach and have churned out a sequel that in every way lives up to its predecessor.<br/><br/>This achievement isn't exactly staggering. As enjoyable as the first film was, it fell squarely into kid-focused entertainment with a hidden entertainment value for adults. The gags were mostly physical, immature and celebrated violence as a means to a laugh. Nothing has changed with ""Despicable Me 2."" Fortunately, the quad team of directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud with writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul works just hard enough to keep the ""Despicable"" shtick fresh.<br/><br/>The film reacquaints us with Gru (Steve Carell) as he adapts to life without super-villainy while taking care of his adopted girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Suddenly, he's abducted by the Anti- Villain League and brought to their underwater headquarters by the eccentric agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig). They explain a villain has stolen a very dangerous serum of sorts and request Gru's help as a former super-villain. Gru gives them the cold shoulder the first time around, but naturally changes his mind. Teamed up with Lucy, they narrow their search to a local mall, where Gru discovers a man he thinks to be the famed and presumably dead villain El Macho (Benjamin Bratt).<br/><br/>The villain of the movie remains a mystery though his plan involves kidnapping Gru's lovable minions. That said, plot doesn't hold much weight when it comes to enjoying ""Despicable Me 2,"" as was the case with the first film. The movie instead rides on the success of its antics, be it slapstick or subtle, clever humor — or even a combination of both as is frequently the case.<br/><br/>In terms of heart-warming family themes, ""Despicable Me 2"" opts for cliché. As a single father, Gru is highly motivated by keeping the young Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) away from boys and the neighborhood housewives are all intent with fixing him up. His girls, especially Agnes, are all excited by the possibility of having a mom, and looking around the options are ... pretty clear.<br/><br/>Sticking to the mold isn't as easy as it probably should be, so props to Illumination Entertainment for matching the hype. As such, ""Despicable Me 2"" shouldn't find many detractors. At the same time, it remains a fun diversion in comparison to animated films from DreamWorks and Pixar, which (mostly) continue to innovate rather than stick to a formula while delivering a similar caliber of entertainment.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I'm not sure if anyone saw the first Despicable Me (2010) being the success that many people remember it as today. It certainly had a lot going for it considering its clever plot, funny characters and unique slapstick. And once the box office reports were in, it was obvious that a sequel would be on its way at some point - although I'm not certain if people thought it would arrive three years later. But it's important to understand that for the past three years, the producers must have put in a lot of work to make sure this next chapter in Gru's life was just as entertaining as the first and it did just that.<br/><br/>This time, fans find Gru as a new man, making jam and jelly products with his goofy minions and three adopted children. Little does he realize that another evil villain is planning to take over the world. So in order to stop this from happening, Gru is given an offer from the Anti-Villain League (AVL) to stop this new threat. And as the plot continues, he begins to learn even more things about himself he didn't think he would overcome. Along with that are some new characters like El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig), and agent of AVL who partners up with Gru. Oh and let's not forget the new purple minion - what personality, ha!<br/><br/>What's great about this sequel is that it feels like nothing was changed at all; which is great. The continuity is clung onto tightly like the first film, the characters all still have their respective voices, the tone is still the same as well as the musical score. Even though it's been three years, it honestly feels like the first one ended literally a year before. That's how close these two match each other and that proves that the time was worth the wait. There isn't much else to say other than if you enjoyed the first one, watching this will be just as enjoyable.<br/><br/>The sequel to the 2010 hit replicates the formula so well that it may feel more like an extension of the day after the events of the first movie. Either way, it still is just as fun."

","I really loved this movie! It was hilarious and at some moments had me rolling on the floor going ""No! They didn't!"" I was dazzled by the first Despicable Me and I can honestly give the producer 2 thumbs up and a job well done! it's not often that you find sequels as good as it's original,But Despicable Me 2 simply blew me away!<br/><br/>Though the format of Despicable Me in General is more ""cartoony"" it's graphics is major eye candy. It's fun ,creative, and mesmerizing. The minions are just too cute! Their random moments and constant talk of gibberish adds much comedy and gives DM that ""exciting glow"". I really liked how they continued the plot of Gru transforming from Super villain mastermind to Super hero father.<br/><br/>Even though Despicable Me 2 is hilarious it has it's moments where the characters are going through something in life that's relatable to real people (younger and older).Whether it's going through first crushes, dealing with maturing kids , getting back into the dating game ,and even realizing your true love Despicable Me 2 offers the whole family a great relatable experience.<br/><br/>Lucy Wilde was an awesome new character to enter Despicable Me.She had a lot of spunk and a eager outgoing personality. The trio of girls Margo ,Edith ,and Agnes definitely got to show off more of who they were even though I wish they still had just a bit More depth to their characters.I was actually surprised Margo, usually the sensible one ,became love struck and lost some sensibleness upon meeting Antonio.But hey! That's how most girls are when they get their first crush: infatuated puppy love! <br/><br/>Although I really enjoyed this movie ,rabid purple minion creatures and all,it was kinda predictable .Most of the trailers I hate to say was a sum of the entire movie! That part was just a tad bit of a downer but I still liked Despicable Me 2 all the same.<br/><br/>Oh and just saying parents beware.I'm not much of a negative thinker but the part where Gru has to use his belt to find traces of the mutation formula ...um ...it kinda looked like he was humping stuff.There's some more little hoo ha's here and there but that's why it's rated PG. <br/><br/>I <3 this movie! Hopefully we'll be seeing a DM3 real soon!"

","I just have to stress how much replay value this movie has. I can honestly watch it so many times. There's never really a dull moment in this movie. If you liked the first one, I'm pretty sure you'll like this one too. Personally, I loved the first one and I might even like this one more. Despicable Me 2 is about the ex-villain Gru moving on from his life of crime and instead raising his family (of which the youngest girl Agnes is probably the cutest animated character. Ever.). Along the way, there's a spy conspiracy concerning a supervillain on his hands, as well as the outstandingly lovable minions. We all love the minions and the makers of this film realized and capitalized on that. There's so much more minion humour in this movie and it's great. Essentially all the humour in this movie is laugh-out-loud hilarious and the best funny parts are the really subtle things. It's actually rewarding in a sense. The second half of the movie is also filled with cool spy stuff (bear in mind that it's not Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol though) and it's all fun and entertaining, while still retaining all the laughs. It's fun for kids, teenagers, and adults: the quintessential family movie of this year so far and definitely the funniest."
"leonblackwood","9","0","0","15 December 2013"," Something for the whole family! 9/10
","Review: This is how all animation movies should be. With a mixture of adult and kiddie humour, this movie was great and for a sequel, it's just as good as the first one. Making nearly a billion dollars, I think that the audiences also enjoyed this really funny movie. The minions made the movie, and the storyline was great for a animated movie. The whole look and feel of the movie was also brilliant, and the director cleverly added some sing-a-longs which all kiddie movies should have. The love element was also cleverly added into this movie, but it didn't spoil the flow of the movie because of the mad purple minions and the Mexican baddie. I just hope that it doesn't take years to bring out a third one. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Its hard to believe that the first movie came out 3 years ago, because it's still fresh in my mind, which just shows how great this franchise is. I loved the face expressions of the characters, especially the girls who were sweet. Gru has become the loving father who is looking for love, whilst fighting baddies at the same time. It has something for everyone and it's put together well. I think that you can tell that I haven't got anything bad to say about the movie so just watch it. <br/><br/>Budget: $76million Worldwide Gross: $920million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first one and who loved the minions. 9/10"
"bob the moo","Null","0","0","8 December 2013"," Good use of the minions make it work even if it is uneven and plot not particularly engaging
","The key thing for me about this film is that the plot really didn't stick in my head. I don't mean the easy summary that Gru is employed to help locate and takedown another super villain suspected to be working out of a local mall, but rather that the detail of it didn't leave a mark. It isn't that I needed an animated kids film to have a really gripping narrative, but here it is a bit meh in its content and pacing. This is where it is weak but generally it manages to shore the film up all around the plot by adding constant cute and funny bits at every turn.<br/><br/>As with the first film, the film is at its best when it gives a throwaway moment to Agnes or, more frequently, it lets a minion fall off something. This it does a lot and it is never not funny but at times it does start to feel a little like the film is overusing them and hurting the main characters by comparison. Gru is less interesting and often just feels like a plot device to make a story so that the film can mess around within that frame and this goes for many of the human characters. It does still work though but, while the film is loaded with voices from Carrell, Wiig, Schaal and many others, it really tends to play to its short yellow strengths instead.<br/><br/>It is still funny, but the minions should be the cherry on top – not the whole show."

","Although I enjoyed the first Despicable Me, I can't recall any funny scenes aside from the old scientist having a slow scooter. I think the main scenes that I'll remember will be the I swear rendition by the minions and their general craziness. Also, the youngest adoptive daughter, Agnes, has an absolutely adorable voice and is in the same vein as Boo from Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>The movie has some really colourful animation and a somewhat straight- forward plot. However, plot is constantly moving with the minions always providing their unique form of energy. Definitely recommend it as a fun movie."

","This is the third movie I watched with my little niece (after TS 3 and Barbie). Gru is back with his little girls and the minions to entertain us again. Only this time as a hero and a kind hearted father. Good job by the animation department to provide eye-popping visuals with lots of colorful characters and none could match the minions (my niece enjoyed them too well). The movements of all characters are detailed enough. I loved the orange haired Lucy and El Macho. I couldn't resist my laughter at the scene in which El Macho fakes death. There's a whole lot of comic elements in the movie. The villain's characterization was bad, imo. I hated the minions appearing very frequently and not all scenes of them are lols as in the first. They get annoying after sometime (for adults at least). The script could've been a little better at least with the villain."

","Once again I am not convinced. 'Despicable Me' movie from the series is yet to impress me. Like the first, it was not that good but okayish. The only great advantage of the story was having minions around. As usual the minion's jokes were very good, even in the end credit we're entertained thoroughly. It is unimaginable, 'Despicable Me' without minions.<br/><br/>Whatever the movie is, there's no stopping for the Steve Carell role, I mean he as a dubbing artist to the Gru. The story continues after ex- super villain Gru gave up his stealing business to take care of his adopted children. Now he's a trying to be a good care taking father and making jelly for a living. But looks like the past won't let him as a new person. The officials recruit him to catch the new villain on the loose who is a great threat. And the rest of the story tells how they gonna stop the dangerous villain from being executed his masterplan.<br/><br/>The story was okay. The problem was the villain, he was too weak. The movie never lets him show his true power in any portion of the tale. I thought many scenes in the movie were wasted for nothing. After okayish first installment I expected this sequel could be a lot better but ended in sadness. This movie is once watchable but not that bad, we can say an average.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Meanwhile, he's dealing with his girls, more girls and his wonderful minions who never cease to wonderfully though never overbearingly steal each scene they're in.<br/><br/>This summer produced several sequels (or in one case, a prequel) to big-named animated features. This one tops the Monsters University prequel but I cannot comment on the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs sequel since I have seen neither the original nor the follow-up.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 does drag in spots and tries too hard to place too many and unnecessary subplots, but for the grand majority of it, it's hilarious, inventive and just plain fun.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Okay, fine, I'm sold on the Minions Movieif only it's not overkill.

",". . . such as CARS 2. Of course, any flick featuring the lovable minions has a leg up on the competition to begin with. As a bad guy gone good, the balding Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) visually puts one in mind of Bruce Willis, only funnier. Further, this feature ends with the most memorable cartoon wedding since UP, so it has a lot going for it. With songs that are passable and jokes which occasionally hit the funny bone, there are probably worse ways to spend 98 minutes (such as attending home games of the Miami Marlins, which are liable to run that long and more--you even have to pay for parking!). Also, did I mention the minions? In this second outing, some of them become what is listed in the credits as ""evil minions,"" which implies that minions are born good (an arguable point). Having good and bad minions works better here than in the most similar flick out this summer, SMURFS 2, in which the Smurfette character is partially corrupted. Which means we have a lot of fun coming up next year, when the minions headline their own feature. Can't wait!"

","This film came in when the animation was desperately in need of a rescuer, who, in this case, a villain. The film performed well at the box office, surpassed it's original film. But in reviews, the film does have some fault and goofs and didn't really matched it's predecessor. It was gained with high marketing and fast positive reviews. But in contrast, the film was really not up to expectations. It lacks of some character development, especially the character of Lucy. It doesn't have the villain evil enough to either impressed the audience or makes the critics feel like where will he go, what will he do. And, the story development does lack of implants and official parts, that laughs the audience like the first film. But in positive ways to see it, it is one of the rare films that is a good sequel to a animation, especially when the main character is a villain in the first part. It's script was like a follow up to the first film, but has a new and refreshing way to make the audience give money out to see the film. And somehow, it has the new and just weird and wait to see love story between an agent and her villain, which is rare, surprising the audience and adjusted the film into a perfect corner."

","I loved this film and thought the plot was spectacular and hilarious. However, because I would give the first film an 8, this has to have a 7 because the villain failed to beat the greatest super villain ever- Vector! The rather dull El Macho makes a very small appearance and is no way near as cool as Vector. Everything else is bigger and better, but for me the villain is what makes and defines a film. What would Harry Potter be without Voldemort? What would Peter Pan do without Hook? Amongst the brilliance of this film is this pathetic villain who has a chicken as a henchman- although, admittedly, the chicken is cool! I can understand why Vector did not return, however a better villain is missing here. This film is severely lacking direction and magnitude, but is full to the brim with brilliant jokes and has a wonderful, heart-warming plot which is sure to entertain anyone."

","If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy the second one. But lets just lay on the table the things I didn't like about the movie. First my great pet peeve, was the lack of the 3 girls, the focus in dm2 is Gru and it shows. Yes the girls make an appearance, but you can tell by how their presented in the story that their basic side items. I would have like to see more interactions between Lucy and the 3 girls, instead of the instant fall in love with her. Agnes meeting Lucy was fine, and I know the other girls wanted Gru to date, but I would have been nice to see Margo and Edith make sure if Lucy was the right women. The movie kinda moved to fast, or I didn't seem to flow as well as the first one, its like they had all these idea to explore but had to edit so much more. I feel like this movie could have been 1 hour longer to further delve into the story. Other than those simple annoyance, which didn't effect my overall love of the movie, there are great scenes, the minions light up the show and Gru's father adaptation is great. <br/><br/>I'm so happy that this movie did so well, making its money back and then some on just its opening weekend is impressive. Hopefully the signals the creation of despicable me 3, which I can't wait for. I actually can't wait to go see dm2 again. Actually I might go do that right now.....lol cya"

","I just watched the movie today with my family. This simply had me laughing the whole time. I found really touching and lovely the picturing of Gru's struggles and deals with being now a good guy and being a father at the same time. The introduction of charismatic characters such as the villain and Lucy Wilde made the movie pretty enjoyable. And then there's the minions. Those little yellow fellows helps through the movie a lot. Few laughs really come from their account and never fail to keep the crowd entertained and rolling on the floor with their adorable clumsiness and crazy ideas. I would recommend this for all the family."

","I found this movie very enjoyable and as good as the first Despicable Me and here are the reasons why. <br/><br/>The Minions: The reason I saw the first DM is because I found them to be very funny, very cute, and they resemble Twinkies (who doesn't love Twinkies?) and they did not disappoint in sequel. <br/><br/>Action: Action wise it had plenty like an animated Mission Impossible. <br/><br/>Comedy: It was filled with lots of comedic moments especially from the minions <br/><br/>Voice acting: There were amazing voice acting from all of the cast <br/><br/>If you enjoyed or are a fan of the first Despicable Me, you'll like this one and I give it an 8/10"

","I saw ""Despicable Me 2"", starring the voices of Steve Carell-The Office-t.v., Little Miss Sunshine; Kristen Wiig-Bridesmaids, MacGruber; Benjamin Bratt-Catwoman, Miss Congeniality and Russell Brand-Rock of Ages, Get Him to the Greek. <br/><br/>This is the sequel-in case you could not tell by the number 2 in the title-to the blockbuster animated hit. Steve returns as Gru, a former villain that has gone straight since he has acquired three little girls. Russell returns as Dr. Nefario, Steve's assistant, who now works on their new business of making jellies & jams-remember, they have gone legit. A new villain appears and starts on a crime spree which causes the intervention of the secret spy organization called AVL-Anti Villain League-to ask Steve for his help. Since Steve is a former villain, he might be of assistance in apprehending Benjamin, aka El Macho. Kristen plays Lucy, an agent of AVL that is assigned to help Steve. And, of course the minions are back-I think they are the best part. If you liked the original, then you should enjoy this one, too. I went with my daughter, son-in-law and two grandkids and they all enjoyed it, too. It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor and some mild action and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy this on Blu-Ray."

","If you are regular cinema goer to Odeon Cinemas in the UK you would have bombarded with advertisement for Despicable Me 2, since Christmas. Despite this advertising overload to some viewers, Despicable Me 2 turns out to fun continuous for the series, even if it does occasionally retread some of the same material.<br/><br/>Since the events of the first film Gru (Steve Carell) has given up being a villain and sets out to be good father to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) with the help of his little yellow Minions. But a new villain has emerged by stealing a secret Russian lab with formula which can turn anything into a purple hairy destructive beast. With no leads the Anti-Villain League (AVL) recruits Gru to find the villain who is located in a mall. Yet sparks starts to between Gru and his partner, Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg) while someone is kidnapping the Minions.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 continues what worked in the first film, the physical and visual humour, the slapstick and the Minions. This film has much more Minion action as they hurt each other, dance or simply enjoying life and this time they play a much bigger part to the story. The Minions are fun creatures and fans of them will be satisfied with their additional screen time. But the Minions are not the only physically comic characters, Despicable Me 2 introduces a new character, the psycho chicken and he is awesome as a guard dog and provides great humour.<br/><br/>Wigg is not a new actress to series, but her character is new. Wigg gave an enthusiastic performance as the eager Agent Wilde, a woman who loves her job. Wigg is known comic actress and she has excellent comedic timing to enhance her lines. Occasionally she does comes off as an embarrassing mom and Wilde is a very Wiggequese character, so people who dislike Wigg will struggle to like her character. But for most people there are plenty of character qualities to make her very likable. Steve Coogan is also a new addition to the series as Silas Ramsbottom (ha, ha, bottom): he is a much more serious, deadpan performance but he still makes an impression and he has some good lines.<br/><br/>Benjamin Bratt was brought in as a last minute replacement for Javier Bardem and Al Pacino as the film's antagonist. For someone who had to work on his role very quickly he brought out a larger then live character as Eduardo the dancing Mexican restaurant owner. He is a much more entertaining character than Vector from the last film.<br/><br/>The original Despicable Me had the visual look of a Saturday Morning Cartoon with better animation. The sequel underplays this element and has more of a Bondesque, The Incredibles look to. The AVL Headquarters more like a Bond villain's lair. The backstory of the villain El Macho, the most manly villain ever, was told in very entertaining flashbacks and his manly death felt very much like the superhero deaths in The Incredibles.<br/><br/>In comparison to the first film, Despicable Me 2 does sometimes meander and looks at subplots, particular Margo falling for a boy and Gru's love life. The flow was not as natural as Despicable Me. At times, Despicable Me 2 plays like a romantic-comedy as well as a sci-fi animated film.<br/><br/>Near the end of Despicable Me 2 repeats some of the same plot points of the first film, even if the make-up is slightly different. It could be argued that this is simply following typical screen writing tropes but it generally takes small step back for a film that actually worked as a continuation to the story. There are also a couple of repeated jokes, but it could easily be seen as a running jokes.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is a delightful family film that will please fans of the original and adults and children alike. It is a film that plenty of humour with different types of jokes during its run time and serves as what a sequel should be, a continuous of a story. The audience I was with absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

","In a perfect world or in movie-world there is a clear line between good and bad, hero and villain. Well, lives isn't that black and white, nor are the movies now for that matter. Why can't we have a bad guy who is good as well? Movies have already dabbled in the anti-hero, so I think it is time for the lovable villain, or at least one who has a heart. I am not talking about having the next James Bond villain want to take Mr. Bond for ice cream instead of killing him. What I want is someone like Gru (Steve Carell), a bad guy who discovers his heart, but still has that evil streak in him. <br/><br/>In 2010's ""Despicable Me"" we were introduced to Gru as he tried to take over the world, only to have his life taken over by three little girls. These girls Agnes (Elsie Fisher), Margo (Miranda Crosgrove) and Edith (Dana Gaier) malted Gru's heart and made him not want to be so evil. In fact Gru is out of the 'Evil' business now and he no longer has his minions preparing for world domination, instead he has them making jam. Super villains are still out there, and one of them has stolen a formula that could cause the world problems if they are not found soon. So how do you catch a super villain you ask? You use an ex super villain to track them down. The Anti Villain League recruits Gru and teams him with Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). Together they must find the mystery villain and save the world from whatever evil plan he has in store for us all. <br/><br/>It seems that most animated movies now are just franchises waiting to happen. Even the mighty Pixar has started to return to the well more often. Why does it seem every animated movie has a sequel now? Well it is pretty simple. Dollar signs. Unlike most sequels though, animated movie's quality can stay relatively the same. Maybe it is because they keep it simple, they don't try to outdo the first film, and they just make a good movie. In the case of ""Despicable Me 2"" they don't let you down, they bring the same laughs as the first film. Stephen Carell is great as Gru, but the minions once again steal the show. Who don't love a little yellow guy who always seems to want to do well by his boss, but always seems to cause trouble. It's like watching those old Saturday morning cartoons, waiting to see what the minions will get themselves into. The other thing about this film is the 3D looks good, especially as you watch the credits sequence. I look forward to animated movie sequels, because the filmmakers who make them know what they are. These movies are suppose to be fun, something the whole family can enjoy, and with ""Despicable Me 2"" they did what they were suppose to do, make a fun movie.<br/><br/>http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

","This was a great film to watch, with several minion scenes that made me laugh (especially the underground minion party!). But the ending was a bit of a letdown for me.<br/><br/>DESPICABLE ME 2 focuses very heavily on further developing the characters from the first film, to the point where I felt the actual plot took a back seat. At the end of the film all the minions had been transformed into invulnerable, ravenous, mindless creatures of destruction... and they are cured within a few minutes of their mass reveal. Furthermore, it wasn't really explain why the serum made minions aggressive and mindless whereas El Macho apparently retained his reasoning faculties.<br/><br/>This issue aside, it was a good movie to watch and I enjoyed it. I certainly am looking forward to a Minions movie."
"rannynm","8","0","0","2 July 2013"," The Minions Are Back - Ever So Moreso
","I think this film is a very cute sequel to ""Despicable Me"" and good news, the minions are in it even more. The 3D animation is wonderful in this movie and the designs and colors are very fun visually. I can tell the creators of this film paid attention to what audiences enjoyed most out of the first movie and that is what influenced a lot of ""Despicable Me 2."" I think all of the voice actors suited their characters perfectly. This film brings back the familiar voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Carell and Russell Brand, while also adding in newer characters such as Lucy voiced by Kristen Wiig, Antonio voiced by Moises Arias and many others. <br/><br/>My favorite character is actually all of the minions. I loved them all so much in the first ""Despicable Me"" and I think it was a great decision to include them for in the sequel. Their banter is so funny, even though I can't understand their gibberish, their motions tell the story of what they're trying to communicate. I think the way they work together and fight is very comical and all of their interactions are very funny. The minions really are the perfect side kicks to Gru since he is so wacky. <br/><br/>My favorite scene would probably be when Gru finds out that Margo is on a date. He freaks out so much and goes running around the mall trying to stop the two of them from being alone. It's really funny and although it is a bit over exaggerated, it still shows what all fathers go through when their daughters start showing an interest in dating. I also think it's funny how Margo's sisters react to her new romantic interests. Edith, being a total tomboy, thinks that it is disgusting for her sister to go on a date with a boy. Agnes on the other hand thinks it's the cutest thing and immediately starts saying that they are in love, which only worries Gru even more. The entire scene is filled with very funny, memorable dialog and interactions between the main characters and is definitely a scene that stands out for me.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 6+ and anyone who enjoyed ""Despicable Me"" will absolutely love ""Despicable Me 2."" I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has the perfect mix of humor for children and adults so it makes for an enjoyable experience for all.<br/><br/>Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D.

However, they were not matched. <br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 has wonderful, vibrant, colourful animation, and the minions still keep is laughing but other then that, there really isn't anything memorable here. The story is weak. The humor is mainly aimed at little children, which is not necessarily a bad thing and it ends all too suddenly. Also, the love story between Gru and the special agent (Chill, i really haven't spoiled anything) feels forced.<br/><br/>All in all, Despicable Me 2 is an enjoyable Family film, but a poor sequel to the wonderful original Despicable Me."

The girls were very cute and added some light-hearted moments. The minions were about the same as in the first movie - funny for the kids, but not much more than a 12-year-old would find funny. I think I laughed about 4 times throughout the movie, but mild laughter.

The movie recycles a cheap and overused plot involving spies and so forth and it's very predictable in the sense that it doesn't do anything new or inventive, including there's no reason these movies should exist, it's completely pointless and it got made in order to make a profit at the box office, considering the big revenues the first one gained.

"mike48128","10","1","2","13 April 2016"," Gru as a good guy and nasty purple Minions!
","People are split between loving it and hating it. It's great fun but nothing like the first one! Gru is a loving father to three ""nauseatingly cute"" little girls but you love 'em anyway! Even funnier even than the new ""Minions Movie""! Gru dresses up as the Drag Queen Fairy Godmother of all time when no one shows up at the girl's birthday party. His evil scientist assistant can't stand making bad-tasting jelly so he jumps ship to serve another villain that (yawn) wants to conquer the world. (Still a popular movie subject--look at the new Star Wars) It makes fun of Mexicans, Mexican food, tacky malls and trendy food courts. A send up of ""Get Smart"", ""Gremlins"" and ""The Hulk"". It certainly isn't politically correct. The antidote to the purple monster-making-goo is Gru's sticky bad tasting red jelly! Too much fun with impossible gimmicks and gadgets, and incredible stylized computer animation. Steve Carrell has a job for life! The ""fat"" CEO of ""The Bank of Evil"" makes a guest appearance.

"sheldonchorta","2","1","2","3 July 2015"," Was this a different movie?!
","I have a feeling that this movie was gonna be the minions movie before they decided to make a sequel instead. That's what I'm gonna question first: WHY ARE MINIONS FUNNY?! Slapstick IS funny, but when you won't laugh when you see that as an entire movie! That's why the Home Alone sequels didn't work, so why are the creators of this movie getting a pass? And the minions' comedy is just that: slapstick overload! So, now that that is out of the way, let's talk about something else. GRU IS BLAND AS HELL!!! Whenever I hear him talk, I hear a bored, uninterested Steve Carrel waiting for his paycheck. And he only cares about himself until someone he knows is in trouble. And the girls! My GOD is this a waste of Miranda Cosgrove! She is a good actress and she was even very good in the first Despicable Me, but she just SUCKS here. The smallest one is a boring character, and I don't remember ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE from the middle child. I would go on and on about all the other characters, but I won't. And the plot just plain up SUCKS!!! Again, it feels like a Minions movie that needed a plot to have a sequel to the first film. It feels slow and boring, and I'm convinced that the script writers were high while writing such inane dialogue, comedy, and characters!!! NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! EVER!!!!!!"

"italo505","7","1","2","4 September 2013"," A Very Despicable Sequel
","After seeing the success of Despicable Me, I had a few reservations for the sequel which I caught yesterday... Oh, trust me, it's still playing in theaters, the best medium to see it on, especially with minimum number of kids in the audience... I think there were only 2 kids in the whole theater... And it was 2 kids too many, if you ask me... I'm such a Gru, ain't I? The concept for the original was phenomenal: a super villain named Gru, voice by the talented Steve Carrell in his most intriguing and strangely foreign English accent, whose evil master plan was to steal the moon. Quite a feat, right? By the time Despicable Me is over, I couldn't help myself but fall in love with the grouchy character with a heart of gold who adopts three adorable little orphans, much against his will, and learns how being a parent matters more than accomplishing his evil act that would make him the most accomplished villain that ever was. Suddenly, stealing the moon doesn't seem to fulfill Gru anymore and being a parent becomes his priority. In the sequel, we meet Gru and his orphans right as he is organizing a birthday party for his little princess Agnes. Everything is doing well until he learns that his ""princess"" will not be showing up after all and so he must please his adopted daughter by dressing up as a princess himself in what's possibly the funniest scene of the entire movie. The scene is so funny and endearing that it summarizes what the rest of Despicable Me 2 is all about: the importance of having a family. Speaking of family, I happened to catch up this movie with old friends, the same ones that came to see The Happening (how can I forget The Happening?) as well as Gnomeo & Juliet. It's great to meet these wonderful friends that, regardless of how long some of us have been apart, feels as if time has not passed by at all. Funny how I consider these friends more than I consider some members of my own family and I'm proud to say that I can really call them friends, without hesitation. Especially after what I've gone through lately at work, it's nice to know that I can still count on these friends, that I can rest assured that whatever I tell them will be kept among us. It's taken this long to realize who my real friends are, and who are just trying to take advantage. Back to Despicable Me 2, I have to say that it's Gru's minions that really bring the comic relief in an otherwise ordinary and predictable film: Gru takes a jive at dating, with disastrous results, until he realizes that his new partner in crime Lucy (voiced by Bridesmaids' Kristen Wiig) is really the one that completes him, the only one that gets him and admires him. There are plenty of laughs thanks to the yellow, mischievous minions that end up dressing up as French maids, as firefighters, as Hula Hula dancers and many more outfits that will keep everybody laughing. Many jokes are geared towards the adults as well, as a matter of fact a big chunk of the movie will have the kids abay. The plot involves another villain who abducts his or her victims through a spacecraft that resembles a giant magnet. I noticed how the ""experimental"" kids that were in the audience were oblivious to this whole plot (although they also suffered from a severe case of ADD anyways) and could have cared less if there was a plot. They had come to see the minions, that's it. I never would have thought that having a plot could ruin the momentum of a movie but this was the case with Despicable Me 2. I believe that having less plot and more laughs would have help this movie soar, especially when you are trying to please your targeted audience. My favorite moment came when the minions, dressed up in their white suits, performed ""This I Swear"" by Boys 2 Men. I was literally in tears watching these minions belting it out and I will look forward to seeing that scene again when it comes to cable (not too far out, I assume). I will definitely look forward to seeing Despicable Me 3, their animation is always phenomenal, script is always funny as well as having Steve Carrell who has made of Gru into a villain that everyone can relate to and loves to love. Maybe not what a villain wants to hear, right? Oh and can't forget about those minions: yellow, purple or in any outfit they will breathe life and laughter into any Despicable movie."

Al Pacino plays the Mexican villain. Kristen Wiig plays the secret agent who helps out Gru. And finally, the minions are back in theaters. Also, the film has more humor than the original film. If you want humor, then this sequel is for you. My favorite part of the film is when Gru marries his new wife, and she becomes the mother of his 3 daughters. I also enjoy when the minions use their own language to sing the popular music hits. The third favorite part I enjoy is the hilarious scene when the fire in Gru's house is put out."

","In 2010, 'Despicable Me' was a surprise hit – it was not a sequel and came from a studio who had never had a huge success in the era of Pixar; but it was an enjoyable comedy that went on to gross nearly half a billion dollars worldwide, thus making a follow-up all but inevitable.<br/><br/>'Despicable Me 2' finds former supervillain Gru (wonderfully voiced by Steve Carrell) in much less evil form, blissfully living with his three adopted orphans (and the minions), hosting birthday parties, sweetly dressing up as a fairy princess and making cupcakes and jellies. However, this idyllic life is interrupted by Anti-Villain League agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) who is partnered up with Gru to take down a nefarious villain. <br/><br/>Despite some good gags involving Gru, the real stars of the show are the little yellow Minions. They're given significantly more screen time here than in the original, but thankfully it rarely feels like overkill, instead they're a reliable source of laughter whenever they are on screen, whether chopping through a wall, singing a lullaby in gibberish talk or saying ""bottom"" with a snigger. On the other hand, Kristen Wiig is given a relatively underwritten role and most of her jokes fall flat, despite some good voice acting.<br/><br/>One of the flaws of 'Despicable Me 2' is how unfocused it is – the big villain behind it all barely gets a look-in, while the plot is muddled and slightly unengaging, but overall, this was easily forgivable, simply due to the charming nature of the movie. It's not earth-shattering and arguably not as good as its predecessor, but this sequel is consistently enjoyable, always managing to put a smile on my face and causing viewers young and old to erupt with laughter."

Till Kristin Wiig's Lucy brings Cru back into the business to, like Hannibal Lecter, help find a similar bad guy.<br/><br/>The best scene has obvious love interest Lucy taking Cru to her underground compound in a car much like James Bond's in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. Leading to an intriguing premise: within a large busy mall, one of the store owners could be the next villain who wants to take over the world.<br/><br/>It's during the undercover investigation the film drags with prolonged musical numbers and an overlong conclusion dealing with a familiar enemy (to Cru). The aliens running around clumsily are humorous but can get tiresome after a while. <br/><br/>Kids will love it though. And that's what really matters."

","After being nabbed in the original Despicable Me, Steve Carrell as Gru is given a kind of furlough from villainy and attempts to go straight with his kids. But a top secret laboratory is stolen from its Arctic site, I mean the whole building is just lifted from the ground with a giant magnet and transported to wherever. Those research facilities in the wrong hands could have a devastating impact on humankind so we set a villain to catch a villain.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig returns as Lucy, agent from the anti-villain league and truth be told she's enjoying the assignment though even because she brought Gru down in the first Despicable Me, she has a thing for him.<br/><br/>As for Gru he suspects that supervillain El Macho whom he runs into in a mall hasn't retired from the villainy business. I really did like what Benjamin Bratt did with his character. Sounds like he was having a great old time with the part.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is a nice animated feature good for the whole family."
"edwardscissorhands123","8","1","2","13 July 2013"," Great Animated Fun
","There isn't much to be said about Despicable Me 2 besides that it is great animated fun. When I say that it sounds bland but its because it is practically the same film as the first Despicable Me 2, only with a more light and fun atmosphere. It really does have the same plot and types of twists. I don;t think this is a bad thing though because I see the Despicable Me franchise as a throwback to what old cartoons really mean, which is to provide over the top fun for the sole reason of laughter. But in Despicable Me, it also mixes in some true heart. I could really see the Despicable Me franchise turning into a big series and I would be right along with it due to the fact that the two movies so far are some of the only animated films I have laughed at in a while, and one scene from the second may possibly be the funniest scene in a movie in 2013. I just think the only problem with this sequel is that it copies a lot of the content from the first so it is hard to connect and feel with some of the emotion presented in its flawless predecessor. Not to say it doesn't have heart be cause it does, but it doesn't come in as much of abundance because most of the characters are already developed and some of the side stories of underdeveloped characters are a tad lousy, such as the father-daughter aspects. I think this side story was a little weaker than it could have been and it didn't really tie up in the end. I like the mother-daughter elements better, those were spot on.<br/><br/>But overall Despicable Me 2 is a great animated movie that people of all ages can enjoy. I don't think you really need to see it in the theaters because unfortunately it's 3D isn't as good as it could have been, and the visuals do not compare to other animated films such as Pixar (that doesn't make the movie lesser though since it doesn't rely on visuals, just the screenplay). So I would say it is must see on a rental.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

"ari_gg","8","1","2","12 July 2013"," EXCELLENT movie..... BUT something was very concerning
","This movie was excellent but....<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying: I am not the type of person to be easily offended by anything but there was a part of the film that made my friend and I very comfortable. It seemed very awkward and the whole theater was thrown off by it. Violence against women is not funny and should not be in a movie rated for young viewers. I'm not upset about this at all but it made the rest of the movie a little awkward.. almost as if making you wonder if someone was angry at an ex-girlfriend and decided to make this scene to spite her.<br/><br/>I won't give anything away but the scene I am talking about involves a young women dressed in leopard print with a lot of makeup on. Her character is superficial and annoying. Long story short, she ends up being drugged while out on a date and then her limp body is tossed around and violated in a violent way (an awkward few minutes that seemed like an eternity)until she ends up face down tossed onto her front steps at the end of the night. I found it inappropriate to expose young children to that sort of behavior. I could understand if it was some sort of magic weapon used against her or something completely made up.. but drugging a woman and then violating her limp body is not something I would want to expose my children to.<br/><br/>Just a thought. Other than that the movie way awesome. Definitely would not take my children to see it."

","""But the real gift of this little animation gem is homely Gru, the world's best villain but financially least productive. His plan to steal the moon is about the cleverest comment on how much we have stolen, innocence among the treasures; the moon is all we have left to lose. But there is also something else to be stolen—Gru's heart—and that's easily filched by Agnes, Margo, and Edith, orphans selling the equivalent of girl scout cookies but sub textually a heart for a villain who doesn't know yet it's a loving parent's.""<br/><br/>Those were my words 3 years ago about Despicable Me, and I stand by them for this year's Despicable Me 2 with one change: Gru's (voice of Steve Carell) heart is to be stolen again, this time by the Anti-Villain League's techno titan, big-nosed Lucy. Having proved herself a formidable agent, she joins Gru's new mission to stop super villain, El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), before his diabolical, out-sized magnet sucks up the entire earth.<br/><br/>There's a reason this animation is knocking off the Lone-Ranger's ten-gallon hat this summer: Despicable is lovable: a genuine heart beats in all its characters, from cute-as-hell near-sighted, yellow Minions to the new villain, whose Latino heart beats strong, if for the wrong reasons. Somehow the slightly fey Ranger and the ambiguous Indian cannot capture the same romance. <br/><br/>Gru is the unlikely hero once again, a model of rehabilitation who could prepare the younger generation for the myriad comebacks such as Eliot Spitzer, Mark Sanford, and Anthony Weiner:<br/><br/>Gru: Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world. <br/><br/>Edith: You're gonna be a spy? <br/><br/>Gru: *That's* right, baby! Gru's back in the game with gadgets and weapons and cool cars! <br/><br/>His date with a big-lipped valley girl is disastrous enough to make any single male move into a monastery. That's the kind of humanity until recently Pixar mostly owned.<br/><br/>Americans love comeback kids, e.g., Bill Clinton; no place better to be prepared for those changes of heart than Universal's challenge to Pixar's barn full of humanity, the Despicables."

Not only did it keep in spirit with the first one, they didn't spoil all the jokes in the trailers and I couldn't stop laughing all the way. True, it's easy to guess the ending, but honestly, how else were they going to the moment we saw Lucy. The minions were great, Agnes was great, Gruu was great... a lot of it was great. Only complaint would be that Edith didn't play a very big role in this one either as it focused more on the love fracture and the fatherly relationship between Gruu and the girls. Regardless it was a great movie, worth supporting and worth watching."

"SouthSideChgo","8","1","2","9 July 2013"," Love is a dangerous mission ...even for a villain
","Contains no spoilers<br/><br/>Life has certainly changed for Gru (Steve Carell) since the first Despicable Me (2010). He's now a respectable family man as well as eligible single father on his block which has a nosy neighbor and his daughters pushing him into the dating pool. Instead of devising plots to take over the world, he and thousands of minions along with Dr. Nefario try to corner the market in jelly making. Yes, life has definitely changed for Gru ...or has it in the sequel, Despicable Me 2? In this movie, Gru faces a larger challenge than being recruited by AVL (Anti-Villain League) for a mission. It's juggling the challenge of falling in love and handling your eldest daughter's sudden interest in boys at the same time. This reviewer can certainly relate.<br/><br/>She enjoyed how the writers delicately handled the adult theme and complexities of Gru's falling head over heels for his fellow AVL agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) without it being done overly dramatic or over the top that the kids would find too gross for them to enjoy the movie. It was handled in way even some of younger viewers could understand and laugh at the goofy things we adults go through when trying to ask a woman out on a date. There is one scene within Despicable Me 2 that fully explains why Gru has a difficult time meeting women that got plenty of laughs from all ages. Nice to see that the cooties joke is still popular with kids today. On the flip side, what's a kid's movie today without the occasional fart joke (as if this movie needed 23 to prove how funny they are)? *sighs* They may be funny but didn't generate much laughs from this reviewer's daughter ...perhaps she wasn't the target age group for that.<br/><br/>Also this reviewer liked the movies unique notion that villains are hiding amongst us including hatching evil plans inside our local malls like Eduardo/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who's son has caught the eye of Gru's eldest daughter. This sets up a the funny situation where Gru becomes the over protective father and then comforter when she experiences her first heartache. However, it's the minions that really keep this movie afloat and mostly funny especially when they insert iconic 70s nostalgia (i.e. YMCA and yes, there was a parent who actually embarrassed their kids with the infamous hand movements in the theater) to include the adult/parent viewer within the plot of Despicable Me 2. A word of caution - the intense scenes featuring the mutated purple minions might be a little too scary for viewers under 4. They did make a few kids cry .<br/><br/>Overall, Despicable Me 2 is a fairly decent family movie that kids of all ages can enjoy . Don't leave when the credits roll at the end of the movie or you might miss the funny extras!"

","I had a slight expectation for this movie and although it didn't meet my expectation. It's a decent movie that is somewhat entertaining for the most part but kinda dull and seems to drag in others. This time around Gru and his crew utilize more of what they have. And the minions this time actually makes more of a presence, which is a good thing. Except Gru is more of the good guy this time around, after the first movie. And this time it focuses in on more of the characters relationship aspect of things. Which is probably the best part about this movie besides the minions and maybe Agnes. It a alright watch but nothing really left and impression or all that memorable. And just didn't cross my mind as one of the best animated movie of the year kinda deal. There is quite a bit of 3D scenes but besides that, there really isn't much I can say about this movie. That I would recommend rushing out and seeing it in theater.

"Far-Sky","7","1","2","7 July 2013"," Sitcom-y but endearing in the best of ways
","Three years ago, Despicable Me launched Illumination Entertainment and announced Universal Studios as a viable player in the animation game (only Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks used to show up to these box-office battles). The film wasn't even the only supervillain animation to hit the theaters that year, but it did one-up its rival Megamind both in critical acclaim and commercial success.<br/><br/>Now, the original film's creative team returns with Despicable Me 2, continuing the adventures of former supervillain-cum-adopted father Gru, his precocious daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and his little, yellow, nonsense-spouting minions. Following closely on the first film's heels (this film gratifyingly puts a premium on continuity), the now-retired Gru is settling into his new paternal role, and while the spikier parts of his personality remain, he's reshaped himself into an adoring father and potential purveyor of jams (and jellies). When an evil plot threatens the globe, however, Gru finds himself pulled back into the supervillain game by the Anti-Villain League, who've recruited him to be the hero, an ersatz spy who knows how the mystery bad guy thinks. One earnest and delightfully overbearing partner introduction later, the pair (Gru and newbie AVL agent Lucy Wilde, played by Kristen Wiig) are undercover as bakers in a strip mall where the bad guy's scheme is likely to go down.<br/><br/>Despite the world being threatened, the stakes feel surprisingly low in the film; the archness of the plot never feels as real or immediate as the character interactions, which are enjoyable all the way through. Here, Gru realizes his loneliness, his neophyte partner realizes her true calling, and his daughters come to grips with new realizations and wishes. The characters take center stage, rarely letting the transparently-raised stakes of the plot machinations get in the way of sitcom-like character arcs such as the eldest daughter dating (and Gru's dogged insistence on undermining it) or little Agnes wanting a new mother. But that's sort of the magic of these films; despite the plot beats being the stuff of basic sitcoms, the setting and characters manage to still make the film a winning combination.<br/><br/>Steve Carell dusts off the strange Eastern European accent he originated for Gru, and manages to be both an amusing character and his own straight man. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher embody adorableness as the girls. But it's Wiig who steals the show as Agent Wilde, a professional woman who is also goofy and personable. Wiig and Carell have fantastic chemistry, even with just their voices in play.<br/><br/>The minions, those little yellow blobs in overalls that accompany all of the film's publicity, are back and hilarious as ever, despite their laser-like focus on slapstick and complete lack of intelligible dialogue. The Despicable films seem to be two separate animation genres welded together: the first is a heartfelt, Pixarian meditation on the nature of family, but the second is the part with the minions, which embody the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes more successfully than any of their predecessors. It's a strange melange that shouldn't work, but dammit, it does, and the resulting films wound up being both moving and guffaw-inducing.<br/><br/>The other aspect of the Despicable films that bowls me over is the virtual cinematography; truly, alongside the best of Pixar's output (like Wall-E), these are some of the most beautiful animated films ever made. The use of color, depth, and art are stunning, from Gru's Charles Addams-inspired design to the beautiful play of light, shadow, and color. This sequel follows the high standards of the first, and the result is a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that like the first film, this one is a trifle, but a very enjoyable one. It's little more than a victory lap for Carell and company, but when there are characters you can enjoy this much, what's wrong with spending another couple of hours with them?"
"reneemsm","9","1","2","7 July 2013"," Better than the first!
","Generally I am not a fan of sequels. Specifically the sequels to kids movies tend to just get dumber and dumber. Definitely NOT the case with Despicable Me 2. My husband & myself (30), our 3 kids (4, 6 & 8), my parents (in their 50's) and my little sister (21) all went to see this on the 4th of July b/c our park pans were rained out. We ALL laughed from the first minute to the last. It honestly starts off hilarious and just keeps the jokes coming the whole time. Another thing I liked about this one was that there were 2 scenes that had the adults laughing hysterically, that the kids didn't quite get. It was nice that it wasn't 100% aimed at the kids, so no matter the age everyone in the theater was laughing the whole time.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Gru as a great dad being responsible and fun, and it was nice to see him with a love interest. The girls are growing up a little so that was really cute to see and to see how Gru is reacting to that. My favorite thing about this one though, was that the Minions had such a BIG part. Half of the laughs were because of them which was great.<br/><br/>I would HIGHLY recommend seeing this one ASAP! (Though, you could probably skip the 3D aspect)."
"carolinejones-505-488042","9","1","2","6 July 2013"," Minion Mania
","You have to love a story where the bad guys have reinvented themselves as good guys. Gru (Steve Carell) has teamed up with Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) on their new business of producing jams and jelly. With that being said the creators had to find a new nemesis to fill the part; along comes El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who is intent on taking over the planet (what else is new). I guess he figured if bad guys can turn good then the reverse should also be possible and he has invented a potion that will do just that. Since no one knows more about how the evil mind works then Gru, he is enlisted by the Anti-Villain League to find and bring down the bad guy. Joining him in this effort is their newest agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig). Lucy swings into action as soon as she is introduced and I have to say that James Bond has nothing on this girl. While all this is going on, Gru is trying to be a normal parent to his adoptive daughters Edith (Dana Gaier), Agnes (Elise Fisher) and Margo (Miranda Cosgrove). Margo is having some issues of her own as she is experiencing puppy love for the first time with a very cute, leather-clad boy named Antonio (Moises Arias). Okay, on to the minions. Whoever invented these guys have a heck of an imagination and I am looking forward to their own film coming out. They were, of course, the funniest characters in this film. As I sat in the theater and watched kid after kid dragging in a stuffed minion, I thought that they loved them as much as I did. With all the big blockbusters this summer such as Man of Steel, Ironman 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness, I think that this film will stand up to all of them in terms of revenue. This film is as good as the first one and may even be better. I have to also say that it was full of action without being violent. There was also plenty of silliness, fun and even a bit of romance. I did not see this film in 3D but I could see parts that would have been very interesting in 3D. I would probably see more films in 3D if they ever came up with a way that you didn't have to wear those stupid glasses. Anyway, I recommend that you have a family day at the movies. I give this film a green light."

This one feels more like the Minions are the stars rather than Gru and his daughters. That being said, though, I'm still looking forward to the Minions movie next year. (Speaking of which, stay during the entire first half of the credits for a little teaser of that movie.) I felt this one had a stronger villain than the first one, better jokes, and just the right amount of silliness to make this one of the best animated films of the year.

"slicedbread117","9","1","3","27 August 2013"," More Minions only helps this wonderful sequel.
","Minions. They are everywhere. The popularity of these crazy little yellow things is running crazy and helping Despicable Me 2 smash the box office on the way, and for a good reason. They make Despicable Me 2 what it is: a hilarious, fun, and entertaining sequel to one of my favorite animated films of recent time.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the delightful Minions aren't the only thing that make the movie a joy to watch. The main (human) cast of characters return headed by funny man Steve Carell, reprising his role of now loving father and ex-villain, Gru. Carell's voice once again brings Gru to life and makes him simply hilarious. Aside from those Minions, Gru is the best and funniest character in the movie, delivering jokes for kids all ages and a couple of those under toned jokes for the adults. Along with Gru, Margo, Edith, and the oh so cute and funny Agnes return as the adopted daughters of Gru, though their roles are less than the first movie. Russel Brand returns to voice Dr. Nefario, who has few parts but once again adds nicely to the mix, and Kristen Wiig comes along to act as a love interest in the form of Lucy, who is funny at times, but also has her not-so-funny moments. But even with this great cast, they all are side stepped by the real show stoppers. The Minions.<br/><br/>The first Despicable Me, released in 2010, was an enormous hit, and to Universal's delight, spawned a new pop culture phenomenon in the Minions. While the first movie was fantastic, people wanted more Minions, and in Despicable Me 2, they answered the call. These wacky hilarious goof balls pop up in almost every scene of the movie and provide all kinds of laughs. Whether they're beating each other to a pulp, dressing up and playing make-believe, or cracking jokes and laughing about butts and farts, the Minions are just plain old fun to watch. They also play a much larger role in the overall story this time around, becoming subjects to main villain El Macho's (Benjamin Bratt) evil tests. To state it again, the Minions steal the show, and without them, Despicable Me wouldn't be half as popular as it is.<br/><br/>There really isn't too much more to say about this movie. The story was fun and provided a good mystery, but for older viewers such as myself, was pretty easy to figure out. Gru acts as a member of the Anti-Villain League, setting the stage for spy missions, as well as some action scenes, and they provide fun entertainment aside from the antics of the Minions.<br/><br/>Kids will love this movie inside and out. It is a very visually engaging film, it's very funny, goofy, and has those bits of action and mystery in it, not to mention again the Minions. Adults and older viewers should find just about the same joy in the movie, it's cute and provides jokes and funny moments that someone of any age can enjoy. Despicable Me 2 is a more than worthy sequel that gave fans what the asked for, and what the makes the movie great. Minions, Minions and more Minions!<br/><br/>9/10"

With this version, I sorta expected the cuteness, especially with all those minions, so I wasn't as disappointed as I partly was with the first one. In this one, Gru is recruited to help the anti-villain league with outing a former villain in a mall. An agent named Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig) is picked as his partner. Oh, and his kids are trying to play matchmaker for him. I'll stop there and just say that while I did enjoy this sequel, I didn't find myself thinking it was hilariously funny.

","Here is Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's second offering of the Steve Carell-voiced bogeyman, Mr Gru, and his anarchic, sweetcorn-shaped servants, the Minions.<br/><br/>Once again, the co-directors have put together a humorous and well-crafted 100 minutes of CGI entertainment that went down well with those children of all ages who watched it. Gru has moved away from the Dark Side and is now a responsible step-father of the three orphans he took under his wing in the first movie. He has also abandoned crime and villainy in favour of a failing attempt to make jams and jellies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately he cannot escape his past, and he finds himself embroiled in a fairly simple plot to recover a stolen item. I shouldn't give away too many spoilers but really there isn't a great deal to give away - U-rated films are never strong on plot and script! Lol.<br/><br/>What does stand out is Gru's determination to stay on the straight and narrow, and even more than that are the antics of the Minions, who have amazing chemistry and effortlessly lift up the movie.<br/><br/>If I have any criticisms it is that the film could have made more of its opportunities for the Minions to create mayhem, too much screen time was in the Mall and Dr Nefario was underused. Minor criticisms though.<br/><br/>If you have kids they will love this, and you will love it as well anyway! A very agreeable 100 minutes of entertainment. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Myself and my little brother decided to see this yesterday in the cinemas as the other film that were going to see Epic wasn't on so we had no choice but to watch our Plan B movie Despicable Me 2. <br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 is a follow up to the 2010 animated romp that follows on a villain named Gru(voiced by Steve Carrell in a Russian Accent)who was planning to take over the world with his sidekicks the minions and his Professor(voiced by Russell Brand sporting an old man's voice)and wanting to steal the moon,that is until 3 little girls takes his heart and he decides not to be the bad guy anymore. THIS TIME....HOWEVER his adopted daughter Angus is celebrating her birthday but she is missing the most important thing in her family...YUP she doesn't have a mother. So Gru's 3 girls decide to set Gru up on a date but when a mysterious red head named Lucy(voiced by Bridesmaids Kirsten Wigg)comes into his life he teams up with her to take out the new bad villain in town (voiced by an unrecognizable Benjamin Bratt from Catwoman),but of course as they try and take him down,the two (yup you guessed it) they fall in love. <br/><br/>So what do I like about this movie; well first off the charcthers and I have to admit but I love the Minions because I'm really not kidding here but these little yellow creatures are SO HILARIOUS especially when they sing there own version of ALL 4 One's I Swear replacing the words with gibberish words and doing a cover of YMCA again with gibberish words. Also I like the music too by Pharell Williams.<br/><br/>Now to the negativity; the charcther design for Gru's love interest who is a carbon copy of Audrey from The Lorax(if you seen it she's voiced by Taylor Swift). I mean the hair,the eyes she's LITERALLY a carbon copy of her I mean were the animators lazy not to come up with something different for her design. Also the story has been done before.A single father being roped by his daughter and falls in love and yeah if you seen it you can smell the ending A MILE AWAY.<br/><br/>Overall I was glad I saw it yesterday and even my 5 year old brother loved it,as did I(22 a female who loves watching animated movies).<br/><br/>Heck I'm giving it a 9 out of 10."

","We loved DM1, and loved DM2 as much if not more (more Minions means more laughs!!). My 8 and 10 year old's were all smiles pretty much the entire movie with the entire sold out crowd all in sync in the non stop laughter. I read a couple so-called ""movie reviewer's"" slamming it. <br/><br/>I don't know what movie they were watching but even Mom and I loved it too, awesome movie. The Minions steal the movie (sure this is of no surprise to anyone!). Carrell and Bridesmaid star Kirsten were great voices and were a great animation love story that unfolds in front of your eyes. <br/><br/>Now the kids are going to drive us crazy to take them to see it again.

"paavanpshukla","7","1","3","4 July 2013"," Just as fresh as the original one! cant recommend enough
","Despicable me 2 This is probably the first time when a animated series' sequel has surpassed the excellence of the original movie. It was fairly unique as instead of the typical good guy as the main character, they put up a villain as the protagonist (although he ended up good) which made it more refreshing and more fun to watch. Aside from his pointy nose and hilarious accent, we were also invited to spend some time with the extremely adorable and mischievous yellow Minions, who speak almost entirely incomprehensibly in their own unique language. This time around, Gru's no longer a villain. The comedy here works too. The jokes are humorous and most of them work for all ages. Some of them may not be original or repetitive, but they're still able to give you a laugh. And it doesn't hurt that an incredible cast was behind the delivery of the jokes here. Steve Carell was charming as usual and he never fails to impress with his excellent voice portrayal of Gru. The rest of the cast was superb too. I for one,Liked the visual effects in this more than I did of Life of Pi. The sets were also very vibrant and colorful. They're so wonderful that they make the film come to life. Everything is splendid about the setting. They're also very detailed and it's just a treat for the eyes. The animation too is just eye- popping. All the characters' movements are extremely detailed and very smooth. The 3D is more of an optional choice though, but some scenes are especially tailored for 3D as they literally pop out of the screen, especially the end credits. Don't miss that one. <br/><br/>High points- Animation, dialogues and end credit Lows- a bit scary for lil ones Verdict- Just as fresh as the original one. I cant recommend enough!  7 on 10"
"agmoldham","5","1","4","16 July 2013"," Fairly entertaining
","Having seen a trailer for Despicable Me 2 I was quite looking forward to watching the movie. Most animated films are aimed at adults as well as children and DM2 is no exception although the focus is probably more towards the children. I saw the 3d version of the film and there are some scenes which were undoubtedly better in 3d. The end credits are a particular example.<br/><br/>The storyline revolves around Gru a retired crook being hired by the anti villain league and being paired with the rather pretty Lucy. They investigate a crime and the movie is always watchable, but never quite memorable. Overall pretty entertaining and sure kids will love it."
"TheMovonka","7","1","4","14 July 2013"," What would Gru be without his Mignons...Mignons FTW!!
","They are back, even when I did not know how much I missed them. The sequel of ""Despicable Me"" was none of my most anticipated movies of this year. Neither has the original movie been the big milestone of animated movies. Still the story around the super villain Gru, three little orphans and above all the little yellow helping fellers, his mignons, was entertaining and had some unforgettable scenes. I just say ""fluffy"". Now the creators had a hard job to do. Gru became a ""nice"" father, ended his evil career and became business man. Ordinary problems like annoying neighbors and hyperactive kids can only be managed with his army of clumsy yellow guys. But his past reputation gets Gru a job at the AntiVillainLeague, where his know-how should be used to catch another bad guy. The story begins<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, because I guess everybody knows that Gru will succeed, this sequel shows how it is done! Creators really listened to the fans and did a remarkable job. They took everything what was great in the original movie, what had the highest potential and bundled it together to create a hilarious and enjoyable sequel, bigger and richer in variety, similar to the step ""Shrek""/""Shrek 2"". More of big eyed Agnes and much much more of mignons are the main pillars which prop the new adventure of Gru as Secret Agent. What is more, new characters like Mr. RamsBOTTOM and crazy Lucy, Grus big fan and more than just a helping hand, enrich this story tremendously.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""Despicable Me 2"" shows in special graphic style how movie ideas should be developed and how entertainment potential can be used effectively. With more screen time, the mignons may finally live up to the importance they deserve and I would not be shocked, if a mignon-spin off would follow. In short, great fun for every age!"
"Anurag-Shetty","8","1","4","6 July 2013"," A fun sequel for the whole family!
","Despicable Me 2 continues with the story of ex criminal Gru(Steve Carell), who is now living the domestic dad life & focusing more on his jam/jelly business. Soon however, Lucy(Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villain League, recruits Gru to stop a new criminal who is injecting a serum into animals which turn them into indestructible killing machines. <br/><br/>This was an extremely funny & entertaining film. Gru's minions were hilarious as ever! The 3D was spectacular. A note on the voice acting. Steve Carell was outstanding as Gru. I love that weird accent that Gru talks in. Kristen Wiig was great as Lucy. Benjamin Bratt was spectacular as Eduardo/El Macho. Miranda Cosgrove was impressive as Margo. Dana Gaier was effective as Edith. Elsie Kate Fisher was adorable as Agnes. Agnes was the cutest character in the film. Russell Brand & Ken Jeong were hilarious as Dr. Nefario & Floyd respectively. I loved this film but I think I liked the first one a little better. But still, if you were a fan of the first one then, Despicable Me 2 is a must watch."
"sddavis63","9","1","4","5 July 2013"," A Good Story And It Left Me With Tears In My Eyes From Laughing
","I am truly delighted to see that this movie gets a good rating. So many good animated films get low ratings I suspect because adults just don't get them. Obviously people are getting ""Despicable Me 2."" I just left the theatre not too long ago, and it's one of the few times that I've had a movie leave with with tears in my eyes from laughing. It's a very funny movie - one that gets funnier as it moves along; one whose funniest moments in my opinion (and from the laughter in the theatre) came at the very end. It's a tremendously worthy sequel to the original, which was also very good. In fact, I think I enjoyed this more than I did the original.<br/><br/>The villain Gru is back once again, but this time he's more of an anti- villain. He's busy playing daddy to the three little girls he adopted in the first movie, and he's turned his crime lab into a jam and jelly making factory. But an unknown villain appears on the scene threatening the world, and Gru is recruited by the ""Anti-Villain League"" to use his villainous expertise to find out who it is. He's partnered with Lucy, who - predictably enough - becomes a love interest for him. But somehow the ""romance"" doesn't distract from the story the way they so often do. It added to the story. It gave us a better sense of Gru - who he was and where he came from. It worked surprisingly well.<br/><br/>And, of course, there are the minions. All sorts of minions. Everywhere and all over and in almost every scene it seemed. And they're just as funny as they were in the first movie as well.<br/><br/>The best part of this is that it's not just a cartoon, and it's not just for kids, and it's not a weak sequel. It has a story to it; a plot that actually works and keeps the viewer surprisingly interested all the way through. Everybody involved with this deserves credit for putting out a winner. My one piece of advice is not to simply get up and leave when the credits start to roll! (9/10)"
"aldri-feb","6","1","4","4 July 2013"," Lacks it's originality, but undeniably cute
","Honestly there's nothing new that 'Despicable Me 2' offers especially in storyline. It's more about Gru a-changed-man (after being villain at the first movie) is recruited by an institution to undercover and reveal a crime. He is accompanied by Lucy, his new partner and of course the minions to find out who's the bad guy and what's he planning.<br/><br/>A spy thing and fighting against bad guy has already been common these days. Besides the studio make the same formula like in any those movies and most of times are predictable. The conclusion for massive conflict is also very simple that makes audience exhausted and would feel they're watching a repeatable movies. Gru's character who become a hero this time is boring, I still prefer to see a bad Gru which is quite impossible. Luckily, they have cute characters (Minions and Agnes) that audience wouldn't mind to see it although having poor storyline. Just seeing Minions move, walk or talk would make people at least smile. Minions have more portions in this movie which is reasonable and not surprising. If it wasn't Minions character, 'Despicable Me 2' would be so horrible and disappointed. Overall, 'Despicable Me 2' is just an ordinary animation movie but still enjoyable to watch. What makes it special because of the cuteness of Minions and Agnes that save the entire film. Just bring kids watching these, they're definitely gonna love it."
"snazzyo","10","1","4","29 June 2013"," Fantastic Visual Treat
","I got to watch the advance screening, and I have to say, it was one of the best I have seen. The movie nicely blended together fantastic imagery, distinctive music, hilarious comedy and an original plot line.<br/><br/>The animation is crisp and clean. The 3D isn't overused and all ""in- your-face"". There are many stunning settings and locations; each one has obviously designed with great care to depict a particular mood or atmosphere. Combined with the various angles used (first and second person, bird's eye views), this movie is a delightful visual treat. <br/><br/>Story-wise, Despicable Me 2 wasn't a great as the visuals, but formidable just the same. Yes, there was character development and an easy-to- follow plot-line, but it seemed just a little bit weak. The movie didn't tie up some loose ends, but they were trivial and seriously don't detract from the overall story.<br/><br/>The music of Despicable Me 2 is very distinctive, both compared to other movies and between different scenes and environments. There is edgy, electronic music, upbeat spy music, rhythmic salsa music, and of course, the ""Despicable Me"" theme song.<br/><br/>Despicable Me 2 does a fantastic job appealing to both the kids and the adults. A rule of thumb is that anything the minions do, the kids will laugh at it. the adults get an impressive mix of pop songs in the 80s- 90s, however they are usually sung in the minion's gibberish."
"GoUSN","5","1","5","9 July 2013"," Whole is less than sum of the parts . . .
","This film was a series of sight, sound and writing gags that had almost no continuity, and while funny, did not result in a coherent narrative.<br/><br/>The first Despicable Me suffered nearly the identical fate, but the parts of that whole were more robust and formidable - the cruel mother; the dastardly foe; the extreme crime; and just the novelty of all of the unusual imagery.<br/><br/>Here? Each part was much reduced. Light laughter, a few LOLs, but zero engagement with the meager plot. I was never drawn into the story, because the story was just a bunch of slight laughs trying to operate as a plot.<br/><br/>And isn't anyone going to comment on the notion of the female protagonist being a red-head named Lucy with her hair tied back in a bun? I mean, come on . . . . ."
"Suzie70287","5","1","6","27 July 2013"," Likable but not as good as first. A little small minded
","This movie was a little fun. Especially when the minions are involved but honestly, I am so sick of Disney/Pixar feeling they have to turn to the 'love story' as a result for creating a plot. And the fact that this film had a ""everyone should have a mommy"" sub-plot in it made me really upset for all the children out there watching it that have a single-parent house-hold (which is a lot of kids out there). The original was more positive since three girls were being adopted from an orphanage (positive and an inspiration for children in an orphanage or not-so-good-household)in which all they wanted was someone to love them (which in the end happens in the original story) but now the focus has been switched to everyone has to find love to be happy 'with a significant other'. I feel this is a step backward for people's moral values. Don't get me wrong, I saw it in 3D which I would recommend (especially at the end with the Minions!!!) but if you are expecting it to exceed the original, as far as funniness, you're wrong. Otherwise, it's a good kids movie with enjoyable parts and I would definitely rent it if you have a 3D TV."

","The first computer animated film, released around the same time as nearly similar Megamind, was a lot of fun and a great success, so a sequel seemed inevitable, and this of course was going to continue where the story left off. Basically former super villain Gru (Steve Carell) has settled into his new life as a father figure looking after the three girls he adopted previously, orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and making an honest living making and selling jams. Meanwhile a secret laboratory in the Arctic has been stolen by an unknown villain, so the Anti-Villain League (AVL) wants to recruit Gru to go undercover and investigate to find the main reason the lab was stolen, a mutating chemical compound, PX-41, that can turn living things into indestructible destructive monsters. He at first refuses, but changes his mind knowing the jam being produced by the Minions tastes disgusting, and his research scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) leaves him admitting he misses being evil and trying to take over the world, and he is partnered with eccentric but efficient enough AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Bridesmaids star Kristen Wiig). They find a chemical scent has been coming from The Paradise Shopping Mall, and Gru recognises mall restaurant owner Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) may in fact be thought-to-be-dead super villain El Macho, who was last seen near an active volcano before disappearing. He becomes Gru's prime suspect, but his judgement may be overshadowed by his dislike of the relationship between Margo and Eduardo's son Antonio (Moises Arias), and his over-protectiveness is making his suspicions unconvincing for the AVL, and he is slowly developing feelings for Lucy. Meanwhile the Minions are slowly being kidnapped and subjected to the PX-41 mutagen, and they are turning from yellow lovable characters into purple and furry monsters that will eat and destroy anything, while their leader is humiliated and dropped as recruited investigator, with his credibility damaged. Gru is proved right about his theory with Eduardo being El Macho, an antidote is developed by a returned Dr. Nefario which will instantly revive all the turned Minions, El Macho is defeated being turned into a purple monster and taken away, and having established their love for each other Gru and Lucy get married. Also starring Steve Coogan as Silas Ramsbottom, Nasim Pedrad as Jillian and Ken Jeong as Floyd. As before Carell is really funny with his crazy James Bond style villain accent, Wiig is a good new addition as his bonkers but fun love interest, and Brand gets his small moments as the weird scientist. The story seeing the former villain going back to his routes is filled with plenty of action and laughs, he may not be trying to steal the Moon or have any other mad plot, but he remains the same grouchy character, the love story is nice, and all scenes featuring the yellow pill shaped Minions are so much fun, with their gobbledygook language being used hilariously during song ""Y.M.C.A."" and ""I Swear"", it is a funny and enjoyable family animated comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature and Best Song for ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!"

","Former supervillain Gru (Carell) is now concentrating on being a full-time dad to the three orphans he has adopted, but he's called into action by Agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig) and the Anti-Villain League to investigate the theft of a top-secret lab.
It's all very well renouncing the villainy business and recasting yourself as a devoted father of three girls, but what next? That's the dilemma facing Steve Carell's Gru as we rejoin him here, adjusting to a world of children's parties and soccer moms while trying to retool his evil empire towards the production of jams and jellies. It's clearly a relief when he's called back into action by Steve Coogan's Silas Ramsbottom and something called the Anti-Villain League to investigate the theft of an entire lab and its monster-creating serum.
Of course, that plot is barely the skeleton of this shaggy-dog story, which sags in the middle before racing towards an entertaining conclusion. Gru also has to cope (badly) as one daughter wishes he'd find her a mother and another takes her first teetering steps into the dating arena. There's a generally baffling segment where Gru is sent undercover in a mall to try to figure out which shop owner has the stolen goods - a proposition that barely even makes sense by kids' videogame standards - but the best moments see the tragically insecure Gru finally take a risk with Kristen Wiig's winsome Agent Wilde, a highly competent and enthusiastic member of the AVL.
Then, of course, there are the Minions, the yellow happy pills who reliably reduce child cinemagoers to puddles of giggles. The biggest laughs of the film, at least beyond Carell's outrageous accent, come from the Minions' looney-tunes, strangely benign mutual violence. Their role has been beefed up ahead of their own spin-off movie coming next; by comparison, the villain of the piece barely gets a look-in, and two of Gru's daughters are affectionately neglected. His assistants' dominance is a little unfair to Gru himself - he's a good enough character that a more focused script and stronger story might make him an icon in his own right - but it's hard to quibble with the likable distractions that surround him."
"Animany94","9","0","1","12 February 2019"," Still got the charm.
","The original was adorable and very funny, and even though its sequel lives on that it's still well done and captures what made the original so loveable.<br/><br/>Gru is now looking out for the three girls, Agnes, Edith and Margo while being recruited by the Anti Villain League to capture the mastermind behind a mysterious abduction of an entire laboratory from the arctic circle.<br/><br/>He ends up working with the enthusiastic Lucy Wilde and then the fun begins. They go through so many hilarious scenes together, and give the minions a run for their money.<br/><br/>Saying much more would be spoiling the movie's central plot points, but let's put it this way: Despicable Me 2 delivers what is expected but does not feel like a rehash at all with the heart and the humour still being top-notch."

The minions have a central and maybe main role in the film that is not focused so much on the girls as to Gru's love life. And here is were the movie gets more adult friendly. Sure the villain and all the guns and even the monsters are specifically designed for children, but the movie is funny, however not as funny as the first one.

"Writer_Commentary","8","0","1","7 September 2014"," Great Sequel
","If you saw the first Despicable Me, you probably didn't think that it would ever need a sequel. But this movie fits in with the series perfectly. It gives you all of what you probably loved about the first film and gave you a new great story to enjoy. This movie is pretty good for any age to watch. I'll admit that some parts of this movie follows predictable story lines that you see in mostly any movie. But, there's enough in here that'll surprise you if you've never seen it before. I highly recommend it to anyone. As a PG movie you might have to put up with some crudity that you otherwise wouldn't, but that tends to happen in a lot of good movies. So if you are looking for a good use of time, then you might want to see this movie."
"Mr-Fusion","8","0","1","17 August 2014"," Genuinely lovable; a worthy sequel, consistent jokes and that same sense of humor from the first movie
","Despite the great voice talent involved, DESPICABLE ME 2 is really about the minions. The lion's share of the film's laughs come from them, and they are its comedic muscle. It's not hard to see that the little yellow Twinkies are the franchise's marketing bread and butter, but they're so shot up with personality and Three Stooges violence, that that's not at all a bad thing. <br/><br/>And the laughs haven't diminished with each subsequent viewing. The movie has me in stitches at every turn, and it does feature one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema (""Bee-do bee-do bee-do). Not to mention the singularly most infectious pop song in 30 years (""Happy""), and the 21 Fart Gun Salute, which I can only hope to arrange for my funeral. <br/><br/>Regardless of where they go for the next movie (straight-up sequel or a full-on Minions movie), I say bring it on.

","This is what often happens with sequels, they disappoint the viewer – this means they are not as interesting as the first movie. This movie is not funny by any level and the character Gru lacks what he brought in the original movie (unpredictable behavior). I actually admired the character in the first movie, and some of that evilness in Gru should have stayed with the Character. This is what the title is based on (despicable me. Any change in the character takes the whole concept out and the movie becomes a repetition of hundreds of movies where the hero is at risk and then get saved at the last minute. The whole plot is stupid and ""déjà vu"". I am just surprised and disappointed with the level of this movie."

"badoli","4","0","1","7 December 2013"," This movie tried too hard to play it safe.
","I loved the first ""Despicable Me"", as it was a great movie. All the ingredients were there: The anti-hero Gru using three orphan girls to take on the world, while they use him to evade their orphanage and in the course of actions they all find themselves being a family. Simple and beautiful. Hence i was skeptical when i found out there was a second movie coming. And rightly so.<br/><br/>Sure, for itself it still is an acceptable movie with cute jokes. But it doesn't have the emotional values of the first one. The story is a slapstick secret agent plot garnished with some superficial coming-of-age ideas and a kitschy love-story. Nothing serious, about the depth of an average sitcom. It just plays safe.<br/><br/>And by doing that it sorta kicks the soul of its predecessor overboard. The worst is how the mandatory happy-end is handled. If you already bought the DVD, spare yourself the last five minutes, as they feel glued on with sugar icing. But honestly, spare yourself the whole movie, it's hardly the same quality as the first one."

","Judging by the title this must be the follow up to the mildly original animated supervillain flick...by jove it is! Now that first film was cute and reasonably fresh, fresh in the sense that the main character Gru was quite a nice design and voiced nicely by Carell. Also the 'minions' were a neat little invention that did garner the bulk of the giggles and kept the film afloat. The down side was it was yet another superhero/supervillain/super spy parody/spoof type flick which has become a saturated genre.<br/><br/>The big question for me was simply...did we really need this sequel? my answer to that is no. Yeah yeah I know I sound like a Scrooge but come on, really, this film has been so padded out its painful. The plot is so damn linear, supervillain up to no good, someone has to stop him, that someone is Gru. The first film had the neat little twist that the main character was a villain and becomes a goodie, switches sides. This time its just you're bog standard run of the mill superhero/super spy flick.<br/><br/>The problem for me her was nothing really interesting happens, there is nothing to explain, no reason for anything at all. Gru is now a good guy, he's got out of the villain/hero/spy game and he's looking after those sickeningly cute kids which he adopted from the first film. That's it! there is nothing more, did we really need a new film to show us this? oh yeah Gru gets a call to help the 'Anti Villain League' to stop some other villain blah blah blah who cares. The point is none of this was needed, the first film was a reasonably decent quirky animated film that worked well on its own, there was no need to milk it Hollywood sheesh!<br/><br/>What I wanna know is what are these minions exactly? what do they speak? where do they come from? and how many of them are there?! In this film there appears to be like...hundreds n hundreds of em! Yes its just a kids espionage cartoon and its not important as such but its just something I'm curious about.<br/><br/>I mean sure the film looks great as do all animated films these days, but there is just nothing on offer here that warrants the sequel. One or two new characters amongst all the same visual gags, visual action, childish minion tomfoolery, gadgets and general super spy-like jiggery pokery. OK call me a misery but none of it felt worth it to me, it all fell totally flat, lifeless and stale.<br/><br/>One thing I will mention is actually how scary it could be for kids. When those little yellow minions get turned into purple monster zombie minions the film does take a turn to the slightly eerie side. Especially the sequence where one of them is chasing the kids, Jesus its almost like a homage to 'Alien'!<br/><br/>End of the day it doesn't really matter how eye blisteringly good the CGI is, if its all the same stuff trundled out all over again from the first film it will just feel like a cheap merchandise machine to me. The finale isn't too bad and ups the excitement somewhat but it still can't detract from a very anti climatic ending. The very final sequence with the kids right at the end is so disgustingly sickening I virtually gagged...good grief (mental note...its a kids film, its a kids film). <br/><br/>Anyway no originality whatsoever anywhere, but bottom line if you liked the first then you'll like this I guess. I thought the first was reasonable but nothing overly special, so for me this has gone downhill. Am I being too hard on a kids film? well maybe but the film is so revoltingly sweet n sugary at times with zero originality I just can't sit back and not say it out loud."

","Simply fun sequel to the animated surprise hit of 2010. Gru and his legions of minions are back, but no longer driven by the need to exact evil schemes on an unsuspecting world, as Gru (still voiced with a outrageously hilarious accent by Steve Carell) has taken to his role as a father figure for his three orphan girls Edith, Agnes and Margo quite seriously. The big question on the girls' minds of course is – much to Gru's chagrin – 'when will there be a surrogate mother too'? Apparently several thousand minions are not enough to fill that particular role, so Gru has to endure countless matchmaking on their part. Fortunately for him, he quickly finds himself abducted by agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig returning for the sequel, but voicing another character) of the AVL, the American Vampire League Anti Villain League, who means to recruit him to smoke out a threat to world peace apparently hiding in a shopping mall, potentially posing as one of many goofy shop owners. Gru hesitantly accepts the job, if only to escape his girls' endless romantic pestering. Needless to say, Lucy and Gru soon get romantically entangled while attempting to stop the outrageously stereotypically Mexican baddie El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) from completing his vile scheme to unleash thousands of vicious purple monsters (most of them harvested from Gru's own minions) on mankind. Though the plot leaves little room for narrative surprises, the infectious charm of the characters and a plethora of witty jokes for young and old make for a thoroughly enjoyable animated flick. As before, it's the endearing minions that steal the show – a fact that has already been confirmed to deliver them their own movie next year, which may not be such a good idea – but thanks to the effective emphasis on Gru's own plot line, including a flashback to his youth which is both sad and superbly funny, it also becomes ever more evident just what a droll character he is himself, considering he spends most of his time without his minions and vice versa, while the movie doesn't end up either boring or less hilarious whenever either party takes center stage (also thanks to Wiig's obvious enthusiasm). Though more attention on an original plot would be welcome for the unavoidable next installment, I can unabashedly say I'm looking forward to a Despicable Me 3 regardless. Preferably with both Gru and minions together once more instead of one or the other."

","This movie was extremely funny which was to be expected because of the first movie. This movie has funny moments, romantic moments, and just plain cute moments. The actors and actresses in this movie are perfect for the characters. I do not know who came up with the minions in the first movie, but whoever it was, I give them kudos! The minions make this movie so much more worth seeing. They definitely add to the comedic side of the movie. The story line of this movie was pretty standard, but the writer put a fun twist on it. The character designs match the characters personalities perfectly, which they probably do on purpose, but I still thought I would say, ""Job well done."" I took my two year old niece to this movie, and as we were sitting in the theater, I noticed that she was speechless throughout the whole movie. She was entranced. She cracked-up whenever the minions where on. Let me just say that for a two year old to sit that well through a movie must mean it is pretty good. All in all, I would definitely put this movie on your ""must watch"" list; you will not be disappointed."

","Despicable Me 2 is the sequel to the first Despicable Me which I liked. In fact I liked it more than other people. I saw the movie in 3D and it's OK but not really worth your hard earned cash. My main problem was it was too cliché and I knew what was going to happened in the film which was sad. But it's biggest star are the Minions they are hilarious. They saved this movie and they turned it into comedic gold. The movie was funnier than Monsters University by a mile. But my main problem is it is just a huge comedy there is barely any depth. Sure this is the biggest laughs I had in the cinema and I had a great time overall. This movie is worth your time and hard earned cash."

","This is the most singular take on the film that I've read so far. Well done! Being somewhat extreme, I think anybody who doesn't like this movie, doesn't like cinema in general. It has everything one could want in a film. What struck me is that as large and hulking the film may seem, it is also something of a triumph of understatement. I hate to use this word, but I think it's a masterpiece.I thought it was very well done, but frankly was hard to follow especially the last half hour. Understood the premise but spent most of the movies saying ""Wait. What's going on?"" Wish DVD had commentary on it. its really really good film to watch and i like it."
"Al_The_Strange","8","0","1","15 July 2013"," Despicable Me 2 review
","The first Despicable Me film has come out as a personal favorite among CGI-animations; it is a zany world of mad supervillains, awesome gadgets and superweapons, funny characters, and some of the most quotable and most hilarious dialogue I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>This second film offers more of the same, for better or for worse. It does still dish out huge helpings of imaginative gadgets, transforming vehicles, crazy weapons, and mad villains. There's still a huge amount of slappy, silly comedy, amusing dialogue, and fun characters. The minions are back in full force, often stealing the show with their zany antics and unique lingo.<br/><br/>The only problem is, something feels out of place. Part of it is the comedy; there's certainly a lot of physical gags at work, but it doesn't feel as fresh or memorable as the first film. The dialogue is also lacking in particularly memorable or quotable lines. The gags feel like they're aiming more and more at the kids, and while they'll certainly get a kick out of everything, it'll leave the adults wishing there was something more.<br/><br/>I think the plot is also to blame. It is notable for progressing the characters along in their relationships. In doing so, it puts out a number of individual subplots that don't really tie into the main story. The subplots in the first film at least tied in with the main conflict, but here, it's purely distracting and random. That being said, I did enjoy the characters and their nuances.<br/><br/>This film utilizes the same animation style and quality as the first film. It shows a little more ambition as it fills up the screen with endless minions and detailed settings. Movements are cartoony and exaggerated, as before. Character designs are pretty much the same as before; they're wild, but distinctive. Even though some viewers found Kristen Wiig's character a little too animated and wacky, I enjoyed watching her. Voice-acting from the whole cast is great. The writing is okay. Designs for all the settings, props, costumes, and creatures are decent. Music is pretty lively and fun.<br/><br/>I personally favor the first film over this sequel, but it is fun to see the characters and minions back in action, and to see new faces and new gizmos on display. Unfortunately, the film seems to aim more at the lowest-common denominator, and the plot suffers a little; it's great for kids, okay for adults, and would be worth a rental for anybody who wants more of Gru and the imaginative world he inhabits.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)"
"Hellmant","6","0","2","10 July 2013"," I'd rate this film on about the same level as the first.
","'DESPICABLE ME 2': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Sequel to the 2010 hit animated film about an evil criminal mastermind named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) working with an army of minions in a plot to steal the moon. He has a change of heart when he befriends three orphan girls. The sequel begins with Gru now a family man, raising the three girls, and working as a legitimate businessman trying to produce jam. That all changes when he's recruited by the Anti-Villain league to help stop a new powerful supervillain. The film was once again directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It features the voice talents of Russell Brand and Miranda Cosgrove, reprising their roles from the original film, and Kristen Wiig and Ken Jeong are back as well (but playing different, bigger parts than they did in the first film). Steve Coogan joins the cast this time as well and Benjamin Bratt voices the main villain (who was originally voiced by Al Pacino but he dropped out of the film because of 'creative differences'). The movie is about as clever and amusing as the first; if you enjoyed that film you're almost sure to enjoy this one as well.<br/><br/>The film opens with the theft of a secret Arctic laboratory (by a flying vehicle using a magnet). A chemical, which mutates ordinary animals into viscous killing creatures, was inside the lab so naturally the Anti-Villain league (AVL) is concerned. They turn to Gru (Carell) for help. AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Wiig) abducts Gru from his home and transports him to the secret underwater AVL base. Once there Gru meets the AVL league director, Silas Ramsbottom (Coogan), who informs him of the laboratory heist and asks him for his help catching the supervillain responsible for it. Gru initially rejects their request but later decides to help the AVL after all. He's teamed with Agent Wilde and of course romance blossoms.<br/><br/>The movie (like the original) captures that old style cartoon feel well. It was made on a budget of just $76 million. Compared to other big animated films that's pretty low and compared to how much money it's making that makes it a hugely profitable film (like the first)! Do I think it deserves it's humongous blockbuster success? No but I don't think any of the kids' animated films out today like this do. This one is at least better than average; It's funny (at times) and Carell and the rest of the cast are good in their parts. The minions are a little too gimmicky for me but they're funny at times as well. I'd rate this film on about the same level as the first, I'd have to watch the original again to say if it's better (because I don't completely remember it) but it's definitely a decent crowd pleasing sequel.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n28SgCY6lwc"

","DESPICABLE ME 2<br/><br/>It was a very funny film, but nowhere near as good as the original movie.<br/><br/>Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to track down a super villain who has stolen an entire research lab from the Arctic. Gru has to investigate this crime with his new partner, Lucy. Whilst all this is going on, his oldest daughter has started to find boys attractive which then leads Gru to anger and he has to do his investigations whilst watching his daughter with this new boy... and if that wasn't enough, his minions are getting kidnapped too.<br/><br/>The story was enjoyable, and the characters were brilliant. The thing I noticed about this film the most though, is they film makers knew that the minions were really popular from the original movie, so they made them more of the main characters in this one. I thought the minions had the funny parts and were the main advertising technique they used for the film. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with, was the really funny bits of the movie were shown in the trailer... there are other really good bits, but most of the them I had already seen.<br/><br/>The voice cast was quite impressive, but I never understood why. Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Mirander Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Ken Jeong & Steve Coogan are the voices. Why would the movie company pay so much more for famous people to use their voices, when they could clearly find someone unknown and the audience would not know the difference? Especially Steve and Russell... if I didn't already know that they did these voices, I would never had recognised them, so surely they could have found someone cheaper. But I don't mind... it's their money. I suppose it is just to draw in the crowd a bit more.<br/><br/>This movie is great for kids and will keep them quiet and entertained for the duration. Very funny & great fun.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Very good, but not as good as the first<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

I like the fact that Gru's children still have a lot of importance in this movie, they are not useless characters. The villain was great, but we didn't get to see a lot of him, and the final fight between him and Gru was really short. finally, great memorable movie, its good to show these kinds of movies for kids than Selena Gomez's movies"

"sniper_grenade","6","0","1","7 July 2013"," Despicable Me 2 has tonnes of cuteness, but little else...
","We went to watch this film together in a group of about 20 people. It was a midnight screening, and after a long day (we were in a training camp), I had expect the film to entertain and cheer us all up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately halfway into the film, many of us were pretty bored by the relatively lack of interesting plot lines.<br/><br/>The characters, other than being very cute, have little else. I don't really feel for them. It's like they lack real depth in their characters and personalities. There are just too many minions in the film, in the end they will all appear as ""that little cute yellow thing"".<br/><br/>To me, the main problem with this film is that many of the punchlines are fairly predictable, we aren't really laughing out that much throughout the film. It depends way too much on sheer cuteness of the minions, and also the over-the-top, exaggerated character animations or actions. It lacks genuine comedy wit, and cuteness can only do so much.<br/><br/>It's not that just guys find that the movies fairly disappointing, many of the girls felt the same way as well.<br/><br/>It's a nice movie, but just don't put too much expectation on it."
"sarbajit-de","8","0","1","5 July 2013"," The Minions are probably one of the funniest characters ever created.
","My review of 'Despicable Me2':<br/><br/>Got to watch 'Despicable Me' - the first part just a few days back.Yes I know I was very late and was surely left wondering at the end of it 'Just what the hell took me so long to watch this piece of animation all this while?'.It was downright enjoyable so with the hilarious trailers of the sequel hitting the scene I was like all eager to watch it in 3D at the theatre. There are only a very few movies which I go and watch on the big screen unless its running at my favorite theatre in town coz of the EXPerience factor. 'Despicable Me' was really good and the the trailers of this sequel were so convincing that it had to be one of those exceptional cases. <br/><br/>The first part was definitely original and introduced us to the amazingly cute and hilarious world of minions - the tiny yellow beings :) 'Despicable Me 2' borrows the theme and builds on from its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. The story is kept quite simple while focusing on the character development of its protagonist the 'Gru'. There are different shades to Gru's character which we get to witness in this one. He is quite a different man now in this one from the one we used to know in the first half of 'Despicable Me'. His affectionate, protective, romantic ( or not so romantic at times ) and caring nature is revealed. The three girls whom he had adopted also are quite smart now and one can't simply resist oneself but fall for the irresistible cuteness of the youngest of them Agnes. I mean there quite a few scenes between Gru and her which would melt your heart and make you go 'Aawwwwww....'. The introduction of the character of Lucy as the eccentric and sweet spy agent is very well done. No I won't give away spoilers here but you will know what I am talking about once you watch it :) But for me the show stealers got to be the incredibly unique minions. Hats off to the person(or team) in whose mind the idea of creating such characters was born.I mean there are hundreds of them and if you ask me they account for the funniest parts of the movie. They are adorable , confused, cute and convincingly funny little beings.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the voice overs now. After watching the first part I felt that Steve Carell as the voice of Gru couldn't have done it any better but honestly he beat me to it. I mean being a non Latino himself how does he manage to pull off that kind of Hispanic accent with so much ease? Hats off to this man really who also happens to be one of the funniest American celebrities. OK now Gru is at least human but how to manage to voice over for one of the funniest characters ever 'the Minions' ? Leave that job to Pierre Coffin and what you get is an unique and downright hilarious dialect even though you don't understand most of it lol. I mean I still can't get over that 'Silas Ramsbottom. bottom ..hehehaha..' part really. There's a song sung by the Minions at the end. Let me know what you think of it.<br/><br/>Technically the film is gorgeous. With the skill level of the artists and animators and with the kind of high end equipment at their disposal almost every 3D animation movie looks eye candy in recent times. So I would not say I saw something groundbreaking which I haven't seen lately. But this in no way undermines the quality of animation which 'Despicable Me 2' has to offer. Specially loved the fur and the water effects.The 3D is nice and it has its moments for sure in some of the scenes. In terms of overall feel of depth throughout the length of the movie however I felt that 'Epic' had the edge.The 3D was smoother and more consistent in 'Epic' but it isn't bad at all in 'Despicable Me2'. If you want to see more of it wait till the main end credits start rolling and you will get to witness some 'in your face' kind of 3D minion action :)<br/><br/>Apart from its technical brilliance what really made this movie shine and such a joy ride for me was the characterisation, the human touch and the insanely hilarious quotient. I normally am not used to laughing out loud at the theatre but this one really had me and during some scenes I was not able to control it at just the giggling level. This movie will be loved by kids and adults alike. If you have watched and loved 'Despicable Me' then I am sure you would want to go out and enjoy this FUN ride as well."

It had one of the common story lines; single dad who refuses to find a partner, but finds a partner in the end whilst also saving her.<br/><br/>Although the story isn't as thrilling and surprising (since I've already figured the whole movie out when I was 1/4 through) It still has its nice, family friendly and funny essence to it. If you want a laugh, then I recommend this movie! There's a little tragic backstory to it too! <br/><br/>Mainly, it's the minions who are constantly stealing the show and making us laugh. I can't really sum this thing up, so just as the poster says, ""When the world needed a hero, they called a villain."""

With plenty of minion movies out in Youtube, I have become a self- proclaimed Minion fan and this was the Major reason for me to watch this movie! Was I let down? Well, No!! I got my share of U2 styled minions, Hawaii styled minions, nanny styled minions and many more of Kevin, Dave and they gave the movie a push that has made Despicable 2 better than the first one for sure!

","Before going to watch ""Despicable Me 2"" I was afraid that the minions were not going to be as much fun as in the first one (since the surprise factor of the first one was gone, and I kind of knew what to expect). I was wrong, they still caused laughs in the whole movie theater, from people of all ages. Their jokes are pretty simple, but still solid fun. <br/><br/>The interaction between Gru and the little girls, is already solidified and brings such a different air from the first movie (even though, it follows kind of the same blueprint, meaning: an evil villain and a grandiose fight scene at the end). The addition of Jillian (Nasim Pedrad) to the gang was great and never felt out of place. I hope they do not get to make a Despicable Me 3 (although they probably will), because this was an excellent way to end this great series, otherwise they might end up like the Shrek franchise.<br/><br/>Score (7)"

","Despicable Me was a success the moment it opened, a literal out-of-nowhere film that had the makings of a huge box office hit. Not surprising the challenge that followed in making something better. I brought my BLT sandwich, as ever, in case of mediocre results.<br/><br/>The screening was packed. Little kids everywhere, a real logistics nightmare for the parents and cinema. They loved it, making horrible noises and kicking. Particularly upon the appearance of the minions - there's a huge cash cow waiting if they can produce another film, perhaps even a nonsensical minion spin off. Some rather original jokes, steady plot. Enjoyed the fact that most of the film takes place in one location, none of this fancy, lets fly to Africa and back nonsense of other films, where they feel exciting locations makes up for an inconsistency in dialogue. Nothing violent, no foul language, a fine plot for its target audience. A meagre sense of pace, quite a lot of change in direction, but overall one may enjoy this as much as his children. If you have younger counterparts, take them to see this, they will enjoy it. The sort of thing they'll look back on in later life and say ""Remember how good this was?"" as we all did with our TV and films. Though, unfortunately, they never have quite the same effect years on.<br/><br/>Although it's not really aimed at folks my age, the film had pleasant moments. They have managed to exceed themselves. Not my type of film at all, in fact I don't know why I went, but these days films just don't get me going like they used to, so I went mainly to review.

But the main story of the film, about how a super-villain named Gru, who wanted to steal the Moon, reformed to become a dedicated family man to three orphaned girls Margo, Edith and Agnes, was its best feature.<br/><br/>This story of this sequel is about the reformed Gru (still voiced by Steve Carell) being recruited by the Anti-Villain League to be their secret agent. His mission was to discover and apprehend the evil criminal who had developed a toxin which can turn any being into destructive purple hairy monsters upon injection. <br/><br/>While this mission was going on, Gru was also having difficulty admitting his romantic feelings for kooky partner Lucy (Kristen Wiig), as well as trying to break up another romance budding between his eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) and her dashing Latino admirer, who was the son of the man Gru suspects to be the diabolical El Macho.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story is not really much to be excited too much about this time, unlike the first one which was totally original and endearing. The first film was already perfect as it was as a stand-alone film. I actually thought and even hoped back then that there would be no more sequels to that one. But you know Hollywood, they will try and squeeze out whatever they can from a successful franchise like this one.<br/><br/>The star of this film is the colorful and vibrant artwork. We watched this film in 3D and it was awesome and worth the money it cost. The face of Gru himself alone, with that pointy nose of his, is made for 3D. The 3D animation was breath-taking in so many scenes, especially those where there was a speeding submarine underwater, the car hurtling out of the mall window, a jelly fight of epic proportions, an exploding volcano, up to the Minions antics during the final credits. <br/><br/>I liked the first film better than this one. This sequel, while still enjoyable, focused more on the relationship between Gru and Lucy. It had little of those delightful encounters between Gru and his daughters which made the first film uniquely appealing. I wanted to see more of cute little Agnes most of all. While she had her little touching moment at the end, it was just too short to make too much of an impact. <br/><br/>But definitely, this is one very funny and entertaining film for the whole family. Fans of those naughty little yellow Minions will rejoice as they have practically half of the movie running time dedicated to them, and there are so many more of them here. Fans of good 3D effects will really find this film so cool. I just missed some of the heart that made the first installment more than special."
"michaelthepichael","7","0","1","5 July 2013"," Less focused then the original, but still a good time
","The first Despicable Me, though not up to Pixar in the CGI world, was above all Dreamworks films bar Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon, way above anything from Blu Sky or Sony, and better then most of Disney's CGI features. Illumination Entertainment seemed to be one to watch. Their next film, Hop, was a disaster, but it was a live-action one they merely contributed animation to, so it was easy to ignore. Then, The Lorax was typical market-tested, drawn-out stuff, leaving the company with a one-in-three ratio of success thus far.<br/><br/>Now, with Despicable Me 2, they have partially restored my faith. Therein lies the movie's problem. It is PARTIALLY better then the original, both in terms of a few element,s and snippets and scenes here and there. But when looking at both as a whole, the first is obviously better. Why? The element or surprise, probably, and Despicable Me 2 is otherwise the best animated film so far this year (in the UK, comparing it to Croods and Epic; Monsters University has not been released here yet).<br/><br/>The plot is attracting stuff. Gru, having had his villain heart softened by the trio of adopted girls, now lives a much more peaceful life. Right around the time that his colleague Dr. Nefario leaves to work for another villain, making Gru question his currently tepid life, he is hauled - literally - away to the Anti-Villain League, where he is recruited to ""go undercover and save the world,"" as he puts it.<br/><br/>Viewed with my critical glasses on, the film is riddled with problems, and I'm not even leaving the viewpoint of a average moviegoer. It is never quite as epic an adventure movie as one would want it to be (though this is not nearly as notable as it was with Monsters Vs Aliens). The characters are also just not as interesting as before. Don't get me wrong - Gru is as amusing and mean-when-required as ever, and Carell remains top-notch, but his one attractive hook - he's a villain - is missing (suffice to say, the biggest laughs with him are when flashes of it shine through). And the third act is rushed up too fast, as though the production schedule din't allow for a proper showdown.<br/><br/>There is one shining factor that is undoubtedly improved - the humor. Even when there is little going on plot-wise to interest, there is always a plentiful supply of gags, and for both groups - for every minion snippet, there is a Indiana Jones spoof. One thing I am certain of is that this one will not hold up to repeat viewings nearly as well as the first, due to the fact that the jokes are the highlights.<br/><br/>As a result, I'm torn between 6/10 and 7/10. The one finds Gru less interesting because of what made the first film's ending so sweet, while the other had a good time, and came out smiling. And the ratio of missed gags to hit gags is a safer one then the first (where we had to deal with the annoying Vector and more bit-part celebrity voices then this one). And the minions themselves are pivotal this time around, for a plot point I won't spoil, in a ticket-worthy nod to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (they have a safe mix of adult gags, kid gags, and everyone gags).<br/><br/>With all that, I'm going to give Despicable Me a 7/10. Still of of the better films so far this year."
"louis-friedmann","8","0","1","4 July 2013"," A funny, cute and adorable sequel that is really worth to watch.
","The probably only movie where the main character isn't on the poster nor very present in adverts, Gru can blame the Minion's for that, but hey, they really are adorable. ""Despicable Me 2"" isn't less good than the first, moreover it's even funnier than its predecessor. ""Despicable Me 2"" doesn't try to hard, and exactly that's what makes it the way it is. The Plot is clear and simple, what makes it fair even for little kids (in contrast to Epic for example). It was very heartwarming to hear about 50 kids laugh next to me for 100 minutes and just having fun, and I can recommend this one to adults and kids as one. You can find more reviews for movies that are in theaters now on my list ""Which Movies to watch and which not that are now in theaters"" on my profile. 8.5/10"
"chrysoberylz","8","0","1","4 July 2013"," The Minions Stole the Screen!
","What can I say about animation movies? In average, animation movies are easy-watching and awesome. Both the graphics, humor, and the story is usually so simple. Mostly about good versus evil. In this Despicable Me 2, the good versus bad is the main theme but all the aspect in this movie is good.<br/><br/>First, the cute minions, which I think are the number 1 attraction in this movie, really stole the screen. With their cute shape (?), hilarious voice and behavior, the Minions are really awesome and, yeah, cute.<br/><br/>Gru, the main character is also hilarious and don't forget his awesome accent and way of talking. I don't really care about the girls (Margo, Edith, and Agnes). But they are good additions for the movie and the love of Gru's life. And Lucy is another person of interest in this sequel. She's hilarious.<br/><br/>Good animation and awesome humor, especially the Minions, this movie is really recommended for everyone."
"onlinespamcatcher","6","0","4","3 July 2013"," Warnings to parents. Cute movie but scary to my youngest
","Definitely not as good as the first as far as family friendliness despite the plugged-in.com review. I'm a parent of 3 ranging 12 yrs down to 5 yrs old. Our whole family loved the first film and made it an event to go see this one. Spoiler alert : The minions are all turned to indestructible monsters (more like zombies) meant to destroy the world according to the villain's plan. The scene where one rogue zombie attacks the girls at home (without Gru) was terrifying to all 3 of my girls. There's no sense of what this monster will do to them but assuming will KILL and eat them as it does to their toys in the front yard at the start of the scene. It pops up and then crashes through the window and chases them all through the house. Just warning parents that the last quarter of the film is more like a zombie movie. Also, I think the macho elements with Margo's love interest where they dance Latin style (very closely) is a bit objectifying to women and had no place in a kids film. It was awkward at best and will take some deprogramming to explain to them."
"venkykp10","8","0","1","3 July 2013"," Lovable Mi(nions)..!
","Now i am just fresh out of a screening of the most adorable 'Despicable Me 2' here in Chennai and i feel like i have to write down a review to 'pusher' people to definitely watch this one ASAP.Although i would have to be honest and concede that it's more ""lovable Gru"" than ""despicable Gru"",i would be a fool if i said Steve Carell doesn't uplift his role with new-found enchantment;while keeping in touch with his usual loathing self,despite the fact that he loses his villainous demeanor and dons a much,shall i say,welcome hero.Come on we could all see it coming.!How else could the second installment have turned about...The lady character in Lucy mostly fills up the empty spaces with good wits yet the character itself tends to fizzle out after a promising intro..It's all understandable still because the tech crew has packed so much content into a 90 min flick that some children might fall out of it,you know..Having said all that,Despicable me 2 belongs right up there with the elites of animation movies like ""The Croods"",""Megamind"" and the like...Just enough for everyone..Pure family entertainment... And NOW moving on to the best part of the movie - NO its not the 3 cutest girls in the world (the tiniest one is my favorite by far though ;but the premise of the whole sisterhood thing i thought was brilliant right from the word go),it is THE MINIONS...!Oh yes folks who enjoyed the first part know what i am talking about..It's almost like the screenwriters guessed the audience craved for more..This is the high point of the movie..Whenever the minions make an appearance,no matter how small they bring the biggest cheers to the audience hearts..So innovatively created;these so-called minions,the real superstars of this tremendously colorful animation world are the ones that keep the loaded film intact(whether they come in purple or yellow)..And special mention about the end which is just as awesome as the beginning,maybe even better.. Much highly recommended...for anyone above the age of 1 month..!ENJOY YOURSELVES humans...this flick is only gonna make your heart bigger and your body smaller..!"
"Jjensen609","9","0","1","3 July 2013"," A satisfying sequel to a growing franchise
","I just saw this movie and I thought that it was very good. This movie is a prime example that you don't have to spend + $150 million to have great animation entertainment. This movie was on par with the first movie except for a few things.<br/><br/>1. I had expectations for this movie. Even though they were met, having expectations ruined the ""wow"" factor for me which made the first movie so memorable and enjoying. <br/><br/>2. Not meaning this as a bad thing, there was a lot more scenes with the minions. I personally love the minions and I can't wait for their own movie, but Gru and the girls were sidelined for a big chunk of the movie. The minions do play a critical part though in the end where they're used to be turned into an army by Eduardo which makes some sense. What made Despicable Me stand out was that the audience rooted for the bad guy, not the typical protagonist in every story. In this movie, Gru has become a good guy fighting a bad guy. This is opposite to what the plot was in the first movie and it went to sort of being a typical non-Pixar animation movie.<br/><br/>3. I wish that the movie had more developed the idea of Margo beginning to date. There could of have been funny encounters between Gru and Margo's crush/child of Eduardo. I could of seen the kid as a partner in crime with his dad and the movie didn't say if the kid even knew that his father was a villain in real life as well.<br/><br/>4. The Anti-Villain League, who fights crime on a global scale, apparently have one agent in the line of duty because that is all you see of them except there leader, Mr. Ramsbottom and a couple of guys clearing out a wig store in a mall. I thought that was weird and would of loved to explore more of the League's submarine where they could of have shown all tons of gadgets being used in training and stuff like that.<br/><br/>Now that I've stated all my problems with the movie, let me share what I liked. I loved Kristen Wiig's character. She was more witty than expected and I loved her relationship with Gru. The minions were hysterical as always and the same type of humor that was in the first film was present throughout the entire film. This is also funnier than the first film which was a nice bonus. It clearly shows on the screen all the fun the animators had while making the film with the characters they created. Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie to watch and I hope that you don't over think it and just laugh!"
"Thomasamills","8","0","1","3 July 2013"," The Best Sequel Of The Year So Far.
","Only in the past year was I introduced to 'Despicable Me' and the world of the minions. Since then I have been anticipating the sequel with much eagerness. Whilst Pixar may dominate the awards and the box office with their films, it's great to see Sony Animations putting their first sequel on the big screen. Is 'Despicable Me 2' a worthy sequel or just a lazy money grabbing summer flick? Well, the smile I had on my face throughout the film should say it all.<br/><br/>The film opens by reuniting us with Gru, his daughters and the minions at a birthday party. We watch the minions slapstick humour fill the screen with laughs and also see how Gru is adapting to a life without being a super villain. Each of the characters are moving on in some way or another, Gru is still single and his girls want him to find love, whilst Margot is having boy troubles if his own. Gru is recruited anti- villain league to stop a new super criminal whilst also learning a little more about family life and love.<br/><br/>'Despicable Me 2' is a funny and friendly family film. Whilst the minions take up the majority of the films laughs, each of the characters has their moments in the spot light. Steve Carell gives a great voice performance as Gru, as does the rest of the cast. Kristen Wiig is a much welcomed member to the cast as Lucy, Gru's new undercover partner and I look forward to seeing her character in the future.<br/><br/>As with many of Pixar's films, Sony Animations have created a genre that works on levels both for adults and children. I may have been one of the only people in the screening without a small child, but I still laughed and enjoyed the film as much as any of the children in the cinema. Also with rumours that the minions will be getting their own movie spin off circulating, it shows that the 'Despicable Me' world has much more fun to spread.<br/><br/>A solid sequel that's full of laughs and more importantly heart. 'Despicable Me 2' is a great family film for the whole family this summer. 'Monsters University' really has its work cut out."
"alexandra-baker4","9","0","1","3 July 2013"," I loved it
","I loved this movie so much. I always think that the second movie will be so bad but I would definitely give this movie a chance. It was so funny and entertaining I never wanted the 98 minutes (1 hour 18 min.) to end. Most of the characters came back and the minions are still my personal favorites. I have always loved the casting of the characters in this movie. I think they all take control of the role they were given and it sounds like they are having so much fun in the booth that they had recorded it in. The reason I gave this movie a 9 not ten is because even though I was super entertained there was one part of me that said this movie isn't as perfect as the first (but quite close). I always see movies when they come out and this one I was so happy to spend my 2 hours seeing. I would so recommend seeing this movie!"
"moviexclusive","7","0","1","28 June 2013"," As lively, amusing and wacky as the original, but Gru's falling in love is pure slapstick that lacks the poignancy of his turn as an accidental father the last time round
","No one could have quite predicted how delightful and heart-warming 'Despicable Me' would be, and therefore how the debut toon of Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment could have come out of nowhere to give Pixar a good run for its money. Boasting ingenuity and heart in its story of three orphan girls who reform a criminal mastermind and his army of yellow Minions, the film became a monster hit in the summer of 2010, all but guaranteeing this entertaining but slightly less outstanding sequel.<br/><br/>Indeed, despite the return of directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud as well as writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, Gru's return feels less inventive than its predecessor, let down most noticeably by the absence of a more character-driven plot. Whereas the first film emphasised Gru's change of heart after turning into foster parent, this one struggles to find a defining character arc for him following his bad-to-good transformation, settling instead for some mild over-protectiveness and a new romantic interest.<br/><br/>Gone are the poignant parent-child bonding scenes between Gru and his adopted kids, - Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and little Agnes (Elsie Fisher); other than an opening sequence where Gru purposely dresses up as a fairy princess to please Agnes during her birthday party, the rest of the movie barely lets Gru spend any time with his kids. A later subplot that sees Gru's fussing over Margo's teenage crush for a cool Mexican boy feels almost like an afterthough, with most of the attention instead placed on his budding relationship with a female partner Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).<br/><br/>Wilde is the only missing piece to Gru's otherwise picture perfect family existence, so the writers have constructed a skeletal mystery as an excuse to bring Gru and Lucy together. A new agent of the Anti- Villain League, she is tasked by the League's director Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) to recruit Gru in tracking down the villain responsible for the theft of a dangerous transmutation serum from a top-secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. Some initial resistance aside (which culminates in a hilarious send-off for Gru's evil mad scientist Dr Nefario - voiced by Russell Brand), Gru opts to join forces with Lucy.<br/><br/>Their investigative work largely takes place within a shopping mall, where they set up a cupcake shop as a front to observe the other suspicious shopkeepers - including the owner of a Mexican restaurant called Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) and the owner of a wig show with the even more eccentric name of Floyd Eagle-san (Ken Jeong). Intended as a perfect complement to Gru, the gregarious Lucy literally bounces and dances around Gru - but though their scenes pop with verve, their relationship lacks the endearment of Gru's with his three girls in the first movie.<br/><br/>Seemingly aware of this, the directors carefully balance Gru and Lucy's hyperactive romance with almost stand-alone sequences of the 'oh-so- cute' and utterly irresistible Minions. Not simply in droves - whether making jam and jellies in Gru's lab or rushing in line for a dubious ice cream truck that comes around the neighbourhood - they also appear in amusing twos and threes as firemen, housemaids and babysitters, and perhaps even more so than before, threaten to steal the whole show. Rather than just Gru's assistants, they also have a bigger role to play in the hysterical finale, which deftly ties together what often exists as disparate story strands in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Yet even though the plotting could do with a little more meshing, the lively visuals and consistently zany energy will surely keep you engaged throughout. Whereas Pixar or even DreamWorks' animation tend to go for beautiful visuals and even a fair amount of restraint, the French-based animators on the 'Despicable Me' movies have opted for complete and unfettered amusement as their top-most priority, and the maniacal energy and sheer nuttiness with which they have crafted many of the laugh-out- loud scenes are infectious to say the least.<br/><br/>It certainly helps that they have a voice cast to match their ambition. Steve Carell's combination of deadpan and an Eastern European accent once again lend Gru an inimitable persona, while Wiig's brisk and bouncy delivery works superbly as his accompaniment. In equally comical fashion are other new additions Coogan and Jeong, but the one deserving of special mention is Bratt, whose devilish intonations lend Eduardo (or otherwise referred to as El Macho) both charm and menace.<br/><br/>The uniformly excellent voice cast keep up the snappy pace of the movie, which together with the lovable Minions, strive to sustain the same entertainment value as its predecessor. And largely, this is as amusing, lively and even uproarious as the original; yet, beyond the slapstick and physical hijinks, there is still something lacking. As one character remarks in the movie, you cannot quite top Gru's out-of-this-world scheme of stealing the moon; and for that matter, neither does Gru's tale of falling in love quite match the same poignancy and sweet-natured charm of his coming-into-fatherhood story the last time round."
"wliia","8","0","2","23 June 2013"," Just as fun as the first one!
","Despicable Me 2 is just as fun and as hilarious as the first film. With great voice performances and a wonderful story to boot.<br/><br/>Gru (Steve Carell) has now settled down as the father of three daughters (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher), trying to run a jam business. However, he soon finds himself back at work when a woman named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) recruits him to join the AVL, and track down a villain (Benjamin Bratt) who plans to rule the world with an experimental compound.<br/><br/>The Minions are just as hilarious as they were the first time around. You'll be laughing at everything they do in this film, and I mean EVERYTHING! The only thing that disappointed me was how Margo and her new boyfriend was dealt with. I was hoping for something more out of it.<br/><br/>But in the end, Despicable Me 2 is still a great fun ride for all ages, and will provide endless laughs for all to enjoy."
