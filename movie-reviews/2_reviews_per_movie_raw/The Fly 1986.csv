"Derek237","10","199","235","16 July 2003"," Better than the original and one of the best horror films ever made
","David Cronenberg redefined what we think of as creepy with this brilliant film. The makeup special effects and grossouts are top notch, but what is most surprising about The Fly is that it turns out to be a very well acted and emotional love story. It greatly surpasses the original '58 version.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis at the top and once it takes its turn towards horror it really pays off. It's not just scary, it's a tragedy too. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal. He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar for this, it's easily his best performance. <br/><br/>I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror, and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it. <br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"paul2001sw-1","8","149","188","7 June 2005"," Does one thing well
","Most science fiction films are big on ideas and special effects, but weak on coherence and character development; most horror films are just the same, except without the ideas. But David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' takes one simple idea, develops it properly, and eschews (its genuinely terrifying) special effects until its truly horrific climax. And by paying some attention to the personalities of its protagonists, it actually makes you care about them (Jeff Goldblum is excellent in the lead role), and adds a level of serious reflection on the very nature of human mortality to the raw shock. The mix amounts to a gruesomely good film."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","94","121","8 March 2007"," Still Fascinating & Very Disturbing
","It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever! I watch it about every 5-7 years. It's utterly fascinating, but it is so uncomfortable to watch at times I always wonder, as I am viewing it, why I put myself through this each time! The original movie, with Vincent Price, is ""dullsville"" compared to this re-make.<br/><br/>Things can get really disgusting as Jeff Goldblum ('Seth Brundle"") slowly turns into a huge fly. The transformation is very gross in certain spots, and certainly gut-wrenching to witness. You can just feel his girlfriend's anguish and horror as she witnesses Goldblums' incredible physical and mental change. Geena Davis gives a convincing performance in that roles as ""Veronica Quiafe.""<br/><br/>The story is not just a dumb horror-creature movie, but an intelligent science fiction tale with both leading actors excellent. I don't Davis ever looked prettier, too. John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, ""Stathis Borans."" Those three characters dominate the film. I can't even remember anyone else in here.<br/><br/>The ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock. In fact, by the nd, this movie will have you emotionally worn out."
"Coventry","9","102","134","27 May 2005"," The terrifying ""Brudlefly-project""!
","Truly great – but very nasty – update of the classic 1958 sci-fi film with both Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis in the roles of their lives. Technically, this is a remake, but with a genius like David Cronenberg in the director's chair, it's obvious that this isn't anything like the uninspired and irritating remakes that are being released nowadays (""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). Cronenberg's interpretation of this ultimate terror-tale differs greatly from the original. In fact, the only resemblance is the basic premise of a fusion between an obsessive scientist and an ordinary housefly. Goldblum is terrifically cast as the brilliant, but slightly confused mastermind Seth Brudle, whose lifework are ""telepods""; funny looking machines capable of transmitting matter through space. Journalist Davis, with whom he has a romantic adventure, closely observes the progress of his work but when he teapot's himself through space, the catastrophe happens. Mentally as well as physically, Brudle undergoes a horrible transformation into a fly and it cannot be stopped. ""The Fly"" is a very devastating film. Powerful enough, but not exactly pleasant to look at. Like only the greatest directors can pull this off, Cronenberg overwhelms the audience with a sublime mixture drama, misery and repulsiveness. You feel as helpless as the characters themselves and you painfully wait for the unhappy ending to come! The screenplay is filled with genuine metaphors and the romance between Goldblum and Davis is beautifully illustrated. The special effects, mainly created by Chris Walas (who went on directing the 1989-sequel) are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards."
"DunnDeeDaGreat","10","123","164","14 September 2002"," One of the best horror movies ever made
","The Fly is more than a horror movie it's a statement of the eighties. I remeber seeing this film for the first time when I was five years old and telling my friends about the gore scenes but as I got older and viewed the film again I realzied how much of a tragic love story the film was. Jeff Goldblum gave an Oscar worthy performanc of ill fated scinenits Seth Brundle and Genna Davis gave an equally good performance as his love interest. The special effects were very good for the eighties and the film does have some scary moments. If you've never seen the film you should."
"Howlin Wolf","7","50","66","10 April 2002"," Successful transition of Cronenberg's brand of 'body horror' to the mainstream...
","Why is it this film that will always be his REAL 'breakout', and not any of the others before or since? The truth is, beneath all the biological yucks and makeup (there is plenty of both) lies a strong emotional core. Goldblum is enthusiastically likable as scientist Seth Brundle, and Geena Davis is just how Geena Davis seems to be in real life... sweet. It is how the events change both characters EMOTIONALLY, not physically, that inspires the true horror.<br/><br/>The blending of both the above elements makes this remake appeal simultaneously to the 'gross out' crowd, and those in the mood for a more cerebral horror experience. A concept of B-movie stature, electrified by the skills of A-list talent."
"morphion2","10","38","49","23 March 2007"," Exceptional Horror
","Just last week, in one of my Screen Analysis tutorials, our tutor good-naturedly decided that if we were going to be film students we needed to be exposed to disturbing things. What he showed us was an excerpt from an expressionist French film made in the late 20's, the name escapes me. Before we had reached the climactic scene, every one in the class had already guessed it, as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade, and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes. At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor, jokingly but in something of a shaky voice, ""Why are you doing this?"" <br/><br/>This question, I think, could well be the definitive mark of really effective horror, and it was certainly in the back of my mind nearly all of last night as I was watching David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" for the first time. True horror films, by their nature, should strive to get their audience to ask this question, because it means that they are transcending the illusion of moving pictures and becoming a film  suspending disbelief and getting under your skin. Effectiveness aside, however, I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing, and not your own. With both these thoughts in mind, I suspect that ""The Fly"" could well be the second best horror film of all time (behind Kubrick's ""The Shining"", which, I admit, got to first place by completely different criteria. Such is life, I'm afraid).<br/><br/>Remade from a 1958 concept starring Vincent Price (and later popularized by ""The Simpsons""), the film follows a pretty archetypical horror premise: science gone (of course) horribly wrong. In this case, Jeff Goldblum (in his tour-de-force performance) plays Seth Brundle, an independent scientific visionary who has been slowly designing a device that will ""change the world as we know it""  a Teleporter. When he shows his invention to romantic interest Veronica (Geena Davis), it is not quite ready to handle living tissue (demonstrated on screen in the first instance of quite confronting gore), but as the two grow a relationship and fall in love, the wrinkles in the technology are ironed out and so Brundle takes one small step for man and tests the machine on himself. Unfortunately, in the process of teleportation, his DNA is mixed up with that of a common housefly, and although not immediately transformed, as in the original, the two species soon begin to genetically merge and transform Brundle into a creature that has never existed before  and for damned good reasons.<br/><br/>Cronenberg, of course, never shortchanges his audience with graphic gore, and even viewed with the critical eye of Generation Y, the film's mid-eighties effects are still quite sickening, none more so than Goldblum's slow physical transformation. What makes this whole affair really outstanding, however, is his psychological transformation: the truly disturbing thing is how front and centre the humanity of these characters and their world is kept. Davis and Goldblum are the heroes in this regard  their chemistry is palpable, and her affection for him struggling against her disgust at what he is becoming, coupled with his own struggle to keep the fly in check, create the kind of riveting discomfort usually only commanded by train-wrecks.<br/><br/>I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel ""Requiem for a Dream""  although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror  and in both examples the source is basically Love. In this sense, the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do, because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting, lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be, and then Horror is unjustly, and irrevocably, forced upon them. This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that ""(he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it. But now the dream is over and the insect is awake"". And in true Cronenberg style, this prophecy becomes quite literal in the third act (think Vincent D'Onofrio in ""Men in Black"").<br/><br/>Now, in a film that had spent more time on sinister close ups of flies and haunting music cues and not on the bare and essential humanity of the doomed lovers, at this point I probably would have asked ""Why are you doing this to me?"" and that could have been the end of it  dismissed as senseless disturbing cinema and forgotten. As Cronenberg, Goldblum and Davis have done it, what I asked was ""Why are you doing this to them?"" And that's the kind of film that you don't ever forget."

It is a stylish science-fiction horror film based on George Langelaan's 1957 short story of the same name. <br/><br/>The film tells of an eccentric scientist who, after one of his experiments goes wrong, slowly turns into a fly-hybrid creature. My all time favorite creature horror film I have this movie in my video Blu-ray collection and I love 80's horror films to death.<br/><br/>Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on a project which is a teleportation device that can teleport molecular structures until one day he experiments on himself with it accidentally lending a Fly into the machine with him being fused. He seems normal after that but days later he is changing and even his sexy journalist girlfriend (Geena Davis) even starts to notice his weird changes he grows through each day like if he's decaying and that he will soon become a monster.<br/><br/>Powerful and horrifying remake of the 1958 Vincient Price Science Fiction horror classic! Canadian Sci-fi/horror/thriller mastermind David Croenberg sets up another masterpiece much like ""Eastern Promises"", ""Videodrome"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""Scanners"", ""The Brood"" or even ""A History of Violence"" for proving he's a genius on all levels. <br/><br/>This one nearly tops the original in some ways using state of the art special effects and gore from Chris Walas (""Gremlins"" and ""Scanners"") which are quite disgusting to this day like the stomach churning dough nut scene. <br/><br/>The performances are just flawless and the film also has emotional which makes this a great Sci-fi horror movie with pure though and disturbing images, this one isn't for weak stomaches but it is a brilliant movie that goes into our deepest fears and mind.

"fabian-16","9","69","97","22 July 2000"," A masterpiece aided by special effects
","I think that this is a grossly underrated film - a noteworthy landmark in modern horror. I would expect nothing less than excellent from my favourite director Cronenberg, and this doesn't disappoint. Goldblum's performance is particularly good as the nervy scientist Brundle, but I think the main reason for the film's achievement is its structure - very subtle, very well made. Most of the action takes place in the last third of the picture, but there is a great suspense building up to that point. And the special effects are jaw-dropping - Brundle's hideous transformation is reminiscent of Lynch's 'The Elephant Man'. This film has a reputation for being unnecessarily gory, which is actually not at all true. It is a very intelligent picture, about love and other issues as much as horror, and a must-see for anyone."
"Chris-332","10","60","89","9 January 2000"," A Superb and Terrifying Movie!
","I have to admit it. The Fly is the only David Cronenberg movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen any of his others, such as The Dead Zone, Naked Lunch, or eXiStenZ (I think that's how you spell it). But it's just an example that you don't have to be a Cronenberg fan to enjoy this classic. The movie was definitely not a horror movie starring a mad scientist who transforms into an evil fly. It's really not even a horror movie. It's a drama with amounts of romance and suspense/horror. Jeff Goldblum did the best performance of his career as Seth Brundle, a scientist who has invented something he calls ""Telepods"". They're pods that transport you from pod to pod, space to space. He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend (Geena Davis) is seeing someone else (John Getz), even though his belief is wrong. He tries the pods out for himself, unknowing that a fly got trapped in the pod with him. The pods splice them together, and slowly throughout the movie, Seth Brundle transforms into a gross and devastating creature, half man, half fly.<br/><br/>The movie had no errors in it. The acting was great, the terrifying score by Howard Shore was amazing, the directing was exceptional, the story was brilliant, and the extremely sick and disgusting special effects were fantastic. Go see this movie! But don't go on a full stomach, unless you want to lose that meal in you."
"RIK-22","9","55","85","26 July 1999"," Brussels, Belgium
","It was nice reading the reviews for this film as so many people picked up the real elements of this movie and not just about the horror.<br/><br/>This movie, as most great movies, is a subtle love story, where someone realises they are a burden and maybe even a danger to them, and so make the ultimate sacrifice.<br/><br/>Cronenberg is probably my favourite director as he is able to take unusual film idea and turn it into something intense and believable.  As he has evolved he has improved his writing and as a results the stories have become more hidden and more intelligent.<br/><br/>I think the Fly, Deadzone and Videodrome are his best work.  His more recent films, Crash and the Naked Lunch have impressed me with his ambition and ability to try something new, but have failed as entertainment. <br/><br/>
I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does, even with very obscure subjects, but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again.  <br/><br/>Highly recommend  9/10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","27","41","17 November 2003"," Boy, for playing a nerd, Jeff Goldblum has quit the body
","The Fly is a great Sci-Fi thriller that brings excitement to the screen that the original did not. Even though, yes, it can be a bit much to watch with all that, eew, vomiting. I think any true Sci-Fi or horror fan would admit that this is a great movie to watch at midnight. I'm not even really sure why I love this movie, I just think you need a good scare every once in a while and the ending is always a shocker.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brendel, a scientist and meets Veronica played by then wife Geena Davis, she is a journalist trying to find a break-through story that can make her career. Seth interests her with his telepods, only these aren't just any normal telepods, they can transfer things from place to place. Only it has not been perfected to where it can transfer a living creature and Seth offers Veronica or he calls her Ronnie, to stay with him and film what will happen when he perfects it. There Ronnie and Seth fall for each other and begin an affair while trying to perfect the machines.<br/><br/>There is one little past problem of Ronnie's, her ex and boss, Stathis played by John Getz, he wants Ronnie back, but she refuses and continues the project. When she's gone away from Seth, he gets drunk and goes into the telepod not even sure of the results to come, a fly accidentally gets into the machine with him and he telepods successfully! Everything seems fine at first, until a cut he got earlier starts to have tough hair Ronnie notices. When Seth tries to get her into the telepod, she refuses being too scared understandably, he tells her that he'll get another person who'll do it. We notice also that his face is starting too look a little bit more rough, he's only eating sweets, and now has amazing strength. When he scares off another girl as Ronnie warns her ""Be afraid, be very afraid"", Seth tells Ronnie to leave and never come back.<br/><br/>But now Seth has a bigger problem, he's now loosing his body parts and collecting the ""Seth Brendel Museum"", he is grossly disfigured when he begs Ronnie to come back into his life and help him. He cannot even eat solid foods any more, he has to vomit on it and make it into liquid, Ronnie loves Seth that she continues to see him and get him help. When it seems that Seth is first frightened of what the results will be, he starts to embrace it with his amazing strength and ability to crawl on the walls and wants to become Brendal Fly! It's worth a Nobel prize or two don't you think? When Ronnie begs Stathus for help, she shows him some video of what Seth is capable of, she has a new problem, she's pregnant with SETH'S baby! She wants an abortion, but when Seth secretly finds out, he's hurt that she'd want to kill the child and he decides the only cure for him is if he and she(with the baby inside her) get in the telepods together and form the ultimate family of one person! <br/><br/>""The Fly"" is a creative and gross but nevertheless awesome movie with great performances and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't think you will be disappointed. It's just a fun watch for a midnight with your friends and you want a good scare. The effects are cool and not cheap and the make up, well, eesh! You might want a blanket to put up by your face. :D <br/><br/>10/10"
"EJBaggaley","7","36","57","11 December 2004"," He dreamt he was a man and loved it, but now the dreams over and the insect is awake
","The film 'The Fly' has one of the saddest story lines I have ever seen in a horror(Sci-fi and drama) film. Its about a man named Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) who invents a Teleportation machine and accidentally teleports himself with a fly from one transmitting pod to another, which places the insects genetics into Seth Brundle, causing him to slowly mutate into a giant insect. What mostly moved me about this film was the sorrow and pity I felt for Seth Brundle and his girlfriend Veronica (Geena Davis) as he was mutating into an giant insect. To see a man who loved life so much and finally making it in life by meeting the woman of his dreams and by succeeding in his six year goal in inventing Teleportation and then losing it all by transforming into a monster, is enough to put a tear into my eye. I admit this film in many aspects was quite hideous, but because Jeff Goldblums and Geena Davis' acting was so proper and convincing, this is what made the film into what it is. The scene when Seth Brundle went smashing threw the abortion clinic window and then trying to convince Veronica (Geena Davis) not to abort his unborn baby as the baby was the only thing left of the real him, I thought was very sad and moving for Jeff Goldblums acting was so real and professional in that scene, I honestly don't think that any other actor could have played the role of Seth Brundle better than him. I recommend anybody to see this film for I rate it an 7 out of 10."

","Someone decides to remake a camp horror movie ? One thing's for sure and that's it's got to be better than than the original where a man who swaps heads with a fly walks about a house with head gear that looks like Michael Jackson's Blanket baby costume <br/><br/>Hey I enjoyed this remake a lot and is certainly David Cronenberg's most mainstream movie . Like most successful horror movies ( HELLRAISER for example ) it confines itself to human elements like desire , hubris along with a love triangle and uses a limited number of locations in this case most of the action takes place in Seth Brundle's apartment . There's something present here that is totally lacking in nearly every horror movie of the 1970s and 80s and that's pathos , we feel sorry for Brundle as he has his genes spliced and starts to mutate into Brundlefly and in many ways the movie feels more like an update of James Whale's FRANKENSTIEN or a remake of THE WOLF MAN featuring an insect mutation instead of lycanthropy . This type of poignancy was absent from the 1980s where horror "" heroes "" were Freddy Kruegar who was an ethereal child molester killed by vigilante parents . That alone makes THE FLY unique . The final scene were Brundlefly emerges from the teleport after merging with metal and wants Veronica to end his suffering is a truly touching scene almost unheard of in the genre <br/><br/>Being an 1980s movie means we're devoid of CGI and count your blessings for that because the make up here deserved throughly deserved the Oscar it won . True maybe some of the gore is excessive but the final transformation of Brundlefly is very impressive .Jaw dropping in fact . We also get to see undoubtedly Jeff Goldblum's best performance playing Seth Brundle in not a too dissimilar way that Tom Baker played The Doctor in DOCTOR WHO though it's fairly obvious that when Brundle does gymnastics it's a body double since the camera never focuses on Brundle's face . The supporting cast also play their parts as if they're in a serious film , especially Geena Davis which makes THE FLY an even more involving experience . If the actors believe in the story so will the audience <br/><br/>An outstanding horror movie from a decade that featured nothing but teenagers getting sliced and diced by serial killers that couldn't be killed , and a horror movie that shouldn't be remade under any circumstances . What's that ? Hollywood have just started on a remake ? No doubt doubt we'll see Leonardo DiCario or Johhny Depp star in a movie bulging with CGI . I'll be going out of my way not to watch it"
"bob the moo","Null","14","20","13 June 2002"," Great remake  horror with a typically Cronenbergian twist
","Scientist Seth Brundle has created a matter transporter to create a sort of teleporting system.  During tests he finds it turns his monkeys inside out and kills them, until he gets it to work.  He immediately tests it on himself and everything appears to work well.  However he soon finds himself going through a series of changes, much to the concern of his girlfriend Ronnie, that see him becoming fitter and stronger.  However it isn't long the changes become more concerning and it is clear that he is changing beyond his control and beyond recognition.<br/><br/>Cronenberg is famous for his body horror and here is no exception.  The remake of The Fly loses a lot of his usual social comment etc but still leaves him open to do a great horror that has some intelligent touches.  The story is very much a horror  but Cronenberg has got rid of the concept of swapping a fly head for a human head and replaced it with the horror coming from within.  This allows him to feel more comfortable with his subject matter rather than it being silly.  The transformation gets more intense towards the end as his whole body begins to become a fly but the early parts allow tension to be built up.<br/><br/>When the gore comes it is typical Cronenberg.  It isn't gore for comedy's sake it is quite shocking and very gory.  The real gore is kept for 2 or 3 key moments and is all the more shocking for the restrained nature of it's use up till then.  The end itself shows that it isn't just an out and out horror and that it does have a heart and a head to match it's strong stomach.<br/><br/>Goldblum is good.  Unfortunately he has come to be type cast as the excitable, Jewish scientist with a distinct speaking manner (try Jurassic Park 1 & 2, Cats and Dogs etc).  However here it doesn't annoy too much. Davis is also very good and was going into a good run of hits (unlike now!) at the time.  She plays the horror of her situation very well.<br/><br/>Overall The Fly is a very good remake.  It is a horror film that is actually chilling as well as gory  Cronenberg's fascination with body horror and the nature of ourselves is toned down but is still enough in evidence to add something."
"AlsExGal","9","7","9","20 July 2017"," A masterpiece of horror that is not better than the original, just different
","When I first heard they were remaking ""The Fly"" over 30 years ago I rolled my 20-something eyes and figured this would be some inferior remake with lots of gore. I was half right. There is lots of gore, but there is so much more going on. The first half is basically a sci fi/romance combo. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), a rather socially backwards genius of a scientist meets science journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) at a press event she is covering. He takes her back to his warehouse apartment/laboratory and demos the teleportation device he has been working on. His problem - he can transport inanimate objects but nothing living. Later he comes to her office and proposes that they collaborate. He wants her to document his work in progress. <br/><br/>All of this time together leads to a romance that is good for both of them. Seth gets a taste of ""the flesh"" as he calls it, and Veronica loses the cynicism she has developed about love. You see, Veronica's boss, Stathis Borans (John Getz), is an ex-lover of Veronica's who is trying to get her back. Today we'd call the guy a stalker. Why would you continue to work for a stalker? That is never explained. He lets himself into her apartment to take a shower, shows up in a store when she is buying Seth a new jacket, and sends her insulting fake magazine covers he has made up concerning Seth and herself.<br/><br/>One night Seth figures out that Veronica has had an affair with Borans, and he gets drunk in his despair, thinking that maybe the affair is ongoing. Since Seth has the romantic experience of an eighth grader, this is understandable. But then the tragic drunken decision to go ahead and transport himself as the first human experiment. Except something tags along - a fly.<br/><br/>Unlike the 1958 film, there is no half fly-half human something that emerges from the pod. Instead, at first, Brundle doesn't know what has happened, and he emerges looking exactly the same as before he was transported. He even seems better for it - stronger, quicker reflexes, more stamina, and this pesky desire for sugary foods. Instead the transformation is gradual, heartbreaking even, as a man finds he is losing himself. Veronica turns to Borans for help, who truly does try to help in this unbelievable situation.<br/><br/>Yet Stathis is not the hero. Brundle is definitely the hero, albeit a tragic one. For the most part the horror of the movie doesn't come from seeing ""BrundleFly"" terrorize other people. Instead it comes from empathizing with him as we see the gruesome transformation he undergoes as he loses everything he cares about. Goldblum and Davis give fantastic performances and get you invested in their relationship really quickly. Watching it all get destroyed is heartbreaking. They were actually a couple at the time this film was made, and their chemistry is palpable.<br/><br/>Highly recommended as everything about it holds up today. I should know since I watched it again last night when I woke up at 2AM when it showed up on one of the Encore cable channels. The tragedy and the horror of it all kept me up until dawn.<br/><br/>One more thing - director David Cronenberg does a cameo as a gynecologist. His 1988 film ""Dead Ringers"" was about two gynecologists. Does Cronenberg have a thing for gynecology? Just wondering."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","3","3","27 March 2019"," Scientific fears
","Have a lot of admiration and appreciation for David Cronenberg. His films are technically very well made and while his films are very disturbing a good deal of his films also have either a dark or subtle wit, poignant emotion or even both. He is for me one of the most interesting and unlike any other out there directors, despite being known for body horror and originating it his films are much more than that.<br/><br/>Like what was said for 'Dead Ringers', one of my favourites of his, all this couldn't be more apparent in 'The Fly' and actually even more so. Despite really liking the 1958 version of 'The Fly', count me in, having seen this film since watching that, as somebody who considers this remake superior by quite some way and by far one of the remakes ever made. This is a rarity when it comes to remakes, with a lot of which deservedly held in low regard and considered as pointless. Yet 'The Fly' feels much more than a remake, one would not know it was one really. It is also a fabulous film on its own merits, a landmark of its genre and one of Cronenberg's best, still is his most acclaimed critically, for sure from personal opinion. Some may not be able to get past the gore, of which there is aplenty and it does churn the stomach, but it was not a problem for me now and do feel one is missing out if not able to get past.<br/><br/>'The Fly' still looks great. Cronenberg's films are seldom less than well made, he always is a very technically accomplished director and 'The Fly' is one of his best looking. Very accomplished and showing a mastery of visuals and effects, with some truly atmospheric, remarkably elegant and clever photography (if not as complex as that for 'Dead Ringers' for example). The special/make-up effects are not just pretty darn impressive, they made me go wow, a technical achievement back then and they hold up extemely well now. Why else would 'The Fly' hold the distinction of being the only Cronenberg to win an Oscar, which was for the makeup (richly deserved, though certainly would have had no problem with 'Legend' winning as the makeup was also amazing in that film)?<br/><br/>Cronenberg regular Howard Shore, the director's ""composer of choice"" even, provides one of his best scores, which is like its own character and like a character of its own in the film. It is very haunting without being obvious, but what is especially memorable about the score is how it makes something beautiful out of the visual intensity going on, without ever being at odds, and how it goes for the emotional core of the story as well. The orchestration is also some of his biggest and most complex, brought to vivid life by the London Philharmonic, a prime example of this is the opening which has always left a big emotional impact on me.<br/><br/>Some of Cronenberg's best directing can be seen in 'The Fly'. The atmosphere is unnerving in unmistakable Cronenberg style with nail-biting tension to boot. There is a lot of gore and it churns the stomach, but to me the film wasn't too over-reliant on it and didn't use it gratuitously. Even more impressively, as well as being a visual master, he achieves a balance of horror mixed with tense thrills, humour and emotion. The script has delicious dark wit, provokes thought and truly heartfelt and never cloying emotion, not many films achieve this balance so well and Cronenberg was one of the masters at this. The storytelling is some of the most disturbing of any Cronenberg film and of any film, but 'The Fly' is also the film of his that connected with me emotionally the most. The tragedy of the story is truly poignant stuff, and it is genuine, not forced or manipulative.<br/><br/>Not many films of this genre have had me really caring for the characters, and again in a way that was genuine. 'The Fly' did this and is an example to all film, the characters here have depth and well-defined and distinct personalities and character traits and not once did they bore or irritate me. The acting is terrific, as good as Geena Davis is, and she is extremely good, Jeff Goldblum is pretty extraordinary in a very unsettling and sensitive portrayal that disturbed and moved me. Goldblum is always worth watching but he in my mind has never been better than here, one of the best performances in a Cronenberg film.<br/><br/>Altogether, fabulous and one of Cronenberg's best as well as a genre landmark. 10/10"

","David Cronenberg's version of ""The Fly"" has little in common with Kurt Neumann's 1958 film of the same title, one of the cheaply made 'creature-features' of the 1950s Instead, it reveals many of the director's obsessions <br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum is Seth Brundle, a Mad Scientist who is working on 'teleporting', a means of transporting objects through space Geena Davis is Veronica Quaife, a magazine writer who becomes interested in his work, and in him They start an affair, but Seth believes Veronica is still seeing her former lover In a rage he tries to transport himself, and his genes become caught up with a fly that gets into the machine Slowly Seth takes on the features of an insect <br/><br/>As in other Cronenberg's films, sexuality is seen as a dangerous force that leads to disaster Seth cannot get his amazing machine to transport living creatures until he has experienced the delights of sex with Veronica, but then almost immediately his jealousy leads more like a fly he develops a raging libido; the more physically repulsive he is, the more he wants sex <br/><br/>Like many successful films of the 1980s, ""The Fly"" is a hybrid, fusing elements of both horror and science fiction Considering that the plot is from the latter genre, the elements of fear and disgust with the human body are traditional to horror Both genres, as this film will illustrate, benefited greatly from the increasing sophistication of contemporary special effects technique, and the make-up abilities The success of the film led to sequel in 1989, in which the son of Seth and Veronica begins to display familiar symptoms"
"poe426","10","7","10","19 August 2014"," The Metamorphosis...
","In Franz Kafka's classic THE METAMORPHOSIS, Gregor Samsa wakes one morning to find that he's turned into a man-sized insect. I've always thought that THE METAMORPHOSIS would make a great episode of a horror anthology (in something like TWILIGHT ZONE- THE MOVIE, OR as an episode of a teleseries). One of the more interesting aspects of adapting the story would be to SHOW Samsa's metamorphosis. (I tried something similar conceptually when I submitted a script entitled VAMPYRE to George Romero's TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE series: in an effort to go ""undercover"" and infiltrate a group of vampires terrorizing a city, I had the main character allow himself to be bitten by a vampire. The scenes immediately following depicted his transformation from a man to a vampire. I was told that the episode would be ""too expensive"" to do.) THE FLY (the remake, helmed by horror meister David Cronenberg) is the next best thing. Jeff Goldblum's absent-minded, muttering acting schtick is pitch-perfect for the character of Seth Brundle and we BUY him as the scientist. Geena Davis does well as the love interest (though I was never really a fan, she does a GREAT job here and is 100% believable in an underrated performance), but it's Goldblum's gradual metamorphosis into Brundlefly that makes THE FLY worth seeing. By far the best of the Cronenbug films. (Boxing fans, take note: durable Canadian heavyweight champion George Chuvalo plays an arm-wrestling barroom brawler.)"

","Seth Brundle is a brilliant but eccentric scientist, working for the Bartok company he has invented something that will change mankind for ever. Upon meeting journalist Veronica Quaife at a party he takes her back to his home to show her his invention, Telepods that can transport objects thru space from one place to another. Tho reluctant to not tell this amazing story straight away, Veronica agrees to let Seth finish his work to finally achieve the ultimate success of sending a human being thru the Telepod system. Things are further complicated when Seth and Veronica start to fall in love, after Veronica is forced to go and see her ex boyfriend, Seth, drunk and jealous, decides to go thru the Telepods, unbeknown to him a fly also went thru with him and the computer, confused to find two matters in the system, spliced the gene codes together, the result is the terrifying birth of Brundlefly.<br/><br/>Remaking an old and much loved horror classic was something that director David Cronenberg tackled with relish, sensing the opportunity to update it with 80s set paranoia's, he managed to not only splice many meanings in his picture, but also to create one of the best horror films of the modern age. Where do you start as regards The Fly's heart? In essence it's a tragic love story, a modern disease riddled Beauty and The Beast, but Cronenberg is not just content with that, he manages to play on mans fears of disease {an 80s AIDS metaphor is hard to get away from}, death and of course change in general.<br/><br/>Cronenberg pictures have generally suffered for poor casting and tiny budgets, but here he gets full license to unleash the devilment and astuteness at work in his mind. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis put in excellent work as our two main protagonists, both putting in career best work in the process, a chemistry pretty much unrivalled in the horror genre post the Motion Picture Production Code demise in 1967. What is a major plus in The Fly's favour is that there is no camp veneer to the story unfolding, Brundle's metamorphosis is slow and adroitly paced, we follow each step as Brundle's body and state of mind changes, and of course we have to witness Veronica clinging on to the love she has for Seth, even as he monstrously evolves into Brundlefly.<br/><br/>Drink deep, or taste not the plasma spring<br/><br/>Some sequences are truly vile, I remember vividly people leaving the cinema during one particularly gross moment, the horror elements in the piece do not disappoint the genre faithful. But really it's the intelligence and crafty nous that lifts The Fly high above many of its contemporaries. Many of Cronenberg's early supporters frown at The Fly for its big budget awareness and mainstream success. Stupid really because it's one of his most accomplished and professional pictures, dripping with goo and seeping with cranial splendour, right up to the final shattering climax that is as unforgettable as it is emotionally wrought. <br/><br/>A candidate for greatest remake ever? Definitely. And come the end credits as your stomach starts to settle and the ache in your heart begins to wane, comes the realisation that Seth Brundle, without the intrusion of a common house fly, really could have changed the World as we know it! 10/10"

","Eccentric, brilliant and extremely likable scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) manages to convince a journalist named Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) working for 'Particle Magazine' to accompany him back to his apartment so he can show her his invention that will, according to him, change the world. Eventually Veronica agrees. Seth shows her his 'Telepods'. Devices that reintegrate objects placed in one pod and reintegrates them in another. Veronica is suitably impressed and takes the story to her ex-boyfriend and editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) who doesn't believe her and says that Seth is trying to con her. Seth contacts Veronica again and asks her to cover the remaining development of the telepods. Veronica sensing a massive story that she will have exclusive rights to, agrees. After some teething troubles Seth feels he is ready to test the pods out on himself. Unfortunately a fly is trapped in Seths pod as he is teleported. The computer which controls the teleportation decides to splice Seth's and the Fly's genes together. Veronica notices drastic changes in Seth's appearance and personality as he undergoes an horrific transformation into the Fly!<br/><br/>Co-written and directed by David Cronenberg I thought this was quite simply an excellent horror film. The script by Cronenberg and Charles Edward Pogue is gripping and really works on an emotional level unlike so many horror films, I actually felt sorry for Seth by the end and the rest of the characters are fleshed out very well so that we care for them. The pacing is excellent, starting off at a sedate pace but never becoming boring and then building up to the gory climax. The acting from both Goldblum and Davis is superb, if they have ever turned in a better performance than I have yet to see it. There are actually very few characters in the film, Seth, Veronica and Stathis is about it. The special effects look pretty good. There isn't much blood or gore, a bone sticking out of an arm and a melted hand is about it. But there are lots of disgusting gooey effects as Goldblum changes into a Fly. It's very well made and looks good. I've nothing really bad to say about it. It was an absolute pleasure to spend and hour and a half of my time watching this. Highly recommended, especially for those who value a well written story with good characters. Don't miss it."

","In the 21st Century when us horror fans hear the word ""remake"" it usually comes with a sigh, but there was a time when remakes were actually as good, if not better, than the original. The Fly is a perfect example, quite possibly one of the best remakes ever. Bit of a slow star (if you're lacking patience) but well worth sticking with. Superb direction by Cronenberg, two great leads in Goldblum & Davis plus some terrific transformation effects make this an 80's classic."

","Only Cronenberg could remake the great B-movie original with as much humor as he does terror. The visual effects and makeup in the body horror is undeniable and supremely disgusting, but the way Goldblum's Brundle handles his transformation is dryly and unnervingly funny.

","David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" has always been one of my favorite sci-fi horror movies ever since watching it as a young teenager. Why? Well, there are multiple reasons for this.<br/><br/>Let's start out with the story. It has a very interesting and disturbing story that deals with different topics without losing focus on the core of the movie. It is a story that deals with scientific issues of teleportation, but it does so in a very believable manner. But it is also the story of an aloof scientist who invents something unique and his downfall into despair and hunger for knowledge and power.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" also has good effects, taking into consideration that it is from 1986. Granted that compared with today's technology and possibilities, then it is outdated. But I do believe that the special effects team working on ""The Fly"" managed to create something that actually still holds its ground even today. The whole transformation from Seth Brundle to Brundlefly is just exceptional, and I mean that both in terms of the special effects and make-up applied to Jeff Goldblum, but also in the way that the character started to behave and the skills he acquired from the transformation.<br/><br/>Then there are some outstanding performances to be witnessed in the movie. First and foremost, it is of course Jeff Goldblum who steals the screen with his enigmatic performance as Seth Brundle. I believe this was also the very first movie I saw him in. His mannerisms, behavior and that twitchy side to him is just right on the nail for this particular role.<br/><br/>There is just something timeless about the story presented in ""The Fly"" and it is a movie that you can watch over and over. I don't know how many times exactly I have watched it by now, but it is around ten or so.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" is definitely a well-worthy addition the to horror genre, and it is an outstanding movie that you should already be familiar with. If you by some strange reason haven't seen ""The Fly"" already, I can strongly recommend that you take the time to do so."
"tedg","Null","8","14","5 July 2007"," Practical
","""Practical"" is the term movie makers use to denote effects done in real life instead of added in by CGI or animation or some such device.<br/><br/>A practical movie is a sort of handmade movie, a sort of sushi of film. Today, hardly any movie that depends on extra-reality is practical. That's good in a way; we get ever increasing imaginative experiences, at least in the better stuff. But as the technology grows, there is a growing appreciation I think of the masters who did stuff with actors and cameras.<br/><br/>Its a sort of embodiment, a reality, a commitment that you can feel. It matters to me more that Jeff Goldblum put on all that goo and plastic than Bill Nighy had Davy Jones' tentacles superimposed on his face while he was on vacation. There's a direct connection that comes from this, one that prompts us to allow more in what we accept as real. This is real, and bless Geena Davis for being our surrogate observer, camera and all. Its her horror that is essential to this, and the very real horror of imagining her child. And knowing that the two were lovers in real life.<br/><br/>The story is about embodiment, as it happens. Cronenberg in his intelligent period, where ghastly shapes were derived from organic forms. Contrast this with the insect-derived monster in ""Aliens"" of the same year. That insect is unlike Ridley Scott's. Its all angles and plates and jutting sharp things. This is modeled, organic, moist. <br/><br/>Oh, the story. Transformation again, a method of folding a character into another. A standby, but bodily change is novel. This version of the story is massively different than the last one. In that case, it was a matter of an alien consciousness creeping into a human and eclipsing it. Here it is a matter of human consciousness surviving the horror of transformation. Keeping a museum of dropped body parts. Wanting to preserve a fetus.<br/><br/>Loving. Even then. Loving.<br/><br/>Practical. Embodied. Worth it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"springsunnywinter","10","7","12","3 September 2007"," One of the most interesting stories in film history
","The Fly definitely has to have one of the most interesting story in film history about a scientist who teleported himself in his invention without knowing that there is a fly with him. The best thing about the movie is that he didn't turn into a fly straight away after he left the machine; he was slowly throughout the whole film which really created the suspense & the tensive mood.<br/><br/>It is a remake and a hi-tech update of the 1958 classic and is David Cronenberg's biggest hit to date, granting Jeff Goldblum his finest role as the teleported monster hybrid and granting an Oscar for its gruesomely icky special effects. Generally flies are the most useless & annoying animals especially when they sit on your food but for once they did become useful for the idea of this terrific film. I've not seen the original Fly because I'm not keen in really old films and I don't think it will turn out to be as good as this one.<br/><br/>It's rumoured that there is going to be another remake in 2008, I don't mind remakes as long as they turn out to be good but most of them are rubbish. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street, The Terminator & Predator, the list is endless. Overall The Fly is a masterpiece with a classic story that has been tackled in a lot of cartoons including Dexter's Laboratory & Johnny Bravo. It is really underrated because mostly people gave it an 8 instead of 10 out of 10 and it should be on the IMDb top 250."

","Short preface of (perhaps) important information:
<ul><li>I am fairly young (born in 1998) but i have a passion for older horror films and i love watching them.</li><li>I have not seen the original 1958 film.</li></ul><br/><br/>To give you a short summation of the story without spoilers. The Fly starts off in a science convention centre where brilliant scientists gather. Journalist Veronica is tasked with creating a scoop about the most interesting story she can find. She meets scientist Seth Brundle and asks about the project he's been working on. Seth takes her to his appartment and reveals he has been working on a teleportation device. The device is still a prototype and has difficulty with transporting meat or living beings.<br/><br/>After some refinement Seth decides to try the machine out himself. While intoxicated, he decides to hop in the machine in order to see if the refined machine can transport humans. However, a fly manages to get into the teleporter alongside Seth. Seeing as the machine was unrefined, it gene spliced Seth's DNA with that of a fly. Seth ends up turning into a gross human/fly hybrid being. How that resolves, you have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>One thing i admire about this film is it's pacing. I'm used to horror films being 2.5 hours long and the fact that this film is only 1.5 ours is realy refreshing. It cuts out all the longwinded and boring parts and makes you feel involved every step of the way.<br/><br/>The make up and practical effects are extremely well done. It looks absolutely disgusting and i love it. The hairs, the swollen faces, the spit, the gore, everything looked great even by today's standards. I can't even begin to describe how glad i am that they didn't use CGI.<br/><br/>The acting is great, there wasn't a single moment or line that felt out of place or unnatural and i was throughly entertained all the way through. It wasn't very scary but it was entertaining and disturbing and i loved it. A definate reccomendation for any fan of horror films."

This is not really a horror picture, or a sci-fi picture.  Those elements are present, but the story itself is really an existentialist drama.  The most fascinating moments, to me, involve Brundle's metamorphosis, and his total disability to figure out who he is, to make any sense of his continually changing identity.  It really makes you think while you're being grossed out.  You don't get a lot of that anymore."

","David Cronenberg's ""The Fly""(1986) - is a remake of the 1950s movie of the same title in which a scientist is turned into a half- man, half-fly due to a fatal defect in the matter transmitter. In his remake, Cronenberg piles the eye popping, jaw-dropping, and stomach-churning effects on the top of each other as the body of the unfortunate, mad but brilliant scientist (Jeff Goldblum in the role of his life I've never seen him better) is hideously distorted and he is losing his humanity turning into the insect of the title. ""The Fly"" is a truly visceral experience which the director himself sees as a metaphor for aging: ""In time we all turn into monsters"". This very impressive movie is a classic of a ""the fatal error of a mad scientist"" sub-genre, ""Everybody's a mad scientist, and life is their lab. We're all trying to experiment to find a way to live, to solve problems, to fend off madness and chaos"" (David Cronenberg)."

It is disturbing, but if you're like me then you'll see beyond that and see the beauty and sorrow of this film.

"moonspinner55","4","6","12","25 July 2015"," A technical marvel, though the characters are ultimately frittered away in favor of shocks...
","David Cronenberg's remake of 1958's ""The Fly"", a solid low-brow horror outing with camp overtones, from George Langelaan's magazine story, never quite takes off. The material is tailor-made for the filmmaker yet, while the shocks are there for the squeamish, the movie is too simple-minded (and too easily wrapped up) for it to be worthwhile to anyone but indiscriminating fans of the horror genre. Nerdy, dateless scientist Jeff Goldblum (excellent) brings home a pretty journalist from a scientific convention and shows her his teleportation pods...this could be the start of something big! He has managed to break down the molecular structure of inanimate objects and transfer them from one pod to another. Unfortunately, he's having trouble transferring live matter (a monkey quickly goes splat in the film's most horrific scene). We never learn how Goldblum manages to figure out the problem and fix it, but soon he's climbing into the machine himself--along with a stowaway fly. Goldblum's transformation is well done, and Cronenberg admirably takes his time building the foundation which will lead us to the showdown, but that's all the film is: a build-up. There's no rush of exhilaration in the denouement because the picture is all technique, mechanical--the love story between Goldblum and Geena Davis is also half-hearted (as if Cronenberg didn't believe in it) . A huge financial success. Chris Walas & Stephan Dupuis deservedly won Academy Awards for makeup. Followed by ""The Fly II"" (with a new cast and director) in 1989. ** from ****"
"andrewcrouch","4","9","22","25 July 2007"," well-acted but repellent and unremittingly depressing
","This is an example of a decent movie that is nearly impossible to enjoy. Paradoxically the special effects are much, much too good at what they do, sucking the entertainment value out of the experience.<br/><br/>Actually, labeling this a decent movie is probably being generous. Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum (until he's buried beneath pounds of make-up) give performances that are both credible and interesting, and I've always liked Howard Shore's operatic score, but those are the highlights. The pseudo-metaphorical science is ludicrous, and far too much time and effort is spent trying to convince the audience that it's not. I respect that there was some restraint shown on Cronenberg's part as far as that goes, but when gene splicing science is the premise of your movie, there's got to be something credible in the explanation of what goes on.<br/><br/>Where there is not the same restraint is in the panoply of special effects detailing Brundle's transformation from man to Brundlefly. Is there a reason for those meticulously crafted (and justifiably famous/infamous) scenes where we learn how Brundlefly eats, or what body parts have become obsolete and have fallen off, other than just to shock and titillate? It strikes me that a more streamlined and less repugnant alternative would have been a Phantom of the Opera-esquire reveal of Brundlefly closer to the end of both his transformation and the storyline, with a building sense of foreboding, a la the original '50s Fly.<br/><br/>This is not the same kind of bad film that ""The Fly II"" is - this film does most, if not all, things better than its sequel. What sinks this picture (and leaves #2 untouched) is the ambition with which it was made. ""The Fly"" falls too far short of its own expectations."
"Woodyanders","9","3","5","19 September 2016"," One of those rare horror films that's both touching and terrifying in equal measure
","Awkward, yet brilliant and obsessive scientist Seth Brundle (superbly played by Jeff Goldblum) creates a teleportation machine that can transport objects from one pod to another. Things go terribly awry after Seth accidentally merges himself with a housefly. Moreover, his scared, but concerned journalist girlfriend Veronica Quaife (a fine and affecting performance by Geena Davis) decides to stay by Seth's side no matter what happens.<br/><br/>David Cronenberg brings a commendable amount of depth, gravity, and maturity to the gripping story, with the doomed romance between the two main characters giving this picture a poignancy and resonance that makes it substantially more than just another creature feature or mindless splatterfest (although it has to be noted that this movie most definitely doesn't shy away from depicting the extreme mental and physical transformation of Brundle into a hideous mutant in an often shocking and unflinching explicit manner). Better still, the central premise serves as a potent metaphor for everything from cancer to drug addiction to how the ravages of time and age take a harsh toll on us all as we get older. Cronenberg and Charles Edward Pogue's take-no-prisoners uncompromising script deserves praise for having the strength of its bleak convictions -- there's no hokey happy ending to be found here -- and further adds inspired touches of black humor to stop this film from becoming too intolerable in its grimness. In addition, it's a nice touch to have Veronica's obnoxious and unlikable boss and ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans (a deliciously odious portrayal by John Getz) come through as a sort of hero at the shattering climax. Joy Boushel contributes a memorably sexy turn as slutty barroom pickup Tawny while Cronenberg has a neat cameo as a gynecologist in a startling nightmare sequence. The Oscar-winning special f/x by Chris Walas are quite convincing and revolting. Kudos are also in order for Mark Irwin's polished cinematography and Howard Shore's outstanding operatic score. Essential viewing for Cronenberg fans and 80's horror aficionados alike."
"chaos-rampant","Null","3","5","2 October 2011"," The inside man
","It had been a long haul bringing external horror back home, since the 60's at least. But relatively close together in the 80's came two films, both remakes of older films, that made it easier to see how the outside menace, horror that beckoned from beyond, was transferred back inside and was ruled that it was no longer conclusively alien with our point-of-view. In fact, it was our point-of-view in the world of these films that was made to be alien. The human being was invaded by or, as here, melded with the monster.<br/><br/>The Thing was relatively clean-cut, like most of Carpenter's stuff. But Cronenberg goes further; he knows what propels the grisly transformations that we experience on the visible level, and is more interested in exploring the act of the transformation itself.<br/><br/>I am not talking about SFX here, which is pretty good to this day. Both these films I personally feel are vastly hampered by this desire to make overly visible, to please the curious eye. We are no longer teased out with shadows and outlines, but get to see every ungodly detail. It's a painful process we undergo, the birth of new life. But gooey and prosthetic nonetheless, and distracting from the actual transformation that is happening inside.<br/><br/>But with Cronenberg the warts really work in his favor; the gooey and prosthetic help vividly describe a prosthetic worldview. It's a very specific, original cinematic world, fertile with ecstasies of the flesh. The fashions, the technology, especially the technology so crucial in his films, always make me feel like they describe an 80's future that waits just around the corner.<br/><br/>So, sex as what makes the flesh crazy - and being crazy, curious, excited about the flesh as an essential prerequisite of being human. Love as what transports between worlds, the movement itself a transformation. But love tainted by even the tiniest flying speck of doubt, even unbeknownst to the conscious mind, produces a monster of a human being on the other end.<br/><br/>Cronenberg would return to this in Videodrome, there more eloquently: on one hand the burning desire to transcend the body, the old flesh that keeps the spirit caged, on the other hand the impossibility of that transcendence as long as the mind remains impure. <br/><br/>So this is why the attempted transformation is always ugly in Cronenberg, revolting, and why it's always left incomplete; the tainted mind - with ignorance, desire, ego, fear - transforms in its image. In the most unexpected way the monster is our in-sight of the mind. This alone makes Cronenberg a stop we can't miss in our cinematic sojourns.<br/><br/>Brundlefly is not the new flesh then, is not new life. He is the mind-corrupted old flesh regurgitating itself. New life, the old world renewed, is only possible through the pregnant woman, this is the way forward. However corrupted Brundle may be by the end, and this is the part of the film where Cron riffs in and out of the classic Beauty and the Beast story, inside of him remains the man he was. The ending is painful, emotional, perhaps too earnest. The hubris is paid back, but we feel sorry because we know Prometheus meant well.<br/><br/>Emotionally heavy, this is the part I don't care much for, but otherwise intellectually light Cronenberg. On the upside, compact, agile stuff about a man yearning to transport himself where life has purpose again, us getting to see from behind a camera, the woman's, the transformation of that man into what he thinks would make him loved. Of course we loved him just the way he was."

","Whether you prefer the original version or the remake, you have to admit that David Cronenberg did a good job with ""The Fly"". For starters, he didn't just copy every scene; he changed the story a little bit. Obviously, the story has scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) transporting himself and accidentally mixing with a fly, thereby turning into something half-fly, half-human. Only reporter Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) has even a remote understanding of what's happening.<br/><br/>The main change from the original was what happened after he transported himself; in the original, the scientist got a fly head and a fly claw, but here...well, you may have heard the term ""Brundlefly"". All in all, as the tagline reminds us, we should sometimes ""be afraid, be very afraid,"" of flies."

","SPOILER---SPOILER---SPOILER<br/><br/>Being a fan of well done sci-fi/horror films I must say that this film gets better every time I see it.<br/><br/>I agree with another comment from these discussion boards that the reason this film works is because of it's setup.  If you were to watch the first 25-30 minutes of the film (without knowing the film's title) you would not think that this was going to turn into a monster film.<br/><br/>
By the time it does getting into the 'monster' half of the film we are involved with the story (or lack of) and these characters.  It was a smart move to begin the film in such a way and then stay with the characters instead of having massive amounts of killing and rampage (the only character that does die is in fact 'The Fly').  And by the time he(it) does die we are just as emotionally drained and spent as Geena Davis.<br/><br/>
It was a definite left turn in comparison from other films of this type which is why this sci-fi/horror/tragic drama is worth more viewings and remains for myself a classic of the genre."

","Contains Spoilers!! That's what I kept expecting Jeff Goldblum to yell when he started turning into the fly.<br/><br/>Anyway, in this uniquely perverse remake of the 1950s cult classic, Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, brilliant but lonely mad scientist who suffers from motion sickness and has five sets of the same suit so that he doesn't have to waste time thinking about what he'll wear. And for a guy who's supposed to be a nerd, he has quite the physique, as someone else around here has already pointed out.<br/><br/>While attending a science fair exhibit funded by his company, Seth meets a beautiful science magazine reporter/journalist named Veronica (Geena Davis, Jeff's ex-wife). After Seth strikes up a conversation with Veronica he tries to impress her by showing her his latest invention - telepods for teleporting things back and forth, an idea he coined up so that he could avoid getting car sick. You can imagine how many times Veronica's been hit on with the line ""I'm working on something that'll change the world as we know it,"" but in Seth's case he can back it up with his pods. Veronica initially mocks his pods but then he transports her pantyhose through the thing and she believes. Unfortunately, Seth overlooked the fact that as a journalist Veronica will naturally try to write an article about the pods and he begs her not to write anything because the pods aren't perfected yet. At this point, the pods can only transport non-living things, it can't do things that are alive, as he later shows when he tries to teleport a baboon with tragic results. Fortunately Veronica's editor and ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans (John Getz) initially scoffs at Seth as a con man, which works out great for Seth because he makes Veronica an offer she can't refuse: chronicle his experiments and she can write a whole book about it once he gets the pods to work. Veronica eventually succumbs to the nerdy charms of Seth and the two have a torrid love affair. After sleeping together and experimenting a little bit with a steak, Seth theorizes that he needs to reprogram the pods to look at living things differently. Seth irons the bugs out while Veronica, in a gesture of romantic affection, buys Seth a brown leather jacket along with some other clothes to add variety to his wardrobe and when she comes back Seth manages to teleport another baboon without killing it. S&V plan to have a little romantic get away but their planning is interrupted when Veronica goes to confront Stathis about his plans to exploit Seth for all he's worth when she finds a magazine cover with her name on it sent to Seth's place (Stathis did a little background check and realized that Seth's no joke). In stereotypical man behavior, Seth drinks himself jealous and tests the telepods on himself, unaware that there's a fly in the machine. After teleporting, Seth looks the same but there's something different: he's suddenly a super athlete capable of having sex for hours on end! He's also become more emotionally exuberant, which = a bad temper.<br/><br/>Believing that the pods has improved him, Seth becomes unreasonably angry when Veronica refuses to let him teleport her and goes out and cheats on her in hopes of finding a girl who is willing to become part of the ""Dynamic Duo Club"". Veronica also notices weird hairs growing out of Seth's back and when she gets them analyzed, turns out they're not human. Seth refuses to believe anything's wrong and angrily throws her out, only to finally realize that something's wrong when he looks in the mirror, notices how ugly he suddenly is and his finger nails start falling out along with some nasty substance. Seth double checks things on the computer and finds out about the fly that was in the pod when he teleported himself.<br/><br/>After 4 weeks alone, Seth calls Veronica and she sees him turning into a hideous zombie spewing fly vomit in order to eat and stuff like his ear falling off. He explains a bout the fly and how the pods didn't know what to do with the two different DNA structures so it spliced them together, meaning he's turning into a giant bug! As the mutation continues, Seth's emotional state wildly bounces back and forth from scared/horrified to crazy fascination (""The Life & Times of Brundlefly... it should make a great children's book.""), as shown when he gleefully demonstrates his fly table manners. Stathis himself doesn't realize the depth of things until he sees the tape of Seth eating. Then it gets worse - Veronica's pregnant with Seth's kid!<br/><br/>Fearing what the child may be when its born, she tries to get an abortion after failing to tell Seth (who now looks like the Toxic Avenger, as someone else pointed out) the truth but he comes after her and kidnaps her from the hospital and begs her not to kill their child as it could be the last of his old self. Stathis comes to Seth's place literally gunning for him and finds out about the only cure Seth could find: fuse himself with another human being. Seth attacks Stathis and Stathis tries to shoot him but he is no match for super-fly (Superman-fly?) and gets his hand and foot melted off. Seth tells Veronica that he has to fuse her to him in order to save himself but when she struggles to keep out of the pod she knocks his jaw off and the last of Seth's old body falls apart as he turns into a giant bug. Stathis manages to shoot the door so Veronica can get out and tries to trap ""Brundlefly"" in the other pod, but when B-fly tries to escape, the pods teleport it and it exchanges its legs with rods. The last bit of Seth left in the monster asks Veronica to [mercy] kill him by touching the shotgun to its head. Veronica complies and the movie ends with her weeping for her dead lover after blowing his head off.<br/><br/>Never was there a tale of more woe than of Veronica and her Seth, oh...<br/><br/>Director David Cronenberg said the film wasn't so much a metaphor for AIDS (though I can see how people might feel that way, as Jeff literally falls to pieces) but more a metaphor for aging, that we all become monsters as we deteriorate. I'll never look at Jeff Goldblum the same way again (Brundle-Fly is permanently fused in my memory) but he turns in a heart breaking performance as the ill-fated scientist. He really got my sympathy going when he delivered lines like ""The baby could be all that's left of the real me... please don't kill me."" Geena Davis is also good as his lover. Not for all audiences."

"stevenrotherforth","10","2","3","15 August 2018"," A repulsive, disgusting, wonderful movie from an era when horror movies had real heart and soul.
","The Fly<br/><br/>The 1986 remake of The Fly by David Cronenberg is a prime example of 80's horror movie making at its very best.
Films like this and 
John Carpenters The Thing (another remake) are types of movies that just aren't made anymore.
Sure there's plenty of the horror genre that make it on to the big screen but today we live in a world of CGI. Nothing onscreen seems to have the texture or the tactility that makes the audience believe that they could reach out and touch what is onscreen.<br/><br/>The Fly tells the story of Seth Brundle played superbly by Jeff Goldblum. A brilliant scientist who's on the brink of one of humankind's greatest accomplishments.
He has figured out how to teleport matter from one space to another. This would change the worlds concept of travel forever.
By using two phone booth like devices known as telepods he is able to shift an object from one pod to the other.
Brundle is struggling with the teleportation of living matter.
A gory scene involving a baboon demonstrates this.
With the aid of Journalist Veronica played by Geena Davis who documents Brundles progress they eventually make a break through.
What follows isn't just a chilling yet repulsive horror thriller but a movie that is deeply character driven.<br/><br/>An inspired choice was to cast Goldblum in the lead role.
His superb range allows him to create and develop certain traits as his anatomy and humanity begins to change.<br/><br/>A man desperate for his creation to be a success Goldblum's character impatiently decides to go through the teleportation process only to unknowingly have a common house fly go along with him for the trip.
Their DNA is spliced together on a equal molecular level which goes on to create something new entirely.<br/><br/>""Be afraid! Be very afraid!""<br/><br/>This brings me to points raised earlier. What follows is the journey of man who goes from being human to something unknown to Science and nature.
Not man, not Fly! A monster that will hurt you if you stay!
This is achieved not through computer generated imagery but through practical effects.
Prosthetics and animatronics.
The ooze is real. The props are real. There's no CGI blood here thank you very much!
This is a film that sticks to your skin making it crawl as you witness Brundles transformation.
Both Goldblum and Davis are brilliant together. Their onscreen chemistry making you care for them. This makes Brundles demise all the more painful.<br/><br/>I first watched The Fly when I was a young kid. I remember being terrified by it and by all rights I should not have watched it at such a young age.
Revisiting this movie as a forty two year old, I was prepared to be disappointed.
Absolutely not! This movie stands the test of time because it is a great film.
Just as Jaws isn't marred by its forty year old special effects. That film is much more than just a rubber shark.
The Fly is much the same.
It is brilliant because of Goldblum and Davis's performances, Cronenberg's direction and Howard Shores haunting score.
Not to mention those gooey, gory repulsive practical effects.<br/><br/>The Fly is a movie you should watch, a movie from an era when the horror genre had real heart and soul."

","I've always been a horror & gore fan since I was a little kid --- Nightmares be damned, I was fascinated by monster movies in particular, and as a result, I was lucky enough to be right in the thick of plethora of horror movies to come from the 80's and early 90's.<br/><br/>While most of those movies are downright laughable & unable to maintain a shred of suspense of disbelief by modern standards, a select few are timeless golden bits of celluloid Cronenberg's 1986 ""remake"" of The Fly is one such film.<br/><br/>Since my first viewing at the age of 11, it's been a firm go-to horror favorite – justifying a watch at least once every 2-3 years. My most recent being last Friday night, just for kicks. No, it's not without its flaws – the science is too watered down, and one can't help but feel that some of the character development had been relegated to the cutting room floor, along with some of the more grotesque scenes (which are viewable on Youtube) – but its positives far outweigh any criticisms one could levy against it.<br/><br/>We all know the basic premise of the film Scientist develops teleportation device, scientist teleports himself, unwittingly taking a housefly along for the trip, bad things happen.<br/><br/>But Cronenberg takes this premise and supersizes it with equal amounts of heart and gore Jeff Goldblum shines as the geeky and eccentric Seth Brundle, trying to hit on reluctant reporter Veronica (A leggy-redhead-fantasy-inducing Geena Davis) at a science exhibition, claiming to show her something that will change the world if she were to accompany him to his apartment.<br/><br/>The teleportation equipment blows her mind, but we're informed that only inanimate objects can pass through, whereas something goes ""wrong"" when teleporting flesh We're treated to a taste of gore early on as a baboon is literally turned inside out, and is shown in graphic detail, writhing on the floor in a pool of blood.<br/><br/>One thing leads to another, Seth & Veronica fall in love as she documents his progress, and inspired by their carnal pleasures, he figures out the solution to making the machine teleport living things, teleporting a second baboon perfectly intact.<br/><br/>Reinforcing the notion that alcohol's effect on relaxing one's inhibitions may not be such a hot idea, Seth proceeds to teleport himself, and accidentally takes a housefly along for the ride except, there's no simple swopping of heads in this version.<br/><br/>Seth emerges, feeling like the million dollar man, better, stronger, faster (and smarter) hypothesizing that the process has somehow cleansed him during reconstruction, but all too soon it becomes apparent that this improvement will be all too short-lived..<br/><br/>And this is where the movie really gets going, and doesn't let up Seth's rapid descent into decay and madness is utterly engaging – not only does Cronenberg present it in visual flair, but he also manages to capture the fallout in the relationship perfectly. The chemistry between Goldblum & Davis is palpable (they were also dating at the time), and Veronica's anguish at Seth's degeneration strikes an emotional chord, culminating in a heart-wrenching mercy-kill in the end.<br/><br/>It's one of my all-time favorites it's campy, involving only 3 actual characters (well, 4, if you count the fly) – the rest are just window dressing. It's gory, it's intimate, and it invests you in the characters sufficiently for the ending to be truly tragic.<br/><br/>80's monster cinema at its finest."

","'The fly', in my opinion, is a romantic horror. I've seen this one when it was just out on VHS and loved it. I have seen the original as well, but it is a bit bleak compared to this, which makes sense considering David Cronenberg is a favorite director of mine and the better means he had to create the appropriate gore. The focus of Cronenberg on the relationship between the mutating scientist and the emotionally involved journalist is one the film's absolute strong points. The greatest horror takes place in the end, when Veronica blows Seth to pieces - at his own request.<br/><br/>The gore is an important aspect of the film, but the rather straightforward story and the carefully dosed gore (though increasingly so, as the film nears the end) within the sober frame of an experiment gone wrong, makes 'The fly' a really special kind of horror film. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis fit this extraordinary '80s bill perfectly.<br/><br/>Hadn't seen it in a long while, but I was blown away once again. 9 out of 10."

","Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is working on creating a machine that can teleport objects from one place to another. He shares his work with reporter Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) and the two quickly enter into a relationship, both romantic and professional. Veronica intends to write about Seth's invention once it's complete. One night Seth tests the teleporter out on himself, with seemingly fine results at first. But, as things start happening to his body, Seth discovers a fly was also in the teleporter when he tested it out which has resulted in him slowly turning into a human/fly hybrid.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest David Cronenberg fan but I do enjoy many of his films, none more so than this excellent remake of the 1950s classic The Fly. It's not as charming or colorful as the original due to the different eras in which they were made. It's certainly a whole lot grosser (understatement of the century). But it's also smart, creative, and fun in its way. It's one of the best sci-fi or horror movies of the '80s. Jeff Goldblum gives a wonderfully energetic performance. I've read some other reviewers refer to this movie as depressing. I suppose from a story perspective you might argue that but I can't see how anyone could be depressed with Goldblum's liveliness. Even as he begins morphing into ""Brundlefly,"" he's still full of energy and a commanding presence that keeps you glued to the screen. Too many times actors inhibited by makeup or prosthetics seem to give up, letting the effects do all the work while they just read lines. But not Goldblum here. Gotta respect that. Other than Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, this is my favorite role of Goldblum's. Geena Davis does an admirable job with a less inspired part. She is attractive and has a great chemistry with Goldblum (the two married the following year). The romance in the film is a little rushed but that's fairly common with movies where the romance is only a secondary plot point. Geena does manage to pull off the ""Be afraid. Be very afraid."" line with a straight face, which is more than many could do.<br/><br/>Chris Walas' makeup effects deservedly won an Oscar. As I said before, the movie is gross in places. More gross than perhaps it needs to be. But the effects are exceptional throughout. Whatever gross thing Cronenberg wanted, the effects team knocked it out of the park. Howard Shore's wonderful score also deserves some praise. And, of course, Cronenberg's superb direction. It's an intense and intelligent take on the old 'mad scientist' films that used to define a large part of horror and science fiction. In the later part of the twentieth century, you didn't see a lot of those movies. Certainly not as many thirty or forty years before. This is one of the best remakes of a classic film I've ever seen."
"Fluke_Skywalker","10","2","3","30 May 2015"," Tragic, operatic, brilliant
","I've probably watched Cronenberg's 'The Fly' at least ten times over the years, and what struck me most this time is that it has absolutely no wasted motion. With a runtime of around 90 min (without opening and closing credits) it's tightly paced and perfectly structured with a focus much tighter than that of an actual fly.<br/><br/>Most importantly, 'The Fly' features superb performances from its three principles; Jeff Goldblum in particular. I'm sure the five Oscar nominated actors that year deserved their selections, but I doubt any were as critical to the success of their films as Jeff Goldblum is here."
"Jonny_Numb","7","2","3","2 February 2006"," a driven, relentless horror show with heart...
","Long before the business of remaking old scare films became an industry unto itself, David Cronenberg (then-author of ""The Brood"" and ""Scanners,"" among other low-budget shockers) took a 1950s B movie and (literally) transformed it into a relevant and compelling horror film. Now, I'll admit that I have never been a big fan of ""The Fly,"" and always viewed it as one of Cronenberg's more underwhelming efforts--an FX spectacular starring then-lovers Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis--but upon recent inspection, was taken aback by its terror, romance, and tragedy. While most of his films are marked by a cold, detached tone, Cronenberg finds a classical despair within the characters of Seth Brundle (Goldblum), a fidgety scientist who invents a teleportation device, and Veronica (Davis), a reporter for a scientific journal who follows his progress. In a fit of jealousy one evening, Brundle--who has only recently met with success in teleporting a living ape--steps into the pod-like contraption, unaware that a housefly is trapped inside with him; afterward, he exhibits an abnormally stunning physical range, and undergoes a transformation that is truly horrific (Cronenberg, with the assistance of makeup artist Chris Walas, spares us no small detail). ""The Fly,"" like ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" shows us a monster who is reduced to a grotesque (and in the case of Brundle, inhuman) appearance, while still endowed with the bare instincts of love, morality, and fear; under increasingly heavy makeup, Goldblum retains his trademark sardonic wit, but it connects with a plaintive sorrow that is truly affecting. The chemistry he and Davis share is something truly rare in the horror genre, which gives ""The Fly"" its transcendent tone; Cronenberg offers a story with humanity, jelled with a metaphor of human decay, and brilliant special effects that assist in bringing this fantastic tale to life. Well done."
"Scottishzombie","10","2","3","6 October 2005"," The best ""female"" horror movie
","I was re-watching one of my favorite movies the other day and realized that I couldn't think of another movie that comes close to portraying fear and horror from a woman's perspective.<br/><br/>I'm not just talking about the fear of the creepy-crawlies or having a birth scene in which the female lead gives birth to some kind of monster, that has been overdone in so many movies. It's almost a cop-out nowadays to show that; a way of covering all the bases. Albeit it does play a part in this story. But it's just to easy to throw that into a movie for shock value, you know? <br/><br/>With David Cronenberg's The Fly, he has elevated the level by binding macabre horror with a psychological love story. Even though our protagonist is male, and his decent into becoming a ""185-pound fly"" is a gruesome one, what impressed me the most is how the writers and director were able to incorporate other facets like abandonment, fear of losing control, fear of the unknown, fear of the loss of a loved one, etc. into the story. Many of the deepest and darkest horrors that would affect the female psyche. Then, at the end, when *she* was the one who had to kill the person she had fallen in love with? Whoa, talk about really giving the screw an extra turn...<br/><br/>That, folks, is why Cronenberg's version of The Fly is in my top 3 horror movies of all time. I still can't think of another movie that comes close to hitting so many different fears told from the female perspective."
"BaronBl00d","9","2","3","2 April 2005"," It Sure Isn't Your Grandfather's Fly
","David Cronenberg makes a somewhat faithful, yet completely stirring remake of the ultimate insect movie - The Fly. I really enjoyed this movie because of its suspenseful storytelling, ability to make you care about the characters, wonderful if not over-the-top special effects, and Cronenberg's obvious touches dealing with nature and man's interference with it. Jeff Goldblum does a very workmanlike job playing a scientist trying to work out the bugs(OK, an obvious pun) with his work in teleportation - very much like the protagonist in the original Fly. Apart from the work and the mix up with the fly when sending himself, there are very few comparisons between this film and the original. I like both versions as entities unto themselves and do not think that any grand comparison between the two is necessary or even warranted because of the completely different natures of the plot. Goldblum, having won the affections of Amazon beauty intensified in Geena Davis, sends himself when inebriated. He soon starts to exhibit characteristics that ultimately make him discover he has fly DNA mixed with his own. He starts to have fibrous hairs grow from his back, an insatiable appetite for sweets, and soon can climb walls. Davis watches by as her lover slowly decays. At the heart of all this terrible affair dealing with Goldblum transforming into a human fly is a love story between Goldblum and Davis. It is touchingly done considering its backdrop and Cronenberg behind the camera. Don't expect the fly to look anything like the classic fly of the fifties - this one is completely different. David Cronenberg once again shows us why he is one of the best in the genre. He wrote this creative script and directs with style that is undeniably David Cronenberg. Certainly this is one of the greatest horror remakes of all time and one of the best horror films of that otherwise barren decade - the 1980s."

","The first time I came across it, I wasn't hugely impressed. I was young, hoping for a mindless creature-feature outing and it was my first taste of David Cronenberg. That being many moons ago. But upon each viewing since then, it has really grown on me. To the point of little details I missed, making it feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. It's simple, but really engages on an emotional level.<br/><br/>This saw director David Cronenberg (the master of body horror) take the concept from the 1958 version of 'The Fly' (which starred one of horror icons Vincent Price) to put his own unique spin on the science-fiction/horror material. His perception was far from conventional, but still a real success. It was an ambitious, admirable and intelligent display.<br/><br/>The straightforward love story beautifully compliments the demented and tragic events awaiting and only Cronenberg could think up something like this. The mental and physical transformation of Jeff Goldblum's scientist character Seth Bundle caused by a scientific project gone awry is expertly projected. Goldblum's confidently twitchy performance is outstanding even behind all that gross make-up FX. The growing affection towards Veronica (a stably strong Geena Davis) the journalist covering his groundbreaking work draws you in even more. There's plenty of convincing character developments that when the slow, but effective groundwork opens up. It's gut-wrenchingly tough and startling with its lyrical dramas and infused visual shocks.<br/><br/>John Getz is good in support as Veronica's jealously smug boss/ex-boyfriend. The special effects are impressive and suitably grotesque with many sequences that remain unforgettable and stand-up to this day. Mark Irwin's photography is sharply executed within what's mostly centered on grungy, confined sets. He gives it a real intimate style, which helps keeps the focused on the two leads and the looming ordeals.<br/><br/>Cronenberg's remake is pure visionary work that successfully splices a real sensitive side with plain unpleasantness."

Visually, it still holds so well by today's standards, so try to imagine how incredible it looked at the time of release way back in '86. This film certainly stood the test of time!<br/><br/>Of the many films Jeff Goldblum made, this is the one I'll remember him for. His performance here is nothing short of brilliant (and he deservedly won the Best Actor award). The props, creature and practical effects are epic! Seth (Goldblum)'s transformation is one of the best I've ever seen on film. Starting with subtle changes, it gets progressively worse until he has completely transformed. The process of transformation is cringe worthy - some scenes are so graphic and insanely well made that I found myself hiding my face behind my hands! And this for a film made 34 years ago!! Some scenes were actually quite sickening. The make-up is also excellent, ensuring the transformation has a very realistic look and feel.<br/><br/>John Getz is quickly set up as the bad guy in the scenario, but interestingly enough, he becomes the good guy as the film progresses, and is so well portrayed by Getz. The romance interest between Seth and Veronica (Geena Davis) started a bit too soon, but being such a short film, they didn't waste any time in setting up the scene. A love interest tends to make us root more for the victim - in this instance I believe both Seth and Veronica to be a victim.<br/><br/>'The Fly' is one of my all-time favorite horror films, and a classic at that."

As they bond and fall for each other, Seth works continuously on the project, overcoming hurdles and errors along the way, trying to teleport a live animal, etc. When his teleportation project finally becomes successful, he's ready to take the next big plunge....teleportation of a human being. And he's using himself as guinea pig. Too bad he does something stupid....he forgets to cover the area where small objects can be teleported, and a fly lands on the screen while he's in the pod. The computer program gets confused weather to transport the fly or him over, so by default, it fuses the two together. Hey! Can't blame the computer, it doesn't know what you do and don't want to do, it's just running a program, you run the show! So! He doesn't know he's a fly just yet, his body goes through a small and painful metamorphosis, and he's slowly transforming himself into an insect, defying all laws of human nature. Director David Cronenberg does NOT shy away from the violence here, oh no. This movie was quite gruesome, especially with the gurgitation scenes. The Fly is, bar none, a great science fiction film, and very creative at that. Good movie, but I would avoid the sequel at all costs. ( Trust me. Avoid it at all costs!)"

","An excellent horror movie for the time (1986). The make-up and specially effects are excellent and still hold-up even today, more than 30 years later. Geena Davis's performance leaves a lot to be desired, but fortunately the focus of the film is placed largely on Jeff Goldblum, whose performance is excellent as always. The film is very slowly paced, as many films were back then, so you can't really hold that against the film today. Overall it's a great horror movie"

","Though I wont go so far as to say that this is Cronenberg's best film, I would say it's probably his most quintessential entry in his oeuvre; it's the film that get referenced the most in pop culture, it's one of Jeff Goldblum's best roles, it boasts some of the best special effect makeup to ever come to screen, and it's images enough to make even the initiated viewer squirm in disgust. In short, this is a great horror movie, one that I would almost go so far as to say is required viewing for horror fans and cinephiles in general. If you're unfamiliar with Cronenberg, this is the perfect place to start.

","I think David Cronenberg was in his highest form at the time that this film was released coming after VIDEODROME and THE DEAD ZONE. Jeff Goldblum (who is truly spectacular in this role and should have at least received an Oscar nomination) plays an awkward, but brilliant scientist named Seth Brundle. He has created telepods that will transport an object from one to the other. Geena Davis (who is great as well) plays journalist Veronica Quaife who is given the story by Brundle himself. In turn though, she starts to fall in love with the super-quirky scientist. One night though (after some drinking) Brundle jumps into a telepod to transport himself. An ordinary housefly though flies into the same telepod and that's when the fun starts.<br/><br/>Plays out wonderfully as there is no introduction to character or set up of story, you are just thrown right into the mix meeting both Brundle and Ronnie (or Vernoica) at the same time. The only other main character is John Getz who plays Stathis Borans the editor of the magazine that Veronica is working for. Getz is quite good playing a self-centred sleazebag. Also has a nice strong score by Howard Shore that meshes great with the film.<br/><br/>I think this really is a great film that works with very few main characters. It works on the acting, great story (writing credits go to Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg), Oscar winning effects (Chris Walas and Stephen Dupuis) and just wonderful direction from Cronenberg.<br/><br/>Maybe not for all tastes. Remember this is a Cronenberg horror film, so there is some gore. But think of it as a tragic love story with strong elements of horror and science fiction. If that does sound interesting to you this will likely be a film to watch."

","Classic. It's gross, has great effects. The process of Jeff turning into this infused fly is packed with suspense and gross-out horror. It has a sci-fi element, introducing some form of science and invention. It is also fairly sad as he has a bit of a romance with Geena Davis character. It's has a good dose of tragedy to it as well as being creepy and intriguing and expertly directed by David Cronenberg. That's all I got, brief words to be sure, but, Alas, those are my thoughts. It's a great movie, for both of its genres."

","Naked Lunch was the only Cronenberg I've watched before seeing this, and although I can't say that I liked it even a tiny bit; I admired the flashes of creativity I've seen throughout its 115-min run-time of an achingly phlegmatic pacing and self-indulgence. Therefore, I was optimistic that this renowned indie director's bizarre style could work for me someday. This day may has come, or maybe it's just this movie. Either way, all I can say is that I was definitely right!<br/><br/>First off, Chris Walas's standout, Oscar-winning makeup effects are just superbly sick! The last transformation is case in point, and I really haven't seen anything more impressive than those effects, aside from the equally brilliant practical effects that were used in Carpenter's The Thing.<br/><br/>What's even more awe-inspiring is how well-developed every single character in this movie is. They are constantly developing throughout the film's three acts. And each act adds more layers into them in a most graceful and reasonable way.<br/><br/>I want to confess that I have never considered Jeff Goldblum as an excellent actor. I always see him as one of the most charismatic actors, who play the same character in every film he's in, and I'm totally fine with that. That's because his quirky distinctive style of acting almost always pays off terrifically, so much so that his character steals the show every time. That said, the different phases his character go through in this movie prove that Goldblum's appeal isn't the only thing he has. For my surprise, Jeff Goldblum turned out to be a really talented actor who can flesh-out his character, figuratively and literally, masterfully.<br/><br/>Geena Davis is quite good as Veronica Quaife, whose character arc and the development of her romantic affair with the protagonist near the end reminded me of Belle in Beauty and the Beast a little bit. I think Stathis Borans is an insufferably cartoonish character during the first act. John Getz is not blame at all, as I think he really did a good job. Fortunately, Stathis is also a pretty strongly-developed character that changed a great deal at the third act, and hence became more credible.<br/><br/>I was overwhelmed by different feelings of pity, fear, disgust, and so many others, in the course of the movie's 96-min run-time. However, I think the denouement lacks intensity, since I found the ending predictable, and I saw it coming a bit early.<br/><br/>Other than the issues I've mentioned above, this movie really impressed me with all its creativity and originality. Cronenberg is truly a visionary filmmaker, and I hope I enjoy the rest of his filmography.<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

","One of the most hauntingly atmospheric and most mainstream work by Canadian David Cronenberg The Fly is an amazing film that is part horror, part science fiction and perhaps most surprisingly a tragic romance. Jeff Goldblum plays an introverted eccentric scientist who, by accident starts transforming into a housefly. Geena Davies plays a reporter who starts off covering his ""case"" but slowly falls for him. The special effects are very good, and the slow transformation is repulsive yet heart-wrenching. This film proves that old school puppetry when done right will always trump computer effects. The setting- Cronenberg's Toronto- is not just a backdrop but almost a character in itself. The actors are all very good in the role from Goldblum's quirky(a perfect casting if there ever was one) yet tragic Seth Brundle to Geena Davis as Veronica the love interest/reporter and John Getz who isn't like your typical villain. The Fly's esteem has only increased with each passing day and it will not only be considered as one of Cronenberg's most approachable films but also among the finest horror-scifi films."

","Not for the squeamish, this retelling of the 1958 classic is to say the least, a little bit more gory than the original.<br/><br/>A young scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) tries to entice a journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) back to his place to see his laboratory. She at first is not impressed but when Seth demonstrates his transporting device to her, she is amazes and immediately wants to report it to the public. Seth follows her to her editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) and all agree to delay the report.<br/><br/>Back at Seth's place the two inevitably fall into the sack and begin to become involved. When Seth successfully transports a baboon from one station to the other, the pair become ecstatic and open a bottle of champagne. Seth meanwhile has become jealous of Borans and while Veronica is away at the office becomes upset to the point of transporting himself in his devices. Unfortunately, he doesn't notice a common house fly in the chamber with him. Uh Oh!<br/><br/>When Seth emerges from the transporting devices, he at first feels normal. But soon he appears to gain strength and mobility and becomes a tireless lover. Veronica discovers some hair like growth on Seth's back. Gradually Seth begins to take on the characteristics of a fly and realizes that something went wrong with his experiment. His appearance begins to change drastically with Veronica becoming more and more fearful.<br/><br/>Veronica learns that she has become pregnant with Seth's child and wants to abort it fearing what might result from the birth. There is a particularly gross dream sequence here where Veronica imagines the birth of her child.<br/><br/>Seth who has re-named himself the ""Brundlefly"", breaks into the doctor's office where Veronica has gone for her abortion and steals her away returning to the lab. Borans goes with shot gun in hand to rescue her and............................................................ This is the real gory part. The sequence where the Brundlefly attacks Boranis is particularly gross.<br/><br/>Although very upsetting, this picture is well done for this type of horror. David Cronenberg was noted for his attention to detail hence the various makeups and prosthetics used in the fly's transformation. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are excellent in their roles going from star crossed young lovers to the horrors that await them. Watch for Canadian Heavyweight legend George Chuvalo as the man Seth arm wrestles in the bar.<br/><br/>Just a couple of questions. Where did Seth get all the money to finance his experiments? And what happens to Veronica afterward? Just asking.<br/><br/>Be afraid....really afraid."

"teodorodontosaurus","10","1","1","25 April 2018"," Diptera terror!
","Back when I was 9-10 years old, the horror genre started to fascinate me, thanks to my dad. I started watching movies with him at night, and then it became a routine. I don't even remember the names of all those horror movies that I have watched, except a few classic-cult movies such as ""The thing"" or ""Alien"". When I heard about ""The fly"", I immediately wanted to watch it. Firstly, there's my fascination with insects; secondly, I heard it was horror.
After the movie, I transcended into my bedroom of solitude and entered an intense meditation that fucked up my perception upon life and death. Usually, a horror movie injected in me fear and insanity; now, I also felt misery, desperation and extreme sadness. It was the first time I felt that way after watching a horror movie; indeed it was a premiere for me that night - the first time I experienced a drama/horror movie ( + sci-fi).
Everything seems perfect here: Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis' performances are top-notch, also a great plot, great scenes, stunning makeup and visual effects, memorable and majestic soundtrack. The creature effects are just pure awesomeness; for me, it surpasses all that CGI business, even today! In a horror movie, the use of CGI somehow makes it more predictable and less scary (the CGI makes it real and too natural to get scared). If it's done without the use of CGI (the use of suits, mechanized puppets etc), while it looks more fake, the subconscious perceives it as an anomaly, as something unnatural and thus, more disturbing, eerie, uncanny. The final ""Brundlefly"" creature's movement is so incredibly disturbing, just because of that; not to mention that it's anatomically correct - the inferior maxilla dropped in order to make room for other arthropod-like mouthparts, including the proboscis and the protruding labial palps.
This movie is the pure definition of horror!"
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","1","25 October 2017"," David Cronenberg crafts an incredibly gory, but ultimately effective science-fiction horror that works as a gut-punching scarefest
","David Cronenberg boasts a few top-notch tricks under his sleeve to pull off a reimagining of the 1958 original of the same name. For a director with an appealing pastiche of gruesome practical effects and ringing in an effectively grim atmosphere, Cronenberg crafts an astonishing rendition of a man who's human identity is slowly faded away by a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong. The Fly is not your standard horror picture boiled with vicious desires tingle with audiences' stomach with over-the-top gore and repulsiveness, it is one that carries a surprisingly gripping edge and journeys into an emotional territory that most horrors films hesitate to venture in. As disturbing and grotesque as it can get, it rarely pokes you with the feeling that Cronenberg believes that can filling the screen with stomach-turning gore is the only tool to leave you squirming in your seats. Of course, that is not to say it is a good idea to have lunch before sitting through this. This film places its focuses on eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (played by Jeff Goldblum) who hopes to revolutionize technology of his new teleportation machine, which he uses to grab the attention of a cute journalist Vanessa (played by Geena Davis). Determined to take his research one step further, Seth conducts an experiment where he steps into one of teleportation pods, unaware that a house fly has managed sneak into the other. Coming out the pod, Seth experiences bizarre and unsettling changes to his body as the fusion between him and the fly causes him to slowly morph into a hideous human-fly hybrid creature. <br/><br/>David Cronenberg embraces his trademark grandeur of gruesome practical effects reminiscent to his previous works, and combines it with sharp precision of storytelling to conduct a brutally bleak horror tale that works in the fashion of a gripping human tragedy. Lead character Seth Brundle has met the love of his life and hopes to impress her with his outlandish research, but all goes wrong when a simple task leaves his man peeling away from the very identity that defines him. And if you think there is no room for an emotional human touch, think again, because Cronenberg places it at the heart of this bodily transformation plot. The story progresses with a menacing tone as the lead character watches as his body steadily deforms into a hideous figure complete with gritty-looking make-up and prosthetics while losing his limbs including his ears, and a sense of dread crowds the atmosphere as Seth sees his relationship with Vanessa deteriorating at the hands of his ugly bodily transformation that makes the Toxic Avenger look like a snuggle doll. And that is just part of how Cronenberg effectively breaths humanity into both Seth and Vanessa. It is an effective alternative element to the more common route of the monstrous villain hunting down victims and picking them of one by one. And this picture would not have worked as strongly without the performance by Jeff Goldblum who poses a convincing a normal human man morphing into less and less of a human. As for Geena Davis, there is no problem with giving her credit.<br/><br/>The Fly is a gripping science-fiction horror picture bound with an astonishing human touch that renders the film drifting from your average horror movie conventions. Thanks to David Cronenberg, it works in more ways than what one might expect from an 80s gorefest. One thing is for sure though, it is definitely not for the faint of heart."

","To me, The Fly is the crowning jewel of 80s Sci-Fi horror. The animatronics, the special effects make-up, the acting, the story... It all makes for a great movie. From start to finish, this movie is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>What I loved about the movie right off the bat was that it did not mess around. The movie starts in the middle of a conversation between the 2 main characters, and Brundle is explaining exactly what the movie is about. From then on the story just flows brilliantly, with no dilly-dallying. There's no mystery, there's no ambiguity, its just a story about an inventor and his machine.<br/><br/>The artistry that went into the make-up, and the Brundle-Fly possibly make this movie stand out as the most realistic looking 80s horror. The Fly didn't need to be shadowed, or ambiguously shot, to hide any flaws.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum's acting is creepy, and suits the character so well. You really got a feeling of discomfort for Gina Davis's character.<br/><br/>One scene that really caught me by surprise was the baboon and the fly. It really baffles me how they were able to film a fly and a baboon together in the same shot, and seem as though they could direct them both with ease."

","Here was another film I really loved to have seen, cinema wise, but again I was one, two years shy of being admitted. The Fly, with those unforgettable tag line words, is a well formed horror film, with wonderful FX, and some strong doses of gore, here and there, where it doesn't, over exploit it. It takes itself more serious as a fine featured horror, and it beautifully is, with it's wonderfully constructed storyline, and gradual, unrushed build, up in an experiment, gone wrong. Genius inventor, Goldblum who's just dynamite, in still one of his top performances, who while stepping into one of his cool shaped tele, transportation pods, makes the mistake of having unexpected company. A small misfortune on his part, as a fly gets in there with him, where both insect and human form one, where Goldblum begins a deteriorating process, as he slowly begins to resemble more features and characteristics of a fly. It's an absorbing and engrossing study, on the writer's part (this guy, also responsible for the Psycho 3, installment, my favorite) only released 3 months before this. Goldblum sickly spouts some funny lines of dialogue. In the early stages, prefore to Goldblum's changing deformities, in that cafe, with a fast talking over hyped Seth, is the one scene that sticks out. Again, great acting on Goldblum's part. Oscar potential. Geena Davis is really good too as a journalist, and Goldblum's new love, Her publisher and ex (John Getz) a refined, slight sleazeball, steals her thunder.... acting wise too. This is one of those better horror films/or Sci fi horrors, that have been shaped, and crafted into one of the more respective ones. Don't go looking for a lot of gore though. One of 87's early surprises. A dead fly was in my special fried rice, the day of the film's release in Adelaide. Coincidence?"
"karl_consiglio","8","1","1","16 November 2006"," This film is a buzzzzzzz
","A frightening romantic horror movie. It is very strange since Cronenberg is the master of this kind of stuff that he never made his version of Kafka's Metamorphosis. The fly is so raw that I wondered as I was watching it if I would have appreciated it as much if I was just flicking through some channels and came across it or if its simply my trust in Cronenberg which once I followed it through, I realized how truly amazing this film is. Goldblum is perfect for the part of the nutty scientist with a David Copperfield aura round him Dr Seth Brundle and he does have the characteristics of a fly. he plays the part convincingly, except for the fact that we never see him feast on a big piece of dung or manure. I love Cronenberg's obsession with toying around with the flesh to replace it with something new that always turns out to be most terrifying. This film sums up with lots of the similarities in his previous works at the time, but still today you know what makes a Cronenberg film."
"Devndemn","Null","1","1","11 July 1999"," Thinking Man's Horror
","David Cronenberg has always managed to direct stylish, off-beat films that bear his unmistakable touch.  This film is an example of the director at his finest moment.  More than anything else, this is a love story...a story of human compassion in the face of transfiguring degeneration.  Jeff Goldblum excels as Seth Brundle, a man with good intentions that go bad through no fault of his own.  Equally as powerful is Geena Davis as Veronica, his love. One of the main themes of ""THE FLY"" is how love transcends the boundaries of the physical.  Even as Seth's body deteriorates and metamorphasizes into a monstrousity, Veronica never leaves his side.  She remains the one constant in his life as it crumbles about him.  She never lets his appearance deter her from keeping her love the only solace Seth knows. Even as Seth fights to keep in control of his mind as the mind of the fly (the instinct as opposed to the reason) continues to take over, Veronica remains at his side.<br/><br/>Another theme, as mentioned above, is not only the physical deterioration of the body...but the mental breakdown as well.  Seth battles constantly to keep the irrational, instinct-driven mind of the fly at bay as to keep his own logic and human reasoning in control (to keep Veronica safe more than anything else).<br/><br/>Cronenberg has always managed to invent films that have a ""body and mind"" theme.  Efforts such as ""THE BROOD"" and ""VIDEODROME"" relate to this theme more clearly.  Despite the visceral special effects, this film remains a seminal classic.  It gains and never loses a human touch that drives the horror elements home with gut-wrenching success.  A must-see for Cronenberg fans and a nice, surprising shock for evryone else.  You do not need to be a horror buff to appreciate this classy, but sick, film!"

","The original ""The Fly"" was a more poigant story of ""man playing God"" and in the process loses himself.  About 28 yrs later, the remake approached the mythology of this classic from a new perspective. The filmmakers injected the story with more horror mixed in with the basic elemnts of sci-fi and the original story. I also felt that the movie's strongest point didn't lie in the special effects or reworked story, but the simple psychology of seeing ""Brundle"" not turned into a fly instantously, but fusing with it on a genetic level, to watch him slowly turn into a creature the world has never seen.  The makeup effects are just awe-inspiring as well as a bit overdone. That is probaly the weakest point of this movie. I think the filmakers went a little far in empasizing the changes we see in Goldblum's character. I liked the gore, but near the end, it got a little too weird and flat-out disgusting. Other than that, the performances are good, especially Jeff Goldblum's,who is the centerpiece of this film and holds it together to the very end.

"jimbo-53-186511","6","3","6","15 December 2014"," Cronenberg's darker reimagining of the 1958 original is a worthy remake, but I personally still preferred the original
","Whether you like this film or not, I think that Cronenberg deserves some acknowledgement for putting his own stamp on this remake. This isn't a rehash of the original. In fact many elements are different and ultimately how much you appreciate this film will depend on 2 things; 1) Whether you've seen the original film and 2) If you preferred the minor alterations that Cronenberg made to the original film. The problem for me is that many of the changes that Cronenberg made to this film weakened it as a whole in my opinion for the following reasons;<br/><br/>In the original film, our scientist was a family man who had a loving wife and child. He was a likable guy, as was his wife and even the kid had a certain charm about him. The other thing that I really liked about the original is the way it was played out as a mystery film - it kept you hooked in and was engaging and interesting throughout its running time. When watching the original you were constantly left in a state of wonder.<br/><br/>Then we come to Cronenberg's remake.....<br/><br/>The big problem that I had with this film is that the whole film had a sleazy mean-spirited feel about it. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) was a sleazy guy who just didn't seem to care about anyone but himself - his misogynistic attitude towards women coupled with his psychotic behaviour didn't help either. It really made me indifferent to his character. I suppose part of his erratic behaviour could have been attributed to his accident, but to be honest I took a disliking to his character pretty much from the start. The relationship between Seth and journalist Veronica wasn't explored particularly well - in fact all I saw her as was a f*** buddy. The chemistry between the two wasn't great and to me the whole film felt heartless and cold.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with this film is that Cronenberg seemed more interested in shocking and scaring his audience than in making us care for his characters or to be involved in his story. I also felt at times that Cronenberg went too far - did we really need to see a baboon get fried from the inside out? It's interesting that the film has the tagline 'Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid' but was it really that scary? You may get one or two cheap jump scares from the excessive gore on show, but this isn't what I'd categorise as scary - I much prefer psychological horror.<br/><br/>One thing I did like about this remake is that it does make more of an attempt to explore the psychological aspect of Seth's condition, there are also one or two nice scenes between Seth and Veronica. As I mentioned above, Cronenberg deserves credit for making this film his own and I'll admit that it is reasonably good and I'll also admit that I was never bored when watching this film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is all about taste; gore hounds will love this film and will lap up Cronenberg darker and much more disturbing remake. As for me, I enjoyed this film, but the suspense & mystery of the original will always make it a much more satisfying film in my opinion."
"FilmCriticLalitRao","10","3","6","20 September 2014"," In ""The Fly"" veteran Canadian director David Cronenberg depicted why all sciences are not good sciences.
","The great Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus stated that change is the only constant in life. One must watch ""The Fly"" bearing this fundamental quote in mind as a lot has changed in our world especially in the way horror films are continuing to influence public opinion in last few years. The reason why ""The Fly"" continues to hold sway is that it was one of the initial films to suggest that all sciences are not good and some sciences can even have bad effects on human societies. What makes ""The Fly"" revolutionary as well as groundbreaking is its inclusion of ideas and innovations on which people are working in 21st century. As examples, one can mention the sensitive issues of abortion and human cloning. It is interesting to watch how Canadian director David Cronenberg arrives at a balanced approach to drama as well as horror. He gets good support from actress Geena Davis who appears quite convincing as a confident yet fragile woman torn between two men. In 1986, when this film was released, nobody was willing to trust the idea of human teleportation as most people were much too scared to even imagine the concept of sitting in a box to come out of another box. Hence, in 2014, nobody would doubt that watching 'The Fly' nearly three decades after its initial release would turn out to be an extremely strange experience for loyal David Cronenberg admirers as well as for viewers who possess little knowledge about his visionary films."
"BA_Harrison","9","3","6","29 June 2009"," Accomplished music video hacks, foreign movie directors with one success under their belt, and Michael Bay—please take note: THIS is how to do a horror remake!
","The Fog, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Omen: just a few of the classic horror titles that have recently suffered the indignity of an extremely inferior remake by greedy studios keen to make an easy buck. With box office receipts the only consideration, the makers of these lazy cash-cows make no attempt at improving upon the originals, aware that indiscriminate teens will flock to see their films, regardless of quality.<br/><br/>Back in the 80s, however, things were a little different: easy money came in the form of sequels, which were churned out in rapid succession, but remakes were rare and a surprising amount of care went into their production. Chuck Russell's 1988 version of The Blob was a hugely entertaining romp from a director who clearly loved the genre; John Carpenter's The Thing oozed with atmosphere and pushed make-up FX to a new level; but it was David Cronenberg's re-imagining of The Fly which really proved that a skilled director blessed with a unique vision could turn a remake into a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Cronenberg keeps the basic plot from the Vincent Price classic—a scientist experimenting with teleportation becomes horribly disfigured after his body is accidentally merged with that of a housefly—but discards the silly notion of a man sporting a massive fly head and arm. Instead, the director once again indulges his obsession with 'the flesh', and has his protagonist suffer a much more gradual fate: in the days following his seemingly successful experiment, genius Seth Brundle (a wonderfully eccentric Jeff Goldblum) gradually transforms into a monstrous creature as his body struggles to fuse his own DNA with that of the fly.<br/><br/>In addition to losing his looks, bits of his body, his ability to digest, and eventually his mind, Brundle also has to cope with the possibility of losing girlfriend Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who is pregnant with his child. When madness finally takes control of Seth, and his transformation into 'Brundlefly' is almost complete, the scientist abducts Veronica as she attempts to abort her pregnancy, takes her home to his lab, and pushes her into one of his teleportation pods, his intention being to merge himself with Veronica and their unborn child, thus creating the ultimate family.<br/><br/>A superb central performance from Goldblum, whose quirky, individualistic acting style is perfect for such an unusual role, is perfectly complemented by the equally unique Davis, and solid support is given from John Getz as Veronica's loathsome ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans. The film also benefits immensely from stunning creature and gore effects courtesy of make-up artist Chris Walas (who created the memorable creatures from Gremlins); these ensure that The Fly is as nauseating as it is heart-breakingly tragic. Amongst the revolting sights on offer are a very painful looking broken arm inflicted by Seth during a show of strength in a bar, a quivering inside-out baboon (one of Seth's earlier mistakes), and the Brundlefly vomiting corrosive liquid onto Stathis' hand and foot.<br/><br/>If I was going to nitpick, I might argue that baboons seem like an unnecessarily dangerous test animal for Brundle to work with (but then again, maybe they had a special on baboons at the pet store) and the scientist's uncanny ability to program a computer to recognise the poetry of flesh (as he puts it) comes a little too easy, but these are minor niggles and do very little to spoil the film as a whole.<br/><br/>With Hollywood currently showing no sign of slowing down the remake production line, perhaps those responsible should take a look at The Fly to remind themselves how the job should be done properly."

","This is the very rare example of a horror movie in which special effects and the horrifying component are not as important as the characters. It's also the even more rare example of a horror movie which actually tells a real story, based on the characters' lives and personalities and on the events that make them interact. The acting is in effect much better than anyone would expect (Jeff Goldblum's performance is truly remarkable, I personally started liking him after watching this one), plus director David Cronenberg managed to transform original film from 1958 by the same title from common sci-fi low-budgeted flick to well illustrated journey into human flesh (Kafka's influence is pretty evident). The horrific make up which slowly turns our man into the final hybrid monster well deserved its Oscar and made this movie, at the time of its release, object of cult (I remember I was just a child at the time and everybody was talking about The Fly, I practically knew the movie before I first saw it). I can easily say this is my favorite horror movie of all time."

It has a terrific set-up of introductions to the three characters we really get to know, and the intimacy is very powerful, as we really feel like we're getting to know these people. The terror is also real, or as real as can be believed, which is very real indeed. Jeff Goldblum gives his ultimate performance as the brilliant Seth Brundle, a man who's genius goes awry, and soon, his life is turned upside down! Geena Davis certainly gives us a real character to embrace, as she falls in love with Goldblums' Brundle. As the story takes it's turns and leaps, the love that the two leads share is stretched through fear and power, and bravery. The film is so depressing by that point, that we feel the loss we know will come. It really holds us well, as it brings us to the very end. Cronenberg is a master at this, and I will forever love this film."

We, as does the Geena Davis character, still see that ""thing"" as Seth Brundle, at least in some sense. This is as moving as a sci-fi, horror movie can get. We care about these characters.

","As a remake, this movie is an excellent demonstration of the advancements of science and technology and how they influence the entertainment industry. While there is more science in the content of this production, there is also more science in its making.<br/><br/>I found the on-screen chemistry between Goldblum and Davis to be delightful and it was portrayed on screen just as lovely as the world witnessed it off screen. The producers did well to capitalize on the relationship between these two very lovable and dynamic thespians while the relationship was still ""golden."" While there were omitted scenes, and the story line was somewhat altered, I found the newest story to be very compelling, tense, and fresh. The photography in this movie was excellent, as was the film quality, and I absolutely loved the dialog. It was intelligent and witty, dramatic and raw.<br/><br/>The cinematography was creatively done, so as to give you the benefits of the best possible angles, the best of the shots and takes were selected. The set designs and layouts were obviously done with respect to the story in mind; the science IN the story. I found the whole idea, design, and execution of the transportation pods to be very well done, at the time; new and innovative. Now, of course, the excellent work done here, is a bit dated, but for the age and era in which it was done, it was done very well; with a creativity and expression seldom seen in the industry these days.<br/><br/>And while this was a remake, it was in no way a cheapened version of the original; such as we have now with remake after remake being churned out of the gullets of Hollywood...watered down versions of the old classics, nothing but money making ventures which offer nothing in the way of intellect or entertainment to the masses.

"vsturkey","10","3","6","26 March 2003"," Operatic!
","This is the only movie I have ever seen that is truly like an opera - a Puccini-weeping, tormented drama.  It could have been a play.  I really, really like this movie, and the fact that it is an opera without song is very high praise.  <br/><br/>Great opera pulls you in, fascinates you and challenges you to throw away your disbelief (not just suspend it).  And so does The Fly.<br/><br/>The Fly has a tightly-written dramatic pull, along the lines of the classic 5-act Shakespearean model, where tension builds and builds, then relaxes, then comes in for the big end.  It has, likewise, a Shakespearean sense of undeserved tragedy, where one is grossly over-penalized for an initial error.<br/><br/>Geena Davis here is like Liu' from Turandot and Cio-Cio San from Madama Butterfly.  She plays the tragedy and suffering and shock so well!  But she is not insubstantial.  She is wise and sharp and energetic - and so we feel her pain and fear so much more!<br/><br/>It is very rare to see agony and weeping over a lifeless body in a movie. Can anyone name me a scene from a movie in the past 20 years that has it? It happens in every one of Puccini's big operas, however.  And it works in The Fly!  I am completely caught up in her agony and in the tragedy of the scientist's hideous end.<br/><br/>Finally, another device in Puccini (and Shakespeare) is a sense of eventuality.  We know from about the 8th minute of this movie that it ain't gonna work out.  The movie does not play with us and tease us and surprise us - it is worthy as a story in itself, and plays it straight all the way through.  Just like La Boheme and Madama Butterfly and Tosca - we know that these Puccini operas are gonna end bad - we know it and we keep watching - we get sucked in because we are enthralled in the story and in the art. Same with The Fly.  The story is so compelling and the characters so interesting.  (And, yes, the special effects only deepen the experience. These special effects service the plot - they do not just exist for their own sake.)<br/><br/>I just thought this side of this great movie has been overlooked.  And I have only scratched the surface of the parallels.  If you like The Fly, see a video of Madama Butterfly!  (I am dead serious.)"

"Boba_Fett1138","9","3","7","1 July 2006"," Not quite fully an horror movie and not quite fully a science-fiction movie. Instead its an unique movie experience in almost every way possible
","""The Fly"" is hard to classify. There never has been a movie like this before and there will never be one again, since the way of movie-making and story telling is so brilliantly unique of this movie. It's not really an horror movie, for it's not consistently scary and gory enough for that. The movie can be divided into several parts and to every part of the movie a different genre label can be put. Cronenberg simply chooses to ignore that there are different movie genres and he tries to create his very own movie with his very own unique view and take on the story. He ignores all of the 'Hollywood' movie rules with as a result this brilliant and unique movie.<br/><br/>The storytelling is for most part slow and mysterious. It helps to give the movie a certain atmosphere of fear and paranoia. The movie has very few settings and actors in it. It doesn't waste anytime on wide-shots, needless side-plots and characters. Instead it choices a straight forward approach. It works powerful and compelling. We as viewers get immediately drawn into the story and the 'action', so to speak, immediately starts of. It are all reasons why this movie is only 95 minutes short but its long enough to cover everything that has to be told.<br/><br/>The unique way of storytelling is probably also the reason why this movie feels so realistic to watch. You just never know what is going to happen next and the characters are mostly unpredictable. The story and characters take several turns as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The wonderful dialog is another thing that adds to the realism of the movie. Of course the dialog is also perfectly delivered by the fine cast. Jeff Goldblum plays his character in a way only Goldblum can. With this movie he deliverers one of his most memorable performances. Geena Davis in this movie also shows that she is a very talented actress. It's too bad her career never really got of the ground, in terms of playing respectable and tough roles. She is a well known Hollywood-star but she never really appeared in any widely acclaimed and respected movie, with the exception of this movie, ""Beetle Juice"" and ""Thelma & Louise"", for which she was nominated for an Oscar. Three years before that she even won an Oscar for her role in ""The Accidental Tourist"". But having a successful 5 years just isn't enough for an actress of her caliber. A real shame because when you watch this movie it becomes obvious that the talent is definitely there. John Getz also plays a great role. He plays an unpredictable character that at moments you hate and at others you like him again. Just like in real life, none of the characters are fully bad or fully good. Everyone has a darker less pleasant side and director Cronenberg is not afraid to show this.<br/><br/>The special effects are simple and quite poor but considering that this movie was released in 1986, it's acceptable. The Oscar winning make-up effects on the other hand are fantastic. There are very gory. Even more gory than the most hardened horror movie. The make-up effects are one of the main reasons why the horror elements of the movie work out so very well, especially toward the ending. It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time, even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's a very well constructed movie that can't really be defined. A typical Cronebergian gem, with more layers, meanings and elements in it then you would see at first sight. Almost everything about it is unique. It makes ""The Fly"" a one of a kind movie that is an absolute must-see, at least if you have a strong enough stomach, for this movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

This is probably Jeff Goldblum's best film. I like it even more than ""Jurassic Park"".<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I wish it was longer. I feel like they could have shown us more of Goldblum going insane. The music is great and it's full of moments to make you jump out of your seat. I think most people probably already know the plot. It's about a scientist who uses a teleportation device not knowing a fly was with him, causing his DNA to merge and turn into a giant fly.

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","2","4","26 February 2015"," It leaves an impression forever
","The Fly is definitely one of the best horror films ever made. If you think that I'm exaggerating then you've gotta watch it, because it's not just a horror film, it's a disturbing and eye-opening view of suffering, misery and loss, and a love that ultimately can't exist. It's surprisingly painful to watch, what with scenes such as Brundle literally falling apart, decaying in front of his reporter girlfriend, and as she hugs him while he cries her eyes are filled with a horror and confusion, no longer able to see the kind man she fell in love with, just the fly he's becoming.<br/><br/>Special effects add several scenes to this movie that aren't gory per-say, but hell, they are D-I-S-T-U-R-B-I-N-G!!! As a little girl I watched The Fly on television years ago and to this day the scene with the baboon showing up in the teleporter inside-out, crying in terror and surrounded by its own organs and bones, creeps me out on dark nights. The maggot baby scene is disgusting and creepy beyond belief, but The Fly is unique in that the effects don't take away from the story at all, they're spared for the few moments when they're best needed and despite the makeup and effects used to give Brundle his sick appearance, you can still feel sorry for him and sympathize with his horrible situation. It takes a lot of power for a movie to achieve that and I think The Fly did an amazing job.<br/><br/>The Fly is also full of late Eighties nostalgia; the music, fashion, hairstyles and buildings are all reminiscent of living in an urban area in the 1980's. If you're into the 'love triangle' plot, this movie has that too with the involvement of Borans as a main character.<br/><br/>This movie deserves so much more than its current reputation; very rarely have I seen a sci-fi horror film that can be so sinister yet so tragic all at once and it leaves a lasting impression - once you've seen it, it's a horror film that makes you wonder."
"Flamboyant_Little_Devil","9","2","4","13 September 2014"," More than just a Horror movie; and better than the original at that
","Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is one of those (very) few remakes that are better than the original. Nothing against the original in itself - after all it is a timeless classic of the ""mad-scientist-experiment-gone-wrong"" horror genre. But this one is a pure Cronenbergian take on it's own and probably one of his best movies (if not the best).<br/><br/>What really sets this movie apart - even as a horror movie - is the emotional depth and the dialogues. It is rare to get both meaning and emotion working as perfectly in a horror movie as it works in this Film. The dialogues take a rather pleasant philosophical plunge to what ""Flesh"", ""Destruction"" and ""Reconstruction"" are concerned and a latter ""Insect Politics"" can move the viewer if he/she envisions him/herself going through what the main character (Seth Brundle) is then experiencing.<br/><br/>It's not a simplistic film. It's not a ""shocker"" per se, but it indeed gets visually shocking and even disgusting to a certain extent (wich is also one of the reasons it gets to be memorable). But in truth, if there were to be none of the intellectual ventures and the emotion that the characters show towards what is happening (and their own relationship) this wouldn't be a Cronenberg Film, rather just another horror show.<br/><br/>In my very humble opinion, this is one of the best horror movies to this date.

I'd like to start off first by saying Jeff Goldblum laid down a great and very memorable performance, possibly the best of his career. His performance from before his teleportation, transitioning to after the teleportation process is great. Geena Davis did quite well in this movie too. Nothing special, but still a good performance. Overall the performances by all the actor's were great, but Goldblum's performance was the greatest and very memorable.<br/><br/>'The Fly' won the Academy Award in 1986 for Best Makeup and deservingly so. The makeup in 'The Fly' is absolutely on point and is by far some of the best makeup ever used in a film. Along with makeup, the effects in this movie were fantastic. Disturbingly realistic and again, some of the best effects I have personally seen in a film. Makeup and effects will more than likely stick with the viewers as it is brilliant and disturbing. <br/><br/>With performances and makeup being the clear standouts in the movie, the score should not be overshadowed.

Definitely a classic that all film buffs must see, with a memorable performance from Jeff Goldblum, as well as very memorable makeup and effects that will stick with the viewer as some of the best.

"Red-Barracuda","9","2","4","11 June 2014"," Intelligent and excellent remake of a cult classic
","At the time The Fly was made, there was a fashion for remaking 50's sci-fi horror flicks with upgraded special effects and the more adult content that the times allowed. The original Vincent Price movie was from 1958 and is something of a cult classic. It has some camp value certainly but mostly it worked because it had an interesting premise that was executed well. David Cronenberg's remake retained the basic idea but updated it with more complex ideas and, of course, ground-breaking special effects. In a sense, The Fly was the last pure horror film that Cronenberg ever made, despite some of his subsequent movies certainly having elements of the genre. As such it represents the final entry in a truly brilliant series of sci-fi horror feature films that began with Shivers in 1975. It's probably fair to say that The Fly is his most mature work of that sequence, in the sense of his screenplay being strong, with the production values and actors being good enough to carry it off consistently well. But that's not to say it's his best work from the period, I have even more of a fondness for his rougher earlier films and would arguably consider Videodrome to be his master-work. But this is all relative really, as The Fly remains a fantastic work and one of the very best horror or sci-fi films from the 80's.<br/><br/>The story focuses for the most part on a research scientist called Seth Brundle and science magazine reporter. He is a reclusive intellectual who has developed telepods which can transport matter through space, while she wishes to report on it. They form a relationship which complicates matters resulting in Brundle deciding to go through his teleportation device himself one night. Unfortunately for him he unknowingly is sharing the telepod with an ordinary harmless house fly<br/><br/>In these days of ten-a-penny remakes and reboots, it is especially refreshing to look back on a new version of an old film that updated it in ways that made it seem necessary that it was remade. Cronenberg had shown in his previous horror films that he was a director full of original thought, so it's not really surprising that he took the ingredients from the original movie and remodelled them into one of his unique body-horror flicks. The old movie was essentially a creature feature with a difference, in that the monster was not a marauding menace but a tragic being. In this way it recalled Frankenstein, with its sympathetic monster but with the added angle that the scientist responsible becomes the monster/victim himself. Cronenberg retains this idea but has the scientist fuse with the fly at a molecular, genetic level; meaning that a new creature entirely, emerges. In this way Brundle's metamorphosis into the Brundlefly is more gradual beginning with small things such as excessive sugar intake, moving on to extreme strength and resulting in physical transformation. The effects work here is exemplary and Oscar winning; in fact, the man responsible Chris Walas was given director duties for the very decent sequel, The Fly II.<br/><br/>What really separates this film with Cronenberg's earlier ones is that it's emotionally resonant with sympathetic characters. Its plot boils down to an unorthodox love story of sorts. The way in which it has such a strong and realistic emotional undercurrent without sacrificing any of the gruesome and imaginative sci-fi horror aspects is what makes it so successful and relatively unusual in the genre. It's helped rather a lot by the acting contributions of Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis who both put in strong performances; Goldblum in particular has never been better than here. Ultimately, The Fly remains a definitive example of how to intelligently remake a beloved old movie – keep it the same, while making it different – it's a lot harder than it seems!"
"lakemat67","9","2","4","4 February 2014"," What a heartbreaking horror story...
","David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" (1986) is one of those rare occurrences in the film world where a remake is eons ahead of it's predecessor in every possible way. The original ""The Fly"" was pretty much a one note horror quickie, notable only for the presence of horror film icon Vincent Price and the ridiculous and often spoofed visual of a fly caught in a spider's web crying in a cartoonish voice ""help me!"" Back then, as today, people laughed at it's foolishness.<br/><br/>But in 1986, Cronenberg, who has always been a thinking man's horror auteur, chose to take the same story, and infuse it with emotion, character development, a small bit of social commentary, and last but not least, romance. Taking the core idea of teleportation gone horribly wrong, ""The Fly"" centers on maverick scientist Seth Brundle, (played in a tour De force by Jeff Goldblum in what is easily his finest on screen work ever)who designs an invention that he claims will ""change humanity and life as we know it forever"", that being an operable and functioning teleportation system which can disintegrate matter completely and re-integrate it completely in another location in less then a second.<br/><br/>His invention is revealed to a science magazine reporter, Ronnie, played by Geena Davis (who would, coincidentally wind up marrying Goldblum in real life for a few years in the wake of this film.) At first, it seems Brundle's invention will be the dawn of a new age of transportation and technology, and as Ronnie willingly documents his work, the two fall in love. But, a past relationship Ronnie has had with her former lover and current editor results in Brundle's feelings of jealousy, so much so that one night, out of aggravation and hurt, he decides to teleport himself to test the telepods on living matter. The experiment succeeds, but unfortunately goes awry when a common housefly gets trapped in the pod with Brundle, unbeknownst to him at the time.<br/><br/>Here is where the significant and much better differences between Cronenberg's version and the original begin. Instead of winding up with a silly looking fly head on his body, as in the original, the change to Brundle starts much more slowly. His stamina and overall strength is increased, much to Brudle's delight, but as time wears on, his body starts to deteriorate as it begins to metamorphose, not into a fly, but a genetic fusion of a creature never before created, a hybrid of a human being and a fly. During all of this, Ronnie is at first horrified, and then heartbroken over what is happening to Brundle. Worse still, for her, she realizes she may be carrying the unborn child of whatever Brundle is becoming.<br/><br/>In the end, as Brundle becomes more monster and less man, Ronnie heartbreakingly realizes that she must do for him one last act of compassion, to put him out of his agony, permanently. The last moments of the film will both cause you revulsion, but at the same time, tears of sadness over the tragic predicament our couple has found themselves in.<br/><br/>Made during the 80's, at a time when the AIDS virus was running rampant and sex and sexuality were fast becoming things to be feared, rather then embraced, ""The Fly"", under Cronenberg's direction, presents Brundle's rash decision without forethought as a metaphor for the precariousness of exposing oneself to unseen peril without rational deliberation.<br/><br/>Some people have found themselves disliking this version of ""The Fly"", either for it's graphic and rather disgusting special effects, and others have objected to it's heavily implied, but never really shown, sexual content. Where you stand on this issue depends on your ability to see the subtext that lies beneath the narrative. Rare is the film that can be taken both as an engaging work of fiction, and yet still provide topical commentary on notions and attitudes of the day. ""The Fly"" works well on both these levels, and ultimately provides both a gripping tale of science, horror and love gone wrong, and a cautionary message of being aware of the consequences of your actions before there is no going back.<br/><br/>It's been said by many that Goldblum should have garnered at least an Oscar nomination for his work here, if not the prize itself. I'm inclined to agree. If the purpose of award winning acting is to present a character so vividly and emotionally resonant with the viewer, then Goldblum's work meets and exceeds that requirement quite handily. Sadly, the notorious ""Academy"" has never held much respect for films from the horror or science fiction genres. It would not be until ""Silence Of The Lambs"", five years later, that a horror film would be lauded at the highest level.<br/><br/>But, be that as it may, ""The Fly"" is definitely worth your time and attention. Be prepared to be shocked, stunned, saddened, and as Geena Davis opines in the film, ""Be afraid...be very afraid..."""
"secondtake","7","2","4","7 July 2010"," In some ways better than the original, but with emotional holes
","The Fly (1986)<br/><br/>I just saw the original 1958 ""The Fly"" and as creaky as it was in some ways, it was a thrilling idea and had some great roles. Two days later I'm zooming ahead three decades, and boy, what a difference a day makes. It's better and it's worse. But rather than compare them, we turn to the 1986 version, directed by semi-auteur big budget director, David Cronenberg.<br/><br/>The story again dominates, but it has taken amazing leaps in concept. If you like the transporter idea, that's only the beginning. The longer the movie runs, the more bizarre and campier it gets. In fact, if you can skip the first half hour (and you could, actually) you'll have more fun. In the second half of the plot, the lead boy genius scientist (now more like 30) played by Jeff Goldblum, disintegrates. This is good for a lot of reasons, one of them is to get beyond Jeff Goldblum the actor, who seems to alway show his awareness of the camera and ruin what might be better acting, and better characters. So when he is no longer quite himself, we are mesmerized by the horrors of the plot. Of course, you have to get past the grotesqueness of it all--it is really gross--but that's part of the ongoing shock.<br/><br/>Geena Davis? Completely convincing and solid as a reporter and eventual second fiddle to Goldblum. And the third actor with any part at all, John Getz, the reporter's editor, is forgivably awful, and meant to be unsavory. The relationship (sexual and otherwise) between these three is unconvincing at best, and the notion that the reporter would even slightly trust this editor is untenable. That much we need to believe in, just as much as we can imagine the other love affair, which is both believable and loaded with implications later.<br/><br/>But the idea, the idea! Simplified and impossible, it's still a perfect movie scenario, and it's a riot, and terrifying. When it defies logic, swallow and give it a chance. Not a quite great movie, but great fun."
"johnnyboyz","7","2","4","1 September 2008"," I've plenty of good buzz for this film.
","With The Fly, we have a film about experimentation; about updating; about taking science and experiments to a whole new level  a film about modernity and the transforming of the old into the new. But the manner of which these ideas and experiments are transpired relies quite heavily on an item of nature: a fly. The Fly by David Cronenberg is a film about the fusion and transport of different matter  ironic then how the film itself is a fusion of genres and is indeed a remake or 'updating' of an old film from the latter years of Hollywood's Classical era. Its themes and ideas of experimentation and one man's greed, in a way, to succeed over everyone else is an interesting point for study.<br/><br/>The Fly does not hang around, opening at a large gala in which science recluse Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is out and about amongst many other people which is a rarity for the film and is perhaps a rarity for the character even before these events transpire. Seth is working on something big but he isn't ready to go public just yet as some of the more technical issues (such as seeing if it actually works) are not tried and tested, but they will be in all their cinematic glory.<br/><br/>I think Cronenberg realises that the film is less so a piece of entertainment and more so a study of a decent into madness and depression through loneliness even though its individual is an actual fly for that period. But the film falls into the genres of horror and science-fiction; two genres that you would commonly associate with entertainment or escapism as film in these genres usually enter the realm of the uncanny or the fantastical. Not in The Fly and never does Cronenberg really come across as someone who wants to make a film about a guy who becomes a giant bug and cause damage, indeed his mindset and attitude is to stay at home and welcome the odd visit from female reporter who he met at the opening gala, Veronica Quaife (Davis).<br/><br/>Then again just because the film does not go out and out to give you thrills and kicks, that's not to say it isn't entertaining anyway. The Fly is a fascinating little film but it never veers too far over into the pretentious or even further into the 'shock' realm. Yes, it's nasty and its special effects are pretty gruesome and the overall character mindset of Brundle once he becomes devoured by this fly's attributes and appearance are somewhat shocking but it is not a deliberate attempt to raise eyebrows in the sense The Evil Dead might've done with its high content of violence or Caligula with its high content of nudity.<br/><br/>As a director shooting a piece, The Fly has several hallmarks of just genuinely good direction. The film can rack up the suspense; draw us into looking away from the screen even though there is nothing really there to be afraid of and yet every time Veronica pays a visit to Seth, we want her to make contact; talk for a short while and then leave whilst getting as far away as possible and that's because the film creates such an unnerving atmosphere as Seth descends more and more into his transformation. There is also the scene in which the transformation(s) are finally revealed, whatever they may be of, and the smoke that creeps out of the transporter ala mist over graveyards in horror films of old, thus delaying our seeing the results of the transformation and the tension is racked up.<br/><br/>But Cronenberg isn't afraid of including the odd scene nearer the beginning to do with animal cruelty and nor is he afraid to have his lead character tear off his own flesh and pop his own fingernails. But these scenes exist not purely to gross the audience out but are included to inform the viewer of Seth's continuous decline into physical change. The smart thing here being that while Seth comes across as slightly eccentric and perhaps a bit of a loner in the opening scenes, his transformation from 'normal' to 'abnormal' is not necessarily a psychological one as a result of isolation and more so a physical one as a result of his own quest for personal glory to do with his work. It doesn't help that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time, either.<br/><br/>But The Fly retains an atmosphere of horror throughout, aided by some nasty dream sequences in which Cronenberg himself gets to deliver a lava. The progression of Goldblum's physical change is the highlight here with any love interest or love triangle utilised to form the basis of the third act but there is no real problem with that here. The Fly will entertain and somewhat shock without ever truly feeling like that's what it set out to do in a guilty and unconstructive way initially. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy but it is one that takes down a sci-fi and horror infested route which isn't often the case in those respective genres."

"Quinoa1984","10","2","4","16 June 2007"," both chilling and strangely intimate, amazing make-up effects, but the depth of a very good play
","Here is something of an unlikely, yet very likely, pairing: David Cronenberg and a big studio budget sci-fi remake. His take on the Fly, which was originally a film featuring a man with his body human and his head a fly, is stark as hell, with one of the bleakest endings in any movie of the 80s. Cronenberg is also working at one of his driving thematic forces as a filmmaker, though not as something that feels forced, per-say, which is the two sides to things, to people, to relationships, and to what science can provide in new breakthroughs. We're given the character of Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), who is a shy but massively accomplished scientist who's come upon the breakthrough of a lifetime- teleportation of matter from one spot to another. But a moment of relapse in his emotional state, of vulnerability to his feelings for a woman he gets close to (Geena Davis's Veronica), send him to go for the experiment himself, not noticing the little creature that's going along for the ride with him. It's a gradual change, but one that is not in the physical sense; we're not getting a man with a body of a man and the head of a fly, but a man who we're seeing in a slightly ""altered"" Kafka perspective. Instead of the man waking up to discover he's already been transformed, we're with him as he goes through a grotesque change, all the more-so because unlike in Kafka's tale he's very smart and can speak his emotions throughout the story, but at the same time it's the tragic unraveling of humanity.<br/><br/>For Cronenberg, this makes up the crazy dilemma of Brundle, who is truly half human and half insect, and it provides for him little moments of the macabre comedy he's famous for (watch as he exercises, or tears a guy's wrist off when in an hand match), while keeping strong to the darker implications of a story this implicit. It's a tale that starts out in romance as much as in science, with two characters we immediately care about because they're not simple cardboard genre movie cut-outs. They have their consciences, but for Brundle it gets turned up-side down by a force that is essentially instinctual. For an actor like Goldlum, it's not exactly a walk in the park to go from straight-laced (if eccentric) scientist to a half irritable and half deformed bugman. He's daring to go for the physicality straight-on, but to not make it terribly over the top, and it's a fine line to walk that isn't crossed. This is important considering for the last section he is, of course, totally disguised by lots of wretched (but excellently executed) make-up FX. There's not much to be bugged about, no pun intended, by the director or actors in how they approach tricky material.<br/><br/>Actually, what makes the Fly hold up isn't just its horror show aspect. Like John Carpenter's the Thing, we're given an atmosphere of true terror, but less for the simple facet of ""ooh, there's something around the bend about to get us"", but about human beings not being able to have trust in one another. Yet Cronenberg is even more operatic than that with his horror: the final scenes are very graphic (make sure you don't have a fly buzzing around the room!), but in still keeping the events on the horror for the characters. The ideas, as with many of the greatest horror films, are paramount, giving rise to everything else that is fun, and quite sad, in dealing with the unimaginable."

","Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) has figured out how to transport objects from one place to another... by teleportation. But when he tries to transport himself, a horrible accident occurs: a fly gets stuck in the pod with him. What will the outcome be and can Seth reverse it before it is too late? <br/><br/>Let me say I love David Cronenberg and I love Jeff Goldblum. I also love the original ""Fly"" with Vincent Price (although the similarities are only with the most basic plot). And let me also say, I had the greatest day of my life before I came home and put this movie on for viewing. So, all in all, I was feeling in a pretty fine mood. (And sober.) <br/><br/>Cronenberg delivers with his three notable themes: insects (duh), ""the flesh"" (Goldblum delivers a nice rant about the flesh) and horrifying special effects. Like ""The Brood"" or ""Rabid"" or even ""A History of Violence"", we see some interesting deformities. A baboon who meets an awful fate stands out in my mind. We also have the music of Howard Shore, always attached to Cronenberg's hip.<br/><br/>The special effects are noteworthy (also for the interesting ""fly walking"" and the ""vomit drop""), but let's not discount the acting. Almost through the entire film, we are treated to Geena Davis and Jeff Goldblum and basically no one else. I am still not sure why Davis married Goldblum, but their chemistry in this is excellent. They work well as a romantic couple. Davis is the steady anchor to Goldblum's flux of a character (heck, he's literally going through a Kafkaesque metamorphosis).<br/><br/>If you like a ranting Goldblum, this is your film. He won't watch you poop, but he will ramble in ways Ian Malcolm (""Jurassic Park"") never could. In one scene in a diner, you really have to pay attention because he's like the Micro Machines guy, but explaining exoskeletal biology and not so much miniaturized automobiles. This was my favorite scene.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Goldblum or Cronenberg, you're going to love this. But if you're not, this might be the film that converts you. Whereas ""A History of Violence"" is very mainstream and ""Videodrome"" is just weird, this has a happy balance: weird, but not so strange that you have to be a film student or a wackjob to really appreciate it. (I'm not a film student and I liked ""Videodrome"", so think of me what you will.) Yes, ""The Fly"", the film that will either win you over to Cronenberg or further deepen your love. That's my promise."

","How rare it is when a remake outshine the original. Not that in this case the original was any good though. This one is a classic. I'm sorry to see the other comments about this movie as just being 'a OK horror flick'. How little do they understand. This is the modern version of Quasimodo or beauty and the beast. The main difference with the other horror movies is this: In most horror movies, the main requirements of the characters is that they must be able to bleed gallons of blood, and they have to scream when touched... or cut. In The Fly the character are filled with human emotions and the deficiencies that makes us humans: ambition, doubt, love, despair, hope and anger. The fear factor here is not the loss of life and limb, but the mechanics of those human frailties that tend to lead us to our doom. The Fly is an intelligent and mature horror movie of the same caliber as Alien. As I flock my memory, I can't remember any other good horror movie after the fly (maybe people under the stair come close). Hollywood is back to courting the popcorn gubling audience watching teenager X being slashed and mangled to dead by creep Y in the dark corner of the silver screen. <br/><br/>TIP: avoid at ANY cost The Fly 2."
"blairwitch-1","10","2","4","7 October 2001"," If You've Never Seen It, SEE IT NOW (warning: spoilers)
","Don't get me started on Cronenberg.  The director is a genius.  The first film of his I saw was VIDEODROME.  Cronenberg's real talent, which has always been the mark of excellent creators of science fiction, is the ability to mix contemporary experience with original fiction.  In Videodrome, an example of this are the pirate television broadcasts of sexual torture.  He mixed the idea of, say, a pirate radio broadcast, with a broadcast product which had I daresay heretofore never been thought of.  I will probably never again watch 1986's THE FLY, which I saw in a theater. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it at the time.  At the time, and to this day, I think it's the best filmed realization of the theme, and to date 5 movies have been filmed with this theme, where teleportation mixes man and fly.  Unfortunately I have mellowed with age and no longer crave violent cinema.  Very early in The Fly, I knew I would love it, when Cronenberg provides the reason behind the invention of teleportation.  The reason is the inventor, the scientist Brundle, suffers a chronic motion sickness which makes any other form of travel, even riding in a car, excruciatingly painful.  I loved the love story.  Who couldn't fall in love with Geena Davis?  I was horrified as Brundle's slow transformation gradually tore his romance apart.  The gross-out scenes are highly realistic (another Cronenberg trademark) and also truly horrifying.  The fact that it takes so long for Brundle to realize his lot is tragic and truly horrific.  The third character (John Getz, the guy who play's Geena's confidant) has a truly horrible character, way beyond hateful, you just want to kick him in the teeth, and eventually The Fly does just that.  I consider this Jeff Goldblum's breakthrough film, this is the movie that made him a star, and you get the quintessential Goldblum here, which sometimes seems only reiterated in all his later films.  You get the wit, the sexual repartee, his acting with his hands and fingers and his eyes and all the muscles in his face, god he's like an acrobat with his face, and his slow burns slower than any other actor except perhaps Charles Grodin.  So you may decide never again to see The Fly, like I did, but you should see it once, like I did, and you WILL be impressed, like I am."

Watching Jeff pull his nails off is one of the most grossed out I've been. Goldblum too is great. He gets both more greasy and manic as the movie goes along. It's pretty well structured in that respect. Its a pretty slow ramp up as Brundle Fly becomes more and more fly like. However, both the story and characters are a bit thin. You've nerdy, isolated doctor who falls in love with spunky reporter. Nothing crazy there. Then after Jeff teleports with the fly it really is scene after scene of Jeff getting worse little by little. Which would be fine if the characters where better, but they are equally repetitive. It's still a pretty good movie overall though. Howard shores music is amazing, the effects look awesome, the performances are generally good, and the story is pretty unique even if it's a bit thin.

There is very quick ramp-up of the disturbing factor though, so much so that I was almost ready to close my eyes before the very disturbing final scene. <br/><br/>While the plot is a bit clichéd, the characters have very distinct personalities and are far from clichéd. All the three main actors give very good performances, aided by a clever script, but Jeff Goldblum's performance is particularly noteworthy as the eccentric scientist. It is notable that during his character's slow transformation into the fly, we see glimpses of fly-like behavior when he is still a normal human being, and then glimpses of the eccentric scientist even when he turns into a full-fledged monster.

","A true horror film is one that instills in you just that...horror. When I was younger, I used to have a scam at the local video store that allowed me to hire ""R"" rated movies...the Fly was amongst these. Far from a half-man, half-fly monster running around slitting the throats of teenage party animals, this film truly horrified me, because despite it being a horror film, and thus, pure fantasy, it seemed so terrifyingly REAL to me. I imagine if you were to genetically ""splice"" a human/fly atrocity, this is a pretty accurate guess of how things would work out.<br/><br/>Cronenberg is weird. Talented, undeniably, but incredibly strange. I mean, who the heck casts himself as a gyno delivering a maggot baby?? He's either genuinely demented or has an exceptionally bizarre sense of humour...<br/><br/>There is an inherent creepiness to this film, a sallow kind of musty odour. It's like being in somebody's basement...it's dark, full of shadows...the air is stale, it kind of smells strange, there's weird dripping noises, bugs, damp air.<br/><br/>Atmospheric...for sure...well acted, absolutely...Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle, aka ""Brundlefly"" is scarily convincing as the scientist who, from the outset, is a little strange, but who progressively goes right off the deep end after he has the unfortunate drunken run-in with a teleporter containing a fly. Good old computers...what does it do? Splices the genes together! Probably using Microsoft Teleporter version 1...should have bought a Mac... Geena Davis is also very good, ditto her editor/ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that is very hard to fault, technically or thematically, though if you are not a genre fan you will probably be repulsed by it or simply not interested. The special FX are realistic, and the film certainly doesn't pull punches in visually depicting the way ""Brundlefly"" eats and lives as his body and psyche are warped into something hideous.<br/><br/>However as an entry in the horror genre, this film succeeds admirably. It is easy to care about Seth and Geena Davis' characters as they are presented as real, identifiable people with emotions, fears and flaws. Goldblum's anguish and fear is tangible as he struggles to come to terms with the horrifying changes taking place before his eyes, and Geena Davis is also very convincing as she too faces the horrible reality before her.<br/><br/>Sex and death are said to be close relatives...so it is with this film, it is at once a touching love story (no, really...) and a truly horrifying horror film...but more than that it is a well-written, well-made, dramatic and exciting movie. Once a year is about all I can take though...it's very good, but it's not one I'd watch over and over."

","The Fly starts off pretty slowly, the time to set the base of the plot: obviously, something is going to happen with this machine but the twist doesn't seem to show up.<br/><br/>Once the movie reaches its pivotal point, the script struggles and doesn't exploit correctly the plot which, on paper, is interesting though. There is not much going on, the stakes are lacking and the story unfolds too linearly to captivate the viewer's attention. The movie even takes, in its last part, a frankly ridiculous and dispensable creepy turn.<br/><br/>In fact, The Fly resembles more a B movie or a bad TV movie, and this feeling is emphasized by the very cheap and blanc cinematography, the insipid dialogues and the far-from-transcendent performances of the cast."

","Compared to the original I have to go with the original on this one. In had more cohesion in terms of its story and acting as opposed to the better effects in this one. The movie just kind of starts in an odd way with no backstory, just a weird exchange of dialogue between two people who are just thrown at us. Its not so much a remake as it is its own retelling of the story. For me personally I did not enjoy it as much as the original. The effects however are fantastic, and any fan of eighties filmography or sci-fi in general will enjoy this one. But if you're looking for more in terms of acting and plot, you'll find that this one comes off as lackluster. The main reason to watch this film is for the last act and the special effects, although parts of it do not make much sense. It comes off as being somewhat rushed yet still entertaining. Since the effects are practical in this one they come off as more raw and enjoyable. Bottom line is, if you grew up seeing this movie first you might be blinded by nostalgia. Check the original again and see what you missed."
"mjneu59","6","2","5","18 November 2010"," inventive but often crass re-make
","There's no reason to remake a 30-year-old (minor) horror film unless improvements can be added, but David Cronenberg's grisly update is an imaginative rethinking of the 1958 sci-fi scenario. In the original, a scientist experimenting with teleportation unwittingly swaps heads with a housefly; this time around, when the absent-minded professor (Jeff Goldblum) accidentally mixes molecules with an insect, the alteration is at a genetic level, leading to a gradual physical metamorphosis better suited to the horror film format. Tiny hairs begin sprouting on his back; next he begins to exhibit unusual strength; then he experiences a sudden craving for sugar; and finallywell, suffice to say that viewers with sensitive stomachs are hereby forewarned. Cronenberg earns points for emphasizing the tragedy of Goldblums's predicament, but the nauseating shock effects are strictly for kids. With a little more subtlety the film might have emerged as a classic of its kind."

In its place is a viscerally disturbing (nauseating actually) mess with a rather mean spirit. It's simply unfun and unappealing.<br/><br/>You don't believe me?

"EnriquePineda13","9","1","2","29 January 2020"," A disturbing big movie.
","The fly is an incredible film that represent horror movies inherited from the style of B-class movies and that has John Carpenter, David Lynch and David Cronenberg himself as his greatest filmmakers.<br/><br/>The film combines a terror and suspense generated from the story and communicated by the characters. A theme that is touched with seriousness and that condemns the characters to go through monstrous and disgusting moments. The direction, the photography, the performances and, above all, the makeup make us experience the same as spectators.<br/><br/>In the movie there are two currents, the positivist or the scientist expressed by the character of Jeff Goldblum, and on the other hand we have the liberal current expressed by the character of Geena Davis. Goldblum on the one hand seeks to enclose all his discoveries and even when he suffers from them we do not see him very worried. Davis on the other hand seeks to bring to light everything and worries even before knowing what happens to him.<br/><br/>These two currents are exemplified when history touches on the issue of abortion. It is amazing how the film touches the subject being in 1986. He wants to have the son, while she wants to free herself from that, and she is totally determined to abort. She is the only one who does not get hurt, a look in favor of women, are the male characters who have to pay for their mistakes. The Goldblum character for doing the experiment that would transform him and the other character for wanting to control Geena Davis's.<br/><br/>All these in an entertaining movie, full of terror that will leave shocked to anyone who sees it."
"crystallogic","7","1","2","3 August 2018"," Legendary with reason
","I've not yet read the short story on which both are based, but the majority of people seem to find this a better film than the 1958 version with Vincent Price in the role of the ""interloper"". I really like Cronenberg as a filmmaker (most of the time) and I certainly see how his version of the story was more challenging from a technical standpoint, but I don't necessarily agree that it's a better film all the same. The original had a quiet, sad psychological feel and told its story in an extremely economical way. It's what I'd call a very ""tight"" film and I really enjoyed Price as a nicer fellow and friend trying to figure out, along with the scientist's wife, what the hell was going on. Still, Cronenberg's adaptation is very good and I enjoyed the different emphasis; the way he took notions from the original tale and really made it his own, with the usual Cronenberg emphasis on very bad things happening to the human body.<br/><br/>This movie is much more a study of Seth Brundle's character, too. We spend over half the film getting to know him and what he is up to, before his unfortunate accident with a pest and a teleportation machine. He's ably played by jeff Goldblum, whose physicality is very impressive in this demanding role, though I found the actor a little prone to mumbling his dialogue at times. Still, he is supposed to be a socially awkward fellow, so I guess it fits well. <br/><br/>The relationship with Gina Davis's reporter character is very effective, and I liked her strong character from teh outset. Unfortunately she does somewhat degenerate and fall to pieces as the story progresses, but I can't really blame her. In contrast to Vincent Price's ""nice guy"" portrayal in the 1958 film, the ""interloper"", or I should say, the third part of the triangle, Veronica's newspaper editor, is a loathsome and despicable person who seems to finally do the right things despite himself. My girlfriend and I spent most of the film wishing he would get killed, and I'm sure Cronenberg made him so sleazy and nasty on purpose. It was frustrating and heartbreaking that Veronica kept returning to him and letting him back into her life, but again, I can't really blame her. In a way, too, it illustrates that even in the ""enlightened"" time this movie was made, a woman's value in work and life was often extremely underappreciated and a lot of very bad sexual politics sometimes took place. This still happens today, but I'm not sure a guy like Stathis would be able to get away with acting like this toward his female colleagues on any major newspaper, even if he were the editor.<br/><br/>Anyway, you can see right off why Veronica and Seth value each others' company. He treats her well and is kind and passionate toward her, while she gives him a sympathetic ear and not only has a passion for his body but also the work he is doing, which sets her afire with dreams of fame and glory. Admittedly it's not nice to see her going back to Stathis and basically insisting that she's using Seth, but in Seth's company we see a rather different side to her. Her horror and revolusion by the end of the movie is really sad to see. Unfortunately it also leads to the one moment in this movie that I thought was ridiculous: the aborted um, abortion scene, with the rather transformed Seth bursting through the window and abducting Veronica. Now who in hell has a window like that in an operating room anyway? I'm not squeamish as such, but the entire abortion scene seemed a bit superfluous and maybe just an excuse for Cronenberg to play out some of his gynecological horror fetish, which of course reached its apex in Deadringers (released a couple of years later). I think the dream sequence was sufficient and horrible enough as it was, and anyway, you could argue that the ""aborted abortion"" scene became the excuse to release this movie's non-Cronenberg-directed bad copycat sequel.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though, this film is considered an 80s classic for a reason. I may not rate it as highly as some and I certainly don't think it's as good as some of Cronberg's other, weirder films, but it's still better than some of what he's done lately (the ""mature"" A History of Violence being possibly his worst film to date) and it's still quite an experience. The horror of the situation really creeps up on you and the first half of the movie includes a lot of sweet scenes that almost lull the viewer into a false sense of security. There's a nice little tribute to the 1958 film near the end and the whole thing becomes gross and revolting in that 70s/80s Cronenberg way you'll either love or hate depending on your personality. I dig it quite a bit; it's one of his very personal touches you can almost always count upon. My only other criticism is that I find the music to be a little dull and too bombastic/mainstream Hollywood, although there were some nice ""sad"" motifs. I think a sparser, perhaps more electronic-infused score would have suited this thing well. But it's ok! Good film and a must for 80s body horror fans."

","When scientist Seth Brundle tells journalist Veronica Quaife that he is working on a project that will change the world she thinks he must be exaggerating but when she sees it she realises he has invented something amazing; a device that will teleport an object from one teleportation pod to another. There is a catch though; it only works on inanimate objects. After more experimentation he manages to successfully teleport a baboon. He agrees to wait for tests before teleporting himself but then changes his mind. Unfortunately when he teleports he isn't alone in his pod; there is a common house fly in with him and when he emerges there is no sign of the fly. He soon notices that he is far more dynamic. He assumes that he has somehow improved but then he starts to change more; he grows course hairs, his nails fall out and it soon becomes apparent that he has been genetically spliced with the fly; Seth Brundle is no more; he is now Brundlefly.<br/><br/>This is a rather different horror film as rather than seeing characters die due to the actions of some horrific creature it is about the horrible things that are happening to somebody as he becomes the creature. That isn't to say that there is nothing unpleasant happening to other people there are a couple of particularly unpleasant things that happen. The special effects are impressive; especially the way Brundle gradually transforms into Brundlefly. Jeff Goldblum does a fine job as Brundle managing to play him in a subtly different way either side of his transformation without being too obvious. He is ably supported by Geena Davis who does a great job as Veronica as she come to terms with what is happening to Brundle and feels pressured to teleport herself. John Getz also puts in an entertaining performance as Veronica's sleazy boss. Given that it is now over thirty years old it feels remarkably fresh; apart from Brundle's computer one feels it could have been made much more recently of course if that had been the case we'd have got CGI rather than the great physical effects. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans; just don't expect a large body count and do expect some fairly disgusting effects!"

"TheRedDeath30","10","1","2","22 October 2016"," One of My Favorite Horror Films of All Time
","This movie should have two things going against it in my book. First, I can't stand remakes. I can name you probably a handful of remakes in horror that I actually enjoy. To me, if a movie is a classic, there is really no reason to remake it. After all, nobody rewrites great novels. Nobody repaint classic works of art. Why are we, as an audience, so willing to accept a remade movie? <br/><br/>The other thing is that I am not, generally, a fan of the work of Cronenberg. He is an artist. He makes good movies. I won't argue with either of those things from a critical point of view. To make a bad analogy, I understand that there are world famous Italian chefs, but I just don't like Italian food. It's just not my style. In the same way, I never got into Cronenberg. His style of ""body horror"" is too rooted in geeky sci-fi themes for me. It's too cerebral, at times, and doesn't give me enough absolute brutality. <br/><br/>So, should I like a remake made by a director I don't like? I don't like it. I love it. It's such a fantastic piece of horror cinema and full of poetic moments. A huge part of the success of this movie belongs to Jeff Goldblum, who is just so good in this role. You could say that he was perfect for the role, but you could argue that the role is perfect because of him. His style of ""my brain is moving faster than my mouth can keep up"" acting brings a charm and intelligence to Seth Brundle that makes him such a likable character and so perfect as a scientist. He evinces that obsession that can make the audience truly believe in why he would push himself into the situation that causes this disaster. Once his experiment is completed and the change begins, that same chaotic style of acting makes him a believable proto-human as well.<br/><br/>The special effects still hold really well for a movie that is 30 years old. I will concede that the final creature creation when he metamorphoses completely into a fly feels a little dated, but on the same token even that design still looks better than most of the crappy CGI I see now. It is the gradual transformation that is done so well. Rather than taking the approach of the original and having him instantly a half-fly creature, Seth slowly disintegrates into the fabric of the fly. Those makeup jobs along the way are really well done and so memorable. That scene where he first throws up in his food and an ear falls off is forever classic, mostly due to how believable the makeup is in that scene.<br/><br/>What pushes the whole thing into classic territory is the poetic tragedy of the entire movie. Like the best tragic villains, Seth is struggling against the evil inside himself the entire way. He wants to maintain his humanity, but is slowly losing his touch with it. Goldblum does such a great job at portraying this that we never see him as a ""bad guy"". Even when he is scaring the hell out of the other characters, we are still cheering for him to be redeemed. The writing helps this, too. There are lines in this movie, oft quoted, that are just spot on perfect. I mean ""I'm an insect who dreamt he was a man and loved it, but now the dream is over....and the insect is awake"". There are many of these lines that full of such intelligence.<br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough. It's Cronenberg's best work. It's one of the greatest remakes ever. It's one of the best horror movies of the 80s. Frankly, it's one of the greatest horror films ever."
"Aly200","8","1","2","2 September 2016"," A Remake Done Right
","David Cronenberg is the master of body horror for a reason and mainly it's because of this terrifying remake of the 1958 science-fiction film of the same name. <br/><br/>Bolstered by a memorable performance by an exceptional Jeff Goldblum as ill- fated scientist Seth Brundle. Goldblum brings out Brundle's ego perfectly as he boasts of his intention to create his transportation device. Even his descent into paranoia and madness is captured perfectly after the accident starts to infuse him into the ""Brundle-fly"". We loathe his arrogance and selfishness as Brundle isolates his former lover and other friends out of life, but we sympathize with the horrible descent Brundle undergoes throughout the film. <br/><br/>Playing the yin to Goldblum's yang is a well cast Geena Davis as Veronica Quaife. Davis brings a innocence and naivety to the reporter who loves the troubled scientist. However Veronica is no slouch and asserts herself when Brundle's possessiveness of her begins to suffocate her social life and work. She remains sympathetic the whole run-time and is the film's reluctant hero at the tragic climax of the narrative. This is one strong woman even if she has to do the unthinkable. <br/><br/>The film amps up the gore effects to marvelous fashion. Turning its lead actor into a shell of a man and eventually into a horrifying fly monster that rivals the original actual fly transformation. Dr. Brundle's transformation into a monster demonstrates his alienation from the rest of humanity even before he becomes the Brundle-fly. There's little to wonder about why the makeup team won the Oscar for Best Makeup."

","If your a horror fan it's impossible to miss this movie, every horror director should watch and re watch this movie, to me besides the amazing makeup effects it's the human emotions in it, you can see it as a love one going threw a disease it heartbreaking to watch specially with Goldbloom and Davis chemistry.<br/><br/>That is what makes this movie so haunting it's how human it is, you feel bad for Goldbloom as he slowly deteriorates into a monster as he looses touch with humanity and the fly starts to take over him and Davis knows she can't do anything about it. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie is a emotional ride from start to finish and the special effects are a plus and believe me after watching this movie you will want for practical effects to come back."
"Leofwine_draca","10","1","2","17 July 2016"," Cronenberg's masterpiece
","One of the genre's most famous taglines (""Be afraid...be very afraid"") adorns David Cronenberg's masterpiece of psychological and physical horror, in turns surprisingly gory and surprisingly intelligent, yet sorely underrated by audiences at the time. Cronenberg had already made a name for himself by the time this was released, for his above average horror films like VIDEODROME, all of course as controversial as CRASH was ten years later.<br/><br/>This isn't just another run-of-the-mill gut churner, however; it's much, much more. In parts a tragic love story and with a vicious streak of black humour, THE FLY actually turned out to be a remake which was better than the original film, which was no mean feat when 1957's THE FLY was a classic sci-fi horror flick boasting star names like Vincent Price. Thankfully, everything about Cronenberg's film works, from the fine acting to the gruesome special effects, but these are just icing on the cake. The real genius lies in the decision to have Brundle slowly disintegrate into a fly, instead of a straight conversion in the matter transporter. The idea that the fusion takes place as a mysterious, horrible, cancer-like illness is much more sickening, chilling and believable than the straight forward man with rubber fly head shown thirty years earlier.<br/><br/>Not many actors could have convincingly pulled off such a complex role, but Jeff Goldblum succeeds admirably in what I feel to be his finest role ever. Goldblum plays his typically weird but likable character, yet convinces us with his stunning realisation that he is becoming something other than man - at first hyperactive and excited, then horrified, and finally struggling to keep his sanity and his mind as the fly's influence becomes ever stronger. Geena Davis also excels as the tough, resourceful female lead, inexorably caught up in the horrific chain of events. Her fleshed-out portrayal is what the countless slashers of the '80s really needed. John Getz lends good support as a seedy yet kind magazine publisher, whom Davis turns to in her time of need.<br/><br/>Add to this formula a good score, lots of clever hi-tech (well, for the mid '80s) computer gimmickry and some clever scenes showing Goldblum's transformation (the gymnastics and the horrible fingernail-pulling bit in the bathroom), this film would have been a success any way you looked at it. But Cronenberg decided to add in some really horrific gore and special effects, which alienated a lot of audiences. The worst bits are when Goldblum has to regurgitate his food to digest, cue lots of vomiting in THE EXORCIST tradition. There are some bloody moments, like the infamous arm-wrestling, too. However, aside from all this, there is one true reason why I knew this film had succeeded. Yes, I did indeed shed a tear or two at the end of the film, which is truly moving, and heart wrenching. A poorly conceived sequel was churned out a couple of years later by the man who did the special effects in this, Chris Walas. Not surprisingly, it didn't reach this kind of level."

","It is a very well-made film where all aspects of film making come together to create the intended effect. Visual effects are stunning, specially makeup. A great horror movie needs a great score and the Fly has a great score portraying the tone of the story perfectly.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum gives one of the truly quintessential lead performances in his role of Seth Brundle- from his nerdy, awkward beginnings to his horrific demise in the final third. I won't spoil anything for the uninitiated other than to say this is like a superhero movie gone wrong. Instead of becoming selfless and heroic as a result of the splicing incident, he becomes hell-bent on self preservation.<br/><br/>The grotesque elements are there but they don't seem thrown in purely for shocks - there is a story resonating beneath the on screen mayhem and at no time does the film become too gross or too predictable. Cronenberg has a definite story to tell us and he weaves his magic to make the film both involving and satisfying. The special effects are extremely good and this isn't a film you should go into if you've got a weak stomach, but it is an enjoyable, horrifying and fascinating trip into what happens when something goes wrong in the lab, very wrong! Highly recommended, especially if you're a fan or even if you haven't seen this film at all.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"jcbutthead86","10","1","2","13 April 2016"," One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Terrifying ,Unforgettable Classic From David Cronenberg
","The Fly is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable classic that combines fantastic direction,terrific performances,amazing special Make-Up Effects and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Fly one of the finest remakes of all-time that is David Cronenberg at his best.<br/><br/>The Fly tells the story of an eccentric scientist Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum)who has made transportation pods that can transfer anyone and anything from one place to another. When Brundle decides to try the pods himself a Fly that is also in the pod is mixed with his DNA and stars to make Seth turn into a fly.<br/><br/>By 1986 Director David Cronenberg had already mastered and perfected the Body Horror sub genre thanks to great Horror films such as The Dead Zone(1983),Videodrome(1983),Scanners,The Brood(1979),Shivers(1975)and Rabid(1977) but in 1986 Cronenberg would release his swan song to the Body Horror genre and his most famous and iconic of his Body Horror films with The Fly,a brilliant and unforgettable SCI-FI/Horror film that was co-produced by Mel Brooks film company Brooksflims(yes the Mel Brooks)and was a critical and Box Office success for David Cronenberg but is also one of finest remakes of all-time. While a remake of the 1958 classic of the same name David Cronenberg has also re-imagined the story to suit his style in creating one of the most horrifying,disturbing and disgusting films ever made. From start to finish,The Fly is movie that is truly goes with the definition of psychological terror because this is a movie that is intense,gripping and harms you not just mentally but physically as well with a tale that is dark,grim and is like living a nightmare that just becomes more and more frightening and once the Horror starts it never stops. The Fly is one of those films that is not very easy to watch but it's a movie that will stick with you. While The Fly is a SCI-FI/Horror film it's other things too it's a character study,a love story(in it's own way)and a sad tragedy told in Cronenberg's style with claustrophobia and dread. As I said before The Fly is a character study and it's character study of the main character Seth Brundle and his downfall. When we see Seth in the early part of the film we see that he's eccentric and weird,but a decent guy. But when he goes into the transportation pod and comes out with the fly he becomes a different person and we see him in the rest of the film transforming into a monster. One of the scariest things about the movie is that each time we come back to Brundle we see him looking worse and worse as he's becoming this creature(Brundlefly) while his body is falling apart and pretty much losing his mind. Brundle's transformation from human to fly is a tr frightening look at madness,fear and how a science experiment can go completely wrong. One of the things I have to warn people about is the blood and gore. The blood and gore in The Fly is some of the ugliest,gross and gruesome ever shown on screen and is truly not for the weak at heart or for weak stomachs. I mean I have seen many Horror films where I am used to Blood and gore but there is something about the blood and gore in The Fly that is unsettling and make the movie more bleak than it already was will make viewers vomit with agony. The blood and gore adds to the film and gives the movie an extra edge and darkness that hangs over The Fly. The ending of The Fly is amazing and unforgettable with fright,terror and surprises. A terrific conclusion.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Jeff Goldblum is excellent and at his best as Seth Brundle,with Goldblum being intense and gripping. Geena Davis is wonderful as Veronica,a journalist and Seth's love interest with Davis having great chemistry with Goldblum. John Getz is fantastic as Stahis,Veronica's ex-boyfriend. Joy Boushel is great and sexy as Tawny,a girl Seth meets. Also,lookout for a cameo by director David Cronenberg as a Gyneocolgist.<br/><br/>The direction by David Cronenberg is amazing,with Cronenberg bringing a dark and gloomy atmosphere with great angles and shots. Fantastic direction,Cronenberg.<br/><br/>The score by Howard Shore is outstanding,with Shore's score being scary,epic and intense. Great Score,Shore.<br/><br/>The Academy Award winning Special and Practical Make-up Effects Chris Walas Inc. is impressive and some of the best and most horrifying Effects ever caught on film. Fantastic Special Make-up Effects.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love David Cronenberg,Jeff Goldblum,Horror or SCI-FI,I highly suggest you see The Fly,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable Hrror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10"

","Recently I decided to watch 'The Fly' again since a long time and I experienced it from e fresh point of view.<br/><br/>It is the only horror remake ever to be way better than the original version. I do know that 'The Thing' by John Carpenter is a great one too, but that one is not based on the original movie, but another interpretation of the same book on which the earlier movie was also based.<br/><br/>'The Fly' still is an artistic masterpiece. Many of the effects have survived the test of time and of course every review on the internet describes this remake as way better than the earlier movie.<br/><br/>When it came out in 1986, many viewers considered it as a cultural metaphor for AIDS, while David Cronenberg never thought of it that way. Cronenberg's view was that it is a metaphor for illness in general and also the process of aging, like midlife crisis.<br/><br/>Watching it today and being a nurse in psychiatric fields, makes me interpretate it as a metaphor also for psychiatric conditions, like bipolar disorders or something likewise.<br/><br/>Over here in Holland, Dutch actor Anthonie Kamerling was bipolar and he committed suicide. Having been depressed for a long period of time, he was energetic to the max, day and night, just before he killed himself.<br/><br/>Manical people don't consider themselves as ill. They're feeling great, life is one big party time. Their families and environment do know something's wrong with them by intuition, but they can't put a finger on it. Anthonie's wife Isa Hoes, also a Dutch actress, wrote a book about him and she described how Anthony was way more powerful with words than she is.<br/><br/>'The Fly' tells us a story with same elements within the process of Seth Brundle. After his teleportation, he starts to change in behavior and this proceeds until he starts to see something is wrong with him. By then, it already is too late for him and his breakdown and degeneration as a human being has already become unstoppable. That of course is put in the story for dramatic purposes and it shouldn't be taken as a truthful standard process in illness in general. In reality, much can be done to treat the diseases that I've mentioned and to stabilize them or control them, even though bipolar disorder is not without risk.<br/><br/>'The Fly' is a great horror movie that survives the test of time and will never know another remake better then this one..."

","The Fly (1986) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Reporter Veronica Quaife (Genna Davis) goes back to the lab of scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) who claims to be working on something that will change human kind. Back at his lab she discovers that he's working on a transportation device so she begins to record his progress but when he tries it on himself the results are disastrous.<br/><br/>It's funny how movies can strike you differently at different times of your life. I was only six when this came out and I first viewed it at some point on VHS when I was around ten or so and I really didn't care for it. Yes, I loved the gore but overall I just thought the film was boring. I tried it again as a teenager and felt the same. However, viewing it as an adult for the first time in well over a decade, I couldn't help but really see deep into its tragic story and come away with a completely different opinion.<br/><br/>David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 classic takes its simple idea and turns it into a true tragedy mixed with romance, outlandish special effects and some graphic content that will certainly shake weaker viewers. Through in a pretty intelligent script and three great performances and you're left with a science-fiction film that manages to work on all levels. The most surprising thing is how smart the picture actually is when you look at what other types of films were out at this time.<br/><br/>The screenplay manages to treat the science material with respect and it never dumbs down the material. The romance between the two lead characters work extremely well and especially when the scientist begins to go through his transformation. You really do care for both characters so you want to see him save while at the same time you can connect with the reporter's heartache of seeing him turn into the title character. Vincent Price, an actor in the 1958 film, said he enjoyed this version of the movie but felt Goldblum turned into a mutant more than a fly. That's perhaps true to a point but there's no question that these are some of the best special effects of the decade. The make- up work on Goldblum's body at the start is simply stunning and very much believable. Once his body starts to fall apart the effects just keep getting better and better. They're certainly stomach-turning at times but the work is exceptional.<br/><br/>Finally, there are the performances by Goldblum and Davis. Both are extremely good but there's no question that Goldblum deserves so much credit for being able to pull off the various temper moods of the character. He certainly makes you believe that he's this genius scientist and once he begins to fall apart, well, you can believe that as well.<br/><br/>THE FLY is certainly one of the better horror films of the decade. It's smart, scary, sad and best of all is that it's made for adults."

","In the movie world, science always winds up running amok. Even if the scientists' intentions are good, something inevitably goes wrong. THE FLY started life as a story written George Langelaan for the June 1957 issue of Playboy. In '58, it was made into an exceptionally creepy movie starring David Hedison and Vincent Price. Then in '86, the studios decided to remake it. With David Cronenberg directing and Jeff Goldblum starring in it, you know you're in for quite a thrill ride! Jeff Goldblum plays quirky inventor Seth Brundle. At the start of the film, he's trying to woo Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis in her best role) back to his laboratory. Once there, he unveils his life's work: a teleportation device. So far, he's had success teleporting inanimate objects. But soon, he's hoping to start trying living beings. But not all is as it seems, because Veronica is a reporter. At one time, she and her editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) had a fling. Early on, it's clear he's somewhat obsessive about her. And he decides to get back at her by having her assigned to a full expose on Brundle's experiments. For Veronica and Seth, what starts as cold, detached fascination turns into a budding romance. But once a determined scientist, always a determined scientist. After a few successful tests with a baboon and a steak, Seth decides it's time to try the experiment himself. But along came a fly and... For a horror film, there are some really disturbing topics that are explored here. And not wanting to reveal too much of the story, let me just say you won't be disappointed. The special make-up and effects are incredible and notably drippy (quite deserving of the Oscar they received). Everything else about the movie is pitch-perfect, too. This is easily one of the best horror films ever made. Followed by a lamentable sequel three years later, featuring an excellent performance by Eric Stoltz."

","When I hear the word remake in the same sentence as a beloved movie, I am hesitant to watch it. But this is the rare exception in which the remake equals if not exceeds the original. The movie revolves around Veronica Quaife, who is a reporter trying to interview the scientist Seth Brundle who is attempting to create teleportation devices. In the beginning he tests baboons to see if it works. Let's just say the first experiment was a grisly result. Once he finally gets it to work, he transports himself, not knowing that a fly was in the teleportation device with him. As a result he starts to mutate into a fly like creature. The idea of the film at first sounds cheesy and laughable and something that would be a sci-fi channel movie. But what they do well is bring the plot to life. They focus on detail of the makeup and gore. Teeth fall out, limbs detach, he throws up enzymes. The film is grotesque but it is a rare cross between a bloodfest and a love story. The film is well scripted and it is possibly the best remake of all time. The film did not have high expectations, but Cronenberg made it work."

"Nothinggrandproductions","9","1","2","26 October 2013"," A tragic horror film where you truly care about the characters
","The Fly is one of those special films where going into it, you aren't quite sure of what is going to happen in the end. It just kept on keeping me guessing and on top of that, the special effects work was absolutely incredible. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is an intelligent but somewhat eccentric scientist and he meets Veronica (Greena Davis), a journalist for a science magazine at a press event. He takes Veronica back to his lab where he shows his invention, a teleportation device. It uses two different pods that can transfer objects back and forth. Although, Seth has yet to make anything but inanimate objects transport, he wants to be able to do so with humans. Stathis Borans (John Getz) is an editor at the magazine Veronica works at and he is still in love with her from a previous relationship, he is trying to get in the way with Veronica's private work with Seth that she is doing completely on her own.<br/><br/>Eventually, things go wrong during his human experimentation and Seth begins to become mutated. He becomes essentially super human but little does he know that it isn't as good as he thinks. Jeff Goldblum gives an amazing performance, at first, he is an eccentric scientist but he completely transforms his performance halfway through into a man with an ego and eventual sad realizations. The special effects work is one of the best parts about the film, with extensive make-up work on Jeff Goldblum later on and things of that nature, it's pretty damn incredible to look at, and it stills holds up very well today. Each time more special effects were used, I just continued to get blown away each time as they continued to impressive throughout the entirety of the film.<br/><br/>It isn't just special effects and good performances though, the story is a tragic one. The very last part made the movie for me. In fact, the last 30 minutes itself is incredible as things keep on twisting and turning. The very last minute of the film kept me gripped till the end and leaves you with things to think about as well as an incredibly memorable film. Overall, this is a great science fiction/horror piece that is most definitely worth a watch considering nearly everything in it works."
"AaronCapenBanner","8","1","2","16 October 2013"," Intense Remake.
","David Cronenberg directed this intense & harrowing remake of the 1958 original that stars Jeff Goldblum as brilliant scientist/inventor Seth Brundle, who has created a matter transmission device that can transport both organic and inorganic material from one pod to another. He invites a journalist named Veronica(played by Geena Davis) to his home/laboratory to witness it in action, and is indeed impressed. Seth later decides to try the experiment on himself alone, but unfortunately a fly is there with him, creating a genetic mutation that results in them being combined, gradually evolving into a new fly/human hybrid. Veronica has fallen in love with Seth, and is horrified by the disturbing changes taking place to his body and mind...<br/><br/>Highly effective film is a textbook case on how to do a remake right, by updating the technology and making the science plausible. Goldblum is excellent, and film unfolds as a grand tragedy, and(while undeniably disgusting and gross at times) is ultimately quite moving. Not for the squeamish however..."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","2","6 October 2013"," ""Be afraid...be very afraid.""
","1958's The Fly is a seminal B-movie sci-fi classic, thanks to its sublime storytelling and its iconic ""Help meeeee!"" scene. David Cronenberg's remake, however, goes a step further and taps into all the unused potential of this classic story. This version of The Fly is grosser, gnarlier, more extreme, more schlocky type of B-movie, but still with diligent attention to story and character.<br/><br/>Among the film's highlights, this version of The Fly handles the teleportation concepts in a more earnest manner, to actually show what could happen when different matter collides. The results are often freaky and bloody. Most of the film focuses on Seth Brundle literally falling apart after his body merges with that of a fly, and the film explores the implications in full. The man adopts the various properties of a common fly, even to the extent of spewing digestive acid. It makes for a genuinely sickening and emotionally hard-hitting experience to watch this guy morph into something other than human.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straightforward (much in contrast to the original film, which hinged greatly on its twisty structure). It does have a cast of endearing characters, who show some genuinely good emotional range and are easy to like. What really matters, however, are the themes, which focus on power-hunger and corruption, effectively manifested as physical decay. It's a bit like the portrait of Dorian Gray, only instead of a portrait, it's the man's flesh. And if there's anything that Cronenberg does best, it's in showing just how scary and gross it is for the human flesh to contort and fall apart into something non-human. The Fly echoes a lot of the same themes and grotesqueness as movies like Videodrome, and it is awesome that way.<br/><br/>This film uses decent photography and editing. Jeff Goldblum is a great joy to watch in this film, as is Geena Davis, and the rest of the cast is not bad either. Writing is pretty decent. This production uses pretty good-looking sets, props, costumes, and some very wicked make-up effects. Music is pretty good too.<br/><br/>If you can stomach it, The Fly is one wicked exploration on the terrors of teleportation mutating the human flesh. Although the original is a classic worth seeing, I do prefer this remake a little more, for all its frightful implications.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"
"thesar-2","10","1","2","4 October 2013"," Flyin' High. REAL HIGH.
","People dog remakes all the time. Hell, to begin with, they have little respect for the Horror, Creature-Feature Bmovies of the 40s and 50s. What David Cronenberg did here, with 1986's The Fly wasabsolutely amazing.<br/><br/>The original The Fly, the Vincent Price, 1958 movie, of which I haven't seen since I was wee little tyke, had a good-enough idea, but they had to settle for the stated ""Horror, Creature-Feature Bmovies of the 40s and 50s"" standards and low-budgetshence, the giant fly-head prop.<br/><br/>To a kid, that can, and was to me, be scary. As an adult, or young adult, even, this updated version was just shy of being a horror/suspense/psychological masterpiece in filmmaking and should rank high on anyone's ""Favorite Remakes"" list, if not just ""Favorite Horror"" tally.<br/><br/>The movie wastes no time setting up what seems like a deliciously and wonderful claustrophobic Broadway play with only a trio of main characters and a few minor extras. In the beginning, (the excellently cast) Jeff Goldblum's brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle entices reporter, (also wonderfully cast, Geena Davis's) Veronica back to his ""secret lair"" to witness what he refers to: ""something that will change the world, and human life as we know it."" And he's right. Kinda.<br/><br/>Even though the original movie predated the Star Trek TV show, the concept Seth's been working on is teleportation; the ability to transport objects, inanimate or not, from one pod/space to another. But, with this technology, it could also help with medical surgeries amongst other fantastic uses.<br/><br/>At first, Veronica's skeptical, but eventually she both warms to the idea, the ""story"" and, eventually, to Seth. (Side note: they had wonderful chemistry on screen, which is no wonder since they did become a couple for awhile in real life.)<br/><br/>But, as all Sci-Fi, Horror stories go, there's the ""but, what if"" scene. In a jealous and drunk rage, Seth decides not to wait on tests and becomes the first human teleported. It would've been all okay, if not for that pod swallowing that fly. I guess he'lldie.<br/><br/>You (should) know the rest, but not this gruesome and inventive. Director Cronenberg was so incredibly creative and smart, it's a wonder this movie doesn't rank even higher. I am not a prude to when it comes to gross scenes, but some of these scenes when Seth becomes (the fantastically named) BrundleFly, I have to look away.<br/><br/>That's not to put a blemish on this great work of art. If anything, it's Cronenberg's way of saying: Hey, this is real lifeif this were to ever happen.<br/><br/>And remember, this is 1986 and probably was worked on in 1985. The SMART computers of those days were, well, house-size, almost. It was cool to see such an intelligent computer even way back then.<br/><br/>This movie had so many things going for it including, but not limited to: excellent acting, originality even in an old story, chemistry, snappy, believable, rich and often, hilarious dialogue, suspense, horror, drama and a truly satisfying ending. There are a lot of Cronenberg fans out there, but this is BY FAR, my favorite of his tremendous résumé.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: ""Be afraid. Be very afraid,"" says Geena Davis. You know how many years I took to track down that quote, pre-internet? I had forgotten where it came from and loved it. Well, look no further"
"liam_donnaz","10","1","2","7 September 2013"," Cronenberg is the king of body horror
","I first saw this film in July with my father and sister. I knew it was going to get bad. Just how bad, I didn't know. Within the first ten minutes, the shocked reaction of the theatre patrons could be heard, and I knew that what I was watching was one of the scariest films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The fly is a tragic blend of sci fi, romance and, in typical David Cronenberg fashion, body horror. The story is of Seth Brundle, a young scientist whose experimentations with a newly created teleporter goes horribly, horribly wrong. What follows is one of two things, depending on what kind of audience member you are: either the most amazing display of special and make up effects since the Italian horror classic Zombi, or the most disgusting scenes of body horror ever shown.<br/><br/>The film itself is driven through the central performances of Jeff Golblum and Geena Davis, whose on screen chemistry reflects on their real life relationship, as well as providing some much needed heart to the characters. Goldblum, even when he's under the heaviest extent of makeup, still conveys the heart and conflicting mental state of Seth Brundle, while also showing an eccentricity that blends well with Davis's down to earth portrayal.<br/><br/>Now, there is not a person alive who can talk about this movie without mentioning the incredible special effects. Most Cronenberg films pride themselves on having vomit inducing special effects, but the fly has the most sickening. the various stages of Brundle's decay are really quite hard to watch, but what's worse is the scenes of Brundle discovering his new bodily functions. I wont give too much away, but you'll never want to bite your fingernails after watching.<br/><br/>Though a remake, the fly remains one of the only films that surpasses the original. It adjusts well to time, and, though disgusting in parts, is quite an enjoyable film. If you're planning on watching it any time soon, though, a word of advice: don't eat anything before or during. It'll come back up."

","This film is messed up; severely messed up. Watching a man slowly deteriorate and transform into a fly -as unique as that may be- is vile. Despite that there is no denying this is a classic. Having never seen the original i can't deliberate on which is better, but i would take a guess that the 1958 version doesn't compete in terms of the gore and gut churning scenes. <br/><br/>As the transformation becomes really noticeable i think it would be fair to argue that Jeff Goldblum may have been a fly in his previous life. His performance is scarily convincing. Unquestionably a brilliant showing. Who else could have played this role? No-one; Goldblum does slightly look like a fly to begin with, so he was perfect. Geena Davis on the other hand was very lackluster; i mean if i witnessed a man eat like a fly, I would have evacuated the premises as quickly as humanly possible. I jest, but she showed no emotion when witnessing such things and it seemed very unnatural <br/><br/>I know it's classed as a horror, but i would label it more sci-fi; i didn't find it scary; it was just a bit gory is all. It is a very good film and worth the watch.<br/><br/>6.5/10 (and my appetite for dough-nuts obliterated...thanks)"

","The pursuit of machines imitating flesh. More pointedly, I'd say, of the intangible need that mankind has for the human element of being. When we're sick, we don't want to be seen at our weakest, but our need for compassion, camaraderie and flesh overcome our egos and shows our humanity. ""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly. Perhaps, she'll die."" Jeff Goldblum was the perfect actor to combine this human element of the film with the David Cronenberg box office draw of science fiction special effects that on it's own makes for an interesting and very creepy experience. How many times can a female lead in this genre look frightened, revolted, curious and yet still rather fetching? Here, at least one more time."
"itamarscomix","8","1","2","24 September 2011"," Surprisingly touching
","I'm not, nor have I ever been, a fan of body horror or gross-out horror; true horror, to me, is the kind that relies on suspense and tension. I make an exception with David Cronenberg; even when he gives in to full-on gore, he does so with his own unique vision and spark.<br/><br/>The Fly is not quite an example of that; it's much more commercially oriented, much less personal and original than earlier Cronenberg pieces like Videodrome or Scanners, and it gives in to the gore much more whole-heartedly. It remains, in fact, the most 'standart' horror film of Cronenberg's career.<br/><br/>And yet The Fly is still a success on a very different level; character development takes the place of world-building, and so it manages to achieve more emotional connection than any other Cronenberg film made before A History of Violence. Jeff Goldblum delivers a shockingly good performance - maybe the best of his career, and creates one of the most sympathetic, pathetic horror-film monsters in history. The fact that we see him grow into the monster gradually over the course of the film makes it even more gut-wrenching. The Fly is not a Cronenberg classic, but it's definitely a horror classic."
"KnightsofNi11","7","1","2","12 December 2010"," So gross, yet so cool
","Revered as one of David Cronenberg's best science fiction films, The Fly is about eccentric scientist Seth Brundle who is attempting to create successful teleportation technology. After lots of perfection to his aptly named telepods, Brundle decides to teleport himself from one pod to the other. During the process a fly gets into the telepod with him and his DNA is fused with it. He slowly begins to transform into a horrible human/fly hybrid which he names Brundlefly. The transformation is horrific and grotesque, but the movie is overall pretty cool.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot going on with this film and there are only three main characters. The story is straightforward but still interesting to watch unfold. There are some side stories that seem kind of useless but they're never overbearing. Goldblum's transformation, physical and mental, is really neat to watch and the movie is definitely entertaining from start to finish. The majority of the sci fi films coming from the 70's and 80's were fairly simplistic but spawned a lot of science fiction themes for the future. The Fly definitely started out an interest in the grotesque human transformations we've seen in a lot of movies dealing with genetic manipulation, so in that respect The Fly is unforgettable. And it's not to say that there isn't enough going on in The Fly, because anymore and it would have been bloated and a lot of the focus of the film, which is solely on Brundle's transformation and how it is affecting the limited cast around him, would have been scattered. As far as storyline goes there isn't much I can complain about.<br/><br/>However, from a character standpoint I did have a couple issues with The Fly. Like I said before, the movie only has three characters. The rest of the cast, which is literally seven other people, are characters with no names or one or two speaking lines. Goldblum, Davis, and Getz aren't bad by any means, but I didn't feel like any of them had the force necessary to drive the film. They all seemed too weak and it made me feel like the film was lacking a dominant character. The film looks and feels very Hollywood, but it lacks the A-list stars to flesh out that feeling. The three leads I felt like belonged in supporting roles, when they were all three important leads. But after some getting use to, they carried the film to the end well enough.<br/><br/>Of course the film wouldn't have kept my interest nearly as well if not for the great makeup job done on Jeff Goldblum as he turned into the gruesome Brundlefly. His transformation is a disgustingly awesome feat in sci-fi creature design. It's probably the aspect of the film with the highest quality, which is fitting for a movie that is all about that particular aspect, even in its title. A warning to anyone with a weak stomach though, Brundlefly is one of the most grotesque and disgusting things I have ever seen in a movie. He is so horribly deformed and disgusting that I get a little queasy thinking about the final horrific scenes of the film. Everything this creature does is eyeopening disgusting and if I didn't find these kinds of grotesque effects awesome I would have probably hated this movie for being ridiculously gross and vomit inducing. But amidst all my twitching and wincing at how gross this film was, I really enjoyed it for taking such a disgusting risk.<br/><br/>The Fly is a lot of fun overall. It's got some kinks, but I can forgive them for the last thirty minutes of the film which are disgusting and yet jaw droppingly awesome. This movie is a worthwhile watch, especially if you're into some classic sci-fi."
"tieman64","Null","1","2","3 September 2010"," A Brief History of Cronenberg
","In the late 60s, Canadian director David Cronenberg directed ""Stereo"" and ""Crimes of the Future"". ""Stereo"" took place in the hilariously named Academy of Erotic Enquiry whilst ""Crimes"" took place in a dermatological clinic called The House of Skin. Both films simply consist of scientists observing groups of patients, Cronenberg's camera examining the effects of various experiments on human flesh. In ""Stereo"", we watch as scientists create a race of super-humans who bond together in polymorphous sexual relationships. In ""Crimes"", we watch as a plague caused by beauty products wipes out all sexually reproductive women. In an evolutionary response to their now defeminized world, some men grow reproductive organs outside their bodies, while others become paedophiles who prey on little girls.<br/><br/>An obsession with youth, the sexualization of kids, the castration of modern man, the temporality of the flesh, the quest for beauty killing the sexually mature...are all pretty heavy themes for such a young film-maker.<br/><br/>Understanding that his interests were far too esoteric for mainstream cinema, Cronenberg set out to make several low budget horror films. ""Shivers"" and ""Rabid"" are essentially about a mutant penis (Shivers) and vagina (Rabid) assaulting citizens and converting them into carnal beings. ""Shivers"", which takes place in a giant building called ""The Starline Hotel"", was seen by screenwriter Dan Obannon (a fellow Canadian) and would prove a huge influence on Ridley Scott's ""Alien"".<br/><br/>Cronenberg then filmed ""Brood"", a nice little horror flick which centres around a divorced couple. Here, scientists encourage man to manifest his emotions as physical symptoms. One patient develops lymphatic cancer as a manifestation of his self-hatred while another gives birth to mutated children who act our her violent emotions. Whatever the flaws of these pictures, they all contain a couple genuinely spooky scenes and a strong, singular vision.<br/><br/>Cronenberg followed ""Brood"" up with ""Scanners"", a hastily written and filmed flick about an underground war between a cult of telepaths and the clinic which created them. With its shotgun battles, trench coats, night scenes and fast pace, the film plays like a schlocky version of James Cameron's (another Canadian) ""Terminator"".<br/><br/>This is where the ""first phase"" of Cronenberg's filmography ends. Up until this point all his films centred around subjects at the mercy of scientific experiments. As a result, they're all cold and impersonal films told from the perspective of the virus/contagion. Cronenberg's next six flicks, however, focus on the subject's personal struggles with their own self inflicted ""diseases"". And so we have ""Videodrome"", ""The Dead Zone"", ""The Fly"", ""Dead Ringers"", ""Naked Lunch"" and ""M Butterfly"", all character studies which empathise with the victim (or infected host) and introduce a sense of humanity previously unseen in Cronenberg's filmography.<br/><br/>""Videodrome"", the precursor to ""Existenz"", is about the president of a sleazy television company who stumbles across a pirate TV station which broadcasts a zero-budget torture program (today the pirate footage now resembles Abu Ghraib). What follows is one of Cronenberg's greatest films, ""Videodrome"" dealing with the escalation of plot-less sex and violence, a world in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy bleed, a provoking satire on media censorship and a Marshall McLuhan influenced merger between flesh and technology (media as bodily extensions, and the notion of discarnate man and virtual identities).<br/><br/>After ""Videodrome"" failed, cash-wise, Cronenberg sold out with ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Fly"", two mainstream pictures which raked it quite a lot of cash. ""The Dead Zone"" is a fairly shallow look at the life of a psychic man, whilst ""The Fly"", despite a cute romantic tale at its core, is simply an excuse for Cronenberg to catalogue the disintegration of human flesh (and a Cartesian mind/body war in which the flesh wins).<br/><br/>Then came one of Cronenberg's most assured flicks, a little seen masterpiece called ""Dead Ringers"". Beautifully shot by Peter Suschitzky (cinematographer on ""Empire Strikes Back""), ""Dead Ringers"" centres on a pair of twin gynaecologists, one of whom falls in love with a woman who has a mutation which results in her having 3 vaginal openings. The film treats the twins as a single organism and the woman as a mutation which must be excised. She is rejected by the dominant twin's immune system, but is accepted by the weaker. This twin develops such a hunger for the mutation that he spirals into addiction when she is removed, resulting in the other twin having to develop special gynaecological tools to symbolically sever their connection. It's a weird but genuinely moving picture.<br/><br/>Cronenberg then made ""Naked Lunch"", a film about the hallucinogenic mind-space of author William Burroughs. Aesthetically the film is a failure, Lynch, ""A Scanner Darkly"" and ""Fear and Loathing"" covering similar psychedelic ground in a much more confident manner. ""M Butterfly"", Cronenberg's next film, was equally muddled, allegorizing Imperial conquest as the domination and gender transformation of women.<br/><br/>Cronenberg then entered his third and most confident phase, his pictures becoming icy cool and tightly structured. And so we have ""Crash"", less a film about fetishes than the aggressive escalation of on screen sex and violence, the film's cast (who all play film-makers) engaging in accelerated acts of titillation, all hoping to bridge what desire's lack.<br/><br/>Then came ""Spider"", ""Existenz"", ""History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"", three masterful films which examined the elusive nature of reality, desire, depth-less simulations (West and East as genre/national simulation) and personal displacement (displacement from country, law, body and gender). These later films, grossly misunderstood, will be talked about in depth with later essays. Suffice to say, with his ""third phase"", Cronenberg has learnt to masquerade Kubrickean levels of complexity within seemingly mainstream, genre pictures.<br/><br/>6.9/10 – (M Butterfly, Dead Zone, Naked Lunch), 7/10 – (Rabid, Shivers), 7.9/10 – (The Fly, Scanners, The Brood), 8/10 – (Spider, Crash), 8.5 - (History of Violence, Dead Ringers), 8.9/10 – (Existenz, Videodrome), 9/10 - (Eastern Promises)"

","The Fly taught me a valuable lesson. It is important for someone to see a film to understand what the film is about and not just take things you hear from other people to form an opinion.<br/><br/>Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is a very smart and different type of scientist. After meeting a reporter named Veronica (Geena Davis) he shows her his latest invention. Brundle has invented a machine that will teleport inanimate objects into another machine. However Brundle has problems when trying to teleport living objects. After much work he finally is able to teleport a living baboon through and then he himself goes through it apparently suffering no problems. However unknown to him a fly was in the teleporting machine with him and as a result it has fused with him and slowly is turning him into a man fly.<br/><br/>The main idea and story of this film is great. It is a great science fiction story, teleporting machine that can also fuse organisms together. But there is a lot of Horror in the film as well. So as far as being a good science fiction and horror film this film is quite effective.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum is pretty good in this film. I really enjoyed his performances in Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Independence Day. He really plays a good scientist with a little oddness in him in this film. He speaks in a way easy to hear and understand and also has great facial expressions and hand gestures. Also the scenes where he is with Geena Davis were really good and no doubt their real life experiences together help them to have such good chemistry.<br/><br/>There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this film. To be honest, I thought this film would be about Jeff Goldblums character turned into a normal fly. However really he starts to turn into a man fly type creature. Very disturbing scenes are in this film. If you are a person weak in the stomach this may not be a good film for you. Brundle has to do a lot of vomiting in his fly form and it really is quite disgusting. But it does a good job of getting the point of the film across to the audience and really gets the mood of the film across as well.<br/><br/>A good science fiction and horror film. It is quite disgusting at parts but those parts seem to help the film out. I recommend it to anyone who does not get disgusted easy."
"Superunknovvn","9","1","2","16 June 2008"," Masterly modernization of Frankenstein's monster
","This is David Cronenberg's defining movie. A reinterpretation of a trashy 50's flick, ""The Fly"" is one of the best and most original remakes of all time. There's just not a single flaw to be found here. From the get go, the director doesn't waste a minute and takes us right into the story.<br/><br/>It's amazing to realize that ""The Fly"" is set up like a play with mostly just three people interacting. The cast does a terrific job. A story like this one could easily have bordered on the unintentionally funny, but thankfully scientific explanations are avoided for the most part and the dialog is as solid as the deliverance by the actors.<br/><br/>One of the movie's main strengths is that underneath the horror this is really a drama. Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is an appropriate modernization of Frankenstein's monster (only this time Frankenstein and the monster are one and the same thing). Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is transformed into something horrible, but we feel for him, even though we fear him. Cronenberg leads you down a spiral of decay that can't be reversed. You're afraid to see what's coming next, but you can't look away, either. At the end you will be shocked as much as you will be saddened by the shocking fate of the protagonists.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" features some typical Cronenberg elements, such as talk about ""the liberation of the flesh"" and lots of graphic body horror. The special effects are awesome. Along with ""The Thing"" and ""An American Werewolf In London"" this movie has the best F/X of any 80's movie (and it is still light years ahead of all the CGI-nonsense that filmmakers rely on these days).<br/><br/>While many of Cronenberg's other movies may seem aloof at times and/or move too slowly, this one gets it completely right. Except for a few shots were Jeff Goldblum's body suit doesn't look a 100% convincing, there's not a single flaw to be found in the whole movie, making ""The Fly"" a classic that hasn't lost any of its original impact."
"sharkattack1978","10","1","2","4 January 2008"," The fly is a classic of a classic
","This remake of the original The Fly is a landmark in David Cronenberg's career. Brilliant lit and cinema-graphed this is one of Cronenberg's crowning achievements in both horror and sci-fi. Re-imagining the whole plot normally kills the original movie but it didn't for this film. In fact it made it more greater. Instead of having a man with the head of a fly you get a man who has almost total transformation into a fly. Goldblum is great as Dr. Seth Brundle a scientist who tries to make a revolutionary design in time-place relationships. Going from the area to another is his idea and with his trusty ""Telepods"" he intends to be a pioneer in breaking research and it almost works. However the experiment goes horribly wrong and Seth realises that he not going to be the same anymore. I have lost count with how many I have seen this but it never gets tiring. The special effects were brilliant and still are to this day. although gruesome sick and very stomach churning, it compliments this classic in the making back in the 80's. Those who have watched Cronenberg's work will notice his trademark in this picture. One being the horrifying FX done fairly close up and the atmospheric score in the background that share the same style of that in Scanners, Rabid, Videodrome and eXistence.<br/><br/>All in all a brill horror/sci-fi movie to be enjoyed by adults with strong stomachs and strong hearts. Just don't watch it on a full stomach. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"

","I can still remember the first time I saw David Cronenberg's 'The Fly'. I was ten years old, a huge animal friend, and would by accident see this not very child-friendly piece of terror. Something really changed in me that night, I'm afraid, when Dr. Seth is transporting the baboon, and after the smoke has settled, sees what his brilliant, yet deranged, mind has done.<br/><br/>A couple of years later I saw it again (and again, and again...) only to find that very scene just as, or possibly even more, offensive. And I loved it. Every single frame of it, this time. Thus, my interest for animals had been replaced by my endless love for cinema.<br/><br/>I guess, this is one of those movies you either love, or hate. You can't say that it's ""OK"" or ""avarege"". 'Cause it's really not. It's something else. The combination of Cronenberg's playful, as well as skillful, directing, Jeff Goldblum's unforgettably diabolic, mutated lab rat and the inventive special effects makes this a landmark in 80's horror, and indeed a powerful one. This, even though some would say that it's mearly just a display of meaningless and speculative violence and gore. But you've got to love Cronenberg to love 'The Fly'. And I do.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I'm not the only one."

The Costume and Makeup Department must have had one good time transforming Jeff Goldblum into a Fly monster.<br/><br/>Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), a brilliant and determined scientist, is a person that hopes to change the world.

He gets into the machine, but a common housefly gets in with him. The telepods merge Seth and the fly. Seth gets out apparently normal, but slowly, one gene by another, he is transforming into a human/fly hybrid, Brundlefly...<br/><br/>The acting is perfect. Tons of memorable lines. Barely any goofs.

"K_Todorov","8","1","2","12 January 2007"," Thought provoking...
","David Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" elevates this simple story of an experiment gone wrong into a carefully paced character driven drama/horror. Thus adding a whole new layer of depth to what could've been a sub-par horror film.<br/><br/>The idea is simple. Jeff Goldblum is the scientist Seth Brundle, who after a what appeared as an successful experiment in the fields of teleportation finds himself slowly turning into a half human half fly hybrid. Gena Davis plays Veronica Quaife, Brundle's girlfriend and also former girlfriend of the third major character in the film, Stathis Borans played by John Gets.<br/><br/>From the beginning to the end Cronenberg focuses the movie entirely into these three characters. Establishing a sort of love-triangle between them as both Brunle and Borans develop or still have feelings towards Quaife. While at the same time facing their own deeper fears as the transformation from man to ... something else, begins slowly digging at Brundle's humanity. And it is here where Cronenberg excels with his ability to properly direct human reaction to situations that are often found unnatural. Employing a turn in character focus that causes the viewer's own established empathy towards them to change. While in the first half we saw the developing relationship between Brundle and Quaife with Borans's character portrayed in a more anti-heroic role, in the second part we witness a complete switch of roles as Brundle is becoming more and more distanced from human feelings and logic. Culminating in the last scene with him finally realizing what he has become and what must be done to stop himself. Even then, at that point we don't see him as the beaten villain but as a casualty of his own personal desires.<br/><br/>Cronenberg sets a dark serious tone to the film and he never changes the pace. Even though the plot outline might sound as something found in the B-movie standard of horror, there isn't a single scene that could be considered cheesy or weakly executed. The effects also help in that matter, with the breathtaking design of ""The Fly"". It is really no wonder why this movie won an Oscar for make-up. But it should have won for a lot more...<br/><br/>People who are searching for a horror film that delivers far more then some cheap scares should give ""The Fly"" a try. Not just because of its effects or its strong focus on character but also because of the powerful and well executed idea of finding humanity even when you've thought you've lost it."

The film won the Oscar for makeup effects but I think it got severely overlooked. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are great, the score is chilling and Cronenberg's direction is perfect.<br/><br/>A brilliant but odd scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) creates two telepods.

","Everyone knows the story--brilliant scientist creates amazing invention (teleporter!) and, in testing it, merges himself with a fly that, unbeknown to him, zips about his second telepod. What follows that mishap could best be described as degeneration, as Seth Brundle, the scientist, becomes Brundlefly. <br/><br/>Obviously, though, the movie was made by David Cronenberg, master of venereal or bio- horror. He loves exploring the body and the many ways it disintegrates or morphs; he loves making audiences squeamish with glistening viscera that serve a higher, more philosophical purpose. If Rabid was about STDs, then the Fly is about love in the face of decay. Reading into the story too much would be reductive--The Fly isn't about watching Brundle die from any particular disease; it's about watching Veronica helplessly stand witness to her lover's slow, unalterable demise. It might also be leftfield, allegorical support for euthanasia, but I'm more inclined to believe that the ending resulted from the necessity of a tidy narrative than it did from Cronenberg's desire to include an encrypted message. <br/><br/>But is it any good? Yes, it is. The Fly works on the level of symbolism, but it's also an enjoyable and frightening horror film. It's got the gore and the scares, but it's also intelligent. The Fly is a brilliant commercial horror movie inasmuch as it manages to stay true to the director's vision, while also delivering what audiences expect from a scary movie. It's also wonderfully shot and acted (Jeff Goldblum already looked like an insect; Cronenberg got him to act like one as well). <br/><br/>With The Fly Cronenberg also achieved something few directors could--he made a remake better than the original. The Fly from the 1950s was fine, but it wasn't really that frightening; it's actually a little silly. Cronenberg rewrote the script and turned the earlier film on its ear. This Fly is scary, smart, and, unlike most of Cronenberg's films, lacking in gallows humor; it's actually among his more serious endeavors. <br/><br/>The Fly is a fantastic piece of film-making that should appeal to those in the mood for a taut horror flick or an intelligent, though coded, exploration of an interesting idea."

"jluis1984","10","1","2","6 February 2006"," Simply Outstanding!
","By 1986, director David Cronenberg was one of the rising stars in the horror genre, having a bright career in his natal Canada where he had directer modern classics such as ""The Brood"", ""Scanners"" and the masterpiece of the genre, ""Videodrome"". After directing his first movie in the U.S., ""The Dead Zone"" in 1983, Cronenberg was chosen to direct his first big budget project in the U.S.: the remake of the classic movie ""The Fly"".<br/><br/>The plot of the original movie was kept at its core, a brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), creates a teleporting machine, but when he experiments teleporting himself, something goes wrong and he gets combined with a fly. That is the plot outline and all the movie has in common with the original, because Cronenberg took a whole different approach to the story.<br/><br/>While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes ""the offspring of man and fly"".<br/><br/>The script is simply brilliant, not only it explores Seth Brundle's tragedy, the inclusion of Geena Davis as the reporter who falls in love with the scientist only to discover that his lover is slowly changing into something unnatural plays an important part in Brundle's tragedy. The story is full of metaphors and it is the ultimate romance/horror tragedy.<br/><br/>Now, all this would not be possible without the acting of both Goldblum and Davis, their chemistry together is remarkable and their performances carry the film with the power enough to give us insight in the tragedy that slowly gets in the middle of their love.<br/><br/>David Cronenberg's direction is outstanding and this is one of his best works. ""The Fly"" truly shows his progression as an artist and it is an important step in his career. In ""The Fly"" he successfully mixes the character study of previous works like ""The Brood"" or ""The Dead Zone"" with the SFX-packed action of ""Scanners"" and ""Videodrome"". this is without a doubt one of his most accomplished pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, I could go on praising this film and yet it would not be enough. ""The Fly"" is not only a modern classic of the horror genre (so much that it has casted a shadow over the original), it is a perfect example of the art of film-making. 10/10"
"Lt_Coffey_182","8","1","2","20 January 2006"," Sci-Fi Horror at its best
","David Cronenberg is up there with David Lynch as one of the top visual surrealist directors. Whilst The Fly is not a surreal like Eraserhead or Naked Lunch, it has its surreal moments and definitely crosses the boundaries in to shock cinema. Cronenberg is a director who has an obvious fascination with the grotesque there are not many more grotesque images than some shown here. The make up used on Jeff Goldblum is brilliant and changes very subtly during Brundle's transformation from man to Brundlefly. To witness the final stages of Brundlefly is particularly disturbing and Geena Davis' reactions mirror exactly how I felt when watching with disbelief. The visuals in this film, although slightly over the top, are fantastic and will never be forgotten. Cronenberg is fantastic as a director because rather than being concerned with making the film accessible, he cares more for making a good film and projecting his vision.<br/><br/>As well as being highly imaginative and impressive visually, The Fly has a great plot. The relationship between Goldblum and Davis is very touching and romantic. The relationship is written very effectively due to it being exaggerated to the point that the audience are prepared to believe that this woman will still love a genetically mutating man. The main plot of an inventor creating 'telepods' that accidentally become gene fusers gives the film its Sci-Fi element and the way Goldblum's character transforms after he goes through is very commendable. Whilst not the most thought provoking of plots, The Fly is intelligently written and does well to both entertain and shock.<br/><br/>Goldblum does fantastically in making the leap from an eccentric, somewhat childlike scientist to a mutant going crazy. He is perfect for this role in appearance, by voice and by him mannerisms. Jeff Goldblum makes Seth Brundle a unique character and definitely should be the role Goldblum is most proud of playing. Geena Davis is a great actress and does very well in this performance. Her ability at showing shock and disgust is very good but it is the more subtle parts involving her and Goldblum's character development where she really shines.<br/><br/>The dark mood of the film is greatly reflected by the atmosphere in the film. Most of the settings are very dark and there are not many characters in the film, helping the audience to focus on Goldblum and Davis. Howard Shore's score is extremely dramatic, slightly cliché but very well done. Cronenberg is an expert at creating moods and contrast. The contrast of a wonderful romance against all the grotesque imagery is very effective as it brings an element of reality to the film. There is also a sense of abruptness to the film; the abrupt ending reflects how quickly the fly's genes fused with Brundle's body. It is the subtle themes that really make this film standout.<br/><br/>A classic Sci-Fi Horror, The Fly is a great film and stands proud with many science fiction films of the 80s. The eighties is often mocked as a cultural phenomenon but with regards to this specific genre, the eighties was an immensely important decade. The Fly, along with Terminator, Aliens and The Thing went to great lengths to revolutionise the genre. Cronenberg does a fantastic job with this film. Of all of his more mainstream films, The Fly is his best effort yet."
"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","15 January 2006"," Pure Visceral Horror
","I've read that David Cronenberg considers this film one of his most mainstream efforts, which is weird, considering some critics tend to use The Fly as the perfect example the Canadian auteur DOESN'T do mainstream. Well, in my opinion, it's both.<br/><br/>The story is certainly a very conventional one: a scientist's (Jeff Goldblum) experiment goes wrong and he turns into a monster. What's unusual about it is the way Croenberg merges the body horror with romance and ultimately uses the terrifying scenario as a reflection on identity (see also Dead Ringers and A History of Violence for further developments of the same theme).<br/><br/>Goldblum shines as Seth Brundle, the eccentric genius whose genetic structure is combined with a fly's during a teleportation experiment, an accident which has serious consequences: Seth gradually becomes a ""Brundlefly"", who possesses extraordinary physical abilities (that stage of the metamorphosis reminds of Peter Parker's transformation into Spider-Man) as well as an insatiable sexual hunger (possible reference to Cronenberg's directorial debut, Shivers). Soon enough, though, he and his girlfriend (Geena Davis) realize things are getting very bad (the scene where Seth quotes Kafka to describe his condition is brilliant, another proof this ain't a conventional horror flick)...<br/><br/>Alongside the acting, the other impressive thing about this movie is the Oscar-winning make-up: rarely has a creature looked so real and revolting (and there's no CGI involved).<br/><br/>And finally, The Fly has one of the best director cameos ever: Cronenberg plays the gynecologist in the infamous ""nightmare abortion"" sequence (a landmark in horror cinema).<br/><br/>For fans of the genre, this is something you just can't miss."

"Bogmeister","9","1","2","13 December 2005"," Horrific Tragedy in the Name of Science
","This remake of the fifties sf/horror version is Cronenberg's own masterpiece of horror. Sure, he had original, unusual ideas before this (""The Brood""in'79; ""Videodrome""in'83,etc.) and branched out into other genres after this, so it's odd that a remake is his ultimate effort. But it's here that all the elements of horror came together in a nearly perfect mix. Many of the scenes, particularly in the 2nd half, are uncomfortable to watch, and this may be why many viewers do not rate this film higher - it's just too disturbing to view. A lot of this has to do with the likability of the two main characters, played by Goldblum & Davis. Goldblum as Brundle especially, comes across as a slightly goofy, harmless eccentric in the early scenes. His charm works on Davis and also on the audience; we certainly don't want anything bad to happen to him. But you already get that sense of dread very early, when he first unveils his macabre-looking pod teleporters. You sense he has some bad times ahead of him - you just don't know how bad. The horror is so effective because it gets really, really bad - just so much worse than you could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>The other aspect to the story, the progress represented by a scientific breakthrough, is another element which, rather than a potential science fiction premise, becomes subverted into a tragedy of horror. Usually, a concept such as teleportation, successfully accomplished, is cause for celebration (see the Star Trek series & films for a brighter version of such technology). Here, progress such as this should probably be avoided at any cost. But, the real tragedy is Brundle's horrific bad luck, falling prey to his human failings, notably impatience. If only he'd waited another day. If only he noticed that fly. If only he'd placed some safeguard to prevent his machine from performing a function it was not intended for. The machinery here becomes a dispassionate godlike creator of monsters; the machine is not so much demonic as remorseless and unfeeling. It's a most disquieting argument against the supposed benefits of escalating technology.<br/><br/>Or maybe it should be termed evolving technology. Brundle's rapid evolution after he first steps into the teleporter touches on some of the most primal fears associated with modern mankind: death and disease. We watch him first seemingly devolve after he first voices our primary concern (""Am I dying?""). A cancer-like affliction cripples him, and it looks like he'll fall apart into nothing soon. Only later do we realize this was only a transitory step and further horrors await our eyes as Brundle changes, changes. By this point, many viewers may want to turn away or turn it off. It's really slow death we're seeing and, unless one has sadistic tendencies, there is no compelling reason to watch. Well, unless it's to feel grateful we will never fall victim to something like this. Or will we?"

","THE FLY (1986) is a great film on all counts. Cronenberg was in top form as director of this film, and his style is all over it. The story concerns Seth Brundle, played by Jeff Goldblum (who to be honest, I usually HATE, but was actually very good in this film...)who is a scientist working on a teleportation machine. He has various degrees of success and is finally ready to test his project on a human subject, and decides to use himself as the first human test subject. Everything seems OK til Seth realizes that there was fly in the transporter with him, and that they were ""combined"" during the teleportation process...<br/><br/>THE FLY hits the mark on every level. The acting, even from Goldblum (did I mention, I normally hate that guy?...) and Geena Davis (another actress that I normally HATE...) who plays Brundle's love interest, are dead on. At first it's fascinating, even fun to watch Brundle's transformation from man to ""fly-thing"" (the extra strength and agility, etc...) until the process becomes accelerated and Brundle starts losing body parts in various gory ways...and there is a good bit of ""gross"" stuff in this one. I remember this film being considered pretty shocking for a theatrical release when it first came out and with good reason.

","The Fly is gross-meister David Cronenberg's grisly remake of the 1958 original. Genius scientist Jeff Goldblum invents a teleporter; a device to transport matter. He shows it to a reporter, lovely Geena Davis who falls in love with him. Alas, Goldblum tests the device by transporting himself, with horribly disastrous results. Be warned. The Fly is not for children. Not since John Carpenter's The Thing have there been such gruesome effects. The Fly is a well-made movie but certain scenes are hard to watch and the ending is a downer. Goldblum's performance was recognized as Oscar-worthy, and it is, but since it's a horror role its importance was lessened in the eyes of the academy and so he was passed-over. I don't think The Fly is as philosophical a movie as some make it out to be. I think it's a flat out horror film and it succeeds. The Fly creature is well done and the entire film is very unsettling, as you'd expect from Cronenberg. The Fly is a superior horror film that should be seen by horror fans, but is not for children or people who cannot watch gross-out films."

I've seen more recent movies in which the special effects were no longer any good, but this movie is different. <br/><br/>Thanks to Jeff Goldblum's excellent performance and 'looks', this remake is still very convincing. Because the director didn't focus on the special effects in the first place, but on the characters' emotions and the psychological aspects, you never get the feeling that this movie was shot in 1986, so already pretty old ... for a horror movie.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum is a brilliant scientist who has invented a teleporter. He uses it on himself but a fly comes with him on the ride. His genes are mixed up with those of the fly and he slowly turns into a crossing of a fly and a man. The new Brundle fly, as he calls himself, has supernatural strengths, but it doesn't take long until everything goes terribly wrong.<br/><br/>The mutation is impressive, even disgusting from time to time, especially at the end of the movie.

It revolves around Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum), a scientist who has created a teleportation pod that would ""change the world"". Seth shows his invention to Veronica Quaife(Geena Davis), a woman he falls in love with. The teleportation device would only transport materials, and make a mess of the molecular construction of an organism. Seth finally acheived success with using a human subject. However, there was a slight flaw. A fly had gotten in the teleportation pod along Seth, thus fusing the two. Seth eventually shows his demise as he starts to gain more insect characteristics, and poor Veronica has to deal with all of this. Regardless, her love still remains.

His simple quirkiness isn't anything phenomenal, but it actually suits him the more he decomposes.

In the end, it is up to the real actor (posing as the real film talent) to destroy the abomination (partial mercy-killing).<br/><br/>The second level is the pacing.  Near the end I was disappointed to see a ""TV fadeout"" associated with commercial breaks.  ""Return of the King"" had five of them if I recall correctly.

His constant fetish with the flesh was first explored with Scanners, and then later with Videodrome, but with The Fly, Cronenberg has a story, a motive, and a clear conviction doesn't get lost in his own surrealism or artfulness. Jeff Goldbloom deserves credit for his performance; he is believable and even likable all the way through and his romantic moments with Geena Davis are curiously entertaining.

The Fly was logical and intelligent and it wasn't about, ""Let's See How We Can Disgust Them The Most?"" There was no shock value in The Fly. The Fly is about a man who becomes torn apart between his girlfriend and his work. The most touching part of the film was when Brundle was forced to deal with a decision he could not control. He suffered from an illness which left him with sorrow   and heart break. The telling of the story reflects how a lot of us are put into decisions that we have to do, that of which we would have originally have chosen not to, but our minds say it is for the best.

This film has a spectacularly balanced mixture of suspense, thrills and just plain ""holy crap he just melted that guy's foot with vomit, that's DISGUSTING"" which will satisfy any horror/SCI-FI movie fan.  The plot, pacing, camera angles, and music enhance the acting of a wonderfully cast Jeff Goldblum (in a brilliant if stereotypical performance consisting of nerdly bravado and odd hand gestures to which even Saturday Night Live can do no justice).  The late 80's-early 90's trend towards movies with cancer metaphors (see also: 'ALIENS') is represented proudly herein as Seth Brundle slowly metamorphoses into 'Brundle Fly'.  For my money, one of the scariest movie monologues is Jeff Goldblum's 'Insect Politicians' culminating in the chilling line: ""I'm saying...(head twitches insectily, looks longingly towards skylight) I'll hurt you if you stay"".  I can go on analyzing this film for hours and hours, but I'll just say that this is certainly MY favorite horror movie of all time, and it keeps getting better every time I watch it."

","Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of creating a teleportation device that could revolutionize the world.

Just when Seth thinks he has all of the bugs worked out, he tries it on himself.  Seth comes out of the chamber apparently unaffected by the experiment.  Then Seth begins to notice a change.  He first finds himself performing acrobatic stunts that he thought he could never be able to do as a normal person.  Next his girlfriend Veronica(Geena Davis) begins to notice a disturbing change in his behavior.  Then Veronica discovers the strange hairs growing on Seth's back.  Veronica, horrified, takes the hairs to a doctor and finds that the hairs growing on Seth's back weren't human, but were in fact, insect hairs.  Seth, shrugging off Veronica's pleas that he see a doctor, decides to review the process as it happened.  He then makes a horrifying discovery, his genetic make up had been accidentally spliced with that of a house fly that flew into the chamber shortly before he teleported and then begins Seth's transformation. <br/><br/>
David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the 1958 film of the same name, is a completely different film from the original.  For instance, in The Fly(1958), a man just has the head of a fly on a human body.  In the remake, a man and a fly become one being and the end results are terrifying.  The Fly is a total gross-out of a movie.  The horrific, Oscar-winning special effects truly are what I describe them as: horrific.  I won't ever forget the arm wrestling match, or the nightmare sequence, or the ending transformation scene.  I'll admit that I used to be scared to watch this movie, but I'm not anymore.  My mom sort of hates this movie because of the way that it shows how flies ""eat"" their food. <br/><br/>The Fly is still a great movie.

"meltedfinch","Null","1","2","22 August 2001"," My favourite film of all time, an amazing achievement!
","Quite frankly, this is an exceptional movie. The highly controversial, shocking and stunning visions and taboos of Canadian director David Cronenberg had never been very successful outside of the inevitable cult following he acquired from such body/horror classics as ""Shivers (1974)"" and ""Rabid (1976)."" These earlier films had established him as a master of shock, flinging flesh, sex and gore at the screen while dealing with themes that would become staples of Cronenberg's filmmaking career; the transformation of the human body from one form to another, mankind's uneasy relationship with science and medicine, and general disgust at the condition of the human body.<br/><br/>When offered the opportunity to remake the 1958 B-movie ""The Fly,"" Cronenberg could hardly refuse. The film seemed perfectly in tune with his own trademark obsessions (a scientist is genetically fused with a fly as he is teleporting himself in his new teleportation device, and his mind and bodily lusts and functions are altered drastically). Of course, the reason this stands out from his other, less commercial movies is the fact that the dramatic heart of the movie is concerned with real human emotions and feelings e.g. love, jealousy, despair and wide-eyed wonder. Cronenberg felt he could make his own ""romantic story"" and succeeded in making ""The Fly"" stand out from his other films.<br/><br/>The film succeeds spectacularly by combining what makes Cronenberg such a unique and special filmmaker (the film contains a number of gruesome, stomach-churning but stupefyingly intense and powerful moments of gory horror, notably the arm-wrestling sequence and the doughnut scene), with a genuinely touching relationship between the doomed scientist (Jeff Goldblum) and the journalist he hires to record his work (Geena Davis). The film is therefore not just a gross-out Cronenberg classic, but a tragic and moving romantic horror in the Phantom of The Opera/Hunchback of Notre Dame vein.<br/><br/>The film is a cascade of powerful intensity, notably Howard Shore's dramatic and epic music, the scenes of horror which are magnificently shot and executed (the maggot-birth nightmare is too sickening for words) while the climax is about as beautiful and powerful as science fiction and horror has ever been, with Brundle the scientist, now in total ruin having failed in attempting to fuse his diseased body with Veronica, the journalist's. He begs Veronica to shoot him, and the devastating final shot of the twisted corpse, Veronica's mutilated ex-boyfriend Stathos Borans (John Getz) and Veronica uncontrollably crying is about as human and heartbreaking as science fiction has ever been.<br/><br/>It's brilliant, but without the monumental lead performance of Jeff Goldblum as Brundle, it simply would not have been the same, Goldblum's sublime combinations of wide-eyed optimism, pathos and arrogance creating a vitally sympathetic main character, while Davis is also extremely good as Veronica.<br/><br/>In the end, the film, being note perfect Cronenberg, is a note perfect movie, full of style, crushingly brilliant scenes and all the perfect elements, not least the gruesome but astounding make-up.<br/><br/>Absolutely flawless."

Brundle is fascinating to watch because he doesn't feel any pity for himself but takes his transformation as any scientist would, as an absolute biological wonder. It is not until he really starts to become physically weak and dying that he feels regret for his ambition (but of course towards the end he regains his confidence). I really give so much credit to David Cronenberg in creating a film with such haunting ambience. Where the locations are cold, sterile and kept to a minimum (characters are also kept to a minimum with only three main characters and a few other very small characters with a few lines of dialogue) for a reason: so that you are stuck with this morphing, oozing man. You have got to roost with the fella to really feel what he is going through. Howard Shore of course adds to the sense of forboding and eerie quality of the film with his wonderful score. People often tell me how they thought the film was too violent and gorry. But how could you envision the picture in any other way? Why don't those people make their own ending to the film where the fly joins a beach club and surfs by day and dances by night. The real fans we'll keep the film just how it is. 10/10."

Despite the contradictory scientific facts that may surround the plot, it definitely works great when it comes to character interaction. The script is simply formidable. Every single scene has a purpose, which makes this 100-minute film very substantial.<br/><br/>And you will find the number 3 several times in the movie. This may sound very subjective, of course.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie could be split in three main acts: `I. The world changing invention', `II. The gene splicing course' and `III. The ultimate genetic experiment', as instance.<br/><br/>There are three `telepods' (designer's phone boots?) at Seth's apartment/lab: one for the source, another for the destiny and a last one which was the prototype that `worked clunky.' Close to the end, all three telepods were used to build the `gene splicing teleporting machine.'<br/><br/>Three times Stathis Borans gets to see Seth Brundle. (1) At his office, when he's accusing Seth to be a con man, (2) at Ronnie's home, when he's watching the video that Ronnie's recorded for him, and (3) when he decides to take justice on his hands and confronts the horrible monster that later on liquefies his hand and foot.<br/><br/>The `ultimate family' is made up of three members: `you, me and the baby.'<br/><br/>
There are some scenes with three focal people on them. One, when Ronnie, Seth and Stathis meet at the latter's office. Other with Tawny, Ronnie and Seth when Ronnie states her memorable quote `be afraid, be very afraid.' One more with Dr. Cheevers, Stathis and Ronnie, when doctor inquiries the couple before practicing the abortion. And, of course, the grand finale with Stathis, Ronnie and the unfortunate creature that was named Seth Brundle once.<br/><br/>Don't blame this movie to be `bad sci-fi' or let your stomach give opinions enjoy the acting, the horror and the brilliant plot.<br/><br/>One good point to add is the music. Howard Shore made a superb soundtrack, worth to be bought separately."

"rparham","9","1","2","18 January 2004"," One of the great ""horror"" films
","Most remakes are simply not the match of the originals that they have pulled their inspiration from.  Usually, they are rather shallow, poor copies of their greater source material, and very few remakes find themselves the film that is better remembered.  Recent examples of this phenomenon are films such as Planet of the Apes, a truly classic film from 1968 that was remade in 2001 with most of what made the original a special event missing. There are, as with anything, exceptions, and one of the greatest, in my opinion, is the 1986 remake of The Fly.  While I have not seen the original film, I cannot believe for an instant that it is the better of the 1986 version, one of the great overlooked films of the 1980's.<br/><br/>The original was based on a short story by French author George Langellan and is most well known for it's famous ending where a child finds a fly in the backyard of a house with a man's head on it, about to be attacked by a spider, as well as the flip side featuring a man with a giant fly head wandering around a lab.  It also starred famous Roger Corman player Vincent Price, the most notable name associated with the film.  While many people looked on this film with fond memories, it is also not really viewed as a true ""classic"" and that is why in the mid-'80s producer Stuart Cornfeld and screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue hatched a plan to remake the film for modern audiences.  With financial backing from Mel Brooks (a rather unlikely suitor) the team of Cornfeld and Pogue attracted director David Cronenberg to the film.  Cronenberg, a Canadian native who had made several unusual low-budget horror films since the 1970s, had created his own minor subgenre of horror that became known as ""venereal horror"" for it's often sexual nature.  The Fly, while much more mainstream than his previous projects to date, would fit his mindset perfectly, and lead to the birth of a veritable masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film centers on Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) a scientist who has devoted his life and brilliance to developing teleportation.  He suffers from motion sickness, so his desire to do away with any standard mobile form of transportation makes sense.  While attending a press gathering held by his financial sponsor, Brundle meets and falls for science magazine journalist Veronica ""Ronnie"" Quaife (Geena Davis).  She is late of a relationship with the editor of the science magazine Particle, Stathis Borans (John Getz), and is intrigued and attracted to the rather naive, yet charming and charismatic scientist.  They begin a relationship and she begins documenting his development of the teleportation devices (which Brundle dubs ""telepods"") for a book to be published after the telepods are complete and fully functional. Brundle is dogged by a rather severe set of drawbacks in the development of the telepods when it comes to transporting living creatures, leading to an early scene where a baboon is teleported and arrives in the sister telepod inside out.  Brundle eventually licks the problem and successfully teleports another baboon.  However, coinciding with the completion of the telepods, Ronnie must deal with Borans who is using her relationship with Brundle to try and get her to commit to writing his story for him, as well as trying to not get her to leave his life.  In a jealous panic when Ronnie goes to see Borans, Brundle decides to test the telepod on himself, while unwittingly sharing the telepod with a normal housefly.  Initially, the teleportation is a success.  However, shortly thereafter, Brundle begins to show changes. He is physically stronger than he previously was, with an increased sexual drive as well.  This is also accompanied by a strong temper and rather displeasing personality at times.  Physically he begins showing some rather strange symptoms as well, such as strong acne and tough hairs growing out of different parts of his body.  Ronnie challenges him on these points, but Brundle just dismisses them, saying she is jealous of his new physical perfection, and he separates from her.  But when his fingernails begin falling out and he finds that to eat, he must regurgitate a strange soupy substance on his food first, even Brundle cannot ignore the reality of what has happened.  He discovers the truth of the event and tries to get Ronnie to help him, but she finds that she cannot continue to support him in the midst of the wild physical and emotional changes he is going through.<br/><br/>The Fly received a lot of press for it's at times gruesome imagery, and I can't deny that it isn't the easiest film to sit through if you have a weak constitution.  But, that does not make the film not worth seeing.  While on the surface The Fly is categorized as a ""horror"" film, the film cannot be easily and simply classified in that genre.  The film is in fact a strong love story and character study of Seth Brundle.  The film's heart is with the two people at the center.  Goldblum is near perfect as the scientist who knows how to assemble complex machinery and develop brilliant formulas for teleportation, but has a hard time expressing his feelings for Ronnie. It's the ultimate underdog story as the unlikely nerd finds love in the arms of a beautiful woman.  Ronnie is also portrayed well by Geena Davis as a tough journalist who has heard lots of interesting promises from scientists in the field before, but finds herself at first intrigued, and then finally attracted to, Brundle.  Their genuinely touching and involving relationship lays the groundwork for why this film works.  Once their involvement has been established, the film unleashes it's horror elements upon us, in the form of Brundle's disturbing transformations.  Most of the film from about the mid-point on is revealed from Ronnie's point of view and we can only watch in horror as she goes to visit Brundle and see what stage he is in at this point.  The strength of their relationship as developed by Pogue and Cronenberg early in the film makes the latter scenes all the more powerful.<br/><br/>Much must be said of the makeup effects created and supervised by Chris Walas.  The film's eventual path lives or dies on the convincingness of the transformations that Brundle must go through, and Walas and his crew pull it off brilliantly.  There are no seams or zippers, no obvious tell-tale signs of makeup work being done here.  We believe, whole-heartedly, in the transformation of Brundle visually, and the film would not be the same without it.  Again, Goldblum helps sell the transformation as well, with his mood swings and erratic behavior, eventually leading to a man scared beyond belief by what is happening to him.  However, it is his powerful, gut-wrenching desire to be whole and human and with Ronnie again where the film's final strength is gleaned from.  The final fifteen minutes are truly difficult to endure first from Goldblum's performance and then from Davis', as the two lovers must come to terms with the inevitable.  There are few other ""horror"" films that are as filled with human emotion as The Fly, and this film stands as the crowning achievement in David Cronenberg's oeuvre."

","OK, think about it.  You're using the latest advance in technology to transport information right now.  Suppose somebody came up with a technological method tomorrow to transport any amount of matter from one place to another.  Not two dimensional text or photos, but three dimensional objects.  Food, clothing, machinery,even people, transported electronically. No more airlines, trucks, automotive industries, OPEC, Middle East crises, on and on.  Hasn't the aim of technology (since Faraday) been to organize ""essential"" matter?  Starting with manipulable electromagnetic waves to form impulses into telegraphic and then radio waves, technology has sought to shrink distance.  Seth Brundle's (fictional) invention is the logical outcome of this quest.  The joke to this theme is in the title.  The ""fly"" is the proverbial fly in the ointment. The dark side of technology is it's capacity to inflict massive suffering on humanity, in the form of war machinery, totalitarian regimes, and  biomedical disasters.  The author of the original story, ""The Fly"", had a prescient understanding of the runaway obsession with technology we are now caught up in.

","I saw this movie once. Never again. David Cronenberg seems to be going out of his way in this movie to gross out the audience. The problem is, he mistakes revulsion for genuine horror and suspense.<br/><br/>This movie has one redeeming value. It inspired what has to be the All-Time Classic Worst Pun in the History of the World. It came from Bob Hope: ""Hey, did you see this new movie, ""The Fly?"" Jeff Goldblum plays a mad scientist who accidentally turns himself into a giant fly. My favorite scene in the movie is when the scientist and his wife are sitting in a restaurant.

","For some reason obsessive film makers make horrible movies that end up taken as Works of genius by many. This is one case. This movie is disturbing like none I have seen to date. It is not rated on this website but it is obviously R, for nudity, violence and gore. The genre is called biological horror, or body horror, what actually means nothing, so I prefer the first. This kind of movie relies on gruesome fx more than anything else, and the dread of being infected and losing your grip on the the human body, and this movie sets the standard. The acting of Goldblum (Fly) and Davis (girlfriend) are at the level of a low Budget movie, what in a sense this movie is, except it had a big Budget for the first time for a movie of this genre, and that's what makes it exceptional. A lot of care was given into the fx and make up. Cronberg's editing is as bad as your typical 80s movie. And some big mistakes were made in making the final edit, leaving important and relevant scenes out. Special care was given into making the main character likable, although the main actor is anything else but likable. For Croneberg it is a tragic love story. But in my opinion it's hard to tell a love story when you put so much weight on gruesome close ups. The movie makes no effort in hiding the hideousness of the fly character, in fact in puts it right in your face."

","When I was a kid, one of the first horror flicks I ever saw was Vincent Price's ""The Fly"" with that creepy 'Pleeeeese, help me' ending that I couldn't shake out of my young head for a long time. This film takes the same basic premise and raises it a considerable notch with some fine moments by Jeff Goldblum in the title role. What I still like about the older sci-fi and horror flicks is the way they use pseudo-scientific explanations for whatever the subject terror might be. This one sounded pretty convincing with that business about the fusion of Brundle and the fly at the molecular-genetic level.<br/><br/>One of the brilliant things about Goldblum's performance is the way he mimics fly behavior starting with the endless cup of sugar. The early touches with the wiry hair effect and the preliminary disfigurement are nicely juxtaposed with Brundle's disproportionate new strength and acrobatic ability. I recall when I saw this the first time that I wondered when we would see Brundle walking around on the ceiling and sure enough, they eventually got around to creating a nicely convincing scene of it.<br/><br/>The thing I didn't find particularly believable though was Ronnie's (Geena Davis) willingness to stick it out to the very end with fly-man. The clincher for me was when she hugged him right after his ear fell off. I mean, you REALLY had to take it on faith that she was trying to remain true to her feelings for the man she started to fall in love with. But gee, you can only take that idea so far.<br/><br/>Thinking about that pregnancy side story, it seemed pretty obvious that the ending left it open for an eventual sequel that never panned out. On the other hand, I'd hate to put Geena Davis through that again, especially since she would have had to deal with another monster.<br/><br/>But you know, I could go along with all the creepy fly stuff and the grotesque makeup job. However the one thing I really couldn't figure out in all this - who would ever name their kid Stathis Borans?"

","If you're looking for a good mind blowing gory techno-horror, Cronenberg delivers with garnish and love. After the initial minute or two it takes to get over Jeff Goldblum's and Geena Davis' 80s style fashion and hair, ""The Fly"" becomes a masterpiece of horror cinema.<br/><br/>The story is actually very simple: Seth Brundle (Goldblum) invents a teleportation device, invites a reporter named Veronica (Davis) to share in the revelation, then, during a moment of weakness, tests the device on himself... accidentally fusing his genes with a wayward fly. Then he slowly falls apart while Veronica watches helplessly, also dealing with her own worries since she seems to be pregnant with Brundle's baby... and who knows how that'll turn out! Such a story is practically packaged in the ""this is supposed to be campy"" production material, but Cronenberg doesn't do it like that. He plays it straight, and with Davis' and Goldberg's humanity, truly gets into the nature of this unique technological fear. But let's not wax too poetic: the movie delivers on a purely visual and visceral level. From Davis giving birth to a maggot to the prosthetics work as Goldblum's skin falls off his face, The Fly is a direct argument against the notion that it's always better to allude, not show, in horror cinema.<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely delicious in a disgusting, rotten synthetic steak kind of way.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

He tries to get her into a telepod, and Seth becomes a human fly guy. He begs Ronnie to kill him. She does.<br/><br/>Overall, this may be a really gross film, but it had terrific acting and the ending is really tragic and sad. I mean, the scientist is the original was okay. Oh, what, he was killed? Nevermind. Anyway, pretend you never read that and just remember to try to look deep down inside this film and look at the sad and tragic structure, the great acting, and a great score by Howard Shore.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: The Fly(1958)"

Scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum)tampers with nature and becomes cursed from it - his DNA assimilated with that of a fly when the two travel through the teleportation pods,<br/><br/>2. Initially he sees it as a blessing (strentgh, agility etc.),<br/><br/>3. But he gradually becomes more twisted - physically and mentally - until he is a 6ft 6inch Fly-man mutant - Brundle-fly's speech about 'Insect Politics' near the end is one of the creepiest speeches in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>4. And finally, tragedy as he gets his girlfriend to kill him as he cannot take his pain anymore.<br/><br/>It is a deeply unnerving, but ultimately tragic movie. It's not something to watch if you want to feel upbeat by the end. There is no happy resolution. It begins with Brundle as a man, and ends with his death. Nothing else happens once he's out of the picture.<br/><br/>But,as I say, it's one of those films that if you like GOOD horror movies that has atmosphere as-well-as stomach-churning sights, then give it a go.

","David Cronenberg is a master of technological horror and always manages to create films chock full of interesting ideas. The problem (or really cool thing ) about some of his films however, is that he lets his ideas overwhelm the story. His films become more like puzzles than straight forward pictures, and often require the viewer to sit back and decipher what they just saw. While The Fly still explores Cronenberg's characteristic theme of the transformation of the human body, it does so in a way that never overwhelms the story. The film remains at its core a tragic love story, aided greatly by Jeff Goldblum's very human performance. The emotion here doesn't seem forced or artificial like some of his other movies (Scanners, Dead Ringers), but actually comes across as sincere. For a director so consistently concerned with artificial human manipulation, Cronenberg has managed to create a film that is surprisingly genuine; supplying this film with a good dose of what many of his others lack: humanity."

The always enjoyable Jeff Goldblum shines in a career-defining role, while sultry Geena Davis proves she can be more than just eye-candy. The concept of disfiguring illness and mad science experiments gone awry have been utilized in genre films before to varying degrees of success. Cronenberg's films, however, are always much deeper than their initial face value, and The Fly is certainly no exception. It is the agonizingly, realistic, well-paced transformation sequences that cement the film in the minds of viewers and film historians alike. By depicting the devastating after-effects of Seth Brundle's abuse of his own genius, whilst in a jealous rage over Davis' character, we as an audience can feel for ourselves the pain and mental anguish exhibited by Goldblum at his body's ultimate betrayal. When we, as a species, create for ourselves (whether through cultural choices or imposed and regimented political structures) an environment where the value of our own Humanity is negligible, then we cease to be Human at all. In fact, we become a form of contagion. A master germ of hellish intent and purpose. The mutation has begun, and everyone's invited to the party.

","I watched this movie on TV, not really knowing much about it but by the sound of it, it was a horror film. I love Jeff Goldblum, he's gorgeous, he's tall, he's built like a God, great actor, etc. and I love Geena Davis as well. So naturally I enjoyed the first 40 minutes to an hour of this movie. Jeff Goldblum plays the quirky yet lovable scientist who is on the verge of the greatest discovery of the 20th century, teleportation. Geena Davis is the journalist who becomes interested in his projects and realizes it has much potential. They fall for each other, but her ex-boyfriend who happens to be the editor of her profession, tries to intervene. I found the first half of the movie to have a different feel, almost like a romance. But I knew that this could not and would not last just from the title of the movie. I love Jeff Goldblum, and of course enjoyed seeing him nude in many scenes, as well as in his skivvies...hey it's as close to full frontal nudity I'll get in this movie! Ahem, anyway, then the movie gets really gross really fast. Geena notices he has some weird hairs growing on his back. He becomes less mellow and very high-strung. She is not pleasing him sexually, as he can last much longer than she can (my utter fantasy, without the morphing into a fly part). He becomes stronger and more agile. Then the creepy stuff begins (if you don't count the baboon inside-out). He arm wrestles a guy until the guy's arm bone breaks. (Gross). He uses canes and his hands are emitting pus-like substances. Geena meanwhile doesn't see him for a while. When she does, he is utterly grotesque, looks like he was in an acid accident, and vomits on his food to eat it (I almost lost MY food while watching this, so sudden and disgusting!) Then she feels sorry for him and tries to help him. I must admit I stopped watching at this point so I guess I really have no place writing a review. I will say though, that i did tune in to see more horrific stuff, and if you've already seen it you know what it is, and if not, just read the parental guide on this website. Basically, he morphs into a humanoid fly to the point that he just wants to die (if it were me I'd have just ended it much sooner) and Geena's character shoots its head off with a shotgun after an attempt to reverse the transformation failed. It is horrifying, sad, and disgusting. It makes me feel so sick and sad inside, but the good thing is that it is so far from reality that it is hard to relate to.<br/><br/>The beginning was more interesting and enjoyable in my opinion but I love to see Jeff Goldblum...like I said.' It's a ""classic"" remake, and it stands alone well without having seen the first one with Vincent Price.<br/><br/>But it is quite intense and gross at the end. I would recommend for people like me to just watch the first half or so, and then be done with it."

It then becomes more and more ludicrous and all logic is tossed aside, even if one accepts the basic premise of the story. While the horror was suggestive in the original film, here everything is explicit and it's not even horror. Cronenberg seems far less interested in horror than in grossing out the audience.

At first he uses food items or animals, but one night out of anger he dares himself to go through, which he does successfully.  Unaware to him was that a fly was in the booth with him and their genes get spliced together causing him to slowly turn into a big bug.  We watch him deal with the sadness of seeing his life dramatically change and how he loses the love of his sympathetic girlfriend (Davis).  You'll really pull for this guy, hoping he finds the cure and can reverse things.  But just as you think hes about to in the films climax, he turns psycho and does something so unbelievably cruel, that he turns into the bad guy and you say screw his cure, let em die.  Thats when he gets ahold of John Getz's character, who is trying to rescue Davis, and vomits acid on his hand, melting it in a truly disgusting, disturbing sequence. We have to listen to Getz scream in pain for some 45 seconds (at least) until his hand is reduced to a stump.  Goldblum sets him down and just when you think thats it...he vomits on Getz foot, dismembering it from his leg!  You think 'why the hell was that necessary?' until you remember David Cronenberg, who likes to torture his characters, co-wrote and directed the film.  Only undamaged thing to the film was the great, creepy Howard Shore score.  But thats what I meant when I said one scene killed the whole film for me.  And if youre like me, you'll be glad when Davis................."

","There hasn't been quite as difficult a film to review as ""The Fly"" in a long, long while. I quite enjoyed many aspects of the film, but there were some elements that seemed to be lacking. While the evolution from man to fly was interesting, there were so many in-between subjects that seemed to slow down the film quite a bit. The entire tale seemed a bit...well...fake. Although that may be the idea.<br/><br/>It is, of course, a retelling of the 1958 classic of the same name, which was a bit tongue-in-cheek and ten times more corny than David Cronenberg's 1986 remake, which seems to take itself a bit too heavy at times. The 1986 version is a very, very gory film. Imagine the abilities of a giant man-fly who spews a decomposing acid from his mouth in order to turn his prey into liquid so he can then drink them. If that sounds a bit uncomfortable for you, ""The Fly"" is not your movie. But this will enthuse die-hard gore fans, the type of fans who like gore in their stories more than the story itself.<br/><br/>
I liked the setup. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a socially outcast scientist, who - like in all mad scientist movies - has managed to make an amazing machine that thousands of scientists combined couldn't even begin to create. But he can, because he's the Mad Scientist. When Ronnie (Geena David), a reporter for Particle magazine, is shown his newest invention, she decides to devote her life to chronicling the events and experiments of Brundle, in hopes of writing a book when it is all over and done and exploiting him for all he is worth.<br/><br/>You see, Brundle has created something marvelous: A giant, designer phone booth, a.k.a. a ""transporter,"" which can transport ""non-animate objects"" from one phone booth to another. It is run by a large computer console which has a large LCD interface, contains extra-large font (just in case the scientists don't have good eyes), and can solve complex algorithms like, ""What is two plus two?"" and so on and so forth. There are two large pods: One the subject goes into, and another the subject is transported to through a series of connecting wires along the floor (consider it a large fax machine). And just like in all mad scientist movies, the mad scientist, frustrated that his machine isn't working correctly (as seen in any movie about mad scientists with never-before-seen creations), decides to try it out himself, and whaddaya know, it works (just his luck). Brundle gets transported from one pod to another. But when Brundle gets transported, so does a small fly that has sneaked into the teleporter. The computer is programmed to transport one being, it has no idea what to do with the leftovers, so it combines them together. After the fusion process is complete, Brundle is no longer Brundle. He is ""Brundlefly,"" part-man, part-fly. Over the weeks to come, Brundle's fingernails fall off, he gains incredible strength and energy, and he starts to grow strange, black hairs over his body.<br/><br/>Ronnie is skeptical about it all, she gets the hairs analyzed and comes to face the facts: They aren't human. She tries to tell Seth but at this time has has no idea the fly was ever in the machine. ""You're jealous!"" he yells at her, only to turn around and look in the mirror and realize something is wrong with his face. He's ugly. Well, uglier than he used to be.<br/><br/>
This is a very basic update of the cliched Mad Scientist tale. After Ronnie realizes she is pregnant with Brundlefly's offspring, she tries to have an abortion, but Brundlefly leaps through a glass window (he is now super-fly, despite the unheard fact that flies are weaker than humans), picks her up, and carries her off into the night sky, trying to preserve his baby. A giant fly crawling skyscrapers with a woman in his arms? ""King Fly"" would be a better title for this movie.<br/><br/>The ending is extremely predictable, not to mention darn (stero)typical. How many times have we seen the heroine in danger from a mutating monster bent on destroying her? Too much, that's how much.<br/><br/>David Cronenberg is a talented director, it seems, but he relies too much on gore and faked romance to carry the story, rather than a strong narrative. The beginning setup was fun - it showed a Mad Scientist with a bit more depth, a Mad Scientist who seemed to have a bit more backdrop to him than the usual over-achiever-scientist-turned-freak. But alas, the end resorted to gore, gore, and more gore. You could call it an homage to the classics. I call it crap.<br/><br/>I enjoyed much of ""The Fly,"" but there were certain elements I couldn't get around. The screenplay seemed forced in certain areas, as well as the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. No sparks flew at all. Why would a woman like her want a geeky scientist like him? Ironically they were married in real life during the filming of this movie. The horror.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" spawned a camp sequel directed by the creature effects artist on both films, Chris Walas. I enjoyed the second film more, I think, because I expected something horrible and found the film to be fun. I expected a lot from ""The Fly"" and got nothing in return. I liked the gore, but it seemed to be the only thing going for it by the end of the film. Show me a film with more gore than ""The Fly"" and I'll show you a puddle of vomit.<br/><br/>2.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

","I´m a big Cronenberg connoseur and have seen all his work. This one, his commercial succes, and most popular movies has a major flaw. The acting of Jeff Goldblum.

Somehow Goldblum just doesn´t fit in a horror-sci-fi Cronenberg picture and not surprisingly they have never attempted to repeat the ""succes"". Although very 80s and impressive for its time I think this movie is a big compromise with Cronenbergs ideals. I think his early and late work (especially ""Videodrome II - Existenz"") is the best. ""Spider"" and ""Madame Butterfly"" was interesting too (notice the references to insects). Insects are rather interesting, I agree. This fly just don´t fly. Brundle fly."
"jboothmillard","9","1","10","14 July 2005"," The Fly
","The original 1950's gave us a good concept, but this remake from cult director David Cronenberg (Scanners, Videodrome) is much more superior, giving us much more fear about the world of science. Basically brilliant and eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) invites journalist (though he doesn't know that at first) Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) to see his scientific discovery. He has created ""Telepods"", capable of ""teleportation"", the disintegration of an object from one pod and reintegrating it to the second pod. She is desperate to write a story about this, he objects at first, but allows her to build on the story while he tries to perfect the machine to transport living things. It takes a while to get there, Seth and Veronica get closer in the process, but the solution is found and a baboon is ""teleported"" successfully. When Seth gets jealous of Veronica, suspecting her of being with her boss and ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans (John Getz), alone he decides to go ahead and transport himself (filming it for Veronica) from pod to pod, not realising a common house fly is inside with him. The ""teleportation"" is successful, but as a few days go by, Veronica knows that Seth is changing, with his newfound abilities, and peculiar hairs on his back, which she takes to be analysed, they are found to be insect! Seth shouts for her to leave, but it becomes more obvious to him something worse, with his fingernails falling off, he investigates his ""teleportation"", that is when he discovers the fly with him in the pod, and that his DNA and that of the insect have been spliced. A few weeks later, Seth finally calls Veronica to come and see him, he has become a hideous mutated creature, ""Brundlefly"" he calls himself, that can climb on walls on ceiling, vomit to break down its food, and it is only going to continue until he becomes something else. While Seth's body falls apart he collects his body parts, or ""relics"" as he calls them, and he tries to find a solution to become human again, Veronica meanwhile finds out that she is pregnant, she knows it was after the ""teleportation"" and she wants an abortion. Seth of course finds this out and kidnaps Veronica, not only to save the baby, but to use her in the way he has found to be human again, splicing himself with her. It is just before doing this that Seth finally falls apart completely, his skin sheds to reveal the large fly creature beneath. In the end Stathis destroys the pod Veronica is in, the creature is teleported, the result of the fusion being that he has been spliced with the pod itself, Veronica aims the gun to kill the creature, but cannot bring herself to kill her lover, but the creature encourages her and after hesitation she does shoot and kill it. Cronenberg cameos as the Gynecologist in the nightmare about Veronica giving birth to a giant maggot. Goldblum and Davis give very good performances, and the story is very well made, but I think most people remember this film for the gory and visceral material. You are not far from seeing Goldblum fall apart and become more repulsive (personality included), with great music from Howard Shore (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), brilliant direction from Cronenberg, and superb award winning special effects make-up, this is a must see horror film. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Very, very good!"

Geena Davis is a bit wavy but she has an infectious ease and some real standout punchy believable moments.<br/><br/>The emphasis on building character makes for lovely little moments of intimacy; the scene in the market with the jewellery callback where he tells her he loves her is a particularly memorable moment.<br/><br/>Cronenberg places his leads in scenes and environments that feel very realistic and believable, the bar, the diner, the Party, it all helps sell the realism inbetween the gonzo parts.

It's Masterful, this sort of sad, smart homunculus emerges. With rip roaring effects, Cronenberg's typical steady eye and some brilliant music, The Fly is clearly a classic that holds up completely.<br/><br/>It's got its share of problems; The accelerated romance between leads is symptomatic of those cut scenes. And we spend way too much time with that smug irredeemable yuppie sex pest for ages.<br/><br/>So the economical theatre feel makes the film easy to rewatch but also makes the work feel slight, with no real reason to go reaching for it regularly.

The accident that causes the transformation is somewhat different but ultimately the same results. Goldblum was a poor choice as the main actor. He sounds the same in every movie that he is in. He throws around a tirade of 'sophisticated'/'science' words to make the pseudo-intellectuals think that he is smart and the movie is cutting edge. Goldblum is just mechanical, he does not act well.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","0","1","20 June 2016"," Excellent performances, scripting, make-up effects and direction make this a very enjoyable - if a little off-putting (not for the squeamish) - film.
","'The Fly' is one of the rare examples of a remake that matches, and perhaps even surpasses, the quality of the original. This is helped by the fact that David Cronenberg's film is very different to Kurt Neumann's 1958 classic; it is darker, more realistic and essentially a tragedy in nature. Both of the movies are loosely based on George Langelaan's short story of the same name, though the 50s version follows the story a lot more closely than the 80s one. In this version, Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle - a reclusive scientist who invents a teleportation device. Throughout the course of the film, Brundle begins to transform into a human-fly hybrid (whereas Neumann's feature had the scientist's head and arms replaced entirely with that of a fly). The film is probably remembered most for it's body-horror elements, which are all extremely well executed, but at it's heart it is a character study and an allegory for disease - especially something terminal. Alongside the physical transformation, it depicts a slow decent into madness; a man losing his humanity to become an insect, on the inside and out, perhaps being punished for attempting to change the laws of nature.<br/><br/>One of the film's biggest strengths is the fact that Brundle is a very sympathetic character, one that truly doesn't deserve what happens to him. The audience is never excited to see the horror, never wants to watch this man suffer; you really feel empathetic towards him, and want everything to be okay. A combination of a great script and a fantastic performance by Goldblum make this possible, building a character you honestly care about: this is why the film works so well. The characters never feel written, instead coming across as real human beings caught in a terrible situation. The story is actually very sad, and set-up to mimic a Shakespearean tragedy. A focus on creating empathy for the characters sets this film apart from others in the genre. On top of the great acting, the title character is brought to life with outstanding make-up effects - which landed Chris Walas and Stephen Dupuis and Oscar, and deservedly so. The prosthetics and animatronic puppets blend seamlessly into the live-action elements, and are both believable and highly grotesque. A stand out effect is Brundlefly's final transformation - which is extremely gruesome and, frankly, quite disturbing. The effects are definitely up there with the best of the 80s, perhaps even of all time, sitting alongside other incredible work such as that found in John Carpenter's 'The Thing.'<br/><br/>There are only a couple of issues I had with the film. I'll start with a couple of minor ones first; John Getz's character is slightly annoying, and doesn't really have much of an arc - he also bizarrely changes personality towards the end of the movie just to suit the plot, and there's a weirdly out-of-place dream sequence that breaks the flow of the film. The main problem I had with the film is the fact that it suddenly skips a chunk of 4 weeks (in the movie's time-frame), a leap that's very jarring and only explained through a fairly clunky line of exposition. It is only separated by a short fade too, a technique used several times in the film when it doesn't skip any time, which serves to make the transition even more unnatural and confusing. It feels as though the missed period of time would have been interesting. I get the sense that it was skipped because the character's transformation was happening more gradually and Cronenberg didn't want the audience to get bored (which I doubt would've happened); it may also have been to save the special effects department some time, since they were working to a very tight schedule. The skip doesn't ruin the film, and may even help it's already quick and efficient pacing, but a couple of extra scenes wouldn't have gone amiss.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Fly' is a great piece of cinema full of excellent and disturbing body-horror elements as well as rounded and sympathetic characters caught in a compelling situation. The film is a poignant one, centering around themes of illness, inevitability, nature, unwarranted suffering, science and tragedy; excellent performances, scripting, make-up effects and direction make this a very enjoyable - if a little off-putting (not for the squeamish) - film. 7/10"

It leads up to the big reveal of the monster at the end. Also, it has greatly developed characters. The movie does a great job making us sympathize with Brundle and at the end, it contains a tragic ending which works so well because we can't help but feel sorry for Brundle after seeing what he's been through. It's pretty hard to watch but it's fitting.<br/><br/>The special effects look phenomenal and despite being almost 30 years old, they still look gruesome today. Few movie monsters are as disturbing to look at as this one. I once thought that The Thing (1982) had great effects for its time (which it does) but this movie clearly has put as much effort into making the effects as gruesome and realistic as possible.<br/><br/>But I didn't like how the movie started off slow. It took half an hour for Brundle to first get infected. I get that the movie was trying to set up the characters (and it succeeded in doing so) but the first half hour felt much slower then the rest of the film. It should have been cut down a bit. However, the other hour of the film which follows is well-done and it had great buildup and tension.<br/><br/>Despite a slow start, The Fly is a very well-done movie which has strongly developed characters. Its effects are disgusting and realistic and they still hold up today. Its ending is very tragic and it gets me every time. If you don't mind gore then I strongly recommend this film."

","A clever example of science-fiction & unsettling work of horror, The Fly tells the story of Seth Brundle; a brilliant but eccentric scientist who is near a revolutionary breakthrough as his teleportation machine is near completion. Earlier only able to teleport inanimate objects, he finally is able to send through living objects from one pod to another. But while he is testing the machine on himself, a housefly manage to enter the pod & what comes out from the other pod after teleportation isn't completely Brundle.<br/><br/>This is the first film by David Cronenberg that I've seen so I had no idea what to expect. And as the film ended, I was left astounded by what I've seen. Cronenberg's direction is absolutely fabulous & the manner in which he has structured & progressed the plot from start to finish is amazing to observe. The screenplay is very much focused on Brundle & thanks to Jeff Goldblum's superb performance, he's able to connect with us much before his accident because of which his character arc feels less appalling & far more tragic.<br/><br/>The performances by Geena Davis & John Getz are no slouch either but this is Jeff Goldblum's film all the way. Cinematography & editing plays its part well but it's the make-up department that deserves the most applause for its equally shocking & impressive design of the creature & Brundle's gradual transformation. And the music by Howard Shore leaves no stone unturned in turning this cinema into a potential nightmare. On an overall scale, The Fly is one of the best films of its genre that even today remains as disturbing an experience as it was during its time of release.<br/><br/>A must for fans of horror, a must for fans of science-fiction, a must for fans of David Cronenberg & a must for anyone who is looking for a cinema that would make them skip their meals for a day or two, The Fly is highly recommended.

","Before watching this flick, I was well aware of how nasty it would be, and boy, people weren't wrong on that. I admit I closed my eyes in the vomiting scenes. Seth Brundle invents a teleportation machine and tests himself on the invention, but due to Murphy's law existence, a fly accidentally goes with him in the test, turning him into a Flyman. Although the premise is a little different of mainly superhero stories, I found it undeniable to state it follows the same pattern of that stories/films. A good aspect about this movie is that main character isn't a Hollywood heartbreaker; he's a simple guy who ends up becoming a monster. The fluids coming out of his body are really really nasty, as EVERYONE has already said, so I won't be repetitive on that. Veronica Quaife, on the other hand, doesn't show much incitement in her acting, but she's at least average. In the end, even thought ""The Fly"" is a remake, it has a great story with a convincing outcome, reason why it's a worth watching film anyways."

Goldblum, fantastic here, plays an out there scientist, Seth Brundle, who lives in a loft downtown, has thirty of the same set of suits that could do with a good clean, two baboons, his own real cappuccino expresso with the eagle on top, and to top that off, these two intriguing telepods, fridge like contraptions, or the new mode in tall washing dryers, that take up the centre of his dark moody pad. He runs experiments in them, transporting items, etc, from one telepod to another with not always successful results. Here to witness his experiments is a reporter, Ronnie-Geena (Ms soon to be Mrs Goldblum) Davis who becomes his love interest. One night, when Ronnie leaves Seth for a few hours, to officially end it with her ex and arrogant boss (John Getz, the character actor, again great as he's been in other films) Seth, orders home delivery Chinese, gets drunk, and makes a fatal mistake. He goes inside the telepod, only a fly gets in there with him. From here, we like Ronnie, notice changes in Seth, not just physical, as he horribly undergoes the slow and ugly disintegration of a man, as if a fly. Not only that, Ronnie has got pregnant, where Seth and her did it that night, after he made the transformation, where Ronnie now knowing the full story of Seth's fate, must decide whether to keep the newborn which leads to the culmination of our tale, amidst some nice bloody bits of violence that run at occasional tides throughout this lovable horror flick. Goldblum I must say, with his long hairdo, that's unlike Goldblum, really impresses, in still one of his best performances while he has great support. He really has his moments too. It's poster design plus title, really stands out too. Special effects are fantastic. Horror flicks like this, made the eighties what they truly were."

","Seth Brundle, a brilliant but eccentric scientist attempts to woo investigative journalist Veronica Quaife by offering her a scoop on his latest research.<br/><br/>The field of matter transportation, which against all the expectations of the scientific establishment have proved successful. <br/><br/>Up to a point. Brundle thinks he has ironed out the last problem when he successfully transports a living creature. <br/><br/>But when he attempts to teleport himself a fly enters one of the transmission booths, and Brundle finds he is a changed man.<br/><br/>With this, Videodrome, and Dead Ringers, Cronenberg made some of the best body horror movies of the eighties, and this is probably is most mainstream and accessible. It's not our typical Cronenberg movie, but it still has his brilliant traits we appreciate from the man.<br/><br/>The film deals with body image and peoples perception of how they looked, this was the eighties, and vanity was rife, and ironically it is shown from the point of view of a man who wears the same clothes.<br/><br/>It also deals with disease, and it could be perceived that Brundles transformation is a metaphor for AIDS, as again in the eighties, people were scare mongering how you could get it from sharing a towel etc.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful success of horror and funnily enough for the director, blockbuster. Goldblum and Davis are great as the leads,many it's took me at least three viewings to realise what an integral part Getz is to the film, he is truly a pivotal part of the film when you look beyond the yuppie, chauvinistic facade.<br/><br/>If you like horror movies, and want to get into Cronenbergs work, this is a perfect place to start, and it will prepare you for his other works."

","I find that the story, even though odd, flows excellently and makes sense in it's own weird way. The set up how Seth was going to turn into a monster was a smart move, as you can completely relate to his disappointment when he thinks Veronica is going back to Stathis. If I would have a minor complaint is that they didn't really involve any doctor to take a look at Seth, but it could be explained to the fact that Seth knew it was impossible to reverse the process.<br/><br/>The characters are so well made, I really feel like they are real people. Seth is quirky and lovable, I think Jeff Goldblum was an excellent choice and he also acts great when Seth changes personality. The fact that Seth admits to being scared and begging Veronica to help him is very touching, nowadays you'd never expect some macho-man lead to ever show this emotion. Veronica is really sweet, but I also like that she is confident and doesn't take BS from others. I love how Stathis is a jerk and generally unlikable in the beginning of the movie, but in the end his concern and love for Veronica makes him risk his own life to save her. He could also had chosen to just back out and weasel away when things got difficult, yet he sticks around for her and supports her emotionally without trying to make advances on her. How many people nowadays can you depend on would do this much with no obvious instant reward handed to them? It's a great character development on someone who isn't even the main character of the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are great for its time. Seth really looks revolting and some effects are just nasty. The baboon scene is disgusting, but horror movies are supposed to be horrifying! If I want fairy dust and happy outcomes I'll watch a Disney movie instead. And this movie truly feels like a horror movie. It doesn't end with Disney magic sprinkled all over it and ugly people aren't the only ones dying. I loathe horror movies that ends happy. This one really puts them to shame. The ending is extremely unhappy and it has me in tears each time. This is how horror movies should be. When I first watched the movie, I expected Seth to be turned back into a human and kill the ""evil"" Stathis. That is how it would have ended if this movie was made in 2012 with pretty actors. So imagine my surprise! And any movie that affects me so much it has me crying really deserves a gold star, because I can be really cold and laugh hysterically when I watch characters die on screen."

"gigan-92","10","0","1","23 May 2012"," David Cronenberg Horror Masterpiece
","One of the few and great I never tire of. I find this movie quite flawless, and for a number of reasons. First off, it took a classic from (I've seen both the Vincent Price original and its sequel) and refurbished it for another time. I still love the originals, but the remake is different enough to truly stand on its own. Secondly, casting was first rate. Geena Davis IS awesome and yes even the at-times pure douche John Getz is just great. And Jeff Goldblum, I can hardly muster the words. Behind the make-up and off, every time I feel for his character. The story has the feel of a great tragedy, telling the tale of what could've been.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite remarkable and remain to this day unchallenged if you ask me. No amount of CGI can beat the amount of effort put into that make-up, the animatronics, or the wall-crawling scenes. Owning the DVD, I pop this in every now and then and the sight of 'Brundle Fly 'still evokes quite a bit of fear in me. And topping it all off is Howard Shore's incredible score. More and more I'm seeing how awesome of a compose he is. Check this one out!!"
"mazec666","10","0","1","11 May 2012"," ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""
","From the striking opening credits sequence to the emotional finale, David Cronenberg (SCANNERS, VIDEODROME) transforms a standard '50s B-movie into a dark, contemporary tale of playing god with devastating results.<br/><br/>Long before becoming a pop-cultural punch line, Jeff Goldblum brings his twitching expressions into the role of Seth Brundle. The reclusive, but eccentric scientist has conducted a teleportation experiment in what is considered to be the coolest apartment loft in the history of cinema. Until one day, Brundle's human molecules accidentally blend in with an ordinary fly while he is inside the booth! <br/><br/>Goldblum and then-squeeze Geena Davis shared plenty of memorable chemistry together in the much-talked about scenes in the movie. Two scenes in particular: the Poetry of Steak and the Sugar-Rush Cappuccino scenes. One-time Coen brothers regular John Getz is an unforgettable riot as Davis' ex-boyfriend/editor. I wouldn't consider him to be a comic relief by all means, but whenever he came on screen the film's black humor comes in full form.<br/><br/>The groundbreaking make-up effects from Chris Walas are outstandingly frightening to the ninth or possibly tenth degree. There is a saying in film circles. If someone is going to remake a film, do it differently and that's what Cronenberg did with THE FLY.<br/><br/>When watching this movie, just stop and think to yourself, ""Be afraid. Be very afraid."""

","Classic 80's gross-out horror with an analytical science fiction twist. I admire the way this skips the typical pleasantries and dives right into the action, omitting any back-story to commence with the freak show everyone in the audience came to see; expertly streamlined, it's non-stop substance without a dull moment. Despite the occasional campy slip-up, the primary storyline has actually aged surprisingly well and still plays as an eye-widening exhibit of suspense and repulsion. Jeff Goldblum, with his quick lip, piercing eyes and slightly inhuman appearance, was seemingly born for his role as the bright, socially awkward science geek-turned guinea pig that sparks the entire affair. Despite a throwaway evil ex-boyfriend angle that lingers around its fringes and a title that shamelessly gives away its biggest moment, this remains an unpredictable thrill ride of an experiment with a one-track mind, a few serious questions about the rate of scientific progress and some great visual effects."

","Sciency drama-horror which appeared in the television line-up on Sunday night. It's a film which I've been eager to see for a fair while, because the concept is so unique and unpleasant, and I was fairly impressed with it, I must say. Not only is it comparably disgusting in a way which can easily be compared to modern gorefests such as Hostel and The Human Centipede, it also carries with it an emotional sub-plot which neither of said films can claim.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum is an actor whom I've always had my doubts about, but he certainly nailed the stereotypical role of mad scientist here. He doesn't overplay his character in the slightest, and the viewer is left with a very real and lasting impression. This story is predictable in places, but there's enough gore, drama and sub-plots to keep everybody entertained, I feel.<br/><br/>And let us face it... who doesn't want to see a man slowly transforming into a fly?"

It combines elements from that and turns it into a very mature and dark tale. It is not for the faint of heart. What makes this film work so well is how it was made and all in all everything just worked perfectly. It effects us the way it should. It shows us how shallow the world is and that in some ways we are all fly's on a wall, or beasts in some ways.

But after watching this, it altered my vision of the 80's. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, and the overall movie is fantastic! I never would've expected this. This film reminds me, and a lot of other people, of Black Swan. These two films can create a sub-genre known as ""body-torture films"" as they both display the transformation into.. well something not human. Out of this and Black Swan, I would definitely check this one out. The film has has lots of gore for you easily-disgusted people out there. Not that bad. The film isn't just about a man turning into a fly, it also has drama which makes it have a rather slow build-up. Not a problem, the film knows this and masters it.

","David Cronenberg is well-known for his incredibly repulsive films, and this one has to his most revolting film he's ever done! You really need to see ""The Fly"" to truly believe it. If you don't cringe at least once then something is really wrong with you. I don't want to sound negative about this film because a man turning into a human fly isn't going to be a pretty experience to behold so I really admire it's sheer power to disgust, and for a film that could've gone the wrong way so easily, this is really a masterpiece.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" could've ended up really cheesy. Jeff Goldblum could've gotten into his telepod with a fly in it and come out immediately sprouting wings or having big bug-eyes (like the original) but instead the genius lies in the way the film slowly burns as we watch a brilliant man turn into something so unrecognisable. ""The Fly"" could've also fallen short if it copied the original which so many remakes tend to do when there's no point! Nope, ""The Fly"" perfects the original by about 10 miles, by taking a whole new direction.<br/><br/>What really makes ""The Fly"" is its hideous make-up and special effects they are truly gut-wrenchingly A-mazing! To be honest I think it would be a crime if it didn't get an Oscar for them because even now they look amazing. I can see that if ""The Fly"" was remade again today (I wouldn't be surprised) hideous (not in a good way) CGI effects would pollute the screen and take over from the incredible story. I know I sound like some grumpy middle-aged man when I talk about the effects of today but I'm not one yet.<br/><br/>David Cronenberg's directing is also really good! He makes everything seem so positive at first and it's the way David handles the gradual changes in his personality and appearance and the way it effects the people around him. This also goes for the screenplay which is also written by David, as it's equally fantastic and handled with precise care. The finale has to be one of the most mind-blowing I've ever seen, it is just completely over-loaded with suspense and terrifying special effects. It also makes you feel sorry for the fly in the end; even though it's hard to tell if he's a villain or still the hero now.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" is a must see. Not just for horror fans (although it helps) but for everybody. It's handled with perfection and style with strong performances by Jeff and the other woman who was in ""BeetleJuice"" was OK as well. ""The Fly"" has everything: Great characters, a great plot, more than great special effects and brantastic direction. It'll have you buzzin'!"

","I wasn't especially taken with this after the first half hour or so. There seemed to be a vaguely comic element involved that wasn't fitting - revolving mostly around the character of scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum.) For those first few minutes the character wasn't working for me. And then, somehow, it came together. Goldblum turned out to be very good and very convincing in the lead role as the scientist who accidentally ""teleports"" himself along with a housefly, and finds their genes ""spliced"" - after which he begins to slowly mutate into a human- fly hybrid. <br/><br/>This, of course, is based on the 1958 movie of the same name - a movie that I wasn't especially blown away by so I went into this wondering why a remake was called for. But this is one of those rare remakes that are substantially better than the original. I particularly liked the hybrid idea. In the original movie we got a rather silly concept of a human with a fly's head and a fly with a human's head. Splicing them together as one creature was a good move, and created an increasing ""creepiness"" as Brundle gradually transforms. Genna Davis was pretty good as Veronica, the reporter who wants Brundle's story and then falls in love with him, but it really was Goldblum who made this work.<br/><br/>David Cronenberg directed. I've not been an especially big fan of Cronenberg's style over the years - and at times this is very much an Cronenberg-style movie - but I would say that of the Cronenberg movies I've seen, this may well be the strongest. It's a good, suspenseful and at times truly creepy movie. (7/10)"

","Seth Brundle is a young scientist who wants to perfect teleportation. Veronica, a journalist, is there to help take down his progress(an early case of taping everything that goes on, including the worst moments, perhaps especially them), and the two have a romance. One night, he tries to transport himself through the machine. And something begins to change. He soon learns that there was a fly there with him, and he's now transforming(and it is terrifying to witness) into... what, exactly? This is not a direct remake of the original 50's one(that I haven't watched, but I understand it's a pretty straightforward creature feature from the period), it's a rethinking of it. DNA was common knowledge, and other traits from the time this was made were incorporated. As he alters before our very eyes, many comparisons can be made, a lot can be taken from this. He goes back and forth between trying to accept it, even asking others for help, and refusing to see any negatives to what's happening. This could be seen as a metaphor for a deadly illness, a drug addiction or even simply the process of aging, and as he articulates what is going on inside of him and his reactions to it and we see the impact on the relationship between the two, this gets to be about so much more than it seems to be on the outside(other than that, as a ""human"" monster flick, this does utilize primal fears). Through the love triangle, sex and intimacy is seen to be potentially dangerous. We only really have three characters(her former boyfriend and current employer is the third), and they are credible and well-acted. Geena is cute and interesting, and complex beyond what ""the girl in a horror movie"" usually is allowed to be. She and Jeff work well together, it's not surprising that they were a real-life couple. The humor is great. This is grand, and the operatic score fits perfectly. The FX are amazing and hold up incredibly well. This is not one that will leave your mind sometime soon, for several reasons. There is disgusting, gory, violent and immensely disturbing content in this. The Cinema Reserve 2-Disc DVD comes with an interesting, informational and funny director's commentary track, a 2 hour and 42 minute documentary, one at 12 minutes length(both of them I will review on their own pages here on the site), one that has a 7 minutes running time, 16 minutes of deleted/extended scenes, 7 and a half minutes of film tests, 4 minutes of interviews, trailers and TV spots, still galleries, two screenplays(the initial one and David's rewrite), magazine articles and the short story that this was based upon(a decent read, takes you about an hour... I can imagine that it could be pretty easily adapted into the Vincent Price take on the concept, if you know what I mean). Yes, if you like extras, this is well worth the purchase. I recommend this to any fan of Cronenberg, and anyone who can handle how far this goes and want a brilliant allegorical tale. 8/10"

","This film is what made the world notice Cronenberg's genius at direction. It truly stands miles apart from the rest of his work.<br/><br/>It is a fresh remake of the older 1958 film The Fly, based on George Langelaan's short story The Fly. You should see the 1958 film before you see this film. There is also a sequel Return of the Fly (1959).<br/><br/>However back to the 1986 film. This story starts at an science convention where Veronica Quaife (played by Geena Davis), a journalist, meets Dr. Seth Brundle (played by Jeff Goldblum) who is a scientist and inventor. He goes in a conversation with Veronica saying to her that he has an invention that will ""change the world as we know it"". <br/><br/>Veronica is intrigued. She drives Seth back to his apartment where he shows her his invention, a set of Telepods connected to each other. She however thinks that Seth is bluffing and that the Telepods are fake. Seth proceeds to show Verconica a demonstration of the Telepods true purpose. He asks Veronica for a personal object. She offers one of her stockings. He places it in a Telepod and activates a computer program to begin a teleportation sequence. <br/><br/>He tells Veronica to keep an eye on the Telepod with the stocking in it. There is a flash of light and the the stocking miraculously disappears from sight. Veronica still thinks Seth is playing a game with her. Seth then diverts Veronica's attention to the other telepod where he retrieves her stocking. <br/><br/>Veronica is amazed and begins asking a flurry of questions. How did Seth keep his invention from the world? How was the machine built and its workings? Seth tells Veronica not to write anything until he has fully mastered and corrected all the flaws of his invention.<br/><br/>He tells Veronica that he can only transport inanimate objects. Transporting living organisms leads to their deaths when they are transported through the Telepods due to a defective re-integration process. He claims that the computer becomes ""crazy when handling flesh"". <br/><br/>However he soon finds a way around that flaw with fatal consequences that will change his life and Veronica's forever.<br/><br/>Watch the film to find out more.<br/><br/>Brilliant direction by Cronenberg. The Telepods actually look like a fly's egg. Jeff Goldblum has all the mannerisms of a fly himself with his eye movements. Geena Davis is the sexpot of this film. Cronenberg's films have some allusion to sex in them and this film in no exception. The special make-up effects have to be seen to be believed. The musical score is by the veteran Howard Shore. Outstanding cinematography by Mark Irwin. Creature effects are by the brilliant Chris Walas. <br/><br/>Overall 10/10 for the terrifying conclusion, casting and acting, brilliant special effects, background score and sound effects.<br/><br/>The film has a sequel The Fly 2 (1989) which is a good follow-up in its own right and definitely worth watching for its special effects. It is directed by Chris Walas who did the special effects in The Fly (1986)."
"AnneSLReid","9","0","1","31 May 2010"," Metaphor
","***** WARNING SPOILERS ****** As explained already, ""The Fly"" (1986) is a re-make of the 1958 sci-horror of the same title. However, whilst the earlier film is a simple horror story of a man who (part) mutates into a fly, Cronenberg's version is a much more complex pic that appears to be a metaphor for mental illness more than anything else.<br/><br/>Story focuses on Seth Brundle (Goldblum), a gentle, socially awkward yet genius scientist who is working on a cure for his motion sickness (the latter preventing him from getting out much), in the form of teleportation through telepods. Brundle meets Ronnie (Davis), a journalist, and, keen to find a companion in his work, invites her to his warehouse apartment. Ronnie is immediately intrigued by his work and his boyish charms, and ends up agreeing to record his work to print an article when it is complete. Almost immediately, they begin a love affair.<br/><br/>Their affair is ultimately the making and breaking of Brundle and is the turning point of the film (rather than Brundle's teleportation through the pods). Having previously been a recluse, confined to his apartment, obsessively wearing the same clothes every day (and who considers cheeseburgers and a deluxe coffee-machine to be the sum excitement of his life!), Ronnie's sensual (and almost motherly) love awakens a passion (and conversely a jealousy) in Brundle he has never known before. Indeed, Cronenberg conveys this metaphorically. Brundle cannot teleport flesh (and there is a nasty scene with a baboon when he does) until his love affair with Ronnie - who essentially teaches him ""how to be made crazy by flesh"". This is literally what happens. Brundle realises his missing component, re-programmes his computer and the teleportation is successful.<br/><br/>Whilst his love for Ronnie helps to complete his work, it ultimately destroys him. In a fit of jealousy when she goes away to confront her meddlesome and lecherous ex (Getz), Brundle recklessly teleports himself, not knowing the pod is contaminated with a fly. The insect is obviously another metaphor, otherwise Brundle would have fused with every mite on his body! The telepods are Brundle's only means of leaving his confined existence - a form of deconstruction/reconstruction that fuses him with an insect at genetic level which is at first exhilarating then terrifying. It is from here that (well I believe) the film becomes a metaphor for mental illness. Having lived with someone with bipolar disorder, Brundle's behaviour very much mirrors the symptoms and personality traits: initially, he is sexually insatiable, promiscuous, irritable, unable to sleep, aggressive, speaks too fast, has an almighty God complex and oodles of energy (very much like a high - even to the extent that he craves sweet foods). When Ronnie can't keep up with him, she becomes ""a drag"", who only has a ""basic understanding of the flesh"" - clearly meaning he has ""progressed"" from mere sex to a higher level of consciousness (bipolar sufferers often feel they ""see"" and appreciate life more than others). Inevitably, his actions end their relationship because she doesn't understand him.<br/><br/>Before long, ""the insect"" starts to change him physically as well. He develops skin rashes, his nails, teeth and hair start to drop out and he is unable to eat food (food ""hurts"") - common fears with Anxiety (particularly food intolerances) when the ""high"" starts to wane and the reckless behaviour catches up with the body. What is noticeable is that Cronenberg very much focuses on Brundle's psychological changes before the gruesome physical downfall. There is no scientific explanation of why he physically metamorphs the way he does because it is really not important. Ultimately, his physical and mental state spiral down into something incapacitating (depression) and ugly until he becomes emotionally devoid to the point of dangerous (when the insect is ""awake""). He feels his only option is to merge with Ronnie and their baby, but his attempts at ""the perfect family"" fail. Ultimately, from being at his mental and physical peak, Brundle is left with nothing, marked by the fact that it is the lecherous, ""disgusting"" ex who eventually who steps up to the mark of hero by helping Ronnie with her abortion and saves her at the end.<br/><br/>The poignancy of the film is that Brundle is always alone, no matter what stage he is at, be it reclusive nerd, arrogant genius or horribly disabled. Whilst the brief relationship with Ronnie is both tender and sweet (he even asks if it is a relationship, he is that naive) it is only brief and ultimately the cause of his demise. One can only wish he had never met Ronnie and kept to his caged existence. It shows the frustration of someone who cannot handle ""the flesh"" - i.e. a relationship - who is always relegated to a life alone constantly craving understanding.<br/><br/>My criticism of the film is the amount of gratuitous gore which looks both dated and ludicrous (particularly when she pulls his jaw off) and which distracts from the main theme of the film, to the point that a lot of people don't get it. Also, I felt Ronnie's character was very one-dimensional - ultimately a catalyst for Brundle - although Davis brought a natural, intriguing intelligence to it and did the best she could. Also, the leads' off-screen romance helped a lot with the chemistry between the characters.<br/><br/>A brilliant film that is probably the best so far of conveying the horrors and frustration of a world confined by illness."

","David Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" doesn't really bear that much resemblance to the original 1958 film. Sure, both feature a scientist whose experiments go horribly awry due to the intrusion of a fly but besides that the stories aren't really that similar.<br/><br/>In Cronenberg's version, eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) ends up unwittingly merging himself with a fly at the molecular level. He initially considers it an improvement but as his humanity deteriorates it puts a strain on his relationship with journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis). The script, co-written by Cronenberg, displays his trademark style and has a depth that is unusual for a horror film.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I'm not crazy about Jeff Goldblum in general but I'd have to say that he did a pretty good job here, particularly as the film progressed. Geena Davis is just as impressive (perhaps even moreso) while John Getz is solid in a smaller but pivotal role.<br/><br/>Cronenberg's direction is well-handled and the film generally looks attractive throughout. The visual effects are convincing while the makeup effects were impressive enough to result in an Oscar win. Howard Shore's score isn't bad either but not especially noteworthy.<br/><br/>Overall, Cronenberg's version of ""The Fly"" is a well-made science fiction/horror film with more verve than most of its kind. Both this and the original version of the film are well worth watching."

However, I was somewhat let down by the ending of this movie.<br/><br/>I still really liked it, but the film had a subtle way about the first two-thirds of the movie that I really appreciated. It was paced perfectly, and it built the sense of unraveling humanity that Goldblum's character experienced very well. However, once the fly itself is up-close and personal on-screen, it lost much of the dramatic gravity it was building. The fly was convincing enough, and the makeup was brilliant, but the film went from very well-made quiet sci-fi thriller to all out monster movie. I know that's what it's supposed to be and all, and it's well done for what it is, but what it started went in a different direction than I am a fan of."

"rooee","7","0","1","12 April 2010"," Bloody (and) Brilliant
","The Fly marks the central point of David Cronenberg's distinguished directorial career so far. He would achieve a certain tabloid notoriety a decade later with the laughable Crash, but this story of loner scientist Seth Brundle's (Jeff Goldblum) fusion with a house fly strikes the perfect balance between Cronenberg's ongoing exploration of squishy body parts and mainstream cinema's demands for high concept genre conventions.<br/><br/>It would first appear that the genre in question is horror. Indeed, many of the final scenes, including the gooey Grand Guignol ending, are straight from the splatter canon. There is method to this madness: Seth is dying - literally falling apart; and the insect in him - brutal, totally without compassion or table manners - is taking over. Off go his ears and out fall his teeth. And yet Brundlefly's heart remains untouched - except, that is, by his writer girlfriend, Ronnie (Geena Davis). Here amongst Chris Walas's fantastic make-up is an old-fashioned Hollywood love story. Perhaps that's why audiences have found The Fly the most accessible of his films: because, whether through straightforward exposition or blood-soaked metaphor, an affecting story of love and jealousy shines through. By the end, you won't be certain you've watched a horror film at all. You may also be convinced that life is a 75-year process of decay, but that's Cronenberg's trick: deep meanings in simple, stark images."

","When hearing or reading about The Fly you will usually hear praise for the special effects, the gore, or maybe even the acting (all praise well deserved). What you probably won't hear about as often, though, is just how absolutely tragic and heart shredding this film is.<br/><br/>The aforementioned gore and special effects really do deserve attention, though. They are still 25 some years later impressive, more so than about 90% of effects today. They are real. They aren't CGI added after the fact, covering up the fact that the actors are interacting with nothing. They are there with the actors, allowing them to see and feel something, and this matters. They also happen to look astounding. When Brundlefly truly emerges at the end it is not only one of the most disgusting moments you will ever see, but it is deeply disturbing on a very intimate level.<br/><br/>That intimacy is because of the actors here. Davis and Goldblum have a real chemistry here that only works to create a deeper connection with these characters. It's not surprising to hear that they were together when this picture was filmed, and it shows on screen. Their love feels real right from the start.<br/><br/>The Fly is a hybrid. Much like the main character, it transforms as the story progresses. First it is a light romance, then slightly comical, then deeply frightening and then finally, extremely sad. In the end the movie balls up all these different aspects and gives the viewer a rush of emotions that is hard not to appreciate. And this is what makes this movie so special. This emotional core is the soul of the movie. It's why the film works. And that's the most shocking thing about this movie. It is more than what most would assume. It is more than most other movies."

","The Fly (1986) 1/3/2010<br/><br/>This film follows my current trend of 80's horror movies and the second David Cronenberg film in a row. He has made most of his films independently and this being a big studio remake was a welcome departure for him. This film is filled with his trademark style of film-making and is a very rare case of a remake being far superior to the original. A sequel was made in the 90's but we can just forget about that one. <br/><br/>Cronenberg's remake stars Jeff Goldblum and Genna Davis, both with embarrassing 80's style hair. Goldblum's hair reminded me of John Stamos's early years on Full House, the thinking mans mullet, you could say. Goldblum's character, Seth Brundle is wild eyed fringe scientist experimenting with teleportation. He meets Davis's character Veronica or Ronnie for short. She is journalist for Particle magazine. They meet at a party put on by Seth's employer. He convinces her to come back to his warehouse laboratory slash studio apartment. He has a few tele-pods that look a little like bee hives, that were constructed for him by different scientists. As he demonstrates he can successfully transport inanimate objects, but when he tries to teleport a baboon, he ends up with a twitching bloody mess.<br/><br/>Goldblum has that wildly energetic personality that translates superbly into his character. When asked why he always wears the same clothes. He states that like Albert Einstein he owns several identical suits of clothes as to not expend any mental energy on what to wear every day. He plays another such eccentric scientist in Spielberg's Jurassic Park. A romantic relationship quickly develops between Seth and Ronnie and she helps him document his experiments on video. <br/><br/>Stathis Borans is Ronnie editor and former love interest. She probably left him because his name is Stathis Borans! He is your average 80's douche bag. He has a manly beard and wears expensive suits. He is not blonde though. Stathis becomes jealous of Ronnie's relationship with Seth and tries taking the teleportation story from her. Jealousy is a big theme in this film as all the characters are envious of each other. <br/><br/>Seth finally makes a breakthrough and is able to fully transport a baboon. Then one night as he starts to fear that Ronnie is cheating on him with Stathis, he get pretty wicked drunk and decides its time to start human trials. This starts a truly horrify string of events that propel the movie all the way to its climax. Seth is successfully transported but their also happen to be a fly in the pod with him. Upon teleporting, the computer fused their DNA and molecules together and while Seth comes out looking normal, there are hideous changes to come. Seth slowly transforms into a human fly hybrid. He has increased energy, stamina, and an insatiable need for sugar. The make-up and visual effects are nothing short of spectacular. The whole process of Seth's transformation is made all the more terrifying in the fact that we like this character and he has done nothing to deserve this or has he? Is this nature's way of telling us not to mess with the natural order of things? Many films have explored the whole science VS nature VS religion theme and The Fly definitely puts in its two cents worth. Ronnie tries to help Brundle Fly, as he now calls himself, but he knows he is doomed. He compares himself to someone that has a terminal disease. To add more insanity to the story, Ronnie finds out she is pregnant and has a dream of giving birth to a giant maggot. The filmmakers then venture off into the pros and cons of abortion, and the value of life. The final confrontation between Ronnie, Stathis & Brundle Fly is equal parts vomit inducing horror and a heart breaking love story. An odd combination for what is a genre defining movie of the decade that was horror."

The effects were excellent for its time, presenting Brundle's descent in frightening and shocking detail. <br/><br/>'The Fly' documents a freak occurrence, a shockingly dramatic spectacle fuelled by one man's nonpareil ambition.

","I finally am able to review this movie now that I'm in my twenties, having watch it again when the special edition DVD came out. I watched it when I was very young, probably about 5 or 6 when my dad rented it and it scared the crap out of me even though I didn't really understand the movie story but still it fitted the genre of horror. My dad loves this movie and he rented it a couple of times in the past and every time he came back with it,just the movie cover ""THE FLY"" was enough to make me avoid it at all costs.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple, an eccentric scientist Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) was frustrated on why his telepods weren't able to teleport life forms. That was until he met the love of his life Veronica Quaife(Geena Davis) whose words inspired him such that he was able to change his program which succeeded in teleporting life forms. Well everything in his mundane life has changed for the better: He found his soul mate and his invention is on its way to becoming part of the nobel prize stage. However jealousy got the better of him and in an attempt to spite Veronica, he entered one of his telepods and did the teleportation without her to witness it. However, he didn't realise that a fly had gotten into the telepod with him and the program has fused his genes with the fly's genes at genetic level.<br/><br/>That's when all the horror starts as he starts mutating more and more into a gigantic fly which Seth himself labelled as ""Brundlefly."" Everything in this film is top notch, from the acting to the props and the story. Jeff Goldblum was able to play Seth Brundle to such a level that you will pity, fear and love him for what he is. Even though you know the ending in which he will die eventually, you will still feel emotions welling up at the end. Geena Davis was also brilliant as Veronica Quaife,the girlfriend who loved Seth so much and struggled when he underwent changes. She tried her best to stay with Seth, however her fear and Seth's insanity was too much for her to handle and she tried to leave him with no avail. Geena's acting of silent fear, desperation and love for seth hit right on the mark. <br/><br/>Of course I couldn't just comment on the acting,the props were also top notched and this was a time when CGI wasn't popular and readily used. The crew really put in a lot of effort into creating brundlefly which you could see towards the ending of the show whereby there was nothing physically human about seth but just a huge monster. I had no idea that it was just a puppet, I thought Jeff Goldblum was in a body suit or something but yeah it was a machine towards the end. Two words for the props: Gory, disgusting.<br/><br/>This film is seriously underrated in IMDb. 7.4/10, are you kidding me?

","At the IFC theater in NYC, there are weekly midnight screenings of Cronenberg movies. I've seen a few, but I haven't really loved any of them. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is not afraid to navigate the extremes of cruelty and kitschy tenderness, but it didn't do a whole lot more than make me laugh and wince a bit. CRASH was very interesting but not fun, and really only memorable for its subject matter- not for any great scenes or performances. DEAD RINGERS really stuck with me, but the movie as a whole is a bit muddled and overlong. And EXISTENZ is ill-conceived Sci-Fi with lots of gore. I walked into last night's midnight screening with nothing more than curiosity, but I'm very glad I went. The film print was grainy but the richness of the colors in the original film more than made up for it. THE FLY is a gory, shocking, confusing movie that truly challenges and rewards the viewer. It challenges the viewer to laugh, cry, and cringe, for there are moments when nothing other than all three are possible. <br/><br/>The movie opens with Brundle meeting journalist Veronica at a scientific convention. With only the minimal dialog necessary, the action begins, as we see Brundle's attempts to teleport objects and Veronica's fascination with the man. We barely get to know the characters before they are in bed together and one of them is doing wild and crazy things with technology, but what is amazing is that, while it all happens so quickly, nothing remains too mysterious. The dialog is all very focused and to the point and Jeff Goldblum as Brundle manages to make even lengthy exposition into entertaining ramblings.<br/><br/>Brundle, even before he becomes a fly, is highly entertaining to watch, and this is key to the movie's success. And his transformation is done extremely well, as he first merely demonstrates a fly-like stamina and agility before he transforms into a confused human insect.<br/><br/>It is not only Brundle's transformation that is disgusting- there is also a brief and surprising scene in which he demonstrates his new insect powers as he breaks an arm wrestler's hand off at a bar. This scene is disgusting and campy, yet it manages to achieve just the right level of shock and hilarity, and it fits with the movie's absurd tone.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie were done at a period which I believe to be the peak of movie special effects, when computer animation was just enabling us to see things that weren't possible, like a human body transforming into a fly, but it wasn't sophisticated or cheap enough for filmmakers to rely on it the entire time. When Brundle is still a human fly, it is done entirely with makeup, which makes it extremely convincing. Today, it would almost definitely be done with CGI, not because it would look better, but merely because it is cheaper and easier. The movie would not be nearly as convincing if it were done with today's effects technology.<br/><br/>And the effects would also not be nearly as impressive if it weren't for the fact that the movie ultimately relies on other things to intrigue us. The effects are so, well, effective, because they really feed our interest. The movie really gets us to ask, ""What will happen to this man as he turns into a fly?"" and builds suspense hanging on that single question, and the effects show us all of the gory details- and the details turn out to be even more gory than we'd imagine.<br/><br/>It was THE FLY that convinced me Cronenberg deserves his good reputation. It's truly one of the great monster movies."

","Horror movies put their audience through a lot. They jump and scream, and their heart races throughout. But, unfortunately, what most horror films lack is characters. They don't usually have a big enough heart, and their characters are all expendable. Whether or not this film fits into the category of horror is debatable, but this story is horrific, and dramatic. It tells us about characters we care about, and puts them through hell. It's as much a drama as a horror film, and the mixture of both is impeccable.<br/><br/>Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is trying to woo magazine reporter Veronica ""Ronnie"" Quaife (Geena Davis). Brundle has an experiment that he's been working on, so he shows it to her. It's a teleportation device, but it has a few problems, like it's inability to transport living things, and keep them alive. After finally getting it to work, Brundle accidentally, and unknowingly mixes his D.N.A. with a fly's, and soon starts transforming into a monster.<br/><br/>The characters are what this picture is all about. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis have great chemistry together, and they play off each other well. This film starts off with Goldblum and Davis meeting each other, and the first half of the film is dedicated to showing us these characters. This is quite effective so the we care about what happens during the last half of the movie. The other main character is Stathis Borans (John Getz), and he's the most miraculous character of them all. He's set up as a chauvinist villain, but this movie doesn't give into stereotype that easy. This character, who has some horrible and rude qualities, has a heart and shows that just because a character has bad qualities doesn't mean they have to be the villain.<br/><br/>The direction and writing is good. The scenes looked well thought out, and they could be pretty disturbing. The makeup effects, which won the 1986 Academy Award are very cool. The transformation scenes rival those in 1981's An American Werewolf in London for best disgusting makeup effects of 1980s cinema.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's musical score for this film is amazing. It's grand and bigger than it should be, like the music from the '50s, but it sounds great. It's a perfect mix of a loud brass section and a soft theme on the flute.<br/><br/>This story about a man's transformation into a fly is sad and horrific (with those words being used in the best sense). This is a must see for horror fans.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. R for sexuality, nudity, strong violence, and some language."

","The Fly is the story about a nerdy, reclusive scientist who invents a teleportation machine, and his reporter girlfriend who is writing a book on the discovery. Everything is going well until the scientist, drunk and jealous attempts to use the machine to teleport himself prematurely, and ends up fusing himself with a fly. The film quickly turns from sci-fi romance, to sci-fi Shakespearian tragedy. <br/><br/>The film is a semi remake of an old Vincent Pryce campy horror film. It is semi in that it was the same title, and a similar premise, but very few of the same plot details, and a very different feel. While the original was a campy 3D style film, this one is truly disturbing. That is not surprising being from director David Lynch best known for such films as Videodrome, Naked Lunch, Crash, and A History of Violence. He is known for violent, disturbing, brilliant, and emotionally brutal films. <br/><br/>The Fly is probably one of his strongest. It features a great performance by Jeff Goldblum as the scientist. He is sensitive, sad, and generally just deeply poignant. The film also features some of the best makeup ever put on screen. The film was made in the mid eighties before most computer effects were available, and all the effects are thanks to the make up. Turning a man slowly into a fly must have been difficult, and it is actually perfectly pulled off. <br/><br/>So in the end The Fly is a strongly constructed, and entertaining sci-fi horror film of sorts, and will be enjoyed by even people who aren't sci-fi fans.

Very wrong.""<br/><br/>Seth Brundle is a research scientist, employed by Bartok Sciences, who has invented ""Telepods"" two matter transmission pods that teleports any object through space from one ""Telepod"" to the other ""Telepod"". But, it is until Seth meets journalist Veronica Quaife who inspires Seth to correct the system, that Seth achieves successful teleportation. But something goes horribly wrong, when Seth uses himself as a guinea-pig in a matter transmission experiment, as he teleports himself, unaware his genes have been fused with a house fly that was trapped in the telepod with him. Seth, now finds himself slowly transforming into a terrifying mutant creature known as ""Brundlefly"" as he finds himself in a fierce battle as his mutated genes begins to take over.<br/><br/>This 1958 horror remake directed by David Cronenberg was a great watch, it had all the elements for an epic horror film. First the amazing yet nasty and puke inducing special effects. For a 1986 film, I'd say it was way ahead of its time when it came to make-up effects, I almost puked on my popcorn every time Brundlefly is doing nasty things in his apartment. Second, the character development of Jeff Goldblum's character Seth Brundle and Geena Davis' Veronica. Come to think of it, if you remove the horror factor of the film, you'd get a romantic story between an eccentric scientist and a promising journalist. The first half of the film basically focuses on said love affair and the second half is where the horrific element sets in and I gotta be honest, it really pays off.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum in his best role ever, is stunning. He delivers great dialogue and even when he's covered in horrific make-up, you can still see the humanity inside of the character, all thanks to the brilliant performance of Goldblum. The Fly is more than a horror film, it was a statement back when it was released and its still a statement up until now. It truly is amazing how you can find cinematic gems like these where you least expect it."

","The Fly is a great movie. Its a compact 91 minutes that veers from intriguing romance, to disturbing unravelling of man. Jeff Goldman is the victim in question here. A man literally consumed by his work, as he turns from scientist nerd to a twitching, vomiting nightmarish monster. Goldblums work has often been seen as irritating and mock-able, but it works beautifully here. His bug eyes, his gangly frame, and his quick delivery, perfectly fit Seth Brundles enthusiasm and following decline. Geena Davis comes off weaker, but still effective as the suffering Veronica who knows the fleeting time they had together, will be with her all her life. <br/><br/>It may well prove to be David Cronenbergs masterpiece!!!"

","In my comment for Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007) I wrote that even I don't like the idea of re-making the classics there are some that I really love. Certainly Cronenberg's Fly is one of them. This 1986 version of the 1958 classic has some similar things of that film but in the end it feels like a complete different story that has no things of the original. Of course the basic plot is the same but this film focuses more and just to the process and consequences of the masterpiece of a brilliant scientist. The 1958 version is pure narrative which is great but basically we don't see a true following to the scientist after his masterpiece change his life and here that following is amazing, bizarre, funny and with some nasty images, especially if you're eating something. One of the things that may be similar is the fact that there are few characters but here it feels the fact that in any time this story with be known by all the world. To make that the woman, who is going to be near the scientist (Jeff Goldblum), work as a journalist is the main reason of that feel. The scientist name is Seth Brundle and he is like a young Einstein (he also bought many identical sets of clothes) whose only interest is to keep on going with his experiments. He is a shy person who never leaves his home so when the journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) appears his life will never be the same but not particularly because of her. Here we have the great and interesting following to a science experiment with Veronica being witness and recording every little detail of Brundle's process in order to improve his own masterpiece, the thing that will change the world forever. Eventually the Telepods will only change Brundle's life and we are going to see a great character study in a situation that has never happened in the world. I think everybody who may be reading this knows how and for what the Telepods work and what happened to Brundle when a fly went inside one of the Telepods, so I think is unnecessary to write it. So when finally the new creature is evolving, is when Cronenberg's style appears and when finally you can say, yeah that's pure Cronenberg. Great visuals, unforgettable images, the interesting relationship between Brundle and Veronica and some humor (remember the ""coffee for your sugar"" and the ""I live with my mother too""?) makes this last part of the film a really magnificent one. David's fascination for the flesh is here and is because of the flesh that Brundle finally could improve the Telepods and also the two main characters had a fascination for the flesh, of course in different ways with Veronica before the fly went inside one Telepod and Brundle after his experiences with the Telepods. Long live the new flesh? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Cronenberg claims, in the interview featured on the Region 4 DVD of The Fly, that he has made pure action films (Scanners), character films (The Dead Zone) and films with a visual part as no other released before (Videodrome) so for David ""The Fly"" has the three things combined. I think he is absolute correct so for my money ""The Fly"" is one of Cronenberg's best films and definitely one of his most accessible works and one of my personal favourites. If you ask which version of the fly you should see, I would say that you need to see both the 1958 and the 1986 version because both are truly fantastic.<br/><br/>Region 4 DVD: is a single-disc edition but is pretty good. Extras are the theatrical trailer, a behind the scenes and five short interviews with Stuart Cornfeld, Cronenberg, Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and Chris Walas."

","Better then the Original. This is not only a masterpiece but also the grossest movie I have ever seen. This is a must see for any gore fan. I am not a huge fan of gore but gore never bothers me. If you are expecting a scary movie you will be disappointed because this movie is not scary it is just gory. It has very little in common with the original version so don't expect it to be exactly like the original. In this one the change every single character's name(there are some characters that are not in this one). Instead of having a brother that Andre had in the original Seth does not(not that I know of). This movie is a very interesting one. The fly and Seth do not switch body parts instead they switch DNA. This film is kinda a love story. It does have originality and is more of a Sci-fi flick then the original. I usually hate remakes but this one is a masterpiece in my opinion. While watching this you could easily forget that this is a Remake because it is a retelling. It is gory. Very Gory. It has great dialogue Like Your afraid to be destroyed, recreated aren't you? and Be afraid, Be very afraid(The most famous line from the film and the best). If you get motion sickness from these types of movies then do not view this film. This is not a movie for everybody. But I had fun watching this and it is a masterpiece in my opinion. 8 out of 10 stars. I highly recommend this film."
"evanston_dad","8","0","1","7 May 2008"," Spooky and Intense -- One of Cronenberg's Best
","Deeply unsettling David Cronenberg remake of the sci-fi chiller about a scientist playing around with genetic experimentation who accidentally mixes his DNA in with that of a house fly. The slow deterioration of his body as he turns into a mutated monster gives the makeup and special effects artists for this film free reign to create all manner of gruesome and frightening images. Jeff Goldblum, as the scientist, gives perhaps the best performance of his career. As an actor, he's always a bit off-kilter, so he's a natural fit as a mad genius. Geena Davis, as his love interest, does terrific work too, and delivers a performance that's something more than the standard issue work you might expect in a movie like this.<br/><br/>Though the film is full of scary moments, perhaps the scariest is when Golblum's scientist character calmly asks Davis's character to leave his apartment because he's afraid he will hurt her if she stays.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","The Fly (1986) <br/><br/>One of Canadian director David Cronenberg's earliest and best cinematic achievements, The Fly is a landmark in the sci-fi/horror genre.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum, in a tour de force performance, plays a brilliant scientist who has (nearly) mastered the art of teleportation in his own flat. With the aid of a 1980s computer and two greatly designed telepods he attempts to master the art of completing evaporating and transferring mass to another place. An early attempt with a baboon goes horribly wrong, but then better results with a piece of steak, it is not long until he decides to teleport himself; but something goes tragically wrong: a fly is present in the telepod at the time of his transfer and so the computer combined their DNA code together breeding a new human fly that slowly and grossly becomes more and more insect like.<br/><br/>What makes this a great film is that it is greatly entertaining, imaginative, intense and at time appropriately gory. The greatest part of this film apart from the unbelievably good Make-up achievement is Jeff Goldblum himself. A tall, enigmatic actor who is perfectly suited to such roles and he is simply exceptional.<br/><br/>A superior achievement in sci-fi, horror, The Fly is not to be missed.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ShootingShark","8","0","1","3 May 2008"," Powerfully, Brilliantly Made Modern-Day Mad Scientist Horror Drama
","Seth Brundle is a brilliant physicist who has developed matter transportation devices and shares his invention with journalist Veronice Quaife. But when he teleports himself, a fly accidentally gets into the machine with him. At first he seems normal, but gradually the insect's genetic material starts to dominate his and he begins to transform ...<br/><br/>Along with John Carpenter's The Thing, this is the best of the many fine remakes of old sci-fi/horror favourites (see also Attack Of The 50 Ft. Woman, The Blob, Cat People, Invaders From Mars, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Not Of This Earth, War Of The Worlds). It's perfect material for Cronenberg; disease, sexuality and transformation all crushed into a beautifully minimal story (there are really only three characters and one location), passionately played and full of gut-crunching horror. It's this stripped-down approach that gives the crazy story its legitimacy and provides the drama with all its power. Goldblum and Davis are utterly believable as Seth and Ronnie and the charm of their romance in the first half (the actors were also falling in love in real life) becomes all the more tragic for the gruesome finale. Seth's downfall from sweet, easy-going genius to self-absorbed, egotistical monster is perfectly judged, and then his gradual decomposition is riveting both visually and emotionally as the insect part of his mind takes over. The scene where he wistfully remarks, ""But now the dream is over and the insect is awake."", is both Hunchback Of Notre Dame grand drama and weird post-modern philosophy. This is horror as it should be; scary but also profound, with no answers and no resolution, only death and revulsion. At the same time it's also strangely enjoyable, mostly because it's so beautifully shot by Mark Irwin and Chris Walas' makeup effects are gleefully twisted. Best of all though is Howard Shore's chilling, booming bass string score - my favourite of his many for Cronenberg - which thwacks up the fear and the tension at all the right moments (the reveal of the fly on the computer monitor, the ""I'll hurt you if you stay"" moment, the carnage-strewn conclusion). Shore has composed a wild variety of scores for Cronenberg (synthesisers for Scanners, free-form jazz for The Naked Lunch, atonal guitar for Crash) but this is a classic example of how for an all-out, scenery-chewing, punch-the-audience-in-the-guts horror movie, you can never go wrong with a really big, really loud symphony orchestra. When it comes to Cronenberg's work, I'm afraid I subscribe to the old ""the early films were better"" theory which hamstrings so many filmmakers. The Fly was the turning-point in his career I think; it was his one big commercial success and since then he's become a bit too culturally appreciated. I really like the dirty horror films he made prior to it, and I sometimes feel its success liberated him in a way I don't like. All of this is by the by however. If you're a horror aficionado, don't miss this; it's a great take-no-prisoners mad-scientist movie, complete with romance, intrigue, thrills, pathos and killer vomit. Cult movie fans note that it is indeed the great mad director himself playing the bespectacled gynaecologist in the obligatory maggot baby sequence."
"dirk-crockett","9","0","1","28 March 2008"," Added dimension
","Great movie. Great acting (Glodblum was cheated out of an Academy Award nomination, as most film critics agreed). I always felt that the biggest improvement over the original with David Hedison was the concept of metamorphosis compared to the instantaneous transformation. Don't get me wrong--I think the original was done extremely well. In fact, I think the original excelled in the ""tragedy"" aspect. It was much more tragic for the wife to kill her beloved of many years, and the father of their little boy, than it was for the girlfriend to kill her just-met lover in this version. The impact of tragedy and loss was much more palpable. I've always felt that if someone combined the tragedy of the original with the metamorphosis of the remake, they would have the best of both worlds and have a superior movie over the first two. All in all, a great addition to any movie-lover's library."

"KiteVega","8","0","1","3 January 2008"," Absolutely chilling
","I did not like or enjoy this film one bit, but Lord help me it does deserve 8 stars simply for the fact that it does what it's supposed to do so wonderfully well. The point of The Fly is, mainly, to disgust the viewer. It does this brilliantly, and be warned, it is extremely full on. When that line goes 'Be afraid, be very afraid,' it ain't kidding! This movie doesn't so much horrify as bash you over the head with out-and-out revulsion in the shape of an overambitious scientist who turns into a giant fly due to a horrible teleportation mishap. OK spoilers ahoy. Seth Brundle (played marvelously well by Jeff Goldblum) invents a device for transporting matter from one place to another. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts (including an inside-out baboon - animal lovers be warned) Brundle finally reaches his target and transports himself. Unfortunately for him (OK - VERY unfortunately) a housefly happens to be caught up in the process as well, and when Brundle's body starts to change, he realizes that something has gone terribly wrong... Agreed, some aspects of this film seem horribly dated. The giant, rampant, poodle-permed hairstyles of both Goldblum and love interest Gina Davis that quiver with earnest indignation throughout the film. Brundle's naff 80's style lab. His fridge-freezer sized, back-talking computer (who's smart-Alecy ability to lecture it's creator seems far-fetched even by today's technological age!). Still, the overall premise of this film is completely chilling. Cronenburg's theme of mutation and illness is brought to the fore in stunning form - it is genuinely heartbreaking to witness Brundle's transformation from a good-looking (sorry, but I've always had the hots for Jeff Goldblum) and ambitious man to a repulsive freak. He gradually loses his mind as his condition becomes worse, and almost commits a heinous crime at the end of the movie. However, despite his madness and physical transformation he still retains his basic humanity, evident in his ragged 'human' breathing in the final phase of his hideous transformation, as well as his desire *MAJOR SPOILERS* for his girlfriend to kill him as he realizes the monster he has become. When I first saw Brundle's horrible, mutated paw holding that gun barrel to his horrible, mutated head I sobbed and sobbed. This is a true horror film - repulsive, unsettling, shocking - with a salient point at its core. Not for the weak-hearted."
"charchuk","10","0","1","18 December 2007"," A brilliant fusion of tragedy and horror
","I love the way that Cronenberg fuses the tragic romance with the sci-fi horror, in much the same way that Brundle is fused together with the housefly. Though it can make the film seem corny and melodramatic at times, it also adds an emotional layer to a genre so often lacking in one. It's not a typical mad scientist film - Brundle is not crazy, and his mishap is not a scientific mistake, but a mere turn of bad luck - and so it doesn't fall prey to the typical clichÃ©s of the form, but instead forges its own narrative path. That makes it highly unique and a refreshing change from the monster movies I'm used to, even if it contains many of the hallmarks.<br/><br/>Goldblum is really quite terrific, conveying many different emotions even while masked under layers of terrifying makeup. The way he can switch between drama and comedy, romance and tragedy without overacting is fantastic, and the fact that he manages to create a believable character at the same time is truly remarkable. It's a type of performance not usually seen in a film like this, and it's more than welcome. Both Davis and Getz are solid, but they simply pale in comparison. This is Goldblum's film.<br/><br/>In a similar way, the film also belongs to the amazing makeup effects. They're stunning and disgusting simultaneously, and yet add another layer of realism. Even the final transformation, while being even more revolting, manages to evoke sympathy in the audience, an amazing feat for a monster in a horror flick. Indeed, Brundle's story seemed more akin to the monster in Frankenstein than the doctor, though his character embodies aspects of the latter.<br/><br/>This is the best film I've seen by Cronenberg so far, and it's largely due the blended story, terrific lead performance, and fantastic visuals. It branches out from the typical mad scientist/monster movie into something more, a tragedy almost worthy of Shakespeare. Grounded by Goldblum's realistic performance, it does not simply show off the terrific effects, but instead uses them to enhance and perform the story. It's a rare treat in a horror film, and makes this one of the greatest in the genre, bar none."

"jamhorner","10","0","1","27 October 2007"," No Need For A Fly Swater on this One
","A romantic drama gone horribly wrong. David Cronenberg, who is most notably known for accumulating horror, directed this masterful reworking of the Vincent Price classic. I scientist (Jeff Goldblum) creates a teleporter but accidentally gets his molecules rearranged when he AND a fly get teleported together. What took this film beyond the cheesy and funny film of the 50's was the visual of Goldblum's skin decaying and falling off., the transformation of the fly, the chemistry between the fly and Geena Davis's character and the internal conflict in each one of them. It was truly a love story gone horribly, horribly wrong. I would first like to make note of the excellent performances by Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and John Getz. They made this story come alive; they gave The Fly and the characters life and never let up.<br/><br/>To see the transformation of Professor Brundle made the horror come true in this movie. There are 6 transformations and each has its own thematic element of ""your body failing you."" You are no longer in control of your body and it just displays all the horrors of bodily hygiene. The make up effects of each stage was, simply put, a gander. Cronenberg imagined each stage beautifully, for example when state 2 hits, you know that it's going to get worse but you don't know how worse and by stage 6, it becomes mind-blowing. Rather than keeping your human body and having a fly head in the old version, this version actually seems like a mutation of man and insect. I think the best example of hygiene gone wrong would be the Prof. Brundle documenting and saving each piece of his body that falls off.<br/><br/>One of the greater aspects of this movie would be the romanticism of this movie. This element alone made the movie hard to watch for a number of reasons. Veronica (Davis) had a love affair with Brundle but when it seems like she is falling for another guy Brundle kind of goes crazy. She loves Brundle but not what he has become and at the end when he completely transforms into a fly-thing with a huge piece of machinery fused to his back, Brundles looses all humanity and Veronica knows that deep down, he is human. That relationship was so hard to watch unravel and it made me cry. It builds per stage and to watch Veronica caught between two men is heart wrenching.<br/><br/>As for the gore effect in this movie, there wasn't that much blood and guts, in fact, there was no guts just puke and blood. This movie doesn't need that much blood because it would steer away from the elements, listed above, that made this movie terrific. Granted, when you see Brundlefly eat, it's pretty disgusting, when Davis gives birth to a maggot, that's pretty bloody, but there are no guts. I like that in this kind of movie, there doesn't need to be gore to make this movie scary, all you need is creature effects, some blood and a tear jerking understory.<br/><br/>Overall, I probably milked the excellence out of this movie and gave away more than enough spoilers but I was just astounded by the impact that this movie had. It was Terms of Endernment meets a Troma film. It's probably one of the best horror movies made and one of the better Cronenberg film next to Scanners and Shivers. There were scares, cries, humor, blood, not guts and just a great underpaying story of true compassion in the most extreme situations. If you have not seen this movie, I strongly recommend you put this on your Netflix. All in all, it was a masterpiece."

He attempts to begin with animals with the hope of progressing to humans, but his first attempt on a baboon is - I mean this literally - a bloody disaster. As he begins to open up emotionally to his journalist/friend, the two become lovers, much to the jealousy (disguised by snarkiness and sarcasm) of her current boss/former lover, Stathis (John Getz). One night, she discovers that Stathis plans to run with the Brundle story without her, she goes to confront him . . . leaving Seth alone to stew in his booze and jealousy, a bad combination. On a drunken impulse, he decides to teleport himself, but there is a fly in the machine with him . . . and the rest is eighties - and all time - horror history.<br/><br/>The acting? Could we have asked for a better cast? Goldblum is quirkily brilliant, Davis would go on shortly hereafter to be an Oscar-winner, and Getz holds his own. Cronenberg . . . well, what more do I have to say than that? Cronenberg. There was some talk of Goldblum being nominated for an Oscar for his work here, but that unfortunately did not happen. However, the make-up effects did win, and this was well deserved. A not to be missed classic."

","For me, this movie is a rare thing: a GOOD horror movie. It's not often that I find one. Yeah, there are some decent ones but the majority of the horror flicks I've seen can summed up in one word: lame. I've also noticed that a lot of my favorite horror movies were made before 1990. This one is definitely high on my list. David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is a remake of the 1958 film starring Vincent Price.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from the other horror flicks? Plot!! This movie has a wonderful story that doesn't just rely on ""Look out behind you!"" scare tactics. Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, an eccentric scientist on the verge of a great discovery: teleportation. When he firsts attempts at teleporting himself through, a fly makes it into the telepod with him and their genes are spliced together. Geena Davis is his love interest, playing a journalist who becomes interested in his work. Aside from the horror of this man's transformation into a monster, the movie has an emotional aspect of the characters' relationship and how it is tried by these tragic events. Davis's character is forced to watch the man she loves disappear.<br/><br/>For those who hear that and are turning away because love is invading their scary movies, don't worry. While the special make-up and puppet effects may seem a little dated, it isn't enough to draw you out of the picture. The gore and transformation effects are definitely enough to gross you out. I recently showed this movie to my girlfriend for the first time and she could barely watch it.<br/><br/>This is horror with heart! A magnificent combination that I wish we would see more of in modern movies..."

However, after viewing and a closer look, it seems like more of an interpretation of ""The Beauty and the Beast"" than anything.<br/><br/>""The Fly"" is as much of a love story as it is horror, and these two contrasting elements are balanced very well. It is exactly the love story elements which make ""The Fly"" work so well...who wouldn't be horrified by watching someone they love slowly turn into a monster?

The story of a scientist's whose teleportation experiments have a slightly adverse effect on him is rather good. As for scares, there just are not that many, the movie is mostly watching a man deteriorate to the point of being really gross looking. Still it has a great cast, and it is a well done movie, just needed some kills or something else. He isn't super fly for very long, but for the most part just the melting man. Like I said, the main point of this film seemed to be just to gross you out. The eating scene with him showing how a fly eats is particularly icky as are the many scenes of various pieces of him coming off. Before the gross out begins though you are given an interesting enough plot about teleportation pods and there is another nasty scene involving a monkey, but in the end the most memorable scenes in the flick are the ones that make you go eww."

","The Fly is one of the best sci-fi movies shot during the 80's, no doubt. Jeff Goldblum's act, blending with Jeena Davis' caused wondrous results. Even though you cannot identify the body and the face of Jeff Goldblum later in the movie, his ""characteristic"" movements can be seen from the surface. Which makes you feel more pity towards the creature Jeff has become. But the ""scientist"" character makes you ask questions about the movie like ""Why does he talk like he's a literature professor more than a nutty genius scientist?!"". ""Brundlefly"" uses no scientific expressions which shades Jeff's play.<br/><br/>Still, the movie deserves more than it gets. Years later, it's still worth watching."

","The Fly (1986) was another movie that David Cronenberg played ""director-for-hire"". Unlike most hired guns he had some<br/><br/>input in the final product. The movie updates the 1950's classic giving it an 80's feel and utilizing some of the most vile effects to date. The Fly remake is more of a product of it's time than a true remake. Only a few of the elements from the original film can be found in this one. Cronenberg also takes advantage of the high-tech gore effects and a ""liberal"" R-rating in this film.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum stars as the scientist Seth Brundle (this is the buff Goldblum, he doesn't look too much like the walking stick<br/><br/>that he was during the late 70's).

","In the 1950s when all the world was aflame with ideas of the future (Orwell's War of the Worlds, 1984, and Assimov's work), George Langelaan came up with the story, The Fly, as his one-hit wonder.  Now, not having seen the first version with Vincent Price, I cannot comment on whether this one, directed by David Cronenberg, is better.  I can, however, tell you that this film is good.  Although it is a slight departure from Langellan's story in that scientist Seth Brundle's (Jeff Goldblum) whole body becomes mutated with a fly's DNA.  In the original story the head and arm become switched with that of a fly.  The special effects and design work involved are very good, from the telepods to the rapid transformation of Brundle into the fly. The chemistry between reporter Veronica Quaife (Gena Davis) seems a little implausible at first but soon fades out as the possibility of teleportation is discussed.<br/><br/>The movie delivers good suspense in Brudle-fly's metamorphosis.  Veronica's pregnancy gives puts a little shock-factor in as well.  The ending has both strange gore along with good theatrical tragedy.  *SPOILERS HEREAFTER:  I was confused as to why the bar girl Brundle picked up didn't get pregnant or was tested (maybe on birth control for flies?).  Some intense gore as Brundle immobilizes his victim when John Getz' arm and foot are melted.  And of course, the disturbing idea that Brundle wants to mutate himself, Veronica and the baby into one big mass...?  Yuck!"

The new fly-Goldblum gets supernatural strengths and even manages to get a girlfriend (the lovely Geena Davis)  whom is pretty impressed by his endurance, but somethings going very wrong, very quickly.<br/><br/>This movie is probably not for wimps but everyone else is in for an exciting ride complete with cheesy settings that oozes  monstermovies from the fifties and pretty full-on gore.

"leathaface","Null","0","1","3 March 2004"," This movie really isn't as bad as the posters here make it out to be!
","This is probably one of my favorite Cronenburg films.  I liked it better than Videodrome, The Brood, and Naked Lunch.  It's the story of a scientist (Goldblum) who creates the first teleportation device.  A journalist (Davis) talks with him about it and decides to go to his apartment for a closer look.  He tries to teleport a few things (apple and a cactus) and ends up screwing them up.  He tweaks the machine a little bit and puts a monkey inside, only to find out that it came out inside-out on the other side.  He tweaks it yet again and tries to teleport himself.  What he doesn't know is that a fly flew into the pod with him and their genes fused.  Geena Davis eventually has an affair with him, and finds coarse black hairs growing on his back.   This is where the movie really picks up.  People say this movie is gory, but I wouldn't really say that, it's more gross or nasty than anything.  We get to see Jeff slowly transform into a hideous mutant, losing his hair, parts of his teeth, his fingernails, and even an ear.  He also gains superhuman strength, the ability to walk on walls, and he is also able to spit corrosive acid from his mouth for digestion purposes.  Weeks later we find out that Davis's character is pregnant.  She has a weird dream where she gives birth to a giant maggot.  Towards the end of the movie, she makes one final appearance at Jeff's apartment.  He is hardly human anymore, looking more like a hunchbacked neanderthal with a bad complexion than anything.  Her ex-boyfriend comes to the rescue, only to have acid spit on his hand and ankle.  Finally, in the goriest scene in the movie, Jeff Goldblum's head splits open as his eyes melt from their sockets and he sheds his diseased-looking skin.  At this point, he looks kind of like the Toxic Avenger with a giant mosquito head.  He grabs Davis, and drags her to the teleportation chamber in hopes of fusing her with him.  Instead, she breaks loose and her ex blows the lock off the door after it closes so Jeff can't get out.  The computer makes a mistake and fuses Jeff with the other teleportation chamber (what?!?) and he comes out the other end missing his legs but instead sports a bundle of wires and cables in their place.  Geena Davis blasts him in the head and the movie ends.  <br/><br/>This movie was great because Craonenburg is simply a great director.  If he makes a film with violence in it, he tries to make it a more creative, surrealistic effect rather than the always conventional shotgun blast or stabbing.  If you like his artistic and surrealistic flair, be sure to check out Videodrome and Naked Lunch.  This movie had a sequel, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first.  It's a lot different (in a not-so-good way) and the final creature looks more like the aliens from Species than it does insectile."

","Here are my thoughts on a movie that is so scary, you just may have nightmares for the rest of your life and that movie would be none other than the 1986 remake of ""THE FLY"". The Fly seems to be a thought-out and well displayed movie that plans on making your stomach feel more disgusting that Seth Brundle did when he was slowly transforming into BrundleFly. The music in the movie is well played and has done its job which is to make your heart race with extreme fear. Trust me when I say that The Fly is the most scariest movie that has ever been put on the movie screen because in the middle part of the movie, Seth Brundle goes into the telepods and then walks out as himself but then later his healthy appearance deteriorates, and we can witness the beginning in the scene where Seth is making bacon with Veronica, that is where we see the hairs on his back grow. Then in the scene where Seth calls Veronica to visit him and Veronica sees very well that something went wrong with the experiment because Seth faces looks like he slept on a hot fast-food stove but that's not the real start of hearts to race like a Chevy Corevette, because what really is when Seth takes a doughunt and barfs on it. Just when you hear him say ""Oh...Oh that's disgusting."" you really want to say ""No kidding, Klyde."" But it keeps getting better because later in the movie, we find out that Veronica is knocked up with the freak's baby. So she and her ex-boyfriend go to the hospital and attempt to have an abortion, however things get way out of hand when Seth Brundle (in his later state of transforming into BrundleFly) breaks into the hospital and kidnaps Veronica taking her back to his laboratory. Veronica's ex-boyfriend goes after him to rescue her but ironiclly it is he who needs saving because Seth Brundle attacks him from above and then dissolves his hand and foot with Fly vomit. To this day I still have nightmares because of that scene. I was 9 years old when I first saw the movie and now I'm 20 years old. Need I say more that The Fly (1986) is indeed the most horrifying movie that has ever been created and displayed on the silver screen? Just watch the movie. But I warn you with a quote from the movie that to this day will haunt me for a life-time: ""Be afraid. Be very afraid."" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
"Jaymay","Null","0","1","21 January 2002"," Real science and THE FLY
","The greatest thing about Cronenberg's version of THE FLY is how insightful it was about its science.  In 1985, when this script was being written, Cronenberg and Pogue almost certainly could not have known how close they were to the truth of things regarding DNA.<br/><br/>Scientists have known for quite a while that just as all computer programs can ultimately be broken down to 1's and 0's, the fundamental building blocks of human life are the same in all living things.  Human beings and flies share over 95 percent of the same DNA code.  So, the concept of combining these two things on a ""molecular-genetic level"" is not as far-fetched as it might seem.  In fact, scientists actually have done it the other way around.  They have replaced sections of fruit fly DNA with human DNA, and bred honest-to-goodness humanflys.<br/><br/>A much newer discovery is even more fascinating in light of THE FLY.  Dolly, the sheep clone, recently developed arthritis.  That's not interesting in and of itself:  sheep commonly get that ailment.  The strange thing is that Dolly got it at a much younger age than she should have.  Scientists believe that it has something to do with the fact that she was cloned.  It's as if the sheep lost something in the copying process.  <br/><br/>Now, this does NOT make scientific sense.  Cloning is like copying a CD: it's digital.  The exact same DNA should create an organism that has exactly the same body (and chance of getting sick) as the original.  But the real-life experiment with Dolly seem to bear out the idea that there is something creepy and mysterious about messing with things on a genetic level, even if--scientifically--it seems like everything should be kosher.<br/><br/>So, in the FLY, when Jeff Goldblum starts slowly metamorphosizing, with both positive and then very negative results, I believe it's scary because it rings true, and we actually believe that it would happen that way.<br/><br/>How cool is it when science-fiction actually predicts science, and not the other way around?"

Ronnie witnesses Seth's experiments, right from the turned-inside out baboon (it seems to be a prophecy for the future horror)  to success.

The computer gets confused, mixes Seth's DNA with the insect's. He begins to transform into a half human, half bug monster. His changes are not just physical, not just what he looks like, but also mental. He's no longer Seth Brundle, the gentle, shy, intelligent, charming and lonely scientist, he is now vicious, aggressive ""Brundlefly"". He doesn't act like a human being, because he's not a human being. He acts like a dangerous, brutal mutant.<br/><br/>It is fascinating to watch the process of Seth Brundle's metamorphosis. At the beginning Seth is scared, then he becomes more like a freak psychologically, although he desperately wants to be a human again. His profound sadness, shame and despair become fury when he sees Stathis Borans (Ronnie's editor and ex-boyfriend, played by John Getz) accompany Ronnie (nothing else, just accompanying her, that's all). This could be the reason why later Brundlefly attacks Stathis so mercilessly. Although it is out of self-defense (Stathis is about to shoot Seth with a shotgun, trying to save Ronnie), but Brundlefly almost kills Stathis because he has always been so jealous of Stathis and hates him so much, even Stathis is no longer involved with Ronnie.<br/><br/>Originally it is a good intention to invent teleportation, but when something goes wrong during the scientific experiment with Seth himself, it becomes a personal tragedy. The film itself is intense, Geena Davis delivers a powerful, fantastic performance as heartbroken Ronnie. But I find Stathis Borans an especially likeable character, at first he is a bit annoying and possessive as Ronnie's ex-lover, but later when Ronnie is in trouble, he lovingly helps her and stays by her side.<br/><br/>Followed by a compelling sequel."

","David Cronenberg is a filmmaker whose films you just simply love or hate. He has a peculiar, disturbing, raw and perverse vision of the humanity, and in great part of his motion pictures, explosive and controversial themes like rape, incest, murder and homosexuality are analyzed in a cold and honest way. The Fly's main character is Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum, giving his career's  best performance), a brilliant scientist who works with insistence in the ""Telepods"" :two capsules that supposedly are capable of disintegrating a body and transport it to another capsule in which it is reintegrated. Seth meets an attractive and ambitious reporter (Geena Davis) in a party and the two fall in love. She starts to share with him the experiences, but something comes out wrong when Seth uses his own body for the experiment - his genetic cells are mixed up with the DNA of a fly. This is the beginning of a nightmare that will throw Seth in a mutation process. The mutation will turn him progressively into an implacable monster. Cronenberg made a film that doesn't follow the basic formulas of the gender. The Fly is not exactly a horror movie, but a mixture of drama, romance and, of course, a lot of violence, blood and gore. The Fly is so violent that makes Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 look like a Disney film.The magnificent special effects took home the Oscar in 1987, and even after 14 years, the scenes in which Goldblum progressively ""melts down"",  shocks for its realism. The director doesn't spare the audience and, unlike The Blair Witch Project, that scared just suggesting, he maintains the cameras in focus, documenting exaggerating cruelty scenes. Jeff Goldblum never delivered such intense acting in all of his career after The Fly. Without a doubt, this film deserves to be a part of any movie lover's collection  - buy the movie.

","Simply the best movie ever made, definitely the best sci-fi horror flick. This film is just so classy and insane its unbelievable. Jeff Goldblum is excellent, even more than usual. There is some sick humour but not cheesy or cheep. There is a really gross ending and just the whole thing is damn spectacular. Repeated viewing is compulsory. Not really frightening so much as entertaining. Superrrrrrb."

","i think this movie is one of the best horror films ever made(i personally don't like horror films). The story is very original and all the actors play their parts well, especially Jeff Goldblum plays the best role in his career. The only scene which was a bit repulsive and unneeded was the arm-wrestling scene, but for the rest, this movie is perfect! You don't have to like horror to like this one. If you just wanna see a good sci-fi film and you don't mind a little blood, this movie is for you!   This movie gets an 8/10"
