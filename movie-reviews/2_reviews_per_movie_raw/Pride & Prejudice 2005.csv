","before i start, i would like to say this. i can read, have read the book, and i read the title of the movie before watching, as should you all. quite disappointed in all the pompous idiots filled with prejudice about the movie.<br/><br/>I know that another version of the well-mined Jane Austen classic would need to be brilliant indeed. Such diverse and beautifully written characters and such a delightful plot, so deeply rooted in a profound understanding of human nature, are timelessly attractive to directors, actors and audiences alike. So give them a break. you couldn't do any better.<br/><br/>Lets start with Mr Darcy. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Where Olivier and Firth gave us an aloof, arrogant Darcy encased rigidly in a shell so impenetrable it was almost impossible to believe he had been moved by Lizzie's sardonic criticisms or attracted by her spirited independence, McFadyen shows a more accessible Darcy. He's vulnerable, even fragile behind his stiff manners. His aloofness is more believably from social inadequacy than arrogance, yet he is believably constrained by his social standing to regard decorum, fortune and propriety in a wife's family as significant in his choice of a bride. His capitulation to Lizzie is therefore more believable.<br/><br/>Similarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp-minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role.<br/><br/>The two have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. the dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning. the love story is heart-felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve. I found this movie to be a a richly photographed, memorable ensemble production in which the romance is predominant over the drama but does not eclipse it. though my one disappointment - the ending?! of course i wanted to see them kiss, who didn't? but the shots of them arguing in the rain, and as they draw close with the sunlight shining between them was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Giving due significance to the rural environment which plays such an important part in the story, the cinematography captures wide frames of soft, misty fields, copses and winding country roads as an environment which underscores the gentle manners and passionately beating hearts beneath empire gowns and ruffled shirts. The surroundings both detract from the humans and function as appropriately natural settings for the dramas of human nature.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley's swan-like Elizabeth moves with energy and grace, hotly opinionated and profoundly moved by principles and prejudices, and magnetically drawn by the seeming arrogance, reticence and gallant behaviour, finally revealed, of Mr Darcy. For two centuries Elizabeth Bennet has been a heroine much admired for her self-contained independence within a culture more conditioned to female submissiveness. Knightley's portrayal is true to the original.<br/><br/>All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving."

","A ""modernised"" version of Jane Austen's classic novel that should not be compared unfavourably with 1940 Hollywood Olivier / Garson version nor several BBC serials culminating in the most acclaimed TV series version from 1995 with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle-a personal favourite. <br/><br/>This 2005 film clocks in 127 minutes (UK / Europe)& 135 minutes (USA & Canada) -the extended version allowing audiences to share more of the timeless love story with the main characters -Elizabeth Bennet & Mr Darcy. <br/><br/>Director Joe Wright plus his screenwriters ( Oscar winner Emma Thompson contributed to the final screenplay) have chosen to emphasise Elizabeth Bennet / Mr Darcy plus Jane Bennet/ Mr Bingley story lines & reduce Mr Wickman, Charlotte & Mr Collins to supporting characters.<br/><br/>Austen's famous wit,satire & humour that forms the basis for her enduring appeal (Pride & Prejudice was finally published in 1813 & continues as an annual bestseller)is sidelined to open up this version as more emotional drama for modern audiences.<br/><br/>If you are open to a newer interpretation, can avoid comparisons to the nearly 5 hour 1995 TV version which allowed for greater depth & detail in telling all the characters story lines & accept some of the new film's rushed story lines-you are in for a treat .....<br/><br/>New British star Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet))excels in her first real leading actress role ably supported by fellow Brit Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet) as the sisters supportive of each other's & their Bennett family problems.Knightley at 20 is the right age for her character,this allows Elizabeth's girlish personality plus her character's pride, misjudgements & loving nature to shine through....<br/><br/>Great star turns from Brenda Blethyn as their mother Mrs Bennet plus Oscar winner Judi Dench as fearsome Lady De Bourgh (Mr Darcy's aunt)add depth to this film version.Claudie Blakley as Elizabeths's wise friend Charlotte Lucas & Simon Wood's amusing Mr Bingley are delightful supporting performers. <br/><br/>One major surprise is Canadian actor Donald Sutherland's touching performance as Mr Bennet -capturing both the humour of living in an all female household & five daughters to look after with the poignancy of seeing his eldest children's difficult relationships develop -easily his best acting performance in years. <br/><br/>In the difficult role of Mr Darcy rising British star Matthew Macfadyen (BBC's Spy series Spooks & Award winning New Zealand film ""In My Father's Den"" rises to the occasion.With the short running time, there is not enough time to allow Darcy's repressed & prejudiced personality to be fully represented -Macfadyen perfectly displays Darcy's social & class problems, his unfortunate attempts at gaining Eliabeth Bennet's interest & his painful adjustments to achieve their personal love story.Macfayden & Knightley's objectionable first dance,their embarrassingly moving Collins House meeting,the unexpected Pemberley encounter plus their two proposal scenes are highlights of this film. <br/><br/>Engaging acting performances with wondrous film photography,film locations at some of United Kingdom's most famous stately homes, marvellous film sets & costumes plus one of 2005's best original music scores add greatly to this new film version. <br/><br/>All in all one of the better films of 2005 -not perfect film making and not intended to be as subtle as Austen's novel -but a wonderful surprise with some changes to present a modern version of Pride & Prejudice for current audiences -do see this film as & when it is released worldwide....<br/><br/>And after seeing the film or re-visiting 1995 BBC TV series -read the original novel for its classic storyline, memorable characters & Austen's brilliant writing style,wit & humour.....<br/><br/>9 Out Of 10 for this different interpretation of an enduring classic"
"katiemeyer1979","10","405","564","17 November 2005"," Jane Austen for ever
","Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followed feverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in ""Apartment Zero"", Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. The other big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature film debut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies"
"shopper1952","10","475","689","11 November 2005"," Outstanding...MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy.
","Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long."
"mankindk","10","158","224","18 November 2005"," Acting is superb
","While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.<br/><br/>If you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.<br/><br/>One warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","10","170","247","4 August 2006"," A timeless adaptation of a timeless Jane Austen novel.
","The fantastic romantic world of Jane Austen again makes its way to the silver screen in Joe Wright's new adaptation of the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. It is the first feature film to be adapted from it in 65 years, and believe me when I say it does not disappoint. This adaptation is, for lack of a better word, a BRILLIANT achievement that keeps you actively involved from the first scene to the very last scene, just about consuming you with aching romance  and it is sprinkled with humour and intelligence.<br/><br/>Still taking place in the late 1700s and still interweaving its story with timeless emotion, pride, narrow-mindedness and love, Pride and Prejudice (2005) zooms in on the Bennet household in class-conscious, stuck-up England. In this household, we follow five spirited sisters under the idealism of their overbearing mother (a superbly neurotic Brenda Blethlyn providing for the comic relief) who desperately wants them all to marry and thereby secure the future of the family estate. But the standout sister and protagonist in the film, Lizzie (Keira Knightley) is clever enough to have other ideas, but alas too romantic to carry them out... *sigh*<br/><br/>When reviewing period films such as this one, one often focuses on the setting and costume design. I believe this is done because they are often better crafted than the actual story. But in Pride and Prejudice (2005), the stormy emotions of its charactersbottled up but bubbling to get outcompletely consume the entire film and places understated set designs in the backseat. Only when it was consciously put forward, like when Lizzie Bennet was admiring the beautiful architecture and Greek statues of Mr. Darcy's estate, did I ever notice the background  and it was, of course, extraordinary. A similar state displaying the dynamics of its central cast should be attributed to the grand dancing scene between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy  the two are so absorbing that when Wright purposely fades out the the rest of the dancing crowd, you do not notice a change. Your eyes are still solely Knightley and Macfadyen. It took me three viewings to realise this. <br/><br/>As for acting performances then, the unspeakably lovely Keira Knightley has finally done it. She has proved me wrong with a truly Oscar-worthy performance and she does it without crying, worrying, moping and sighing like the other nominees that year. Knightley is in fact all about sweet subtlety here, bringing a fantastic presence to her high-spirited character Lizzie. She is the type of character that every girl and woman in the world can identify with and with Knightley behind her to give her oomph, you will not find a more likable creature in films this year. MacFayden is completely satisfactory as Lizzie's love interest Mr. Darcy, but he is no Colin Firth  lacking in charm and is a bit too wooden. But no matter, because these two have the best on-screen chemistry I have ever seen. I'm not kidding, this was sensational. Such magnetism. It is highlighted from scene 1, playfully touching upon their sexual tension and gradually turning it into feverish love that sends chills down your spine.<br/><br/>Every last actor in the cast of Pride and Prejudice (2005) gets to shine in their characterfrom Dame Judi Dench as a cold rich lady to Donald Sutherland as caring Mr Bennet, all except Jena Malone whose all too Valley-girl American attitude was distracting and annoyingly anachronistic. But it is Knightley who is in focus and who propels the film with her warm charisma. It is impossible not to fall in love with the main characters, and I say this as someone who avoids romance-themed films and who does not care for period films. <br/><br/>This is a truly timeless story and this film will hopefully be remembered, celebrated and praised for breathing life into it with such passion.<br/><br/>10/10 (which is a rare grade for me)"
"lillianna66","7","257","396","12 September 2005"," Romantic, funny, well-acted, well-scripted - give it a try!
","Having watched a slew of special effects-laden trailers before this film I was reassured to discover that in the brave new world of CGI cinema there is still a place for a satisfyingly romantic story, well-acted and thoughtfully scripted and directed. <br/><br/>Comparisons with the highly-regarded 1995 BBC series are inevitable, but whereas that production had the luxury of time to unfold its plot and characters at leisure, the creators of this film had the unenviable task of reducing Jane Austen's book to just two hours. Yes, Austen lovers will mourn the absence or alteration of favourite scenes. Yes, we do lose some sense of the developing and changing relationships between the main characters (two examples - Wickham appears in only two scenes of any significance and personally I would have liked more time to savour Lizzie and Darcy's rediscovery of one another at Pemberley). Yes, there is occasionally a feeling of entering or leaving a scene partway through (where do Lizzie's uncle and aunt think she has gone when she apparently sets off from Pemberley to walk to Lambton without a word to them?) On the whole though, I think director Joe Wright, and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, are successful in retaining the flavour, the vital essence of Austen's original. <br/><br/>The film also offers some new perspectives on very familiar characters. Tom Hollander in particular, gives Mr. Collins something approaching dignity in his determined but usually unsuccessful attempts to ingratiate himself with those more powerful than him, and he provides some of the funniest moments of the film  witness his attempts to gain Mr. Darcy's attention at the ball. Mrs. Bennet too, who we all remember Alison Steadman playing with an enthusiasm approaching pantomime, is more sympathetic in the hands of Brenda Blethyn because we understand more clearly the reasons behind her desperation to marry her daughters off. Mr. Bingley though teeters a fine line between nervous hesitancy and simple-minded idiocy which made me question why Jane Bennet would ever consider marrying him. And who on earth thought of giving him Cameron Diaz's infamous ""There's Something About Mary"" hairdo? <br/><br/>Reviews for Matthew MacFadyen seem to have been mixed so far, the inevitable 'Firth Factor' at least part of the reason. Personally I think he has a sexy, brooding presence to equal Firth's and (dare I say it) his Darcy has a little more charm and humanity when he does let his guard down. The scene where he bursts in upon Lizzie at the Collins' parsonage, all glove-twisting nervousness and incoherent attempts at small talk, captures perfectly the bewilderment of a man trained since childhood not to express his feelings, and made vulnerable for the first time by the conflicting emotions Lizzie has stirred in him.<br/><br/>I do think his Darcy is oddly lacking in 'pride' though, his taciturnity attributed to having so many expectations to live up to that he never dares let down the facade of 'Mr. Darcy of Pemberley'. Nor do we get any sense, as in the book, that Lizzie's free-spirited influence alters his attitude or behaviour towards others, the explanation the audience is left with being that really he was a nice guy all along, just misunderstood.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley's Lizzie brings nothing really new to the part, but whilst too stunningly beautiful to be the girl dismissed by Darcy as 'only tolerable', she has an abundance of the playfulness and charm which quickly captivates him. She is also a good enough actress to show Lizzie's own growing confusion and then loss as she realises how she has misread her own feelings. <br/><br/>The chemistry between the two leads works well, their dance at Netherfield a key moment as their verbal sparring gives way to a growing physical awareness which neither of them is ready to admit. Other little incidents such as the touch of hands as Darcy helps Lizzie into her carriage keep the romance heating up, and it almost reaches boiling point in the first proposal scene. It does fizzle away disappointingly though in their final reconciliation, which promises much at the start with a heady mix of very slightly disarrayed nightwear, rolling thunder and smouldering gazes across a misty meadow, but, whilst tenderly played, it ends up being a little too coy for the 21st century. Come on Joe Wright, give us a kiss in the DVD version please!"
"evebay39","2","343","543","24 October 2005"," Minor errors? But Pride was constipation, they forgot Prejudice. And Austen come to that.
","Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.<br/><br/>Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If he wants bucolic, he should try Tess.<br/><br/>Mr Bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. The scene where he stops Mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it doesn't - don't include it.<br/><br/>MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers acting. The first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station. Most of his lines, he could as well be reading a shopping list.<br/><br/>Lydia is awful. Completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling inane character Lydia actually is in the book, at times.<br/><br/>And Elizabeth. Half the time Knightley is, clearly, mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE.<br/><br/>From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly fancies him. When he comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham you don't get Elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship.<br/><br/>And apparently it is Caroline not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily wanders into Jane's bedroom. And and and - Wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants. But a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for Hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place.<br/><br/>The cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't the last proposal shots/lighting from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. But most importantly - when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one - Austen. (She'd have laughed out loud at the Elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through to picturesque folly, wet Darcy rubbish).<br/><br/>I admit I found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. I was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. But to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when Knightley wasn't aping Ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script.<br/><br/>Tom Holland alone would escape censure. While he toned down the comic aspects of Collins, he did turn in a very interesting approach. Dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane.<br/><br/>The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? Not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. Elizabeth couldn't have come up with the £10k figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickhams marriage the lines didn't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece.<br/><br/>It really is appalling stuff. Anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone I frankly don't believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing. Wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour. I'm not convinced he has read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch - he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it.<br/><br/>What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'I love you, I love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant.<br/><br/>Anyone who reviews it as a film alone? Well, more difficult for me except I would note the poor acting, the weak Darcy, and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking it's title."
"thingfive","10","201","319","12 November 2005"," Absolutely Perfect 2 Hour Adaptation!
","For years I have waited for a Pride and Prejudice that perfectly captured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of Jane Austen's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it many times, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much of the dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of the more subtle dynamics of the novel.<br/><br/>Finally this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing! True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt--to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it has to rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authentic and true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. You simply do not want it to end...<br/><br/>Well done!!!! It was about time!!!"
"mkazmierczak","1","477","783","11 November 2005"," Jane Austen is spinning in her grave.
","This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel.<br/><br/>There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance at which Darcy snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy families belong, but is rather the dancing of the lower classes. The gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance. There are costume and hair problems, too. The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors. Women of the Regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and vest) at which they admit their love for each other. This is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. <br/><br/>But the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he/she can write like Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent but also has no feel for Austen's style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less awful than Austen's portrayal. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is miscast. His affected British accent is terrible and he portrays Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century. Matthew MacFadeyn's portrayal of Darcy is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a pretty Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern. Knightly focuses on the Elizabeth's forthrightness, but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time. She would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period.<br/><br/>If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. This film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope Emma Thompson decides to do a film of Pride and Prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds.<br/><br/>The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film. True fans of Austen will rush home to watch their DVDs of the far superior 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds."

","If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen.<br/><br/>Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and grins through every scene, and came across as being so obnoxious that no-one would want to marry her! Darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written.<br/><br/>This version failed to show the proper Pride and Prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered from and, at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who cared whether they got together or not! Absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this rubbish. I cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended!"

Granted the locations and houses very lovely (if not a little miscast-yes even the house were wrong for their parts) Keira was too modern, dull and frankly I found it unpleasant to watch her. Were everyone else sees Darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he isn't meant to be) and the Bennett's were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reason farmers, this is incorrect and ludicrous. The very idea that Mr Bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr Collins was not repulsive and greasy merely stupid and obnoxious, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress, what! As if! It is Historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying. I could go on for days. I hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but I fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it. The BBC version is so superior it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory. In short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the BBC version other wise you will be lead done the deluded road that this is what it's like, which its not!"

And to change Jane Austen's witty dialogue for some of the dross, especially early on in the piece was definitely not an improvement.<br/><br/>This loud, grubby group were not my idea of the Bennetts or their friends. The Bennetts may have been poor and may well have lived in a shabby house, but they had more class than this lot.<br/><br/>As for the proposition that Darcy's aloofness was because he shy and not confident, he just seemed pathetic to me and Darcy should certainly not be pathetic. <br/><br/>Except for the scene where he gave a lovely smile - Mathew MacFadyen wore the same expression pretty much throughout, (which was not surprising as this Darcy was such a boring character), and Kiera Knightly just seemed much to flighty for Lizzy, she seemed more like Lydia.<br/><br/>To me - it is the Benny Hill version of P&P - no subtlety, little wit, almost just slapstick.<br/><br/>Thank God for the BBC."

","Pride and Prejudice has always been one of my favourite books, so any screen incarnation has to live up to certain personal expectations of character, style etc. And of course, there is the gold standard of the 1995 BBC series, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, had the luxury of several episodes to cover a story that here takes just two hours. So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>The first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.<br/><br/>The cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far. She captured the playfulness and wit of Lizzie's bright mind wonderfully well, and made me think long and hard how truly frustrating it must have been to be an intelligent young woman in a world that expected nothing more of her than an ability to choose ribbon and to capture a husband possessed of money. The only possible slight criticism I might make, is that Keira Knightley is perhaps a little too waif-like to pull off the 18th century characterization entirely convincingly. She is stunningly beautiful, but her stick thin appearance alongside her more robust looking screen sisters, made her look as if Mr Bennet might well have doubted her parentage!"

","This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a very traditional interpretation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that manages to entertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.<br/><br/>At the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).<br/><br/>This is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed."

"laiagarien","5","76","120","21 October 2005"," Loosely based on the book - anachronism international
","Actually, I was highly disappointed in the movie. I admit having a strong bias towards Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and I actually said earlier that a new adaptation wasn't necessary as there is a perfectly functional BBC miniseries, but still I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I thought Keira Knightley made a very good Elizabeth. She has just the headstrong and witty nature a real Lizzy needs. But that was about the only redeeming quality of the movie I could find. Though, now I think of it, it is good that this one doesn't last six hours.<br/><br/>I am no expert on Regency life and times, but still I saw quite some anachronisms or historical inadequacies. For example, when Jane is ill at Netherfield, Bingley enters her sick chamber. Preposterous! Then, later, Lady Catherine visits when all the family was already asleep. One would never do that except in cases of severe emergency. Both Lizzy and Darcy walk around not fully clothed when they meet for the second proposal. The girls are out in society, yet wear their hair loose. Everything happened suddenly. Suddenly, Charlotte is married. Suddenly, Lydia is married. Suddenly, Lizzy goes to Derbyshire, and suddenly she's at Pemberley. They also cut out a lot of minor characters (the Hursts, the aunt and uncle in Meryton) and a lot of background story, which is of course inevitable when you want to tell the same story in less than half the time. I missed those characters, it made the evening scene at Netherfield seem lacking. Most other characters were underdeveloped as well. Col. Fitzwilliam only remained to tell Lizzy about Darcy's interference in Jane's relationship with Bingley, otherwise he'd been cut out too. I thought Bingley a schoolboy, like an older Ron Weasley. Clumsy and insecure, and not quite a gentleman. The Bennet sisters were vulgar, as was the mother, and the father had not that wit he had in the book (and P&P2). Georgiana was too confident, certainly next to her brother, who is supposed to be ten years her senior. Darcy was ""tolerable, I suppose, but not handsome enough to tempt me"". There was no real character development, again due to lack of time, and hardly a reason to dislike him except for his remark at the Meryton gathering-of-peasants. I liked the scenery, with the very old trees and the beautiful spot on the rocks, as well as the folly at Rosings and the moorland near Meryton. The Bennett family was living at a farm, not a manor. I admit this brings out the contrast with Pemberley and Rosings, but I think they outdid that. I thought Rosings and Pemberley maybe a little too large and elaborate next to the farm, certainly as neither of them is the seat of nobility.<br/><br/>I think I got my point across; I haven't really finished yet, but I'll stop now. All in all I think it would have been an enjoyable movie with some deja vu's if it hadn't been called Pride and Prejudice. Clueless, maybe?"

","In 1995 the 5 hours miniseries of Pride & Prejudice, with Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, was a big hit in England and the Netherlands. It even inspired Helen Fielding to write the Bridget Jones's novels. Therefor, whether you'll like the new 2005 movie mainly depends on the fact if you've seen the version that was done ten years ago. If you have, you'll probably be very disappointed with the Knightly movie. If you haven't, well, maybe this romantic flick may be 'amiable' enough for you.<br/><br/>For those who aren't familiar with the story: Pride & Prejudice is a romantic costume drama that takes place in 19th century England and is based on the famous novel by Jane Austen. The story is about the Bennet family, a father, mother and five or six daughters. The only way to secure the future of the children is to marry a party that owns a lot of money. Jane, the oldest sister, is beautiful but a little icy. She hopes to marry young Bingley, a rich aristocrat who just moved to a castle nearby. Her younger sister Elizabeth, the main character of the movie, wants to help her conquer his heart, but finds out that Bingley's best friend, the rich but arrogant mister Darcy, sabotages her plans. Elizabeth and Darcy start out as enemies, but as the story progresses they both find out that their opinions of each other are based on wrong information, pride and prejudice.<br/><br/>Let's bring the good news first. The new Pride & Prejudice is the big Keira Knightly show. Although she cannot top Jennifer Ehle's performance, Knightly proves that she has real star-power and that she is able to carry a movie. She looks lovely in this flick: she enchants you with her great smile and has the charms of a young Winona Ryder. Dame Judi Dench is excellent as Darcy's powerful aunt who is against a marriage and Donald Sutherland has a both moving and funny scene at the end of the movie when he gives permission to Darcy to marry Elizabeth. The end of the movie is actually better than the one in the miniseries. <br/><br/>Okay, then the bad news. I guess the main flaw of this new version is Darcy himself, a role played by Matthew MacFadyen. In the story he is rather dull and generally uninterested in what's going on. It must be difficult to replace Colin Firth as leading man and the Darcy of the miniseries of course had more (screen)time to show his inner struggle. But the new Darcy is so dull that frankly you don't care if he ends up winning Elizabeth's heart or not. There is absolutely no spark between Knightly and MacFadyen. At the end of the movie they don't even kiss and as an audience you couldn't care less. <br/><br/>But Darcy isn't the only one that seems miscast. The new mister Bingley is  despite his Jamie Oliver haircut  a real nerd, and mister Wickham, who falls in love with Elizabeth but elopes with her younger sister, lacks the depth to be an interesting villain. Because of the time-frame, the movie is less subtle than the miniseries. There's a lot to be told in two hours and because of that there is hardly any suspense. Problems rise but they are solved within minutes. But what I really missed were the great dialogs. In the miniseries heavy emotions were always masqueraded by politeness. Darcy doesn't say ""Wow, it's great to see you, Elizabeth"" but instead asks if her parents are in good health. The things that are NOT said were more interesting than the things that were indeed spoken out. The encounters between Elizabeth and Darcy always turned out to be great fights in which words and sentences were used as swords and daggers. I really missed that in the new version. Come to think of it, I also missed the humor you did see in Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility, also based on a Jane Austen novel. Where is Hugh Grant when you need him?<br/><br/>A friend of mine  also a journalist  really liked this movie. But he hadn't seen the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995. So perhaps I'm a little hard on what was presented to me last week, because the film does have its qualities.<br/><br/>7 of out of 10"

","Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. <br/><br/>Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. As I have read the book and watch the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go, before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr Darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. Where is the build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is just bizarre! It all looks put on. <br/><br/>Was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.<br/><br/>The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. Her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of England.<br/><br/>I didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that I don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, honestly Mr Bingley who has wealth should know better. There is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly donee, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. What about that laugh of his!!! I Wickham hardly has a presence and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. Keira did okay, but it just ain't the same."

"braingrease","1","99","163","22 November 2005"," Should we rejoice at the inferiority of this rendition?
","For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of adaptation problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well shot. Watch this monstrosity with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.<br/><br/>But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue such a mess.<br/><br/>First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog. And despite being the consummate romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.<br/><br/>Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the facade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of the intended pouty sex kitten allure, she looks as if a large dose of Thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.<br/><br/>Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance (in the book & BBC version) is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than Thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be a bit silly, which they are, but they both seem to be in the throes of a bad Ecstasy binge. Their squealing and twittering is relentless and positively manic. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) appears to be stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, ""big eyes and stick-up-the-arse marionette movement"" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.<br/><br/>Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first adore and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is sadly overcast as the fiery old crone, Lady Catherine de Bourg, which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste. And she brought almost too much credibility to the trivial Lady Catherine. Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of ginger hair. The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this, and not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail. But she occasionally lacked conviction in terms of her chronic ""nervous condition."" <br/><br/>When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Brontes. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC, A&E, or Masterpiece Theatre where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars."

Keira Knightley does not look or act the part (note how she chooses to act with her chin every time she gets emphatic) and I've sold lumber more charismatic and interesting than the man who plays Mr. Darcy. There are so many clichéd shots (if I ever have to see someone stare at a candle in the foreground for an entire shot while having a conversation, and then blow it out for the scene change, or a door slamming shut with a dull, resounding crash directly into the camera, I may scream.)<br/><br/>Darcy is boring; Collins is boring; Bingley looks like a woman; Mrs. Bennett is not funny as she is in the BBC version, she is merely irritating. And oh the giggling. The horrid, horrid giggling. I think a good 15 minutes of this movie is comprised of giggling. Another 15 goes to ""moving"" shots of the beautiful landscape, while Lizzie stares pensively into the distance.<br/><br/>I offer this as an especial warning to anyone who has not read the novel, who would be doing themselves a horrible disservice by seeing the movie before reading the book and watching the delightful Colin Firth BBC version - which is in every imaginable way a superior film to this sack of sugary rubbish. <br/><br/>Thank you.

","This film is bad. There are no words that do justice to what this film has done to the most beloved work of one of the greatest English authors. To start with, the film cannot seem to decide when it is set. We see scenes and costumes from a plethora of different historical periods (especially in the ballroom scenes). This is nothing to the dialogue, however, which cannot decide if it wants to be modern or self-consciously antiquated. Apparently just using Austen's dialogue would be too easy. The characters' manners wouldn't fit into any period (see Georgianna Darcy in particular). The scene of Darcy's second proposal appears to have been stolen from a Mills and Boon novel. I can only imagine that the makers of this film have never read the book or were just having a laugh. Even the acting doesn't redeem it, as even great performers collapse under an absurd script. The two leads are particularly bad as they attempt to smoulder. Please do not go to see this film, as giving them money would only serve to encourage this sort of thing."
"ByronicMadam","1","80","132","20 February 2006"," Dire adaptation of an Austen classic
","Judged as a movie in its own right, Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a disappointment. Judged as an adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel, however, it is nothing short of a travesty. For those of you already acquainted with the book, be warned; the only thing that Wright's work has in common with the Austen masterpiece is it's title. Even with the most superficial of viewings, it is clear that the script holds little more than a passing resemblance to the novel. Wright goes to great pains to include most of the story's key features, but has seemingly neither the time nor the inclination to go into any real manner of depth with them. Important plot points - such as Lydia's disappearance and subsequent elopement - are introduced and resolved so quickly that the viewer is denied the luxury of suspense. Consequently, the film feels remarkably lacking in drama, and a sense of flat detachment permeates into every aspect of the script.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this rushed pacing leaves Elizabeth's journey - both physical and emotional - reduced to mere bullet-notes, and neither she nor those around her demonstrate any growth as individuals. Characterisation is sacrificed again and again as Mr Wright's attempts to cram as much action into the allotted two-hours go increasingly awry. Much-loved characters are reduced to mere nonentities, or else distorted so greatly as to be irreconcilable with their originals. Indeed, in watching this movie, I was left doubting whether the script's writers had read their source material at all. Mr. Bingley's role was cheapened to that of the comic relief (presumably to accentuate the merits of his friend, Mr Darcy), and Georgiana Darcy - far from the sensitive young girl of the novel - is portrayed as a inanely-giggling twit. For those new to Austen's world, there are shamefully few reasons for them notice or care about these characters. Adaptation or not, there can be no excuse for such sloppy characterisation.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy too is snubbed, despite Mr Wright's pretensions towards 'gritty' realism. From the fashions to the dancing, it is clear to anyone with even a basic knowledge of the period that factual errors exist at every turn. However, these outward faults could perhaps be forgiven had the film at least attempted to remained true to the spirit of the era. Sadly, this is not the case. In attempting to modernise Austen's characters - doubtlessly due to the studio's assumption that audiences would not understand the originals - they lose all sense of credibility, and the script descends into farce as even the most basic social conventions of the day are blithely ignored. Gentlemen enter ladies bedrooms, introductions are bypassed, and Mr Darcy has apparently no qualms about walking around (and visiting his potential father-in-law) in a state of undress. Though seemingly small, such mistakes would be unthinkable in the Regency period, where a person's standing in society depended as much on their decorum as it did on their fortune. Manners and restraint act as the keystone of Austen work; they are both the driving force and the central conflict of her romances, and to remove them so completely from the script makes the whole film ring hollow.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite all this, the greatest flaw in Mr Wright's adaptation must surely be the dialogue. Far from Miss Austen's delightfully light repartee, we are instead treated to a wearily cumbersome script that fails to inspire either humour or interest, and which makes only a half-hearted attempt to remain true to it's source material. In the novel, it is dialogue that acts as the catalyst for the Darcy/Elizabeth romance - their agile debates demonstrate both wit and intelligence, and remain some of the most memorable exchanges ever committed to the English language. In the movie, however, it is difficult to discern any spark between them whatsoever. Keira Knightly's waspish Elizabeth snipes, pouts, and trills her way through their conversations, while Matthew MacFadeyn's Darcy looks bored and faintly embarrassed (though given the cringe-inducing drivel that he is forced to utter during the second proposal, I cannot say that I blame him). Frankly, there was no need for the script-writers to attempt to re-write Austen's famously sparkling dialogue. The 1995 BBC adaptation lifted most of it's lines directly from the novel itself, and was consequently hailed as the finest costume dramas of it's generation. I can hardly imagine anyone willing to subject themselves to a second viewing of Wright's dire revision.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie falls woefully short of expectations. Special blame must surely be laid at Keira Knightly, however, whose portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett sees one of literatures most beloved heroines reduced to a simpering shrew."

","I think it is saying something that the Bollywood ""Bride and PRejudice"" stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version did. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you have read the book or seen the 1995 BBC version (and liked them), you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then. My friend however, who had seen neither, was mildly amused by the film. If you are a JAne Austen purist though, or even a film-goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit through this.<br/><br/>Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors wouldn't have fared half so badly if they'd had a decent script, perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved Austen's work.<br/><br/>What travesties were committed? Well, you'll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as ""Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!"" and ""Leave me alone for once in your lives!"". Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the Regency era? The usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book. The writer also decided to give characters lines that, in the book, were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose. Worse of all, when they do try to stick a bit closer to the book's writing, the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words. It was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. Stick to Austen's words; she did it better than you! I assume all of this was done in a ""revisionist"" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 BBC version. However, for me, it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work.<br/><br/>The casting did have potential, though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in. But Keira, giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him tolerably handsome enough, misread his script and was under the impression he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really did enjoy Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really rather refreshing.<br/><br/>Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and I must say it is an apt description. And can somebody tell me why they fashioned Wickham after Legolas? Though he was in the movie for under two minutes, I daresay, and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie.<br/><br/>On a wardrobe note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency evening gown? Please! More Versace than Austen, that is sure) And poor Keira, all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they didn't catch him soon enough to comb the actresses' tresses before filming rolled.<br/><br/>In short, with this new Hollywood version, bid adieu to Austen's eloquence, subtlety and wit because you'll be getting the complete opposite."

","There are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for its ""realistic"" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people."

","From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.<br/><br/>Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.<br/><br/>The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.<br/><br/>It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache."

","The sparkling wit, the colourful detail, the absorbingly real characters and the familiar concerns of the inhabitants of Pride and Prejudice made the book and several movies into timeless classics. This new movie adaption highlights the brilliance of Austen and the excellence of a faithful reproduction.<br/><br/>Sadly, it highlights these qualities by their absence.<br/><br/>The scriptwriters have carefully excised any traces of wit or charm from the dialogue and, thanks to the removal of Austen's subtle characterisations, every piece of action and every decision is now explained in excessive detail as though the audience is not capable of the simplest interpretation.<br/><br/>An excellent example is the famous scene when Elizabeth first meets Lady Catherine de Burgh in her house at Rosings. The original scene was a cleverly played battle of wills between the two strongest characters in the story, as they pitted politeness against intrusiveness, honesty against artifice and youthful pride against middle-aged prejudice. Keira Knightley and Judi Dench, utterly failing to capture the spirit of either character and left with a poor excuse for a script, are unable to establish the tension that is needed between these characters for later plot developments to have any sense or meaning.<br/><br/>Ms Dench, so sublimely witty in the same dress as Lady Bracknell in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", is too attractive, too dignified and quite unable to capture the repressive spirit of Lady Catherine.<br/><br/>In scene after scene, the set, costume designers and directors fail to create a believable Georgian setting. Lizzy walks about the town in what appears to be a work dress, hatless and gloveless; Mr Bingley breezes into Jane's sickroom at Netherfield; Caroline Bingley parades a sleeveless dress at a ball; and Mr and Mrs Gardiner expose their niece to the vulgarities of a common tap room at an inn instead of hiring a private parlour or at least sitting in the coffee room.<br/><br/>In the end, the drama and romance can't quite carry off the final reconciliation of this poorly realised couple. One can't help feel, at the end, Keira Knightley would have made a better Lydia, or even a decent Jane. Mr Darcy is barely distinguishable from Mr Collins and disappointment lingers that Austen's clever way of setting up Charlotte Lucas as the future Mrs Collins has been replaced with a crude and unnecessary tiff between her and Lizzy.<br/><br/>The drab music is mitigated by beautiful scenery, however, and in a courageous move many parts of the movie are shot in the semi-darkness of a candlelit world. The gorgeously fashionable setting for Mr Darcy's initial scene of proposal almost makes up for the puerility of his speeches, and for a while there I really thought the movie would succeed in creating a meaty, realistic, tangible world through its crowded ballrooms and earthy minor characters.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to students and fans of Austen everywhere, as it is only when the quality of Austen is removed from the story that we appreciate how special it is."
"slainte83","1","51","85","29 November 2005"," Thank goodness many agree with me
","I am a great lover of Austen's works, especially Pride & Prejudice. The 1995 miniseries is so faithful to the novel its astounding. The actors are well chosen, there isn't modernized language thrown in, and each emotion is handled well. You can't help having your heart skip a beat when Elizabeth and Darcy finally realize they both love each other. You hate Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst. But in this latest adaption, its hard to swallow. There is no Mrs. Hurst. The Bennett family look much poorer than they are. Elizabeth walks/dresses/acts in a manner so against what women of that time would. Yes, Elizabeth Bennet is unconventional, but more in the fact that she is not afraid to express her opinions. She is, however, socially capable and proper in the way she carries herself, dresses, etc. In this, Keira walks around in cruddy clothes, and acts as though she should be down on the farm in the Midwestern USA. The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy ""can't sleep"" drove me insane. SHe would never walk out in that! The scene where Bingley just enters Jane's room as well...he would never have done that! If you haven't read the novel or seen the 1995 adaption, you'd probably love this movie. But those who love the novel or love the adaption (or both) will be very disappointed. Why there was a need to adapt this novel again, I don't know. I have nothing left to say. I know Austen would be very unhappy should she be able to see this latest movie."
"mercybell","10","94","165","9 November 2005"," Oft told tale made soulful, young
","I saw an advanced screening of this film in Boston and was very pleased, it is intelligent in its handle of the material and its fluency in cinematic crafting. Goodbye to dusty, ""precious"" interpretations of Jane Austen. This cheeky, poetic, even dark new film makes the story youthful with down-to-earth vibrancy and worship of emotion. Here are young people making the mistakes and dreaming the dreams of the young (when it was written it wasn't antiquity, it was life). Lizzie is not a smirking omniscient but a quick witted independent; hotheaded and fiercely loyal to her sister. She is wary of an unfair world and uses her wits to survive. Darcy is not an impenetrable stoic but a shy sensitive soul with high unwieldy social pretensions fending off the outside world. And they are both lonely and have big yearning hearts, so the filmmakers made one great decision -- they let them fall in love the first moment they lock eyes. In a shot we see hearts behind fortified personalities and an instant chemistry that takes a movie's worth of battling with each other and themselves to right itself. It's an earthy move that sets the tone for a film about the people and world behind the antiquated manners, a world not so different from ours. <br/><br/>Now set in 1797, when Austen wrote the first draft of the book, the filmmakers committed to main plot points and themes, and astutely represent the Romantic Age and Austen's characters. The love between Jane and Lizzie is supreme and fuels a desire in Lizzie to tear at Darcy when he separates Jane from Mr. Bingley. She's hurt, she reciprocates the pain, and it is bitter. Pride and prejudices are drawn clearly: Lizzie searches hard to find fault with Darcy, and Darcy cannot bring himself to let down his guard. Both have their reasons justified, but they foil their own chances at love constantly until they see how wrong they are and are too heartsick to keep going. Class conflict is suddenly personally injurious and vicious. When Charlotte Lucas marries for security, it's a grave matter and she must bitingly sober up a disdainful Lizzie on the realities of their world. The Bennets are too eccentric and improper for their own good. Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench, who is downright fearsome) is not just a cold figure for Lizzie to spar with, but someone capable of deeply hurting others. The filmmakers are savvy in their understanding of history. Setting it back 20 years is a remarkable move, because we accept more diversions and variation with the 18th century than the 19th and it presents Austen as a Romantic, which automatically requires the story to be interpreted from a different, very legitimate, perspective. The ideals of the Romantic Age are ingeniously, subtly played here: human equality, gritty realism married with beauty for the sake of beauty, but a beauty which is never elitist or decadent, always grounded, simple, and universal: nature, the human being, emotion. <br/><br/>The ensemble and mis-en-scene are electric. The camera spryly edges in and out of rooms and conversations instead of sitting arthritically in a corner. The dance scenes are less about ballet, now rollicking and spirited as characters send signals, flirt, deflect and analyze one another. In true Romantic form (worthy of filling Wordsworth with pride) the aesthetic unabashedly revels in beauty, but always the simple joys of our world: sunrises, dewy landscapes in wide shots, colors everywhere. It has a lovely score, period inspired and without any pomp and circumstance. Simple blocking is caffeinated and given substance, something is always going on in the background. Lively, layered interactions between characters make rich scenes, neither wasting space nor time. Consider a scene with Mr. Collins, played by the magnificent Tom Hollander (a standout here, so delightfully weird. When he jaggedly squirms his way up to someone you want to shriek). He wants to speak to Lizzie, alone, and a bolt of fear strikes through her as she pleads in vain not to be abandoned. The sisters are merciless, Mrs. Bennet delighted, Mr. Bennet at a loss, and Collins prepares. It's all silent and it's hysterical. <br/><br/>Suggesting variation to revered characters is a frightful task, but here it's a revelation. The entire cast is brilliant, but the two leads are transcendent in their roles. Keira Knightley is charismatic, random, wonderfully young, intuitive to the bone -- she inhabits Lizzie. Matt MacFadyen is deep, remarkably subtle, but mostly he is soulful. I've long held him as a sympathetic actor, but he shines in this. The two instill an unexpected exuberance of feeling in their performances. Neither ever acknowledge the camera exists and make the most of every second they have on screen to project their characters. When you throw them together you get a love story full of emotional subtext, double meaning, and gloriously heavy moments. <br/><br/>Because so much dialogue was cut, simple lines have impact and much of the exposition is visual. Epic little moments linger and rain, revealing souls. The thoughts and intentions behind the actors' eyes and words are visible at all times. This movie understands the power of a shot or glance. Lizzie comes to understand Darcy in how he embraces his sister or smiles (a momentous occasion, indeed). When she talks about love it's stirring because it's finally spilled into the open after we've seen it near the edge many times with half said sentiments and stifled tears. Usually ""I love you"" comes with extra explanatory prose, but here sincerity kills cliché: parties are fun, a misty field is breathtaking, the dawning of love a revelation, the heartbreak is throbbing. <br/><br/>It's a brilliant film. There is something breathless and luminous about it, from its youth and the break from propriety, to the beauty and spontaneity of life and romance, pain and joy, which provide the color."
"garboventures","9","98","173","12 September 2005"," Surprisingly refreshing
","I liked this film more than I ever thought I would.<br/><br/>PP is utterly engaging, emotionally resonating, and truly beautiful. Photography is lush, cinematography is outstanding, art design is impressive and director Joe Wright has a wonderful choreographic talent for organising space and people - the long tracking shots he uses for the two major (and magnificent) dance scenes, and the opening sequence at the Bennet House comprise brilliant film-making. The music is enchanting too.<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere of the film is evocative, down-to-earth, very sensual. Many may not appreciate this reading of Austen; but in my opinion this earthy, sensuous interpretation actually works surprisingly well. <br/><br/>The plot mainly focuses on Lizzie and Darcy which ensures coherency and flow and streamlines the action. Even so, Bingley and Jane are nicely-played and the relationship between Lizzy and Jane is endearing and realistic too. <br/><br/>At first Bingley is a little too comedic with his froggy bug-eyes and a shock of bright red hair, but he grows on you - his crush on Jane (a luminous Rosamund Pike) is heart-warming. His failed proposal is amusing too, as is an additional scene where Darcy 'rehearses' the proposal with Bingley.<br/><br/>Lydia and Wickham are much less-developed, and both characterisations are not so satisfying. Lydia is just too giddy and even a little vulnerable. Wickham has a touch of the sociopath  there is even a foreboding of marital violence.<br/><br/>The Bennet family is one of the highlights of this production. The chaos, warmth and humour of the household is delightful; We do hear Donald Sutherland's Canadian twang but his Mr Bennet inspires affection. Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is comical and vulgar but lovable and naturalistic too.<br/><br/>Stand-out minor characters - Mr Collins (Tom Hollander) is pitched nicely, very funny but very stiff; Penelope Wilton has a nice cameo role with Aunt Gardiner; Judi Dench's Lady Catherine de Bourgh is amusing, most especially when she hyperventilates like an angry rhino during her final confrontation with Lizzie - although it is some measure of her overall lesser importance here that this scene actually felt a little unnecessary by this stage. <br/><br/>Darcy is truly wonderful - in my opinion Matthew MacFayden nails this role. I love the Firth portrayal (BBC 1995), but have always considered it just TOO haughty and mature and confrontational, even for the novel's Darcy. Despite a shorter running time and an occasionally jarring script, MacFayden's acting is wonderfully subtle - there is a sense throughout of intense emotion barely contained ... just beneath the skin. His eyes flicker with light and shade to relay emotion. He has a powerful presence throughout.<br/><br/>As for Knightley's Lizzie - at first I didn't like her one jot. Too many teeth, too perky, clipped delivery - but she gains real gravitas as the film progresses. (Despite this she is awful in the very last scene - but that is the fault of the script). In 1995 Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie was marvellously witty, but maybe a little too matronly. Knightley's flighty Lizzie is so very different - a bright young girl grappling to come to terms with her emotional and sexual feelings. She is not the much-loved Lizzie Bennet of the book  but there are flashes. This is still a pleasing and appropriate Lizzie in the short space of time we have to know her. <br/><br/>Sure, this film is not too big on ideas and wit and verbal combat - it is fleshier, sexier, easier to understand in a digestible 2 hour fix; but it succeeds brilliantly in what it set out to do, which is to revel in Austen's world, language, and this hugely entertaining love affair. This film is primarily about falling and being in love. <br/><br/>The tense physical attraction between Lizzie and Darcy is enacted beautifully - Darcy's gaze lingers on Lizzie's neck (a beautiful neck by the way and frequently seen), and their fierce argument when he first proposes - strong acting overwhelming what was otherwise quite a clichéd scene - and their graduating sense of mutual awareness as the story progresses. Even their final sappy scene together is rather charming, albeit cloaked in dawn mists amidst thundering romantic piano music.<br/><br/>Stand-out scenes include one likely to enrage Austenite purists when Lizzie visits Pemberley and marvels at a gallery chock-full of Classical Greek marble male statues  she tearfully admires the smooth eroticism of their naked forms. The grandiose ceiling above is festooned with plump naked cherubs and scantily-clad ladies. <br/><br/>The opening scenes at the Bennet house are fabulous, Lizzie's begging her father to not allow her to marry Mr Collins by a sunset-drenched lake, and the first assembly is a rumbustious, lively affair - you can almost smell the sweat. <br/><br/>But for me the best scene in the film is the Netherfield Ball. This sequence is stunning; the camera swooping and diving throughout the action, pursuing multiple characters and story lines before the camera finally moves outside of the ballroom and finds Lizzie alone, recovering from her dance with Mr Darcy. <br/><br/>The film is packed with similar moments - the camera seems to track closer and closer to Lizzie as the plot progresses, and constantly captures subtle signs of Darcy's physical response to Lizzie's presence such as when he flexes his hand whenever he has been near to her.<br/><br/>There are also a lot of laughs in this film. Watching this is rather like quickly downing a few glasses of champagne - you feel bubbly, lightheaded, even enervated. <br/><br/>Don't expect a deeply cerebral experience. Don't expect virtuous reverence to text and period. Don't have too many pre-conceptions - just enjoy the film for what it is: silly, sexy, often very witty, visually stunning, at times remarkably subtle and beautifully acted (MacFayden is a stand-out in this department, as is Blethyn); all directed with great verve and feeling."
"linneaw-86805","10","8","10","24 April 2016"," Charming and beautiful adaption of the novel Pride and Prejudice
","My favourite adaption of the beautiful novel by Jane Austen. Joe Wright captures the beauty and romantic sphere and gives the audience beautiful photography and amazing dialogue. Keira and Matthew are a perfect match in this love story and looks so good on the screen. It has those moments where you cant help but smile and laugh and the cast couldn't have done a better job getting their characters to life. It really feels like you are walking with Elizabeth Bennet through her story. Everything in this film feels naturally and genuinely. The story as most of us probably know is that of a young girl that meets a handsome but reserved man with a big fortune. Circumstances around the two main characters makes them first wound each others pride and give in to their prejudice. In the end we get the happy ending. I strongly recommend anyone to see this beautiful and charming adaption of Pride and Prejudice."
"sshamba","1","50","84","13 December 2005"," Why another Pride and Prejudice?
","OK where do I begin? First the writing: the idiot who wrote this screenplay thought himself superior in writing to Jane Austen and decided to replace Austen's superb economy of words with his own ramblings. Second of all the whole story completely lacks the understanding of social interactions and mores that governed the early 19th century British society. At the time, a woman of 19 or 20 was expected to fully run a household and a gentlewoman was expected to handle many servants as well. Kira Knightly plays Elizabeth as a giggling airhead more at home at the main shopping drags of Paris, London and Los Angeles now than in 19th century British countryside. To add to the travesty we have Donald Sutherland playing Mr. Bennet not as a British eccentric but like an ex-hippie. It is as if Sutherland is channeling his character from Kelly's Heroes.<br/><br/>As for other characters, Darcy is forgettable. One wonders why anyone would love him Judy Densch has too much bearing to play the foolish Lady Catherine. Finally, Mrs. Bennet is not the oaf that Jane Austen makes her to be.<br/><br/>Having said all this, the main problem with this movie is that it is a ""Romantic"" movie in the true sense of the word, i.e., its heart and its values are those associated with the romantic movement of mid 19th century. However, Pride and Prejudice the book is decidedly ""unromantic"" and ""rationalistic."" While romanticism is based on rebellion against convention, Pride and Prejudice is rather a celebration of social convention. The people who would be romantic heroes in other novels, i.e., Wickham and Lydia are treated as fools and knaves. On the other hand Elizabeth and Jane, fall in love within the conventions of the day and are given full rewards and happy endings. This movie is contrary to that spirit."
"tanijakins","2","50","85","29 October 2005"," who hired the scriptwriters?
","I have given this film a score of 2, one point due to the lovely scenery, the other for the actors who worked well enough with the script they were offered.<br/><br/>Overall this film was a debacle. Perhaps it should have been called 'A film loosely based on a book by some woman of no great note' for all the credit the scriptwriters gave Jane Austen. Fans of Austen, save your money and watch the BBC version again (Firth etc). I believe it truly an insult to one of the greatest authors of history to dismember her story, words, settings and even delete all wit from one of the most perfect love stories, and observances of manner and class, of all time, <br/><br/>Even the costuming is a disaster, the wigs awful, and where were half the characters? One begins to suspect they had a very small budget after paying Keira's fee, or perhaps it was all spent on hiring the rocks who really stole the show (even though Elizabeth and her relatives are supposed to be headed for the lakes district). I am so appalled by the 'movie machine' these days, and scriptwriters please get over yourselves. you will never ever compare to the true literary greats.<br/><br/>To all those who have never heard of Jane Austen, you may well enjoy this film and go see it by all means.<br/><br/>I am so, so sorely disappointed."
"maudelynn13","1","44","74","16 April 2006"," This is a wretched adaptation of a wonderful book.
","One evening I met up with a few people to see the new Pride and Prejudice<br/><br/>I am glad I went with good company because the movie was awful. While the scenery was nice the costumes were, for the most part, atrocious. Since when would Caroline Bingley wear a completely sleeveless, 1990's Jessica McClintock dress to host a ball? And speaking of the Bingleys, the fact that both sisters are not included in the film makes it less funny. Charles Bingley, while played by an adorable actor, is portrayed as downright stupid. I adore Donald Sutherland, and i dare say would have loved him in the film, but his Mr Bennet is reduced to a simpering, weepy man who does things a farm hand would have done, not a gentleman. And speaking of farms, since when are the Bennets so destitute as to have no maids to bring in the laundry when it begins to rain? Mrs Bennet may be silly and stupid ( and in this film she is barely funny) but she would never let her house become such a wreck. Charlotte Lucas lost every bit of sense she had and was turned into a desperate, skittish creatures that screams for Lizzy not to judge her. There is no explanation as to why she marries Mr Collins. Mr Collins is the best part of the movie, a fine performance. He made me laugh several times. Kiera Knighley as Lizzie was abominable. She was weepy, showed very little spirit and generally looked like a wishy washy girl who had no idea what she wanted or stood for. She also couldn't seem to keep her nightgown on. Mr Darcy was portrayed as nothing more than shy, not at all the proud and judgmental man he starts out to be. You do not see a change in him, at all. No lessons learned on his part. It appears that Lizzie is just a whiny girl who is judging him for being so rich. Jane Bennet was lovely and I quite liked this portrayal, but still, you didn't get the true sense of the character, due to a time constraint, i am sure. Now, let's get to the major etiquette flaws that bothered me. First off, when Darcy delivers his letter to Lizzie, it is around 3 am at the Collins home and she is in her nightgown! ????? He would have been shot on sight or forced to marry her. Secondly, Lady Catherine would never ever show up at 2am to bless out Lizzie for thinking she was going to marry her nephew... Never. Full stop. And if she did Mr Bennet would never offer her tea, he would have made her leave after making great sport of her bad manners and folly. It was just a massive jumble of horrible mistakes and cheesy clichés... I, in short, hated it...."
"Quicksand","10","11","15","2 January 2006"," Wonderful Moments, Both Big and Small
","There's really nothing negative to say about the film. The actors are perfectly cast, the direction is subtle and well-realized, and even a shade more cinematic than I would have expected, or than it needed to be. The moment, early in the film, when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are arguing while dancing, and as they look at each other, everyone else in the room disappears... emotional, cinematic, and brilliant. Soft little touches like this, throughout the film, make it work far better than some dry BBC version of any Jane Austen book.<br/><br/>Yes yes, I'm male, and I enjoy a good car chase and explosion as much as the next guy. Tragically, there was none of that in this movie, but I'll get over it. Ladies, you'll want to watch this movie over and over. And guys, trust me: Even if this movie isn't your ""thing,"" if you take your date to this one, you're in good shape.<br/><br/>Ten of Ten, and that's after I saw the Bollywood ""Bride and Prejudice"" not too long ago.

"mamlukman","9","25","40","20 September 2005"," See it!
","I saw this at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival. At first I thought, ""why yet another Pride and Prejudice?"" But I quickly changed my mind. Yes, the 1995 version was wonderful, and yes, you can develop characters a lot more in a miniseries. Let it go and judge this on its own terms.<br/><br/>This version is set earlier--1797. As the director explained, he thought the Empire dresses too ugly and justified the earlier date because that was the date of the first draft of P&P. So it looks a bit different--more realistic, if you ask me. The Bennetts live in a real estate, with pigs and mud around. Chatsworth, which Jane Austen visited, fills in for Pemberley. With the exception of the ball scenes and a scene in town, very little of the epic period piece is needed.<br/><br/>Keira makes a wonderful Elizabeth. She is the right age to be vivacious and silly, and she does a great job. Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett!! At first the idea seems preposterous, but once again, it turns out well. Sutherland somehow masks his accent and blends in perfectly. His eccentricity is just enough to show where Elizabeth gets her spirit.<br/><br/>The director and Matthew MacFadyen confessed at the screening that neither had seen the earlier versions before they filmed this, which perhaps explains why this is so successful--they weren't intimidated and weren't tied to earlier interpretations.<br/><br/>If you have any doubts, see this yourself. You won't be sorry."
"showgirl626","10","12","17","25 May 2007"," A splendid and moving period piece
","I saw this movie for the first time on a premium channel, and bought the DVD shortly after. I also can't pass it up any time it's repeated on cable. I'll look forward the whole day to watching some program or another, but if I see that this movie is on, I'll forsake almost any other other program for it.<br/><br/>Though I've seen many cinematic interpretations of her work, I must confess that I've never read any Jane Austen. I generally have trouble plodding through the language from books published from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. I just tend not to have the patience for it. Anyway, I've finally, after watching this version of Pride & Prejudice for perhaps the 15th time in less than 3 months, felt compelled to share with you my tremendous love for the story, and I think - when I'm done here - that I'll go to my favorite bookstore's website and buy some of Ms. Austen's work. (Actually, I couldn't wait that long...I just paused from writing this to place an order for the literary Pride & Prejudice.)<br/><br/>The cinematography of this movie is fantastic, the locations very stirring, and the script brilliant - really lending itself to the actors' abilities to realistically interpret it with incredible depth and color. But the director, Joe Wright, deserves extra special commendation for getting such WONDERFUL work from the actors, especially Keira Knightley. Yeah, sure, she was great in Bend it Like Beckham and the Pirates trilogy, but I really didn't think she had it in her to lead a cast...much less a cast with Donald Sutherland and the mighty Dame Judy. But she really did prove me wrong. Much like Rachel Weisz did in the Constant Gardener. Keira did a fantastic job. Mind-numbingly so. Kind of scary that this is the same young lady that did Domino.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen stormed into my world with a delicate grace that suggested a deep abiding talent with which I should further acquaint myself (I hadn't been aware of him before I saw this movie). The way he and Keira traded their characters' individual pride and prejudice (they both suffered from large measures of both) was a magic dance. I can't say with any certainty right now that I've seen a portrayal of two such lovers done better.<br/><br/>What MacFadyen REALLY did for me with Darcy was the sublime nuance of his expression. Though his face really didn't change much at all - whether he was stuffy, indignant or angry - when I first saw that dazed look and tentative smile of devout worship on his face when Elizabeth was about to have that profound, private audience with her father toward the end of the movie, it was wonderful. I could really FEEL Darcy losing himself in his love for Elizabeth, and I could feel almost as strongly his relief at not having to fight it anymore. The stoic, starchy, intimidating Darcy has been reduced to a fumbling child. I thought it was the truly naked face of the character madly hinted at, but so well hidden before just then. Bewitching.<br/><br/>Every well-fleshed portrayal in this movie was done really well (it will be the actors from THIS movie that I picture when I read and re-read the book), but I must make a point of saying that Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins is brilliantly pathetic, Mr. Bennett was TRULY one of Donald Sutherland's greatest roles, and it was a great thrill to see the Dame Judy's Lady Catherine put in her place when she made that late night visit to see Elizabeth.<br/><br/>I now understand that the story of Darcy and Elizabeth is one of the greatest love stories of all time, and it's one of those grand love stories that retains its delicacy without being smarmy or ridiculous. I treasure the privilege of being allowed access to this interpretation of Pride & Prejudice, and I'll recommend it to anybody. It's destined to become a legend.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did."

"tedg","Null","93","172","23 November 2005"," Juxtapositions
","I'm amazed at how many people think of books as being encompassed by their stories. When that story appears in a film relatively unaltered, purists rejoice.<br/><br/>How silly. Stories are there as frames on which all the meaningful stuff is draped. Or so it would be after Jane Austen invented the novel. The way an idea appears has more effect than the idea itself, and so with images as well. Jane had two great inventions.<br/><br/>The first was in building two parallel narratives: one of individuals bumping into each other and the other of grander forces of life and society. The two interact at times (and much is made of these turning points) but usually the two are layered one on top of the other, shifting dominance as they go.<br/><br/>The other great invention was devising a narrative style that sometimes centered on the people and sometimes on their containing world, using the one to poke sly fun at the other.<br/><br/>So converting Austen to film is a challenge, indeed, but only if you want to capture Austen's magic. Past P&P projects have used the Merchant and Ivory approach which just takes the people alone. There is a context, but it is there only to provide lushness and decoration, not fate. Not what would become known as noir.<br/><br/>The challenge comes in how to handle the layers. We have already many ways of ""folding"" in films, but they mostly require structure in the story itself. How to introduce this notion of a second flowing layer without changing the story? Why you do it cinematically.<br/><br/>And that's what we have here. I don't know this director, but he is from TeeVee so obviously is inexperienced in these matters. I credit the producers for specifying the technique.<br/><br/>And we have it to glorious excess. Nearly every shot is structured with at least two layers, with things happening both in foreground and background. The opening scene introduces this to us, a wonderful sequence worthy of Welles, as we follow our girl down the road over a bridge behind laundry to the house. Then we leave her and enter the house and noodle around a bit, always still with layers, then wander to a window where we see her passing by behind the house.<br/><br/>Any movie only has a few moments to introduce itself and tell you how the visual world will be constructed and this does it well. This layering is kept up throughout, with a tour de force in the ball, where a seemingly seamless eye goes all over the building, capturing glances at people we know and those we don't. <br/><br/>It isn't that they do it and it is so effective. It is that it goes on so long, layers shifting and receding to be replaced by others in the scores. It is magnificent. The film is worth it for that one scene alone.<br/><br/>Oh, the actors are appealing, as we expect. The story is simplified and softened, also as we expect. The father is made less culpable, minor characters are dropped. The visit to the great house adds a sensuality the book lacked. Incidentally, that house is the same one used in ""Draughtsman's Contract"" which was specifically about this layering technique.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"darcywil","9","22","35","5 January 2006"," Enjoyed it's new perspective
","The movie is beautifully shot, the supporting cast does very well with the limited time they are on screen, and the leads are refreshingly young and passionate. Knightley is fiery and expressive; MacFadyen says so much with just a pause or a look. For those who have yet to see it, go in with an open mind and enjoy it.<br/><br/>I've read some of the (many) harsh comments written about this movie, and quite frankly, I don't understand the need to bash what amounts to a rather good interpretation of JA's book. The Austen purists have come out in droves to nitpick on every aspect and to hail the 1995 miniseries as the definitive P&P adaptation.<br/><br/>I loved the miniseries, and it gathers no dust in my DVD collection, but why be close-minded on a different view of JA's beloved characters? Does the new movie take liberties? Absolutely. With only 2 hours to fill, that is not surprising. However, I found it quite refreshing to see the characters in a new light. For example, Knightley as the youthful, not matronly, Lizzy made her sparkle, and more likely to rush to judgment. McFadyen's Darcy, played as shy and misunderstood, made me re-think the character. I'd forgotten he was only supposed to be about 28, quite young to be the lord of the manor. When I read the book, I saw him as stuffy and old. Even Firth played him as such, although he goes through a satisfying transformation by the mini-series' end.<br/><br/>Let's all remember that the miniseries took it's share of liberties on the book as well, did it not? I do not recall reading about Mr. Darcy jumping in a pond and emerging in a state of undress. And fencing? These scenes were meant to flesh out his character and add some sensuality. I believe Joe Wright is doing the same...with the Pemberley statues (vs the paintings)...with the proposal in the rain vs. in the drawing room... I, for one, am happy to see one of my favorite books played out on-screen, with a new perspective. Who knows? It may entice a new generation of movie-goers to go to the library and check out a copy..."
"fyeban","1","61","110","2 November 2005"," No Great Impact
","Some people say that we have to see this new adaptation with an open mind and that we should not compare this to that of the previous adaptations but why not? We could still compare the performances of each character couldn't we. It all comes down to how well each character acted their part. I don't believe that we should disregard the brilliance of the previous adaptation to appreciate a new one.Ten years ago I compared the 1995 BBC film to the earlier interpretations of PnP and it just blew me away. It was a perfect interpretation and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy is spot on.Watching the series made me read the book and until now It still affects me every time I watch it. Mathew Macfadden is not Mr Darcy , he is too crumpled and too soft to be Mr Darcy.He is not proud enough and Keira is not strong enough to be an intelligent Lizzie. The whole film is just not PnP. The main characters are almost in love too soon, they both don't have strong characters that made Lizzy and Darcy so perfect for each other. As a movie it is okay but not a definitive interpretation."
"kaw1990","10","23","37","18 September 2006"," A Spectacular Film
","Although I rarely give out excellent scores for movies, Pride & Prejudice of 2005 seems to demand one. Whatever flaws do exist in the film aren't even noticeable, and once you're swept into the magic of the story the spell is not broken for one moment until the television is turned off.<br/><br/>The true surprise of this movie, for me anyway, was Matthew MacFadyen's excellent portrayal of Fitzwilliam Darcy. I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's book, and Colin Firth's Darcy (although momentous in its own ways) never quite seemed to match the written account to me. MacFadyen triumphs in bringing out the vulnerability that feeds the shell of pride and his awkward shyness that lurks beyond his disdainful haughty brow. His hesitation when it comes to sharing his feelings with Lizzie Bennet are exactly what I pictured from the book: an almost boyful and youthful embarrassment paired with the desire and strength of a man. He truly shone.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley was also superb. If you believed her career was stereotyped by her work in Pirates of the Carribbean, one glance at this film should prove you wrong. She has an incredible talent to play many different roles and to bring out many different moves. The happy, carefree Elizabeth that is by shades overcome with sorrow and regret is wonderfully brought to life by Knightley.<br/><br/>The other actresses and actors in this movie are quite excellent, especially Simon Woods, whom I had not heard of before. Something that makes Pride & Prejudice a treat for the eye is the delightful filming, which whirls you throughout ballrooms and across entry halls and from conversation to conversation, dance to dance, without you even noticing that you aren't there yourself.<br/><br/>The raw desire that makes the ending so satisfactory is something that is rarely found in a PG movie, but here it is pulled off with perfect decency just in the eyes of Darcy and Lizzie. I definitely suggest giving Pride & Prejudice a try."
"collette-11","10","23","37","20 September 2005"," Brilliant, loved every moment
","I went to see this with with a degree of scepticism, and very fond memories of the TV series and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. No need to worry, I do believe they met the challenge of every English female to have watched the TV series with ""that"" scene in it and maybe even surpassed it... it took my breath away.<br/><br/>This version has been filmed with sensitivity and emotional insight, telling more with a glance here and a look there than a thousand words can say. Having said that the vocal ""sparring"" between Lizzie and Mr Darcy is both intelligent and witty. The whole picture house joined in with the journey, sighing, laughing and gasping in all the same places.<br/><br/>I felt completely at home with all the characters, Keira is wonderful as Elizabeth, Mathew Macfadyen, tremendous as Darcy, Brenda Blethyn outstanding as Mrs Bennet, Donald Sutherland a joy to watch as always. Nobody disappoints in this ensemble and I spent the most uplifting 2 hours of my time for a very long while, and left feeling happy and content, with a tear in my eye and a spring in my step."
"charlie3t8","1","85","158","23 September 2005"," Pure Americanised trash spoils a wonderful story
","I was extremely disappointed with this version of P&P, the producers really couldn't have picked a worse actress to play the role of Lizzy. Elizabeth Bennett is the most sensible of all the sisters, yet Keira attempted to play her as she does all her other characters - cute and silly, it DID NOT work. Even the costumes seemed out of place on her anorexic frame, could they not at least have given her a wonder-bra, or even some socks?<br/><br/>Darcy came across more as a sulky teenager than an English Gentleman and MacFadyen does not possess the same air of dignity and grace that is Colin Firth. In the true story, Elizabeth's love for Darcy developed so gradually, yet here it progressed too quickly and therefore spoilt the whole general feeling and suspense of the story. The film altogether was rushed through at an alarming pace without the viewer ever really getting to know a character, and the whole 'Lydia saga' seemed to be resolved and forgotten in a matter of hours. <br/><br/>The language jumped and interchanged from the original script to modern English, even during the same conversations, resulting in a very confusing mess. This was especially apparent in the first proposal from Darcy, which was so cringe-worthy I could barely stop myself from covering my ears and running out of the cinema.<br/><br/>This film was cast, produced and directed so poorly, I beg everyone to read the book or watch the original in order to enjoy this fabulous story and leave this pure Americanised trash where it belongs."
"ab-2","10","13","19","20 December 2005"," Best film of the year 2005
","The period piece has never been a favorite film genre for reviewers. There have been excellent ones, such as Barry Lyndon and awful ones, such as Sense And Sensibility. Perhaps the worst quality is the tendency for these types of films to just stop and ponder. Pride & Prejudice is thankfully not that type, but will instead enter the pantheon of great period films.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 1797. Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is trying to get her five daughters married off. In hopes of doing so, she brings them all to a dance where the dashing Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) will be attending. One of the daughters, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), falls in love with Darcy, but can't stand his arrogant personality. She tries to wow him, but is unsuccessful in many attempts. Through this tale, all the characters come to know what true love is in their own way.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely fantastic. Keira Knightley has never been as impressive as she is in this role. She projects a virgin innocence to her character. Knightley brings complexity to what could've been a clichéd, one-note female character. Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy is awesome in his role as an emotionless, unlikable man. For a film in this day and age, it was a pleasure to see such an arrogant, pompous character portrayed realistically. The scene that best stands out is at a dance party where Elizabeth offers to dance with Darcy. He turns her down, saying ""I don't dance if I can help it."" Just the sheer tone and mannerisms of his character make him unlikable in a performance that deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn, one of the greatest British actresses to grace the stage and screen, gives a magnificent and hilarious performance as Mrs. Bennet. She has such a natural ability, it doesn't seem like she is acting. There are so many layers to her character and she gives equal emotion to all her personalities and feelings. It is also great to see Donald Sutherland back on the screen, as the caring and loving father Mr. Bennet. He gives a sweet and lovable performance.<br/><br/>The actor who gives the best performance in this film is the great Judi Dench as Darcy's callous aunt. Though she doesn't have a big role, she has a fierce and imposing manner on screen that makes her impossible to ignore. She chews up the scenery every time she appears on screen. Her cold, emotionless stares send shivers down the audience's spine.<br/><br/>The writing for this movie, especially for a period piece, is quite fantastic. While it cannot be judged as an adaptation, the dialogue is not boring or overly fancy with hefty amounts of old-English colloquialisms. It has some, but overall, the dialogue is written in such a way that will satisfy audiences without confusing them. The comedic dialogue is well balanced against the dramatic side of the movie without one over powering the other. Therefore, the audience knows they are seeing a dramatic comedy, not a comedy trying to be a drama or vice-versa.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright smartly keeps the film moving at a fast pace, which happens very rarely in period pieces. In most, the directors just stop and let characters talk for what seems like forever. Instead, Wright constructs every scene with integral importance to the story.<br/><br/>He treats all the characters, especially the males, with respect. The film could've turned out to be a one-sided woman's picture, but thankfully doesn't turn out that way.<br/><br/>Wright makes the film stand out from the others in the genre. His use of the zoom and hand-held camera is quite unheard of in period pieces, but he uses them sparingly and at the right moments. His use of the zoom on a character's face during a highly emotional moment is executed very well and helps heighten the emotional effect. Overall, taking on a novel that has been adapted countless times is a daunting task, and his version is very well done.<br/><br/>A period piece can't be reviewed if the visuals are ignored. The cinematography by Roman Osin is like a beautiful painting. The lighting and colors are so vibrant and stunning, making one wish they could live in such a time period. His color schemes capture the English countryside at its best, particularly in a scene where Elizabeth is just strolling across a hill. The costumes and sets are all gorgeous as well and also enhance the love for this film. In many period pieces, these factors tend to be the main distracters in the film, thus leading to the term ""costume drama."" Going into a film with negative expectations and coming out with the exact opposite is a great feeling. Those who go into Pride & Prejudice do not have to be fans of period pieces. It is recommended that everyone goes see this film. The mature romantic nature of this story will even make the most stoic person want to bawl. Come Oscar time, this film better rack up several nominations.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A+"
"ringostarr-3","1","39","68","17 April 2006"," How to spoil a great novel...
","I cant speak English perfectly, so i hope you'll forgive me. Gosh...What to say about this movie? First, i have to say i've seen Pride & Prejudice directed by S. Langton with J.Ehle/C.Firth (BBC 1995, more than 360 mins) and i consider that film a masterpiece. Maybe i am a bit one sided when i speak about this new version of the film, but since for the very beginning of it i understood it would have been a poor thing: first of all, (as the most of the USA historical film) it is completely unfaithful: eg. in the first ball scene Lizzy asks Darcy if he wants to dance! Come on! Was Joe Wright out of his mind? A lady asks a gentleman to dance in the Victorian England period??! That's a nonsense as the most of the things shown in the movie. Second, what to say about the figure of Mr Collins? It should be a comic figure (as he was in Langton's film), but here looks more like a psycokiller. And Wickham? He is just the poor,gay, version of Orlando Bloom. What about Darcy and Bingley? the first one is really nothing in comparison with the great performance of Colin Firth and the second one is really ridiculous in the part of a weak gentleman. And Lizzy & Jane? They act like a '90 teenagers more than ancient English women. Too bad. Also Keira Knightley that usually acts good (a part to be one of he finest creature on the earth)in this film seems confused and acts hysterically in some part of it. Poor Jane Austen..."

There was no indication that she was witty, particularly intelligent or specially attached to either Jane or her father.The girls giggled a lot.Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet is a disaster. Mrs Bennet is less awful than JA intended.Mr Bingley was played as a complete idiot for cheap laughs. Mathew MacFadyen is more vulnerable than proud,there was no strength of personality.

Elizabeth is a strong character with slight nuances that intrigue; Keira Knightley showed little enthusiasm for the character, actually she had the same facial expression throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The final impression of the movie is that it was purely to show off Keira Knightley, with superfluous scenes of her looking pensive (but somehow pensive looks the same as anger, happiness, and love... interesting).

"sharon2610","10","41","73","26 October 2005"," A wonderful adaptation of a great story
","I saw this film last weekend with some trepidation. As an English teacher and an ardent Jane Austen fan I didn't think anything would come close to equaling the BBC mini-series which starred Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. In my opinion this film surpasses it. Like the 1940 Laurence Olivier/Greer Garson adaptation this does not strictly adhere to the novel, but it captures the essence of what Austen's story is all about. But in this film, never more clearly is the class distinction between Darcy and Elizabeth shown. The Bennet's are meant to be poor but respectable; Longbourn (their home) is after all, a farm. Previous incarnations have shown the class distinction through the size of the respected homesThe Bennet's Longbourn estate is still grand to many of us, but indisputably small in comparison to Darcy's home of Pemberly (Lyme Park in the BBC series, Chatworth House here). In the fashions, the distinction of rank is also preserved and we feel that to 'catch' someone like Darcy or his friend Mr Bingley is a serious achievement. The acting is wonderful from Dame Judi Dench's nasty Lady Catherine to Tom Hollander's comedic Mr Collins. Keira Knightley again shines but many may be disappointed by Matthew MacFadyen's Mr Darcy simply because he isn't Colin Firth. I love Mr Firth coming out of the lake toobut MacFadyen's performance is sterling (all those who have seen him in the TV series Spooks will not be surprised by this); he is far more Austen's Mr Darcy than his predecessors. Previous interpretations, though excellent in themselves, have, I believe, corrupted the Darcy's true nature. Austen's Darcy is moody and shy, which makes him seem arrogant and rude to those who do not know him. There are some excellent scenes (that take some liberties from the book), such as one where Darcy helps his friend practice an important speech; these reveal the truth of who these characters really are. While some sub plots are glossed over (such is the fate of squeezing so much into 2 hours) the main elements of the story are conveyed convincingly. To me this film is a wonderful adaptation that encompasses the real essence of the novel. It has made pick up Miss Austen once again (I am on page 106!!) Enjoy!"

Pride and Prejudice is not only my favourite book but the Colin Firth version is also my favourite drama and Elizabeth Bennett a strong character with a certain essence and intelligence which Knightley was incapable of bringing to the fore.

","With the exception of Tom Hollander's absurdly silly Mr. Collins, the characterization of every character is flawless. And with the exception of the overly-fluffy and stuffy period pieces first act, Joe Wright captured the spirit of Jane Austen's classic novel astonishingly: Austen's biting sarcastic, yet delicate humour runs through the vein of this film.<br/><br/>What I love the most about Jane Austen is that she has a strong control over her characters: she develops them throughout the novel so exquisitely, and she can change the reader's perception of them so gracefully. And of course that was my biggest concern about this film: I doubted that such thing can be done on screen convincingly. I daresay Moggach's screenplay managed to pay justice to the characters, and their development, in a way I've never thought it would be possible.<br/><br/>Besides the aforementioned nitpicks, I have some other quibbles: I think Lydia's elopement is a turning point in the story and the film should've laid stress on it more, and I think the same should have been applied to Mr. Darcy's ""revealing"" letters to Lizzy.<br/><br/>Other than that, I think this is an astonishing adaptation, and a one that truly benefits from being condensed - for I think the novel gets a bit monotonous at some point. All the actors and actresses are perfect for their roles: I would've never thought I would say that about Rosamund Pike having seen Gone Girl first, but she is perfect as the most innocent and persuasively ideal character, Jane Bennet. Keira Knightley delievered her best performance in her career by far, and I think out of all the roles she played, this is the only one that trully shows her talent.<br/><br/>(9/10)"

","Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my favorite books. Due to that fact, it was crucial for me to see a worthy work from the side of filmmakers and I think that they did it. In particular, they demonstrated perfectly the mood of the characters. I saw the real emotions and feelings of Mr. Darcy. The actor greatly demonstrated Darcy's stiffness and cold-blooded. I mostly liked the part when he told about his feelings to Elizabeth. At that moment I felt his nervousness with the help of his eye play. Also, I want to talk about the actress, who played the role of Elisabeth's mother. I admired her throughout the film. Of course, we all know that her characteristics are not the gooiest one and I really cannot understand her as a mother, the way how she acted with her daughters. Nevertheless, the actress, who played this role, perfectly fitted in her role and I believed her. Thus, I think that this movie is worth watching."

"christinejones89","9","5","6","10 January 2015"," One word - beautiful!
","I honestly don't understand how this film is getting bad reviews, so here's my take on it. <br/><br/>I love Jane Austin films, and I've read Pride and Prejudice many times in the past. I've also watched this film probably around 10-15 times now, which is a sign of how much I enjoy it. <br/><br/>Firstly the story itself is very similar to that of the book, I understand many people have suggested that they've made the Bennetts poor, but that's not how I understood it at all. They were wealthy enough to keep a cook and a maid, which is in keeping with the book. There were other minor differences for example, when Bingley asks Darcy if he has his blessing, this isn't in the book. I thought the setting for the film was beautiful. Very rural and typical England for the time. At some points in the film it seemed very dark, foggy, miserable and then the end scene it brightened up to sunshine (similar to the story I guess). Keira Knightley was by far my favourite in this film, she portrayed Elizabeth fantastically, even if she was a little more forward than the book states. I still got a sense of independence, free will and lots of laughter from her, and Rosamund Pike (Jane) also. Matthew Macfadyen who portrayed Mr. Darcy also did a superb job. He looks the part, and played the part wonderfully, portraying Darcy as a superior, wealthy gentleman who slowly falls in love with Elizabeth, against his better judgement. I even got the impression he was annoyed at himself for it! The props and costumes are wonderful and to detail for the time period. I think all the characters look fantastic, and the soundtracks fits the film also. I actually don't have any negative comments for this film. <br/><br/>It truly is a lovely film to watch, although I do admit, no film will ever do the book justice, but this definitely is by far the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice around."
"am546","4","161","329","13 September 2005"," Too much to prove and doesn't quite pull it off
","The problem with attempting to produce a film version of this legendary book, just 10 years after the iconic TV series, is that the film must first of all justify its own existence, and then rise above its predecessors in glorious triumph. Sadly, any adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that reduces itself to 2 hours of screening time will never achieve this feat.<br/><br/>Although there were some good performances, and some original takes on the material, director Joe Wright simply shot himself in the foot by his own endeavours. Plastering Kiera Knightley's face on the sides of all the buses in Belfast may be a good ploy to get high box office sales, but you really have to deliver once the tickets are paid for, and sadly this film does not. It is simply too short, and the trailers, which summarise the film in around 30 seconds say it all as to Wright's focus - 'There is one man whom no woman can resist... Mr Darcy!' The film is NOT about Elizabeth Bennet's relationship with Mr Darcy. It is about so much more than that, but the 2 hour time-guillotine means that these extra elements of the Austen's carefully-created society must be cut out, or tailored down to a passing reference, in order to have more time to shoot Elizabeth and/or Darcy brooding over their potential love.<br/><br/>The sequence between their meeting at Pemberley up to Lydia's marriage, which happens in literally a minute, is a case in hand. Both Lydia and Wickham (very freshly portrayed by Jena Malone and Rupert Friend) have so much potential to capitalise on their 1995 predecessors (Julia Sawalaha and Adrian Lukis), but the film simply doesn't give them time to talk, let alone shine, as it races through their scandalous alliance in seconds, without explaining why it is such a shocking event, or how it even came about.<br/><br/>An interesting innovation of the film is its tendency towards realism, seen in the squalor of Bennet living, pigs with large sperm sacs walking through the house, and a refusal to allow caricature in any of the presentations. Whereas this makes Mrs Bennet an altogether more likable and well-rounded character, it means that comedy elements such as Mr Collins (Tom Hollander) and Lady Catherine de Burgh (Judi Dench) are simply flat and lifeless. Austen's original text relies on the non-realistic elements of satire and caricature to carry those parts, and in this production it is missing.<br/><br/>Therefore, the onus is on the leads, Kiera Knightley and Matthew MacFayden, to turn this film from a mediocre remake, into a charming love story. While Knightley is exceptional as Elizabeth Bennet (although supposed attempts to make her unattractive during filming obviously didn't work - an unstraightened fringe is not equivalent to ugliness!), MacFayden fails dismally at his attempts to bring any life or originality into the character of Darcy. He spends most of the first half of the film attempting to look inscrutable but actually looking wet, and the second half of the film attempting to be loving but actually being pathetic. What MacFayden doesn't realise is that Darcy is not Mr nice-but-misunderstood. He IS actually proud and arrogant, and during the course of the plot he MUST go though a reformation. Colin Firth's spectacular 1995 performance managed to epitomise the importance of 'not-acting' a part; Darcy DOES very little, yet the energy needed to play him, and to play everything that is under the surface, is immense. MacFayden merely DOES very little; there is no under-the-surface energy anywhere.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this film was more frustrating than disappointing. Aspects of it, such as the realism of setting, and Knightley's amazing lead performance, made me want to see more of it, although to be honest, I don't think I could endure more than 2 hours of Matthew MacFayden bumbling his way through a botched Mr Darcy attempt. Yes, you've guessed it, I am a Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth/Jane Austen elitist, but not without justification I hope."

","I liked this movie excessively. It has almost all the elements of a great movie (minus action); suspense, romance, humor, wit, and British accents. The cinematography is beautiful and the movie was excellently cast. Sometimes Kiera Knightly's mouth gets a bit annoying, with her big teeth and jutting chin, but she delivers the lines just as Elizabeth Bennett would, so one can forgive her for the affectation. I love all of the Jane Austen movies (Emma, Sense & Sensibility, Mansfield Park, etc.) but this is by far the best yet. The movie inspired me to read the book (which is very good) and the movie is mostly spot on with it, which makes me like the movie even more for its integrity. I highly recommend it (catch it on the big screen if you can)."

","If you have not seen the original b+w version or the masterpiece that is the BBC mini-series you may very well enjoy this latest attempt to make Pride and Prejudice. Though exited to see this well received movie, upon watching I found myself very disappointed as I found the movie to be hap-hazard and sophomoric. There were many good actors through out and I fault none of them as the acting can only go as far as the director is willing or able to take it. This director seemed barely to understand the material or the time and place for which the tail is set. For my money, this movie was a dreadful mistake that only wets the appetite for the quality of storytelling that Austin's masterful and rich tale deserves. If one were to focus on this movies most obvious and glaring flaw it would be its abandonment of the roll of manners that colored every aspect of late 18th Century interaction and conversation. Such breeches of ethics and good manners such as getting caught ease dropping (a sophomoric 'joke' used several times in this film) would have devastated all involved. If you want to see what I mean, see the above mentioned mini-series for all the examples you could ever need."

"michkiddies","9","14","22","25 November 2005"," Pride and Prejudice
","Okay. I was fully prepared to dislike this movie. I have the 1995 A&E Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth version that I've seen hundreds of times. I really feel that has to be one of the best Austen adaptations ever.<br/><br/>When I heard Keira Knightly was going to be in this version, I was like, ""WHAT??"" I'd never really seen her act in anything remarkable. She is very pretty, and that is about it. Actually I thought she might be TOO pretty for the role. In Austen's version Elizabeth is slightly less pretty than her ""beautiful"" older sister. But not stunning.<br/><br/>However, I was really surprised by how much I loved this movie. Knightly is a bit more raw in this than other movies. She is gangly, flat-chested--not perfect. Which is actually a good thing. And casting Macfadyen was amazing. I wasn't sure how he would work out either. Another good thing that he has rugged good looks. Not those of some Hollywood hearthrob.<br/><br/>The cinematography, direction, lighting, beautiful score and acting really came together well.<br/><br/>It really zipped along, but I was amazed at how well they stuck with Austen's vision. I know some purists totally disagree. But this is a movie adaptation. It is NOT going to be exactly like the book. They do have to entertain folks who have not read the book afterall.<br/><br/>The things I liked were: I took my 13-year old daughter along (dragged actually). She actually understood the humor and laughed along in many parts. I really liked how humorous this adaptation was.<br/><br/>The countryside was lovely. And I liked how in this version they clearly displayed the difference in the Bennett wealth (or lack thereof) and the wealth of Darcy and Lady Catherine. The A&E version was not as clear on this. The Bennetts had a lovely smaller home in the A&E version--but you didn't really understand the lack of wealth per se. This movie version also clearly conveys that they live on a FARM--not some nice estate.<br/><br/>The sensual scenes were just HOT. Amazing how they could convey sexual tension without overt advances, etc. You could cut the tension of the proposal rain scene with a KNIFE it was so hot. Darcy could barely keep his hands off her or contain himself. And then you see that Elizabeth feels it too despite herself. And afterwards, I think she realizes she may have made a mistake blowing him off like she did.<br/><br/>The last couple of scenes had me practically choked up. More than the A&E version. The way Darcy's voice broke was just an amazing acting interpretation of how he must have been feeling.<br/><br/>I thought this Darcy (Macfadyen)was more sympathetic than the Colin Firth Darcy. Even though Firth nailed that version amazingly. You could see a little more emotion in the eyes of this current Darcy. He had to really punch the emotional bullet since he only had a couple of hours to show us who he was.<br/><br/>The only complaints I guess I had were I wish it had been longer. Which is not realistic. It is a movie and not a television adaptation with many parts. They left a lot of Wickham out of this movie which was probably a slight detriment. However, I thought there was a bit too much of him in the A&E version anyway. It was like ""enough already--we GET that he is a cad!!"" So I didn't really mind.<br/><br/>Also, Bingley was a tad bit buffoonish in this version. I know he is supposed to be a sweet guy. But I don't think he is supposed to be a feeble minded dork. But even he didn't bother me too much.<br/><br/>Mr. Collins was utterly hilarious. Much funnier than the A&E version. In that version you almost wanted to hit him with a fly swatter. This version was just funny.<br/><br/>And Dame Judy Dench was one ferocious Lady Catherine. You really saw how Darcy might have faced some embarrassment himself of how some of his own relatives displayed rudeness and overt judgement of others.<br/><br/>I am thrilled to get the chance to see a movie that believes viewers are smart. And not just idiots who need to be slammed with special effects and moronic dialogue. The dumbing down of television and movies is obscene!! This restores my faith in cinema (for now......) Yes I am going to see it again. FOR SURE"
"Faerietail","4","39","72","25 October 2005"," If you're after some Austen action, you've gone to the wrong movie...
","Alright, before I begin, let me establish - whilst I am both an Austen fan and a fan of the 1995 BBC Mini-Series, I am not a purist. I walked in to this film with very few expectations, and willing to accept that it would not be like the oh-so-wonderful BBC version. I was ready for a change. And I have to say, I pretty much got what I expected - just let me remind you, that wasn't a whole lot.<br/><br/>Firstly, this film is NOT Jane Austen's version of Pride & Prejudice - it's more like an odd, re-written version of P&P by Emily Bronte. Instead of the novel's original clever, witty and fairly quiet suburban, drawing room satire, director Joe Wright chose to create a lush, sweeping, romantic saga, set against stark and gloriously beautiful locations.<br/><br/>Essentially, the story is pared down to its bare roots -- Lizzie Bennett, a precocious and rather giggly girl, meets and hates-on-first-sight Mr Darcy, the uptight and taciturn friend of Mr Bingly, the new renter of Netherfield Park. Bingly, goofy, awkward and tongue-tied, is immediately enchanted by, and falls in love with, shy Jane Bennett, Lizzie's older, quieter sister. The story follows Lizzie as she first hates and then falls in love with the increasingly emotionally fragile Darcy, overcoming her prejudice towards him, and assisting Jane in establishing a relationship (and marriage) with Bingly.<br/><br/>Sadly, many wonderful (and, in my opinion, extremely necessary) characters fall to the wayside - the clever caricatures of Mr Collins (the obtuse, silly, mean spirited cousin), Mrs Bennett (now just a tad whiny but mostly lovable), Mr Bennett (indulgent rather than scathing), and Lady Catherine (still nasty and selfish, but lacking any of Austen's delicious wit) all dwindle down to not-much-ness. It's Austen, Jim, but not as we know it! <br/><br/>This film DOES have some good points - firstly, the cinematography, is just plain gorgeous. This is top class stuff - one film moment, where Lizzie stands on a mountain precipice whilst the camera sweeps around her, really made me catch my breath. Also, Matthew MacFadyen brings a very interesting new dimension to the character of Darcy - while we miss out on Darcy's clever dialogue and scathing wit, we do gain a lot of vulnerability that is interesting and really beautifully portrayed by MacFadyen. While I still think that Colin Firth has created a version of Darcy that is, in my opinion, unbeatable, MacFadyen really engaged me and had me interested.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly, on the other hand, was NOT my vision of Lizzie. Whilst she is much closer in age to the character than Jennifer Ehle (""not yet one and twenty""), she turned an outspoken, intelligent, strong, independent character in to one seriously lacking in backbone. She wavers back and forth from giggles to looking teary and forlorn -- all in all, not a character that I can imagine ANY man of intelligence falling desperately in love with.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I also found the overall change from early 19th century English Regency to late 18th century French Provincial (???) really irritating and confusing. As I understand it, the director was interested in setting the film when it was originally written (which was, admittedly, at the end of the 18th century), but what he failed to take in to account was that Jane Austen did major rewrites of all of her novels before they were published in the 19th century. However, whilst the setting would not, in my opinion, have been at all appropriate to a more faithful portrayal of the novel, the execution of the story was so different from Austen's original intentions, it hardly matters.<br/><br/>All in all, tossing aside my love of the novel, I still find I am left with a fairly mediocre film. There are some glaring historical inaccuracies (or rather, historical improprieties - such as a certain character wandering the countryside in her slippers and nightgown, to name one), the costumes are ill fitting and really unflattering for ALL of the characters (I understand the director wanted to ""ugly up"" Knightly, although I don't understand his reasoning for this - Lizzie is, after all, supposed to be very handsome) and the dialogue for the most part is uncomfortably, awkwardly changed from the original. I suspect, as well, that if I didn't know what the story was about, I wouldn't have been able to follow this film very easily.<br/><br/>To sum up, go see it if you know the story and want a new take, or don't have a clue what the story is about - you'll probably at least moderately enjoy it (and clearly, many people have). However, if you are a major fan of the book (or just like it a lot!) stick to the BBC series - Jennifer and Colin leave this version for dead."
"fatesmiled","10","16","26","11 December 2006"," it is the passion of that love story that much more clearly comes through in the movie than in the miniseries
","I was initially very skeptical of this movie. ""Why do we need another version of the book, when the BBC/A&E version was so thorough?"" I thought. I now feel that being thorough in an adaptation isn't nearly enough, and that this movie version may actually do better justice to the novel than the miniseries did.<br/><br/>I say this because the miniseries was, after all, adapted from one of the world's greatest romance novels and yet at many times is not Romantic in the generally accepted literary sense of the word (and yes, I know Austen is sometimes considered Neo-classical). The movie, in comparison, is romantic in both senses of the word. I found myself noticing the overgrown and verdant plant life in several scenes and the rainy proposal/fight scene between Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth took my breath away. By the time Darcy was walking across the field in the early morning mist to make his second proposal to Elizabeth (with a beautifully lush score accentuating the mood), I was so enraptured that I doubt even Wordsworth himself could have found words to capture my emotion.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there are parts of the 2005 movie that I am not so ga-ga over. Although Rosamund Pike is angelic as Jane, the movie incorrectly portrays her amorata Mr. Bingley as fool. Additionally, the mercenary ways of Mr. Wickham and the vicious nature of Caroline Bingley are sadly curtailed. Mary Bennet is much less priggish and Georgiana Darcy comes off as almost mischievous instead of painfully shy. And, I have to say it, I really don't like Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet. Granted, Mr. Bennet is neglectful in the book, but Sutherland plays him with a mean streak in the movie. But then again, Brenda Blethyn is so pleasantly ridiculous as Mrs. Bennet that I almost forget this. Besides, it isn't like it is Hugh Grant stomping all over the part of Edward Ferrars (don't get me started on that travesty of a mis-cast). I was saddened to find that my favorite line in the fight between Lady Catherine de Bourg and Elizabeth had been struck, but then again, casting Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine makes my complaint seem almost petty. The bottom line, as I see it, is that this is a story about two characters who fall in love the hard way, and how they are portrayed is so engaging that I can forgive nearly everything else entirely.<br/><br/>And I cannot say enough about how much I like the casting of the leads in this film. Colin Firth made being stoic downright sexy as Darcy in the miniseries, but Darcy is not made of stone in the novel. The novel makes it very clear that he is already painfully smitten with Elizabeth by the time she visits Netherfield to attend to her sick sister Jane and has a hard time keeping his emotions in check. Matthew Macfadyen does a much better job of portraying that passion, and therefore presents to us a much more approachable Mr. Darcy. The close up of him flexing his hand as he is walking back into Netherfield Hall after helping Elizabeth into the carriage is worth more than at least half of the romantic comedies of 2005 put together. As for the female lead, deciding between Jennifer Ehle and Keira Knightley would be a toss-up, but ultimately I agree with the director's assertion that the movie should be remade with younger actors. Elizabeth is 20 in the book, Darcy 28. Ehle was 26, Firth 35 when the miniseries was released, which is probably another of the reasons why that version seems so much more staid when compared to the more emotionally charged movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it was the last scene of the movie that really cinched it for me. The miniseries ends with the marriage of Jane to Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy, but the book goes on past the marriage before it ends. In the book, Lydia visits her sister sans Wickham (since Darcy refuses to let Wickham anywhere near Pemberley ever again, after what he did to Georgiana) and she is constantly hitting up her sister for money. Also, Kitty starts living nearly full-time with the Darcys, and improves greatly after being separated from Lydia. And Mr. Bennett spends a lot of time at Pemberley too, leaving Mary and Mrs. Bennett alone at Longbourne to keep each other company. All of this is neglected in the miniseries, but comes to play in the movie, if you read between the lines in that final scene.<br/><br/>I didn't catch it at first, either. I initially didn't quite get a sense of the lapse in time, but then I realized that Elizabeth and Darcy are at Pemberley and there is no way that they could have made it from Hertfordshire to Derbyshire in the few hours between sun-up to sunset. It wouldn't have been proper to be so intimate before their marriage anyway. That one scene, with its sense of what their marriage will be like after all the brouhaha is over, made me smile.<br/><br/>Which is why I say again, I think that the movie may actually be a better adaptation of the novel than the miniseries, because even though the miniseries came closer to getting all the little details right, the movie comes closer to getting at the novel's romantic heart. Austen wrote ""Pride and Prejudice"" 15 years before she wrote ""Sense and Sensibility"" and then stuck it in a drawer, and it is the passion of that first story, written at a time when the author was still quite young herself, that still draws us to the story of Elizabeth and Darcy, and it is the passion of that love story that much more clearly comes through in the movie than in the miniseries. Because of that, I feel I must get online and gush that I loved this movie."
"oldendorf1","10","16","26","25 July 2006"," Arguably the best version of an often-filmed favorite
","I had heard the controversy about the non-canonical ending, so I went in fully prepared to hate this version.<br/><br/>It's wonderful. <br/><br/>It's note-perfect throughout. It's hard to see how the casting could be improved: Jane and Mrs Bennett were perfect; Knightley was surprisingly good (who suspected that she could pull off the role of Elizabeth Bennett?); and Sutherland was born to play Mr. Bennett. The interiors, set decoration, and costumes looked perfect; the dances were astonishing - and the outdoor scenes were everything they should be. (There's a credit for ""digital effects"" - I presume that was what helped the landscapes look so good.) Poor Mr.Darcy has an impossible job following Firth's definitive performance, but he succeeds in bringing a very credible interpretation to the role.<br/><br/>All in all, I found this to be a MUCH better version than the reviews would suggest. A pleasant surprise."
"nycritic","10","16","26","12 April 2006"," The Movie Version
","Whenever there is a version of a novel that has come to be accepted as the definitive one, making a new one brings the usual baggage as to ""will it live up to the expectations"" or ""will the lead actors symbolize the characters in the book"", among other ""will there-won't there"" questions and people will make the inevitable comparisons, if at all for the sake of the comparison itself.<br/><br/>On having read Jane Austen's novel repeatedly since 1985 and knowing it by heart, and not having seen the miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle (and half of England's top actors), I was open to this interpretation, knowing it would be much shorter and that there would be the inevitable excising of plot elements in order to maintain interest in the principal story.<br/><br/>The story is exactly the same. The Bennets learn that Netherfield is to be let at last to an eligible bachelor, and all five daughters rejoice at the thought of meeting such a single bachelor. Having no sons, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have nothing to offer their daughters except an uncertain future, and at a time when women were not professionals and were married off in a hurry before they were even 20, security does become the principal issue not just within the Bennets but the Lucases.<br/><br/>But this is a story of romantic suspense in the classical form. The meeting of two people who whether they admit it or not, are very similar to each other, who due to circumstances look at these social gatherings with a turned-up nose, who due to misunderstandings and not really knowing each other come to repel each other while thinking about each other at every passing moment: such is the thing of romantic suspense at its purest. Austen, whether she was aware of structure or not (and I have reason to believe she did), knew she had to place the moment of crisis exactly in the middle of the novel, and in the film it occurs just a little past mid-point. Joe Wright brings a more turbulent feel to PRIDE & PREJUDICE -- many have said it's a blend between Austen's novel and Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"" but I think not. Only because Darcy and Elizabeth's scenes are taken out of their tidy settings and out into the open where mist and rain are ever present, and in one scene Darcy is seen riding a horse at full speed ahead, does not constitute an imitation of Bronte's novel. It would have, however, made for a very boring film to set it perpetually indoors; indeed, Austen has quite a number of external scenes, and even when she rarely mentions the weather (except when Jane Bennet makes her trek to Netherfield and falls ill there) it doesn't mean it doesn't occur.<br/><br/>It's also why the moment of release, when Elizabeth has undergone so dramatic a change, looks best at dawn, with Darcy walking in his nightclothes, all masculine longing, coming for one last time to talk to her even though he knows her answer will be yes. This specific scene would have been awful indoors, and notice Matthew MacFadyen's piercing blue eyes telling -- pouring -- emotions about to be released once Keira Knightley's luminous face faces his, and wordlessly accepts him. Just like in the novel, their declaration of love is one paragraph and as emotional as ""Wuthering Heights"". When Jane Austen writes, ""They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, to pay attention to any other objects,"" I imagined this to be pretty much as it occurs in the film. It is one of the most emotional climaxes in the history of romantic dramas and says so much more than the most dizzy, violent depiction of romantic love from writers of her generation.<br/><br/>PRIDE & PREJUDICE should be a staple for writers of romance. In keeping the two leads within touching distance from each other, not quite getting what the other is about, there is a sense of urgency -- we want them to make it into each other's arms, even if it happens in the last page (or the last scene, this being film). This being one of the most well-constructed novels of romance and one who gains more weight with every passing decade, it has also embedded itself into modern culture. It wouldn't be hard to find references of this type of story in SEX AND THE CITY, for example, in which Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big, two polar opposites, meet, fall for each other, then argue, then get separated, meet again, can't get along, can't understand each other, go on their separate ways until Mr. Big undergoes such a change towards the end of the series run that when he comes for her, we absolutely believe it and want him to rush after her, snatch her up, and bring her back home where she belongs.<br/><br/>Definitive version? Watch for yourself. But it's always best to read and enjoy the language, the texture, the characters, the urgency of the Bennet's situation, laughing at even the ridiculous characters, cheering when the deeper plots get resolved down to its epilogue when even Lady Catherine de Bourgh -- a relatively powerless dowager -- has to relent to her nephew's wife. Boy meets girl, loses girl, wins girl back has never looked so well as it does here."

","I went to see this movie without much expectation, as I was a big fan of the 1995 BBC series with Colin Firth. But my low expectations were overturned and I now consider it a much better depiction of the original novel than any of the previous adaptations.<br/><br/>I am in awe with what was achieved in only 2 hours. The characterisation and direction is so subtle, with multiple layers that repay repeated viewings. On first viewing I thought that many of the sub-plots were poorly done - Jane and Bingley, Charlotte and Mr Collins for example - but look at the background in the dancing scenes! There the many interactions of these characters show the development of their stories in a satisfying way. Even Elizabeth's relationship with her father is conveyed in a few shared glances of understanding and enjoyment - for example he starts baiting Mr Collins at the dinner table and she smoothly joins in - yes, strictly she is using lines that are Mr Bennets in the book, but it shows how much in tune father and daughter are, plus giving her a very witty, Lizzy-like observation to say.<br/><br/>In this version the Bennets are a real family, they interact naturally, even look similar and Joe Wright was very astute in developing some mannerisms that would be family traits. For example, their giggles had similar tones, and the use of the hand over the mouth, which Mr Bennet, Jane, Lizzy and Lydia all use. I also loved the fact that the actors were age-appropriate for the characters they were portraying - it made such a difference to how I perceive Lydia's antics (less knowing-slut and more young, giddy girl in love with the idea of love).<br/><br/>Another big plus for me was to see humanised Mrs Bennet, Mr Collins and even Lady Catherine - so different to the caricatures of the BBC version. This achieved a much better balance with the other characters - I could never believe that Alison Steadman could be the mother of Jane and Lizzy, or married to Mr Bennet!<br/><br/>Keira Knightley was a revelation, ably supported by a excellent cast, including Matthew Macfadyen (who has knocked Colin Firth from his pedestal).<br/><br/>The photography is brilliant as well, especially in the big dance scenes. The one-shots of the Netherfield Ball are some of the most effective I have seen. All in all, give this movie a chance, it draws you in and makes you feel you are a participant and not just a bystander."

","Couple of problems with this show; it was too short, and it wasn't long enough. This film has fast pace, high octane dance, razor sharp delivery, vivid sketches of secondary characters and breathtaking settings. Darcy comes out of his fog like a god (please include nude scenes in the extended DVD version). Lizzie is smitten early and deliciously bunged up with prejudice, watching her reach truth is a revelation. Lady Catherine de Bourg, Mr. Collins and Mr & Mrs Bennett are fresh and surprising.<br/><br/>I love the BBC production. I was blown away by this new film. How often do you get to love two versions of a story? Saw it on a big screen today. Forget about work, I'm going back tomorrow."
"mackema","10","17","28","5 September 2006"," Has become one of my three top favorite movies of all time.
","I am so sorry that I missed this at the theater. This is a very moving and wonderfully emotional love story. The actors fit beautifully within their characters, and it is hard to imagine them as any other person. I have loved watching Donald Sutherland my whole life, and he continues to surprise me with his incredible skills of interpreting a character and making me believe he is actually that person. Matthew Macfadyen is also wonderful as Mr. Darcy...just wonderful. Keira Knightly and Rosamund Pike were such believable sisters and were superb. As I watched the movie I was wishing I could be in the Bennett family with them all. Though I love seeing movies, rarely does a film pull me into it the way this one does.<br/><br/>I have had one favorite movie for most of my life (Gone with the Wind). This ""favorite"" was cracked just a tinge by the Lord of the Rings trilogy, though it was a different genre. Pride & Prejudice has taken over. I rented it two weeks ago and can't stop watching it. I love everything about it and will have to actually buy it to add to my small collection. It's a wonderful escape with a truly ""wish I were her"" ending. It varies slightly from the book but does so without removing the main scenes and dialog, and it pulls all pieces together without leaving ends hanging.<br/><br/>Thank you all for bringing such a wonderful escape to my life!"

All the other actors do a great Job, specialty Mathew Mcfyden and Jena Malone. The screenplay is absolutely perfect and very alike the original book. This movie truly deserves every award that is nominated for. It is one of the best movies ever made. I loved it. Everything on the movie was perfect.

","Pride and Prejudice is by far, one of the greatest love stories ever written. And far and away the most developed story Jane Austen wrote. This 2005 movie was wonderful and breathtaking. The script was fairly faithful, and the story line indeed faithful, but the portrayal of the characters was dramatized differently than those in Jane's book. With that said, this portrayal was beautiful and well worth the attention of Austen lovers every where.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10, removing one point only on the basis that it took liberties with the style Jane Austen portrayed in her book. Other than that, it was a magnificent!"

","After a good friend handed me Pride and Prejudice in eighth grade and implored me to read it, I have re-entered the world of the Bennet's each year wondering when a movie was going to be made that could capture Austen's characters I knew so well from the book. I was a bit skeptical at first due to some of the casting but I am glad to say I was very wrong in my prejudice. I wish I could tell the director himself how much I enjoyed his interpretation of this outstanding story. It was witty, breath taking, and the acting was so realistic you cannot help but be drawn in to the story. Matthew McFadyen did an outstanding job showing the complexities of Mr. Darcy's character while Keira Knightley brought out the independent and clever subtleties of Elizabeth Bennet. The ensemble of actors, screenwriters, set designers, and all others who worked on this film truly did a superior job. From a Jane Austen fan, this is a favorite brought to life on the screen."
"Edeline","1","29","52","25 February 2006"," Dire adaptation of an Austen classic
","Judged as a movie in its own right, Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a disappointment. Judged as an adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel, however, it is nothing short of a travesty. For those of you already acquainted with the book, be warned; the only thing that Wright's work has in common with the Austen masterpiece is it's title. Even with the most superficial of viewings, it is clear that the script holds little more than a passing resemblance to the novel. Though Wright goes to great pains to include most of the story's key features, he has seemingly neither the time nor the inclination to go into any real manner of depth with them. Important plot points - such as Lydia's disappearance and subsequent elopement - are introduced and resolved so quickly that the viewer is denied the luxury of suspense. Consequently, the film feels remarkably lacking in drama, and a sense of flat detachment permeates into every aspect of the script.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this rushed pacing leaves Elizabeth's journey - both physical and emotional - reduced to mere bullet-notes, and neither she nor those around her demonstrate any growth as individuals. Characterisation is sacrificed again and again as Mr Wright's attempts to cram as much action into the allotted two-hours go increasingly awry. Much-loved characters are reduced to mere nonentities, or else distorted so greatly as to be irreconcilable with their originals. Indeed, in watching this movie, I was left doubting whether the script's writers had read their source material at all. Mr. Bingley's role was cheapened to that of the comic relief (presumably to accentuate the merits of his friend, Mr Darcy), and Georgiana Darcy - far from the sensitive young girl of the novel - is portrayed as a inanely-giggling twit. For those new to Austen's world, there are shamefully few reasons for them notice or care about these characters. Adaptation or not, there can be no excuse for such sloppy characterisation.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy too is snubbed, despite Mr Wright's pretensions towards 'gritty' realism. From the fashions to the dancing, it is clear to anyone with even a basic knowledge of the period that factual errors exist at every turn. However, these outward faults could perhaps be forgiven had the film at least attempted to remained true to the spirit of the era. Sadly, this is not the case. In attempting to modernise Austen's characters - doubtlessly due to the studio's assumption that audiences would not understand the originals - they lose all sense of credibility, and the script descends into farce as even the most basic social conventions of the day are blithely ignored. Gentlemen enter ladies bedrooms, formal introductions are bypassed, and Mr Darcy has apparently no qualms about walking around (and visiting his prospective father-in-law) in a scandalous state of undress. Though seemingly small, such mistakes would be unthinkable in the Regency period, where a person's standing in society depended as much on their decorum as it did upon their fortune. Manners and restraint act as the keystone of any Austen work; they are both the driving force and the central conflict of her romances, and to remove them so completely from the script makes the whole film ring hollow.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite all this, the greatest flaw in Mr Wright's adaptation must surely be the dialogue. Far from Miss Austen's delightfully light repartee, we are instead treated to a wearily cumbersome script that fails to inspire either humour or interest, and which makes only a half-hearted attempt to remain true to it's source material. In the novel, it is dialogue that acts as the catalyst for the Darcy/Elizabeth romance - their agile debates demonstrate both wit and intelligence, and remain some of the most memorable exchanges ever committed to the English language. In the movie, however, it is difficult to discern any spark between them whatsoever. Keira Knightly's waspish Elizabeth snipes, pouts, and trills her way through their conversations, while Matthew MacFadeyn's Darcy looks bored and faintly embarrassed (though given the cringe-inducing drivel that he is forced to utter during the second proposal, I cannot say that I blame him). Frankly, there was no need for the script-writers to attempt to re-write Austen's famously sparkling dialogue. The 1995 BBC adaptation lifted most of it's lines directly from the novel itself, and was consequently hailed as the finest costume dramas of it's generation. I can hardly imagine anyone willing to subject themselves to a second viewing of Wright's dire revision.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie falls woefully short of expectations. Special blame must surely be laid at Keira Knightly, however, who's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett sees one of literatures most beloved heroines reduced to a simpering shrew. To quote Lady Catherine, I was 'most seriously displeased'."
"LunarKitty13","9","18","30","13 November 2005"," must...remain...faithful...to Colin Firth...and a&e...AAGH, why is it soo good?!?!
","I must admit that I went into the theatre almost completely biased and determined to dislike this movie and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy because who on earth could live up to Colin Firth's gorgeously arrogant and aristocratic portrayal of Fitzwilliam? I tried to dislike it, I tried to find fault. Damn it all, blast and wretch!! Urgh, all right, all right, it's good, it's GOOD...!! <br/><br/>Keira Knightley, i think, is a better choice for playing Lizzy because while Jennifer Ehle is a good actress and fairly attractive, Keira shows Lizzy's rough edges and unconventional beauty in the Victorian era. And I know it sounds weird, but Keira's body type fits Lizzy better I think. Jennifer has gorgeous flawless smooth white skin and is just barely plump-ish, and has perfect curls; to me this does NOT seem like Lizzy Bennett. Now Keira Knightley has a slightly almost ruddy complexion, slightly messy hair, is tall and lanky, and has pretty much no boobs. Jennifer, has boobs. It may seem weird, but it makes sense.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I loved Matthew Macfadyen even though I felt like I was betraying my dear Colin Firth. As far as the image of arrogance and self-importance, Colin succeeds better. But when it comes to Darcy informing Lizzy of his love for her, Macfadyen is better in that he really looked ticked off that he's tried so hard not to like her but he just can't help himself and that makes him even more ticked off. I could totally see the thoughts of ""I've tried SO FREAKING HARD to not even like you, let alone, love you, and I still do, it's against my better judgement, you're beneath me, it would be socially stupid of me to marry you, but god help me, I love you and I want to marry you.""<br/><br/>Mrs. Bennett, haha, she's great: a fidgety scheming nervous wreck of a woman. Wonderful. ^_^ Mr. Bennett was delightful in his own small role: laid back and does well with his few little funny bits. Judi Dench was wonderful as Lady Catherine de Bourg, although I kept thinking of her as the crotchety and full-of-vinegar Armande in ""Chocolat"". ^_^ He's ridiculous, but I felt really bad for poor Mr. Collins because no one really ever listens to him, not even his wife. Kitty and Lydia were wonderfully giggly Victorian teeny-bopper flirts.<br/><br/>I did wonder a little at the cinematography, as far as closeups went. It just seemed like every time the camera panned to another person, it would zoom in just a little when they spoke, and then when the camera panned back again, it would do its little zoom think again.<br/><br/>Costumes were great, even though I've always detested most of the Victorian styles for women. Darcy still looks good...<br/><br/>Scenery was nice, especially Darcy's house. Good freakin' LORD, that place is HUGE, and sooo NICE! Which reminds me of another character analysis: Tamzin Merchant as Georgiana was adorable! And the little knowing look she gave to her brother when Lizzy was in the room, well, it was perfect. ~_^ <br/><br/>So yes, even though it pains me and I feel disloyal to A & E and Colin Firth, I must give this film a 9 out of 10 for wonderful awkward moments, superb acting, and the most-perfect-to-date portrayal of Jane Austen's novel I have ever seen.<br/><br/>thespian wishes, <br/><br/>~*kitty Walsh*~"

","Wonderful adaptation of the classic.<br/><br/>As a fan of the BBC TV series, I arrived expecting to be disappointed. I could imagine Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy after his great role in Spooks, but must say I was sceptical of the casting of Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet) and Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet). Was I wrong! Casting was spot on and the cinematography was a visual feast. I loved the contrast between the slightly-down-at-heel Bennet house and the Great Houses. Music was wonderful throughout, as were the immersive, pulsating scenes at the Balls.<br/><br/>The story remained very faithful to the book (as far as I can remember!), with the editing along the lines of a ""Readers Digest Condensed Book"" contraction rather than wholesale re-writing. Few liberties taken here, thankfully, and those quite acceptable in the interests of fitting to the feature length.<br/><br/>Music, acting, production - all great. Go and see it.

"shepherd_moon","9","19","32","3 September 2006"," I was moved to tears
","First off, let me say that I hardly ever cry. Even when watching touching films such as ""The English Patient"" or ""Million Dollar Baby"", the most I've gone was a burning sensation in my throat.<br/><br/>I'd previously watched the BBC Miniseries of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and thought that it was pretty good. My friend recommended this one to me ages ago but I never got around to watching it until last night. And I loved it! I loved the costumes and the settings (especially the rainy scene where Elizabeth and Darcy have a little spat), and the witty dialog. The last couple of scenes in the movie (ie. when Bingley proposes to Jane, when Elizabeth and Darcy both couldn't sleep and met each other in the fields, when Elizabeth was explaining to her father how much she loved Darcy etc) were so touching that I started to cry. The actors and actresses were wonderful. I especially loved Mr Bingley, Georgiana and Mr Darcy. No matter how small a role they played, they managed to bring out the essence of the character.<br/><br/>One small note of discontent (is that possible???) is how some of the personal scenes towards the end between Elizabeth and Dary were left out from the movie. I would have liked to see them share a little kiss, just like at the end of the 1995 BBC version. *Sigh*"
"mistymidnight","9","19","32","12 August 2006"," Simply Stunning
","One of my favorite films to date, Pride and Prejudice is a film that is stunning on several levels: the performances are excellent, the soundtrack is amazing, and the cinematography is beyond comparison.<br/><br/>One of the things I love so much about this movie is the atmosphere. With many movies, people will remark that they felt like they were actually there, witnessing the story. With Pride and Prejudice, I felt not only that I was there as an observer, but that this was MY world, too. The beautiful camera-work will just draw you right in.<br/><br/>The performances were stellar. The entire cast was great, and it's interesting to note that, among the ""stars"" that made up the cast, there are several lesser known actors; this was the first movie credit for both Carey Mulligan (Kitty) and Tamzin Merchant (Georgiana).<br/><br/>However, it's important to note that this movie is not entirely like the book. (Any spoilers that follow are minor and relate to the book, not the film.) Some of my favorite scenes from the novel were cut down or didn't appear in the movie at all. Other times, lines that were originally said by one character in the novel were said by another character in the movie. (The most amusing case being Miss Bingley's mocking line to Mary, ""Indeed, much more rational, but rather less like a ball"", which was directed at Miss Bingley herself in the novel.) Most of the differences are minor; for example, the absence of Maria Lucas on the trip to Rosings Park (she didn't play much of a role in the novel, anyway) and the potential relationship between Lizzie and Colonel Fitzwilliam (never even referenced in the film...however, this plot angle never really affected the outcome of Pride and Prejudice). The situation involving Lydia's marriage was not as major a part of the movie as it was of the novel. (Personally, that was a relief to me...that portion of the novel is what I usually skip over when I re-read the book.) Georgiana's character in the film is significantly different from her character in the book--the film portrays Georgiana as much more outgoing, while the novel describes her as shy and a bit socially awkward.<br/><br/>All in all, I give this film excellent marks. It's not a word-for-word adaptation of the book, and cannot be considered a replacement for it (as in, ""Oh, I always meant to read Pride and Prejudice, but now I'll just see the movie."") Die-hard Jane Austen fans might not care for it so much, but, speaking as someone who loved both the book AND the movie, I can honestly say that it's a very satisfying and charming film.<br/><br/>9.5/10 stars"
"Lindewen","10","19","32","19 November 2005"," Wonderfully shot, lovely adaptation
","Having seen the BBC mini-series shot 10 years ago, I was really hoping that this adaptation would be just as good or better. Don't get me wrong, the mini-series was wonderful. The acting was great and so was the cinematography. But it was 6 hours long. Someone who wants to watch that needs to be really interested, or they will switch off half-way through the story. <br/><br/>I was so happy that this new adaptation managed to capture the flavour of the book, without giving up too much. Sure, everyone complains when scenes are cut, but how else are you supposed to adapt a novel without making it 6 hours long? The main points of the story were there, although I agree some more of Wickham and Lydia's story would have made the point of why it was such a scandal more clear. It was successfully adapted to 2 hours. This means that newcomers to Jane Austen's wonderful novel won't be bored to tears by the end of it. Many people can not handle that much period at once.<br/><br/>Besides the wonderful acting on everyone's part, the movie was exquisitely shot. I especially liked the shots where the camera wanders around the ball or house. It made it seem less like a movie, but more like an intimate look into what life was like. Needless to say, the costumes were wonderfully designed and beautifully made. I thought the dialogue, which stayed very true to the book when it could, was witty, interesting and made me laugh in all of the right places.<br/><br/>All in all, I couldn't ask for a better 2-hour adaptation of a classic novel."

It is indeed hard to fit all the nuances of a classic novel in two hours, but i thought they did exceptionally well with this hard task. I thought nearly all the actors did a fine job. Kiera excelled my expectations of her, and take no notice of previous comments on Matthew McFadden's role, I thought he handled it with aplomb. Brenda and Donalds pairing was inspired and both revelled in their respective roles. I took my wife to see this and she gave it ten out of ten.

The film begins by introducing you to the small crowded rooms and noisy goings on of a 5-girl middle class family.Later you will be shown the astounding austere spaciousness and silence of a very upper class abode.Socially, the dichotomy continues to be shown with the loud , merry,crowded middle class country ball v.s. the silent, low-toned restrained and awkward conversations in the drawing rooms of the wealthy. While their worlds are opposite in most ways, the main characters,Elizabeth and Darcy, are both frank, stubborn, head strong, secretive and loyal to those they love.Their relationship,the continual pulse of their push and pull, is the heartbeat of this enthralling film.The acting, every single performance, is spot-on, and the chemistry between the 2 leads is truly provocative and compelling. Do see this film soon; you will not be disappointed."
"jvmccauley","2","39","73","13 November 2005"," Sorry - This one just didn't cut it!
","First I must confess to fighting my own level of prejudice toward this subject, the new 2005 film version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" based on the Jane Austen novel. After a decade of frequently and very enjoyably watching the inner workings, delights, silliness, sadness, disappointment and joy of the Bennet family on the 1995 BBC version of this story  a 6 hour- lovingly laid out feast of character, plot, manners and love winning at last, I was unsure of what to expect of this film in spite of good reviews. I decided to remain ""open"". If you are a person with no prior context such as the BBC production you might like this new version as is. For those of us who have appreciated the films versions of Mr. Austen's books you can not help but judge this one against the others. <br/><br/>FALLING SHORT: The new film, two hours and ten minutes long would I suppose be of use as an introduction to the film adaptations of Ms. Austen's particular story, but it falls very much short of quality. In the end it doesn't even come close to matching the 1995 film versions of ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"". These were and are very well charactered, well acted gems of films with pace, grace and heroines and participants you can relate to and sympathize with. This latest adaptation of ""P and P"" is a sad bumper car ride of disappointment. <br/><br/>INSULTING THE CHARACTERS: I was shocked and insulted the way the screen writer and designers depicted the Bennet family. This was not the house of a country gentleman, with five ""country-squire"" daughters of varying beauty and intelligence or silliness, who had a loud mouth mother who was smart enough to know how to put her girls in front of rich young men. It was rather a depiction of 21st century city squalor, rudeness and impoliteness dressed in country Regency garb. I knew the film would need to move quickly but the plot ""jerked"" from scene to scene, without a breath or reflection or adequate transition. <br/><br/>The director erred seriously in this respect. Perhaps he was trying so hard to NOT make a film similar to the BBC version that he simply went to far in the other direction. My goodness the house they lived in is not shown as tidy or well-thought-of. No it is a country slum, with wash hanging everywhere; mud obviously mixed with animal leavings, stacks of everything piled everywhere, views of the full back side of a muddy, dripping, male pig walking through the house and very unkempt women and unshaven men. With the exception of the Nether field ball, ALL the actors looked like they had slept in their clothes, had hair they did not care to brush and had never been taught by their mothers how to be presentable in public. The director seems to delight in making sure that every possible wrinkle on the more senior actors was center-stage. Poor Judi Dench was the main illustration of this technique as was Elizabeth's mother. <br/><br/>WHERE WAS ELIZABETH?: The film was not about Elizabeth Bennet, her character, her spiritual worth and development, her overcoming her prejudices and misjudgments. Nay, it was not. It was a gangly, never coached in ""how to speak, talk and walk like an early 18th century lady"" Kiera Knightly bad mouthing others in a high-society English accent. She looked like a wastrel waif wearing somebody else's hand-me-down clothes. I fully expected this Elizabeth Bennet to wip out an iPod, jam the earphones in, ignore anyone talking with her and start rapping. These people did not have manners instead they had 21st century voices, walks, attitudes and postures. Mr. Darcy came across as a one-dimensional uncertainty with a monotone voice. What was it about Darcy that we should think him attractive aside from his money? Nothing. And by the end of the film when he shows up walking across the field to Elizabeth there was no anticipation of joy that they would finally come together. Rather I felt relief that the ruddy thing was coming to an end. Ms. Knightly although capable I think did not have the depth needed for this character. Move on and try again. <br/><br/>All the characters were one dimensional cut-outs with actions taken due to unexplained reasons. The film had no context, no setting, depth or presentation of rationale why these people do what they do. <br/><br/>MUSIC  FORGETFUL/ PHOTOGRAPHY-LOVELY Sadly even the music didn't measure up. For the three films mentioned earlier when you left the theater you had memories of music, themes, perhaps used to remind of the characters. Not so here. Although I enjoyed the use of solo piano music it just wasn't memorable and emotionally never carry the scene. The only good element of this film was the photography. The English countryside can be breathtaking and brilliant. It would take a really determined director to ruin that. <br/><br/>This film tried hard but it didn't learn from the success of other films that proceeded it. <br/><br/>In the end let's hope Emma Thompson and Ang Lee can team once more and fix this blemish.<br/><br/>Cheers!"
"michaelowen75","2","67","133","21 October 2005"," Austen lovers (and more particularly readers) BEWARE
","From the outset of the movie, I was hoping for something different from the BBC version, especially as it was the most recent version, and done very authentically with a wonderful realisation of Jane Austen's wit, humour and warmth. The main drawback with this production was that it was slightly sugar-coated visually, with nice warm lighting and generally a little clean. But nonetheless very authentic and true to the author, which is why many love the story so much in the first place. If you are one of these people, you will probably hate the Keira Knightley (let's-help-the-teeny-boppers-understand-great-literature) version.<br/><br/>I like the more grimy setting of this film and thought (at least initially) that it demonstrated a desire to distinguish the film from other versions. One glaring question came from the first shot of Longbourne though, which was to do with the Bennet's manservant and other servants. How can a middle-class family of the late Eighteenth Century afford two servants and a manservant, especially when Mr Bennet himself appears to be working on the farm? Also, how is it that Mr and Mrs Bennet have such a cute relationship in this film, with Jane and Lizzie being so secretive from each other. Personally, I think Jane Austen is convulsing in her grave.<br/><br/>For a horrible moment during the scene where Darcy prematurely proposes to Lizzy in Kent, I thought for terrible second that despite her rejection, they might just kiss anyway. I also thought that Lizzy might throw in a slap for good measure. Again, very poorly realised in the script. I also couldn't understand the creative team's propensity for taking some lines directly from the novel and then paring it with obviously dumbed-down lines for those who might have had the film confused with ""Bride and Prejudice"". Tricky Bs and Ps.<br/><br/>(Enough with the pouting, Keira.) <br/><br/>Poor, poor Wickham. Where was the man in this film who in the book meant so much to Lizzy (more than just a little crush) and helped her to learn so much about herself? About 4mins screen time.<br/><br/>(Enough with the girlish giggling, Keira. 'Cute' isn't going to cut the mustard here.) <br/><br/>Finally, (and mainly because I cannot bear to relive the horror of this movie much longer), did the people who wrote the script have any idea about etiquette in this era? Even if in a fit of passions, Catherine de Bourgh would never dream of invading a house in the middle of the night, unless she had recently become a highwayman. And Mr Darcy would hardly wander the fields near Longbourne at the break of day just for the opportunity to catch a glimpse of Lizzy in her nightdress. For those who just have to see it anyway, I won't spoil the incredible crassness of this moment.<br/><br/>And can I just say, why does Keira Knightley have a modern hair-do sticking out from under her wig? Weren't they paying the hairdresser enough? <br/><br/>Don't be fooled. Grimy (we're trying very hard to be authentic) presentation is just grime. And you will not be able to wipe it from your memory."

","This film looked great - the director has obviously gone for 'realism' so slightly dirty houses and clothes etc and it didn't look chocolate boxy at all which was nice. Equally, the filming was lovely in the sense of colours (really earthy and actually very English). The costumes were a bit odd however - using clothes from a slightly earlier era was fine I think... except that Caroline Bingley's bizarre mix of regency / 2005 Versace stuck out like a sore thumb. <br/><br/>The cast was OK and the film generally acted quite well. Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet was fantastic - she absolutely stole the show. Judi Dench was Judi Dench. Jena Malone as Lydia was really quite good, deliciously immature and snotty, but there wasn't enough of her - the wonderfully comic but uncomfortable sub-plot which is the Lydia/Wickham story has been completely mangled. Keira Knightly was OK with the right sort of wickedness and energy - she'd clearly watched some tapes of Jennifer Ehle do Elizabeth however! Donald Sutherland didn't really get Mr Bennet I don't think - there was something too American about him which I can't quite put my finger on. Mr Bennet is quite lively and capricious and he just wasn't really. His accent was also on occasions a little suspect. Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy OK but only OK - he certainly looked the part though. <br/><br/>The problem with the film was the script and the direction - Jane Austen does Mills and Boons basically. The entire cinema groaned for example when Darcy marches across the misty moors at the end into the arms of a bosom heaving Lizzie. The cast really suffered from a sub-standard script, particularly Darcy. Now I appreciate this might be a bit purist of me - I realise that the content of the book needs to be cut down into a two hour film but absolutely unnecessary changing of dialogue and action which would have more authentically done the job just seems pointless. The screen writer and director obviously felt the need to make things clearer but ended up making all of the relationships less believable and so the whole point of the story was missed. Basically the book is about women but in this film it felt like modern women with modern needs, independence and attitudes in fancy dress. It's not that I have a problem with that approach as such - it just means that all of the tension, comedy, tragedy and frankly eroticism which make P&P what it is has been replaced with a huge pile of clichés which are a poor replacement. <br/><br/>Subtlety is the key with Austen I think and this was not a subtle film.<br/><br/>If I'd made this film and wanted to sell it, I would be concerned about my audience to be honest. Anyone who has read and loved P&P (or even just seen the TV version) is going to be patronised and irritated by this. The other 80% of the population will think it's a fairly reasonable (but clichéd) weepy / rom com which they get from pay per view on a Sunday afternoon because it's raining. Hardly Oscar winning. <br/><br/>And one last thing. Darcy is NEVER funny. Pained yes, lonely yes, uncomfortable yes, awkward yes. Funny, NO!<br/><br/>Just an added comment about needful3's determination that we should not obsess about the TV version and give this version a chance. I'd just like to point out that most comments have been based on a comparison with the book. I personally think that the TV version had flaws too but it benefited from more time to be able to let characters and story lines develop effectively I suppose. As you've suggested, it is indeed a beautiful film. This doesn't however save the film from a poor comparison with a much loved book. I'm just a little disappointed. And I really really think that Jane Austen would have been less than proud!"
"steph123456","2","43","82","16 October 2005"," i am mortified
","Allow me to preface by saying that before viewing this version of Pride and Prejudice I carried very high standards due to my love of the novel as well as the spectacular BBC mini series. Nevertheless, I could not help but be mortified at this effort of butchering a classic. Other than the cringe-worthy portrayal of Mr. Darcy by Matthew MacFadyan, the acting was actually commendable. The actors were simply victims of a script that had an incredibly fast pace and had the nerve to alter the phrasing of Austen for a 21st century audience. I was disappointed on every occasion as I awaited one of the novel's unforgettable lines. The relationship between Mr and Mrs Bennet was also a total mystery, as the lay viewer would assume they had an amiable relationship when in truth Austen portrayed them as being largely estranged. Probably my biggest disappointment was the mangling of epic scenes such as Darcy's initial proposal to Elizabeth and Lady Catherine's confrontation of Elizabeth, both of which could have been pivotal in the movie's success. For those of you who enjoyed this film, I beg you to watch the 1995 mini-series and in turn give this monstrous effort the contempt it deserves."
"sylvian","1","30","55","11 February 2006"," Austen turned into trash
","I couldn't agree with the one star crowd more. This simply doesn't compare with the BBC series. Jane Austen's spirit is not present, the thing is witless and illustrative. Even worse, it's conceived in an eye-poking populist manner. The proper costumes of the classicist period were swapped for a mishmash of later styles for a 'better' look, and the story itself was relieved of Austen's social observations, and warped into something imponderous like a daytime soap. It's Lizzie's new version that this weightlessness is most evident in: she's all attitude and no personality. And no discipline either: she giggles downright stupidly all the time, like a spoiled brat long overdue for a punch in the nose. Watching this atrocity, I couldn't help thinking of the 'creative' team of braindeads behind it. How much they must have been struggling to make every aspect and detail 'consumable', i.e. dumb. I'm afraid they have fully achieved their goals with this mess devoid of competence, style and respect."
"parkmate","9","23","41","4 October 2005"," Yearing to see it again
","I can tell you it is beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and the UK version leaves you aching to see it again......and again......and again.<br/><br/>The distributors in the US rather patronisingly IMO decided to give what us Brits and I'm sure most intelligent Yanks would call a Hollywood Ending and much as I will enjoy seeing it in the deleted scenes part of the DVD I am glad it's not on our edit. I was lucky enough to see a Q & A where Joe & Keira both agreed that the UK version felt right. They even went to the trouble of re-shooting the ending to see if they could make the Hollywood one work but were still not satisfied. <br/><br/>I hope that's not too much info. <br/><br/>Joe Wright and Deborah Moggach have truly understood the medium of film (as opposed to TV serial drama) and distilled a wonderful story running at just over two hours from a richly textured book in such a way that stuns belief. You know there are tons of things left out but you really don't miss them. Joe said he was sad they couldn't afford to cover any of Jane's trip to London but it doesn't spoil the story. It feels totally complete. The cinematography is beautiful both from the colour and texture point of view and also the intimacy of close-ups on long lenses. Some shots are immensely complicated but they make them look so easy. <br/><br/>I'm sure you've all read that this is very much concentrating on the view from Elizabeth Bennet's eyes and this actually gives rise to enormous humour. It is not observational (as you so often find in costume drama), it is personal and intimate. I am so NOT a Keira fan but she does lend herself to this character beautifully and I do have to remind myself that she is so very young still and really does give a performance that shows experience and maturity (of technique - I'm not saying she appears too old for the part!). <br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen is wonderful and the way he is directed is so clever. For the first third of the film when Lizzie has dismissed him in her mind he is always just out of focus, wandering around in the background stealing glances of her and turning away as soon as she looks like she might see him. <br/><br/>I am sure that Matthew's dialogue could be condensed to no more than 15 pages of script but in the way that so few actors are able, he coveys 20 more pages with a few moves of facial muscle or something in his gait. I would say that 60 per cent of his storyline is communicated without words and this is where Matthew is so incredible. He leaves you aching to help him. His Darcy is so vulnerable, so confused and so inadequate to the task of unravelling his emotions. He really does not know what to do with himself. He has such huge responsibilities which he takes so seriously and yet he is bewitched by this woman and lacks the experience to cope with it. The sadness in Matthew's eyes as he struggles to work out what he can do next to win her over (or even just contrive to look at her for five seconds) is so heart wrenching. The way his voice catches when he DOES have the chance to talk to her. This enormous great man, in both stature and standing, seems so very tiny in her presence. <br/><br/>I can't finish this without giving huge mention to the pitch perfect performance (a lot of alliteration for an anxious anchorwoman - name that film!) of Tom Hollander. He almost steals the film and I had the uncontrollable shoulder shaking giggles at one of his scenes. <br/><br/>I could tell you the best bits but they will be real spoilers. I envy anyone who is looking forward to seeing this for the first time. <br/><br/>I keep telling people who have reservations about seeing the film exactly how funny it is and they immediately think I mean 'unintentionally funny'. It is SO intentionally funny and it's not like a regular costume drama at all. It's so tactile and enveloping."
"canbrooke","10","12","19","1 March 2007"," I can't stop watching it
","I just can't stop watching it. It's as if I've been taken back to this time period and just don't want to leave it. What's amazing about the relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett is, I believe, how honest they are with one another. They're conversations have everything they need to have in order to get to the heart of what Jane Austen intended and absolutely nothing that they don't need. It has probably the best dialogue in the world. This film couldn't have been done more perfectly. A big part of that is in the cinematography. It is incredibly beautiful and far different from anything I've seen before. For example, when we see Mr. Darcy in the mirror when he drops off the letter as if we are looking directly through the eyes of Elizabeth. Not to mention the breathtaking landscapes. There are hundreds more examples, but I can't possibly describe them as well as the movie can show them to you. I've never read the book, but after being so captivated by this film, I don't see how I can possibly avoid it now. I went out and bought it today. Everything about this movie is enchanting and refreshing. The truth in how they judge each other from the start, and then the honesty in how they confront each other about it. Keira Knightly brings an elegance to the character of Elizabeth along with her down to Earth manner of living and approaching people. Matthew Macfadyen is simply sublime. He doesn't even need the lines; just his facial expressions get the whole meaning across. Whenever I watch this, every scene he's in, I cannot help but stare at him the entire time, or else I feel like I'm missing something important. I hate just blinking when he's in a scene. I could go on and on about Donald Sutherland and everyone else as well, but all I basically want to say is that this film had the absolutely, hands-down, brilliant, most perfect cast that could ever have been conceived. The story line is what we might think of as being too simple. ""We"" being the spoiled audience of today who have had our heads filled with explosions and bullshit dramatic sequences. But in fact, the beauty of it is in the way Austen brings out the deeper meaning of every single seemingly insignificant event. It is a must see for all the decent, intelligent people left in the world."
"IridescentTranquility","7","6","8","25 March 2008"," Still trying to make up my mind
","I don't immediately think this is my favourite interpretation of Jane Austen's novel, but I do not hate it either.<br/><br/>The look is good - rustic England - but the Bennets' home seems a little ""farmy"". The assembly room (I assume that to be the setting for the first ball) does have a good atmosphere, though - noisy, rowdy, informal, fun English country dancing. (Not in the maypole and morris dancers sense - the type of dancing favoured at this time was actually known as ""English Country Dance"".) A tiny point I noticed is how ""of the period"" the windows at the Collins' parsonage look. The one jarring thing was that blue, white and orange ceiling at Pemberley - surrounded by the other decor it seemed tacky in such a grand house.<br/><br/>The wardrobe department doesn't give an impression of any kind of co-ordination. The dress Lizzy wears to the first ball isn't dressy enough (to say balls and such functions were a chance for the unmarried to meet potential partners) - she looks like she should be gardening in it! The Netherfield ball is odd - Caroline Bingley wearing an unusual sleeveless number and Lizzy without gloves, where every other lady (even the extras) is in both gloves and sleeved dresses. Saying that, the striking costume difference when they first arrive at the ball marks them out instantly as ""high fashion"" people compared to the locals, but their entrance is possibly too dramatic.<br/><br/>Jane looks pretty but Lizzy seems to have coiled her hair, stuck a few hairpins in and hoped for the best. Mary is plain enough to melt into the background - but the family looks mixed when Bingley returns to visit Longbourn - Jane is ""dressed up"", Kitty and Lizzy are middling and Mary looks like she should be scrubbing the steps.<br/><br/>The Lizzy I envisage doesn't listen at doors to her parents talking (Lydia and Kitty maybe, but not Lizzy) but she is kind - ie. trying to get Jane the carriage to visit Netherfield. Jane listening at the door with her sisters during Mr. Collins' proposal also seems out of character - quite an extroverted action for someone described by Charlotte Lucas as not affectionate enough with Bingley. I missed the absence of Lizzy giving a clear indication after Wickham and Lydia are married that she knows that the story he spun her had a few holes in it.<br/><br/>None of Austen's witty satire on Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's incompatibility is present. I also missed Mr. Bennet's dry wit - he sounds so laid-back, almost half-asleep in some scenes. Although she looks desperate pushing her daughters under Bingley and Darcy's noses as soon as they arrive, Mrs. Bennet obviously cares about their futures - although not shrieky as in the 1995 adaptation, you can see why Darcy finds her behaviour vulgar. When Mr. Collins discreetly asks to speak to Lizzy (as with Bingley and Jane), her haste to clear the room seems like overkill. (Incidentally, why go to the kitchen in the latter scene? Surely they had another ""good"" room to sit in?) Lydia and Kitty having their hair down adds to their youthful look. They both look about fourteen so it seems odd when Kitty states that she is older by two years. I'm not sure why Mary wears so much black and grey - is she in mourning? Her tears at Netherfield after her piano performance isn't very ""Mary-like"" - I always thought of her as vain enough to think herself brilliant. There is a nice montage of them all showing themselves up at Netherfield - in a film, time is of the essence and this is an effective way to show a lot in a very short moment.<br/><br/>My crucial issue with the script and dialogue is that, while it is well crafted from Austen's source material, it seems rushed. Darcy (who, incidentally, didn't strike me as handsome) speaks in a rude, clipped, unfriendly way even when surrounded by friends. The Bennets' maid sounds like she's reading her line (although I liked the contrast of this young girl laying out shoes and dresses for girls her own age to attend the Netherfield ball, an occasion she would never be grand enough to attend - it was sad and poignant somehow) and the Bingley footman's ""Miss Bennet"" introduction sounds silly - I'm sure ""Mrs. Bennet and her daughters"" would have sufficed.<br/><br/>At Rosings, Lizzy and Lady Catherine seem to be ""reading"" their lines. Lady Catherine's confrontation with Lizzy regarding Darcy's proposal is also rushed - it's like the film crew only had five minutes of time free in the schedule before lunch to film it. Lizzy's snappy response to her family afterwards is not in keeping with the character Keira Knighley has shown this far - more sulky teenager than witty female. When Darcy first proposes, I think they were hurrying through the script to get out of the rain. They did include many brilliant lines from the book - I especially liked Mr. Collins turning his enquiry about which cousin was responsible for the food into a kind of backhanded compliment by being pleased that the estate can generate enough to afford servants. The only downside is his voice - the ""violence of his affection"" for Lizzy described in a monotone was ironic.<br/><br/>One small thing I'm not certain of - why is the travelling in this film often done at night? Lady Catherine visits Longbourn at night, Lizzy and the Gardiners come home from Derbyshire at night - do the film makers realise that this was still an era when highwaymen were lurking around at night? I like what the film makers were trying to do - I just can't make up my mind as to whether they achieved it."
"wickedialogue","10","13","21","29 December 2005"," Best movie of 2005
","This beautiful movie did not receive the attention or screen time it deserved. Its extremely limited release in early November was followed by an only slightly more expanded release a couple of weeks later. Here in Phoenix, Arizona that release was short lived and can now only be seen on a few remaining screens. I own and watch regularly the A&E version and knew there would be comparisons. Sorry, but this film wins hands down. The chemistry between the characters and cinematography were second to none. And the soundtrack is awesome. I had to hunt high and low for it here, but it was worth the effort. I honestly believe there is a prejudice (no pun intended) here in this country about films produced in the UK. Look at how Phantom of the Opera was received here! I just wish I could express adequately my ""kudos"" to the people who obviously worked so hard on it. This film is the definitive answer to the question of whether we needed another version of Pride and Prejudice: Yes, a thousand times YES!!!!!!!"
"square-peg","7","13","21","24 September 2005"," Now read the book
","Please pay attention - this is not the lengthy 19th century novel by the genius Jane Austen, it is not 6 hours of glossy, BBC drama, this is 2 hours of cinematic story telling. Once you realise that you can forgive the omissions - quite a lot of the Wickham subplot, for example. The film-makers have pitched this back a few years and muddied it up a bit. The Bennets are well-off - they have servants and property - but it's all relative and we are encouraged to see the brink on which the fates of these five young daughters teeters. Only Mrs Bennet, often despised, but here much more than a comic caricature, realises how important it is for these girls to make a good marriage. Austen knew this only too well, as she wrote her marvellous novels in the corners of other people's houses, with never a room of her own. The look of the movie is interesting, no glamorous, bust-line enhancing empire-line dresses, no powder on the noses of the genuinely youthful cast (save Ms Knightley, I suspect), and the curls, even when pinned up for parties look a little untidy. I liked this aspect very much. Donald Sutherland's casting was a little eccentric, but he brought out a side of Mr Bennet I had always suspected - a fond, weak man, aware of his daughters' vulnerability, but unable to do anything about it - knowing as he does that marriage may bring more disappointments than mere lack of money. Now to Ms Knightley, whose charms have always bemused me. I am prepared to admit that I may have been wrong, for here she is delightful. She delivers the difficult lines with conviction and passion, her bright eyes watching everywhere for examples of human folly and frailty, her affectionate nature not able to dismiss even her irritating mother from her care and concern. And falling in love. As she pieces together the clues as to Darcy's nature she is beguiled, intrigued and, at last, smitten. And he gains a partner who understands him, something that Mr Bennet knows is far more important than mere physical attraction. Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy, suggests severe self-consciousness, arrogance masking his exposed and sensitive heart. Their scenes together are potent and persuasive. The minor characters do their part in expressing the other dimensions of the Georgian world - Lizzie's friend Charlotte making the hard-headed practical choice of marrying a man her inferior in everything except fortune; Wickham's seduction of the youngest Bennet requiring substantial pay-off before she is rescued (along with her family) from debilitating scandal. I didn't think I could come across an actor to top David Bamber's performance in the BBC dramatisation, but Tom Hollander is marvellous, raising even a little pity in the audience. The superior budget of the movie shows in the packed ball scenes, which are carried off with much bounce and energy, shadowed corners for Lizzie to catch her breath in, the sweep of the camera showing other intrigues and liaisons this film could not tell, but at least suggest are going on, in this pre-Victorian society. This film delivers a successful re-telling of an adored book. Which I now intend to re-read. Again."
"compactcutie","10","19","33","24 November 2005"," The differences and the bottom line of both
","This Chunk I've Written Does Have At Least One Spoiler. Clearly there's going to be difference between a 5hr. production and 2hr. production, and there's going to be difference between an AE production (which prefers to stay closer culturally and historically) versus a Hollywood production (which caters to the modern American). Pride & Prejudice with Kiera Knightley, I thought, was a very good MOVIE. Because it was chopped up and mixed around with enough of the original dialogue and was said to be BASED on Pride & Prejudice, it shouldn't be judged as someone trying to make a movie about the book. They took the story of the book, stayed admirably true to the events but changed the structure. They were out to make a MOVIE not a book- to-movie movie. Considering all the horror, thrillers, action/adventure, romantic comedies, and epics that are being made these days, the Kiera Knightley's Pride and Prejudice was a breath of fresh air in an American theatre - don't get me wrong, the other movie categories are all fine for the people who like them and I'm a fervent fan of them all except horror. Now, I'm Also a Jane Austen buff, so I DO realize that it didn't have the same essence of Jane Austen like the AE version, nor did it stay as detailed. However, I was charmed by the cinematography and the grittiness and the emotion of this movie. AE Pride and Prejudice is my favorite, but I want to speak up for this version as well. I said grittiness because there was a much more striking contrast between the Bennetts' home and the Bingleys'/Darcys' home. I liked that very much because it was always hard for me to see why Darcy was such a snob about their station in the AE version, since their house was well kept, pretty but only smaller and less grand. It was much easier to understand Darcy's snobbery in this movie towards their station, while in both movies the family's behavior was equally embarrassing. I disagree that Colin Firth did a Better impersonation of Darcy than Matthew MacFadyen. They were different impersonations, but I do understand why someone else said that Darcy's turmoil and reformation was much more under-the-surface-yet-tangible in the AE version, than in this recent adaption. Being someone, myself, who's been hurt and lied about, liked someone and had that person be told lies about me, I liked Matthew's portrayal of Darcy very much, because while proud, he seemed more like a man glad to burst his usual restraints of emotion for a woman that he loved romantically. While Jane Austen portrays him as much more stiff and proud, as a MOVIE CHARACTER (they were out to make a movie, not a book2movie movie) I liked him very much, and even as a variation of Fitzwilliam Darcy I liked him. Many people I knew didn't like the portrayal of Mr. Bingley. I LOVED Mr. Bingley. In the AE version, all Bingley seemed to do was smile, say his lines and smile some more; he reaked of sweetness, but only of sweetness and his performance was genuine. In this version, Mr. Bingley was given a much better portrayal of the man who was kind and sociable and not deficient in understanding, although Darcy was the clever one. In the AE version, Bingley was sickeningly sweet, polite and everything that a ""young man ought to be."" In this version, although he sometimes fell all over himself in expressing himself, he displayed all the emotions that Bingley was supposed to have. Blissfully happy(after the Netherfield ball in the morning), quietly regretful and sad (when he was leaving for London), eager (when first meeting Jane), quietly-yet-fiercely happy and grateful when Jane accepted his proposal and (to my amusement) practicing his proposal with Darcy in the agitated, not-satisfied-with-himself way; wanting it to be perfect but he was very nervous. I liked Jane very much in both versions. Lizzy... Keira WAS more homely than the norm compared to her other movies; nothing but deliberate stage makeup could hide her beauty, but Jane Austen didn't write her character to be ugly or strikingly beautiful, she was written to be mildly attractive, slender and to have her personality make her even more beautiful in the mind of the reader and in the sight of Mr. Darcy. Wickham was not as good in this movie (in my opinion) as in the AE version. It was much easier to like him and have to be torn from him in the AE version, than in this version. He was very cliché in this film and the line, ""So I was the easy-to- forget person"" (or something like that) made me think, ""Anyone who says that IS easy to forget, so you definitely are forgettable."" The cinematography was striking and passionate to me, not just hunky-dory England. The romance between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy came across as much more openly emotionally passionate, and for this movie, I liked that very much, especially because Mr. Darcy kept a pretty contained demeanor throughout the whole, which made his outbursts during the first proposal exhilarating, his second proposal adorable and his ""Mrs. Darcy kisses"" something to be wanted! --- The AE version vs. this version had more of the Jane Austen essence, but this version is not bad because of it. As a movie itself I really thought it was splendid."

","This small gem of a film was extremely well-written, a delight from start to finish, and perfectly cast; in particular, the 2 leads, Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen, were superb. Macfadyen made the character of Darcy far more sympathetic than in previous portrayals. In addition, the lead actors were closer in age to that of Lizzie and Darcy in the book. Although Austen purists criticize the editing and condensation of the book for this screen adaptation, the essence of the classic remains intact.

We should all have a mother that frets and cares so much for our future. Matthew MacFadyen offers up the most moving performance of Mr. Darcy I have yet seen in any performance of this story, and I've seen them all. His Mr. Darcy is human. How does one play an arrogant aristocrat and still show the audience such glimpses of vulnerability. This Mr. Darcy is the one I imagined when I read the novel. Bravo!

"angelic_roxy","Null","14","23","6 December 2005"," art film
","I just wanted to say that for those of you who weren't already aware, this version of Pride and Prejudice is mostly an art film. I went to see it expecting for them to focus on things like telling the story and using the witty dialouge to its utmost, and was shocked to discover that it wasn't about the story at all. The story is a backdrop in this case, used to give visual imagery to an art film. If you're going expecting something very different, hopefully this will help you not to be disappointed. There is no comparing this version of Pride and Prejudice to any other, because it is an entirely different creature. Actors cannot be compared to other actors because this version is going for an entirely different feel. Keira and Matthew are not even attempting to imitate Jennifer and Colin's performance. All comparison is moot. In this version you are not supposed to be able to become attached to the characters, be amazed by how witty the dialouge sounds, or be enchanted with the story. These all have a very rushed and glossed over feeling because the main thing here is the visual medium. It is an art film called Pride and Prejudice. All other resemblance to Jane Austen's book or previous adaptations is non existent. That being said Keira Knightly is beautiful and Mr. Collins painfully amusing and creepy. There is a lot of beautiful camera work and a lot of awkward moments. It's worth seeing to form your own opinion but be prepared for what to expect."

","First off, let me say that I did love the miniseries with Colin Firth, but he was always not my complete perception of Mr. Darcy. He just didn't have enough character development for me in the series. But in the new film, Matthew MacFadyen's Darcy is layered with emotions and character traits that all shadow and highlight his face throughout the film and make for a more exciting and more endearing Mr. Darcy than we have ever seen on screen before. I loved this film and it is now my favorite movie of the year. I also noticed that throughout the Darcy and Elizabeth scenes there were more oohs and aahs heard in the theatre than there were when I visited the diamond floor at Tiffany's in New York. Women love this movie! Count me as a new obsessed fan too. Keira Knightley is witty, sassy, charming and perfect in the role of Elizabeth and Matthew MacFadyen can do no wrong as Mr. Darcy. He is prideful,passionate, shy,loving and everything good all rolled into one hot,sexy package. Congratulations to Joe Wright for getting it right and to all the casting agents because this ensemble was perfect in every way. I can't wait for the DVD and from the reaction of the packed audience, I think it is safe to say that Mr. Darcy will appear in many more veiled mists in the minds/dreams of millions of women across the world for years to come.<br/><br/>P.S. for those who did not get the kiss ending...Call me just another American, but I like me some sugary sweet happily ever afters way better than the starch, diet ever afters."

Immediately afterward, I purchased the paperback, read it that same weekend (saying, ""Oh! Now I get it!"" several times) and went back and saw it for a second time the next weekend. Then the third weekend I convinced my adult daughter to go with me, and she loved it too. I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out! Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden are splendid - there's just not enough on-screen time with the two of them in my opinion, but actually that's true to the book.

The filming is spectacular with breathtaking views of the English countryside as well as the grit of the ""poorer"" folks homes and barns/livestock.

","Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is the second of five daughters, all single and young. When a new man moves into the neighborhood, all of the girls take notice. Mr. Bingley is quite rich and handsome enough, after all. At the first large party for area folks, Mr. Bingley comes to the festivity with his sister and the proud Mr. Darcy in toe. Bingley has his eye on Elizabeth's beautiful sister Jane while Mr. Darcy neither dances or talks to anyone. Although unacknowledged, however, Mr. Darcy is transfixed by Elizabeth and she is strangely drawn to him. Through a series of town meetings, country visits, and more, Elizabeth and Darcy meet again...and again. There is something stirring. Is is disgust or is it love?<br/><br/>This classic story could not be presented better than it is this film. It is utterly lovely in every aspect, every way. The performers are just outstanding, with Knightley giving Elizabeth the fire, the mind, the sensitivity that make her such an appealing person. Mr. McF is to sigh and cry over as his Darcy is handsome, in possession of a arresting voice, and provides a display of the great depth of his own sensitive nature. The costumes and scenery are colossally stunning, as is the editing, the script (most of it is Austen's own words), and anything else that makes a movie this beautiful. Do not let another day go by before you buy a ticket or arrange any other method to watch this film. When the credits roll, your mouth will drop open in admiration as you utter that single word, ""Wow!"""

","First of all, let me say that this was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I looked at some of the comments others have left and I wonder how this movie could get such low remarks. Granted, I have not read the book or seen the earlier movie, but, perhaps that has not influenced me either way. I some ways I am glad I didn't, because, going into this particular movie I had no expectations of what this film was about. Let me say that it was beautiful, funny, sweet, and definitely worth seeing. I will be honest and say that the majority of the audience was female. Perhaps 90%-95%. Of the few men in the audience, the ones I could see were moved to tears in a few scenes. Whats wrong with men shedding a few tears?? Its good for them. So, with that said...PLEASE, if you want to be entertained for a couple of hours, go see this film. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Aloha"
"Alicepire","10","28","52","7 November 2005"," Forget Colin Firth, THIS is how Darcy should be.
","When I went to the cinema to see the most recent adaptation of Pride and Prejudice I was sure it was going to be terrible. ""Keira Knightly playing Lizzy Bennet? You have got to be kidding?! She is too thin and beautiful and untalented and air headed to be able to assume one of the best-loved characters of English literature. And Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy? Sure he did a superb job in 'Spooks', but surely he doesn't have the depth to be able to beat, or even equal Colin Firths performance! And anyway there have been so many adaptations, another would be entirely superfluous. They're probably just going to Hollywoodise it and ruin it completely for everyone."" These were my thoughts before entering the cinema, only going to see the movie because of my love of 'Spooks'.<br/><br/>Fortunately for me (but rather unfortunately for those around me), I loved it and have become completely and utterly obsessed with it. I have since seen it another 4 times and am still impressed with how brilliant an actor Keira Knightly is, she manages to become Lizzy and make the character her own in every way. She might not be your traditional Lizzy, but she is the perfect Lizzy for this adaptation.<br/><br/>Now we all know the story of Pride and Prejudice, but in case you need your memory to be refreshed here's a quick summary: The 5 Bennett sisters: the very beautiful Jane, intelligent Lizzy, bookish Mary, naive Kitty and wild and flirtatious Lydia, their father and neurotic mother lived in Georgian England, a time when the best a young woman could hope for was to marry a rich gentleman with an optional personality. Mrs Bennet is particularly keen for her daughters to marry because, as she reminds them almost daily, when their father dies they shall not inherit the estate because it has been entailed away to their rather pathetic and highly annoying distant cousin, Mr Collins. Life for the Bennets is fairly uneventful, until the rich and kind Mr Bingly, his unpleasant sister and the seemingly unpleasant, proud and prejudiced Mr Darcy come to town and their lives are changed forever.<br/><br/>As I said Keira Knightly did a fantastic job in this movie. The scene that particularly impressed me was when she was in the sculpture room at Pemberly. To be able to convey a billion emotions of love, loss, regret, sadness, etc that are your characters and not your own to a lump of rock (albeit a beautifully carved lump of rock) must be very difficult. And with a camera circling you and the crew standing around staring at you must it must be near impossible. Yet she managed to do it with seeming ease, bringing the whole audience with her, showing the audience everything her character was going through without words or another actor to work off. To me this showed just how good an actor she really is.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen, what can be said about the breath taking performance by Matthew Macfadyen? It's the kind of performance that restores your faith in men. Forget Colin Firth, THIS is how Darcy should be. You can see that this Mr Darcy has feelings and is human. Colin Firth may have the scene where he emerges from the lake fully clothed and soaking wet. But Matthew Macfadyen has the intense stares, the beautiful eyes, the crack in his voice at Pemberly, the full body shiver during the first proposal scene and let's not forget the entire of the second proposal that had women (and men) across the world wishing that their lives could be like that, and that they had a Mr Darcy of their very own. Keeley Hawes, Matthew Macfadyens wife, doesn't know just how lucky she is.<br/><br/>But Knightly and Macfadyen aren't the only actors in this, the entire cast did a brilliant job, particularly the very very very beautiful Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet), Brenda Blethyn (Mrs Bennet), Donald Sutherland (Mr Bennet), Claudie Blakley (Charlotte Lucas) and Talulah Riley (Mary Bennet) were all very impressive.<br/><br/>My one complaint about the whole movie is that it could have done with a little more time to develop the Mr Wickham aspect of the story. It was handled so quickly that it didn't allow you enough time to see just how much and why Mr Darcy hated him. But apart from that it was perfect.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again."
"indygrass","1","24","44","29 January 2006"," A complete scandal
","After seeing the BBC miniseries version of this, I am completely taken back by this version, and not in a good way. They jumped from storyline to storyline, added too much drama, strayed from the book too much and even COPIED the BBC miniseries version! they copied it in ways such as: the nether field ball - Mary is supposed to be so accomplished, not bad at singing at all. the BBC miniseries version added that part in for interest, and then this current version COPIED that, which wasn't in the book at all. Also, a lot of the wording wasn't taken from the original book, but just the previous TV version. They crammed everything into too short a space of time and got the architecture all wrong. they skipped characters out (such as Mr and Mrs Hurst and the Gardiner's' children) and added humor into the story where the book did not indicate it. This is a minor detail, but I couldn't believe it when i saw it: Caroline actually wore NO SLEEVES only thin straps! i have researched the era of Jane Austen thoroughly and i can tell you that they NEVER did that. NEVER. it would be seen as so rude. i thought the acting woeful. Keira knightly copied Jennifer Ehle thoroughly and was hopeless. the Mr Darcy in it was arrogant, but not proud at all, which was his main problem! everyone rushed through their lines and were so plastic that i could be sick. i give the makers credit, they did contain feeling. but it was the WRONG feeling. EVERYTHING was DRAMATISED.<br/><br/>overall, the whole thing was hopeless. it was such an insult to the immortal Jane Austen's writing and i shall always remember the makers of the movie and the actors in the movie, ESPECIALLY KEIRA KNIGHTLY WHO WAS TERRIBLE with the utmost anger for ruining this completely harmless, sophisticated and magical story and turning it into a SHAM. I do not recommend ANYONE to watch it. it was woeful."
"spooksloft","4","23","42","23 November 2005"," Not what I had hoped it might be.
","I'm trying to think of a delicate way of saying how much I won't be buying it when it comes out on DVD. Visually, it was stunning. Though one wonders why so few members of the cast seem to have been allotted a hairbrush. Perhaps they spent so much on livestock for this production that, in the end, they found they could only afford one. What a pity it wasn't shared.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was superb. Judi Dench was magnificent, as always. But then, I truly believe that woman could give a compelling reading from the phone book. Matthew Mcfayden was a sultry, nigh-Heathcliffian Darcy. Tom Hollander made a creditable Mr. Collins with what little he was given. Donald Sutherland had me welling up when he did. And Tallulah Riley was the most sympathetic Mary Bennet I've ever seen.<br/><br/>But as for Keira Knightly's interpretation of Elizabeth Bennett As I told a good friend, I shall not soon be inviting Ms. Knightly to tea. Though, I would willingly strap her to a chair and feed her a pie. Like Gwyneth Paltrow before her, Ms. Knightly seems to have gone to extremes to make her Austen heroine look as underfed as humanly possible. Ms. Paltrow, however, at least played Emma truer to character than Ms. Knightly did Elizabeth. (I feel bad about that too, as I really did like her in Love Actually and Pirates of the Caribbean.)<br/><br/>She was just so unsubtle. She displayed a tongue-behind-her-teeth grin, and an irritating propensity to giggle that was far more like Lydia than Lizzy. While she didn't come off as stupid, she did come off as far less acerbic and discerning than the Lizzy of the book.<br/><br/>My other issues are that (for the sake of time) certain scenes were combined that should not have been, it changed the tone of some of the key encounters. Charlotte's getting angry with Lizzy was unexpected and out of character. I spent much of the movie having no idea which girl was Lydia and which one was Kitty, as little was done to distinguish one from the other until ""the infamous elopement"". Some of the language was, in my opinion, dumbed-down too much, supposedly for the sake of modern audiences. Certain things that Lizzy said were far too modern. (And really, who did they think would be seeing this movie anyway?) Lizzy declaring to her father that she had been completely wrong about Darcy was nonsense. A big part of the book was Darcy's transformation; he really was a pompous, posturing ass in the beginning.<br/><br/>And what on Earth was that scene at the end!? I half expected to see fireworks timed to go off with the obligatory smooch. That, or Tinkerbelle to fly by.<br/><br/>Pardon me, I must now watch all five hours of the A&E version in penance."
"magoctopus","1","36","71","6 November 2005"," Embarrassingly bad
","I think the Cliffs Notes for 'P&P' might have more of the nuance of the novel than this rubbish - and I'm not entirely convinced anyone in the production team even looked at those. This version is just bizarre - no sense of time period, how people really lived, how people behaved - why make a period film if you're not interested in the period? Good grief, there were costumes from 50 years prior to the time, and then one from the 1990s. And pigtails like Dorothy's. But that's besides the point - to paraphrase from the book, it's the total want of thematic honesty so uniformly betrayed by everyone involved in this production that absolutely sinks it. Unromantic, unfunny and completely uninteresting - if you want the pleasure of this story, curl up and read the book again."
"Sailor-21","1","25","47","12 March 2006"," Truly awful
","It takes a lot of effort and determination to turn Austen's superb novel into something truly awful. The producers, writers, director, and cast of PP2005 have managed to do just that. If you cherish the novel, don't go see this movie. If you love movies, give this one a miss. If you're feeling optimistic about the state of the arts in our time, go see this movie - you'll be cured of your optimism for a long time to come. When I had finished watching this movie I felt like undergoing ritual flagellation.<br/><br/>I couldn't find a single thing to like about this movie. It's completely over the top. From the ball, where a few fiddlers and flutists manage to sound like an 80 piece orchestra, to Blethyn's tedious and patented hysterical mother, to Dench's absurd Lady de Bourgh, to the hysteria of the five sisters, to earsplitting cacophony of the five Bennett sisters in full cackle, to Knightly's vacuous face, to . . . words fail me.<br/><br/>I'd give the movie a zero if I could. Pace, Miss Austen; this too will pass."
"ilovedolby","10","16","28","4 February 2006"," Masterful Cinema
","Jane Austen's classic novel about a young poor woman who falls in love with a rich man is masterfully crafted as one of the best love stories to hit cinema in a very long time. The story crosses the boundaries of Victorian England to be ever pertinent in today's society as it portrays relationships among different classes. Keira Knightly gives the finest performance of her career portraying the strong willed Elizabeth Bennet. Outstanding performances resonate throughout this film, most notably by Matthew Macfadyen, Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn. But it is more than a beautiful and honest love storyit is film-making at its most breathtaking. The cinematography by Roman Oshin is lavish throughout with its continuous shots that had to be meticulously choreographed. The dialogue of the screenplay is taken almost directly from Austen's book and is a fine representation of the era. Even the musical score by Dario Marianelli adds to the greatness of this moving and comical love story that was so finely directed by Joe Wright. It is the year's most delightful film."
"eduff-4","6","8","12","12 November 2005"," The realism was unauthentic.
","I felt distracted by the 'realism' of the film. Jane Austen would not have gone into detail about the 'farm' (chickens, hogs, etc.) portrayed in the film. Jane Austen's world was a gentle one and the Bennets, despite their pretensions, were middle class. The television series got it right. This film did not. The new film deviated too far from the book and the author's intent in dealing with the manners of the aspiring middle class in the early nineteenth century. Although the costumes appeared to be authentic, the makeup was too heavy; the eyebrows on the women too sculptured and the men's beard too unshaven, as are characteristic in 2005. One good feature was the variety of clothing styles form the current (early 1800s) to the outdated of Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland. I remember David Maclean saying about the film Dr. Zhivago that they forgot about the hairstyles. Here they forgot about the makeup."
"D_la","1","42","85","7 October 2005"," Oh so very boring
","Sometimes directors really make you think, make you stop and consider their work, make you want to never ever see anything in the cinema ever again because they have killed any desire you might have felt for moving pictures. Wright has almost managed to do this.<br/><br/>I mean, how does one go about transforming Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a book full of wit and humour, into something so dreadfully boring? And I can't blame the dialogue, because a lot of it was lifted directly from the book. And I can't blame the actors because I've seen them do so much better in other works, and there is one scene in this film that hints at how good this film could have been. Who is left to blame? Well, the director who instead of giving us a romantic comedy instead decided to show off his camera skills.<br/><br/>Ohh, look at the countryside. See the strange camera angle. And what was with the porcine fetish? Did I really need to get that close to a pig's testicles? The one good thing about this film, it was so terrible I was actually in fits of laughter in the middle of it. Never before has seeing some one walking, walking, walking through the misty countryside been so humorous. I'd swear I laughed for ten minutes. And I so wanted to just shout out ""How lame is this entire film"" but I resisted out of courtesy, although I'm not quite sure if anyone who enjoyed this film deserves any respect at all.<br/><br/>It may seem like I'm being a bit harsh on this film, but that is only because it deserves it. Knightly looked ridiculous in her costumes. All they did was emphasize how flat-chested she is (something that didn't crop up in Pirates), and made her look, well terrible. And speaking of terrible; Matthew McFadyen, what the hell happened to you? A man who was great as the taciturn, withdrawn character in Spooks, is here a pasty-grey faced twit."

","Alright well I've seen that some other people have given really harsh reviews for this movie. But as long as you're not going to sit and critically analyze whether or not everything is perfectly historically accurate you should love the movie. If you've read the novel you will see that some parts are left out, but it's not very damaging to the story line. Matthew MacFadyen does a great job playing Mr. Darcy, I think he really portrayed the character correctly. This is one of those movies that by the time you get to the end of the movie you can't help but grinning. I went out on a limb and randomly bought the movie just because I had read the novel and it was worth every single penny. This is definitely a must see and is now one of my favorite movies."
"gretlle","10","14","24","31 December 2005"," A Great Movie With Character Development
","I admit I was skeptical about how this movie would turn out, as the book has so much rich material, and 2 hours and 7 minutes demands a lot of adaptation to cover the essence of the story; which is the problems which arise between people who pre-judge others or jump to conclusions and then proceed to characterize everything that comes later in a bad light. What a tangled mess it becomes; but what a great story watching the emotional growth of the lead characters.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was absolutely wonderful. I have been so hooked on Colin Firth since seeing the 1995 series, that I was certain I would not like MacFadyen's character as much. But, I was wrong. He was up to the task and brought a new dimension to Darcy, that of a proud man who was socially a bit inept due to taking on a huge burden at an early age.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly was also excellent as Lizzie Bennet. I actually liked the pairing of Knightly and MacFadyen better than Ehle and Firth. Although Jennifer Ehle was an excellent actress in the 1995 version, she appeared too old to be 20 years old and too matronly in some of her dresses to give credibility to the restrained passion of the story. I guess I preferred the youthful casting which seemed more like the book.<br/><br/>The music score was outstanding in this version, and the dance scenes at the opening assembly were terrific.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this version as an addition to your P&P library. Of course, I still will watch the 5 hour BBC-A&E version when I want to see the entire story and characters, plus to get refueled for my Firth addition."
"burdphil","10","13","22","29 May 2008"," No, it's not the BBC Mini-series. It is, however, a wonderful film.
","If you are a huge fan of the 1995 BBC mini-series, or more specifically if you are a middle-aged woman who is completely obsessed with Colin Firth's Darcy and get absurdly angry at the prospect of anyone else attempting to fill that role, then you shouldn't watch this film. I'm guessing that 99% of the bad reviews this movie has received on this site have come from women who have watched the BBC version 6,000 times and are disgusted by their poor husband/boyfriend because he's not more like Firth's Darcy.<br/><br/>Ugh. I get chills just thinking about that. If you happen to be dating a woman and learn that she loves the BBC version of P&P, I would suggest that you run. Quickly. You will never live up to her expectations of a man. If you stay, you are doomed.<br/><br/>As for the 2005 version of P&P, it is a gorgeously shot and scored film. The backgrounds are lovely, the colors, tones, and music are soft and alluring, and even the transitions between scenes are often surprisingly well thought out. For example, there is one scene that ends with Elizabeth blowing out a candle which cuts directly into a shot of a whipping piece of fabric, and the two sounds are almost identical. Very clever.<br/><br/>The script does stray from the book, but I personally like that. If I want to read the book, I'll read the book (which I have done many, many times mind you). This movie expounds more on the love between Lizzy/Darcy and Jane/Bingley, and modernizes the atmosphere and the attitudes just enough to remove some of the obnoxiously dull stuffiness of England's Regency period. The actors are wonderful, particularly Knightley, but especially Simon Woods who plays Mr. Bingley. His wide-eyed, warm-hearted charm is very funny and enjoyable to watch. Donald Sutherland was very good as well, the last scene between his Mr. Bennett and Elizabeth was quite powerful and made me quite happy that I'll be the father of a baby daughter in the near future.<br/><br/>So, to summarize...<br/><br/>1) It's not the BBC version.<br/><br/>2) Colin Firth is not in it.<br/><br/>3) If you are a man who is involved with a woman who is obsessed with Colin Firth's Darcy, then I feel sorry for you.<br/><br/>4) If you appreciate quality film-making, enjoy good-humored romance stories, and don't particularly care about this movie being exactly like the book (i.e. you're not a ""Janeite""), then you'll very much enjoy it."
"tccandler","10","13","22","22 February 2006"," It doesn't get any more romantic than this...
","""Pride & Prejudice"" was quite easily the most pleasant cinematic surprise I've had in ages. It is easily the most romantic film of the year and it may just be the best.<br/><br/>Brits often complain about the repetitive nature of Hollywood formula pictures. They make a valid point despite the obscenely hypocritical tone that tends to accompany it. You see, Brits seem churn out the same seven movies over and over again...<br/><br/>Shakespeare adaptation. Elizabethan drama. WWII drama. Literary biopic. British gangster flick. Python-esquire silliness with comedian-du-jour. Austen adaptation.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong. They make some truly wonderful films. But their range isn't too daring. They have failed to match the American independent scene in terms of originality, daring and experimentation.<br/><br/>So when yet another Jane Austen adaptation comes down the pike, you'll forgive me if I tend to roll my eyes let out a weary sigh.<br/><br/>The only thing that peaked my interest for this recent version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" was the inclusion of Keira Knightley as the beloved Elizabeth Bennet and Rosamund Pike as the eldest Bennet sister, Jane. Knightley and Pike are two of the loveliest and most talented young actresses of this generation and I was curious to see them try their hands with this poetic material.<br/><br/>So with all my trepidation in tact, fully expecting to see a respectable but nonetheless uninspired British period piece, I sat down to watch director Joe Wright's version of the classic tale.<br/><br/>Within thirty seconds of the opening, I knew I was in for something unexpectedly refreshing. I had a smile on my face for the next two hours, fully enthralled with the witty trials and tribulations of the Bennet's family struggle to marry off their five daughters to respectable husbands.<br/><br/>Austen's prose shines through each and every pore of this film. Keira Knightley and company wrap their skills around every meaningful word and subtle glance in ways that will have attentive and literate fans bursting with delight. It is a delicate, complex and intricate script that will leave the witless behind in a wake of confusion.<br/><br/>WARNING: The next bit of gushing will make this very heterosexual critic sound more gay than a Wyoming Cowboy in heat.<br/><br/>This version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" made my heart soar. I wanted to hug and kiss everyone in the audience, except for that fat guy in the third row. If Keira Knightley's firecracker performance doesn't have you cheering, perhaps the heartbreaking strings and rolling piano scales of Dario Marianelli's wonderfully romantic score will have you in tears.<br/><br/>Perhaps Bingley's eventual drop to one knee will send shivers down your spine. Maybe Mr. Darcy strolling majestically through the morning mist toward his true love will have you weak at the knees.<br/><br/>Maybe the anguish of Mrs. Bennet's nerves will resonate. Or the kindly recognition of Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet will leave you warm inside.<br/><br/>Will the playful interaction of Elizabeth and Jane under the covers as they wistfully dream of true love touch your heart?<br/><br/>Will Elizabeth's journey to the edge of a cliff or the spinning solitude of a barnyard swing have your heart aching for a resolution?<br/><br/>I don't know what will touch you the most... But rest assured, something in this film will move you. If it doesn't, consider yourself emotionally numb.<br/><br/>This is a film for utter romantics. It is a film for connoisseurs of literary elegance and sly wit. These characters spar in verbal gymnastics that will leave your head spinning.<br/><br/>If Jane Austen's legendary love story is the engine to this film, Keira Knightley is the fuel. Her performance in the best of the year... from either sex. She bursts from restrained to rambunctious, elegant grandeur to rugged determination. She handles the part like a seasoned veteran who eats Shakespearean dialogue for breakfast. To paraphrase the man, she is more lovely and more temperate than a summer's day, imbuing the silver screen with the darling buds of May.<br/><br/>See, I told you this would sound gay!<br/><br/>But I don't care. This is the kind of film that can make you feel like that... like love is all that matters in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>""Pride & Prejudice"" is the best film of 2005. It is certainly the most romantic. If you are in that mode where you just need a break from all the typical British period pieces... trust me... take a look at this one. It blows them all away, virtually reinventing the genre... certainly revitalizing it. I had no earthly idea that I would find love in this story... a sentiment shared by the beautiful Lizzie Bennet."

","In this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel, Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennett, a rebellious young woman who refuses to marry the wealthy man her mother (Brenda Blethyn) has picked for her, although it would save her family from poverty. Meanwhile, her four sisters deal with their own suitors, including the mysterious Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I have never read the novel and period pieces don't really interest me so I wasn't expecting much from this movie. However, Pride and Prejudice is a solid film with an engaging romance and strong characters. The best part about the film is probably the cinematography. The whole film just looks fantastic and it has a very engaging hook to it that just please the eyes. Director Joe Wright does a good job behind the camera. He captures the romance nicely and he moves the film at a nice pace. Sometimes, the film moves slowly but the actors get it out of the rough patches.<br/><br/>Out of the entire cast, I would say that Donald Sutherland gives the best performance. It seemed a little simple but it was still pretty nice. Keira Knightley also gives a good performance though I don't agree with her Oscar nomination. Her character is portrayed as a different girl and not one that giggles at everything. In the beginning of the film, Keira is too giggly and it didn't fit the character though she gets better as the film progresses. Rosamund Pike gives a good performance even if her character is a little dull. Jena Malone gives an annoying performance but it fits her character so I would say that she did a good job. Brenda Blethyn gives a funny performance as Elizabeth's mother and she has some memorable scenes with Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen also gives a strong performance and he has great chemistry with Keira. The two of them make a predictable story engaging at times thanks to their performances. There were a couple of things that I didn't like about the movie though. There were a few cheesy scenes that were kind of unnecessary. For example, at the end of the film when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are kissing, there is this huge yellow sunset in the background and I felt that it was a little too much. Of course some things are just unavoidable in chick flicks. The screenplay is pretty good though I don't know how faithful it is compared to the book. The score is also pretty good and it's easy to tell why it got nominated for an Oscar. Most of the film is just top notch and it's defiantly a film for both girls and guys. In the end, this wonderful surprise is worth checking out. Rating 8/10"

","I confess I've loved her ever since our meeting seven years ago. Whereas I used to abuse her with a Darcy-like arrogance, ""my knowing her better improved my opinion"" of her. Jane Austen--after my wife--has been one of the most influential females in my life. She's witty, wise, and can pin a scoundrel down like an eight year old boy can pin down an insect on cardboard. Bottom line, I love the woman for her gifts to humanity. <br/><br/>Pride & Prejudice being one of my favorite books (and the Firth-Ehle movie version a cinematic staple in our home), I cringed at the thought of a 127 minute version. But alas...my wife, sister, and I happily journeyed to the theater for at the very least a few moments of Austen enjoyment.<br/><br/>About a half hour into the film I felt like I was watching someone try to play a super-glued accordion: the scenes had no breathing space; hence no music. I noticed my wife's restlessness concerning which, when I asked her about it, she replied that ""This version seems claustrophobic."" I agreed.<br/><br/>Had I not been suckled on the real thing and also exposed myself to the A&E version, I think I ""might"" have had a fighting chance of enjoying it...somewhat. <br/><br/>Real character development demands time, and time is not what the Knightley version gives its audience. I'll try to be somewhat helpful below. <br/><br/>There are a few bright spots: 1. Simon Woods is quite a bit sillier (a bumbling Brit rock star type) than Bonham-Carter is as Mr. Bingley, and thus evokes more laughs, including his, was it, ""incorrigible ass(?)"" comment. 2. The proposal scenes (excepting Mr. Collins') are quite a bit more tenderly drawn out (very un-British) satisfy the yearnings of (post)moderns for absolute access into everything holy. 3. Wickham is quite a bit more believably attractive as a Lizzy suitor. 4. There are a few spots which will jolt the tear-making machinery out of its rusty slumber...(Lizzy and Jane's affection and happiness for one another and Mr. Bennett's deep and moving satisfaction concerning his beloved Lizzy's love for Darcy.) 5. The soundtrack will be melodramatically pleasant. 6. This version's cinematography is thoroughly sensual and the characters (the likable ones) much more so (this seems the most important requirement for a movie these days) than any other version to date (However, as my wife pointed out, Mansfield Park better achieves the balance between sensuality and well-done character development). <br/><br/>The bruised spots: 1. The length. P&P is too complex a story for a mere two hours. 2.Hence, Lydia, Kitty, and Wickham seem added to the movie just to make it work (without the viewer ever being able to move beyond mere acquaintance with them) 3. Tom Hollander's (as Mr. Collins) proposal to Lizzy is way too rushed and stands in need of quite a profound re-take (I do, however, love his performance in ""Wives and Daughters""). 4. Lizzy's character (this is not slight to Knightley, maybe rather the script writers/director)- there were many very un-Lizzy-like comments. The examples that irked the most were Lizzy's outright disrespectful (though true) comments to her parents. Austen does a fantastic job of depicting Lizzy's inward frustration with the foolishness of her parents while at the time tempering her comments with love, respect and restrained British politeness. The recent version attempts to Americanize Lizzy into the typical 21st century ""speak my whole mind, even the ugly, rude and whatnot"" young adult. 5. Lizzy tromping about in her nightgown in the early morn and chancing to meet Mr. Darcy strolling massively out of the fog 6. The hideously laughable ""Goddess-Divine"" comment at movie's end. 7. The length... again. It's impossible to pull this off. <br/><br/>After the movie, I felt like I could justifiably conclude that real Austen fans will enjoy a few moments but will be left with a bad taste in their mouths until they return home for some delicious Firth and Ehle sustenance. Better yet, read the book...so the literature/cinema polarization always seems to go..."
"silver-ink","2","40","83","25 October 2005"," It's shiny, it's pretty, but it's not Jane Austen.
","Although the storyline was cut down very well to fit into the time allowed for the film, this was still a poor adaptation. It left the audience feeling disconnected from the main characters - Darcy was the most approachable and that's REALLY saying something. Lizzy was remote, and while she was lively there was little to indicate her intelligence beyond her propensity to read the occasional book and sometimes express slightly more than a passing objection to some point or other. This was not necessarily the fault of Keira Knightley however as she wasn't exactly given much to work with in the first place. Mr Wickham was virtually a nonevent, as were Lydia and Kitty, and Mary to some extent too, but the most offensive aspect of the character adaptation was the portrayal of Mr Bingley as some kind of endearing fool designed to bring comic relief to the text. <br/><br/>Jane Austen is known for her surpassing talent in character development. This film did virtually no justice to that whatsoever, and even insulted it at times. Moral of the story: if you're going to try to adapt something and make it ""easier"" to understand, at least try to do it without making a mockery of the best parts of the original.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography was beautiful and the casting generally good, and at times it did seem a little more realistic than many period pieces, with mud and dirt and messy hair, but unfortunately this impression of realism is also partly because the makers changed the behaviour of Jane Austen's characters to seem slightly more modern and thus normal to us. It seems film makers of period drama often find it very hard to comprehend this basic fact of history: people in the past were NOT. LIKE. US. This shows in the way they often try, subtly or unsubtly, to impose modern Western values on the characters designed to exist within a totally different time frame, and it may seem reasonable to the viewer but it makes the characters less realistic in their context.<br/><br/>I had low expectations in going to see this film. Usually this means I'm easily pleased. Unfortunately, this version of Pride and Prejudice didn't even pass my low standards. If you want better Austen productions, try Roger Michell's version of Persuasion (1995), Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995), Douglas McGrath's Emma (1996), or my preferred version of Pride and Prejudice - the 1995 mini series directed by Simon Langton (not strictly comparable seeing as it's roughly five hours and the film had to fit the story into about two, but nevertheless a much better telling of the story).<br/><br/>Or why not even go one better and try reading the book?"
"clairlsmith11","7","16","29","29 September 2005"," surprisingly enjoyable!
","It was with some trepidation that I went to see this film, believing that I would not enjoy it and that it would in no way compare to the book or the 1995 adaptation. However I floated out of the cinema! A lavish production with lots of giggles and I thought brilliant performances from Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen. The romance was believable, if somewhat 'rushed', having to squash lots of happenings into a 2 hour film, but I think I'll have to go and see this again. For a big screen production it works. However I suspect die hard Austen fans may object to the differences in the film to that of the book. But go and see it and judge for yourselves..."
"hazel-32","1","29","58","5 October 2005"," Not funny
","I'm afraid I didn't make it through the first half-hour of this film. Sadly, none of the satire, irony and characterisation that is present in the book and the 1995 adaptation was present.<br/><br/>The humour was simple. I was appalled by the portrayal of Bingley; making 'cheap' situation jokes which were not in the book. Bingley was too nice, not stupid. A group of young teenagers who were sitting behind me found it highly amusing, so I must deduce that they have never read the book.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand Mr Bennet, he is not as quick witted as he was in the book, and his deep monotonous voice began to grate.<br/><br/>I thought Mr Collins was rather good.<br/><br/>Kitty and Lydia were spot on.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly smiled far too much and I began to grow sick of her cheesy teethy grin.<br/><br/>I won't get started on Darcy, all I can say is that I didn't fancy him; enough said.<br/><br/>The scenes were very nice, although the Bennets never cooked their own meals. In fact, Mrs Bennet makes a point of it. I'm also sure that they were not farmers... not very 'gentlemanly'.<br/><br/>Massive fans of the book and the 1995 adaptation will not like this film and I would strongly suggest that you resist the temptation to see it at the cinema and rent it out on DVD.<br/><br/>I think it was a good way to get our money calling the film 'Pride & Prejudice', as it has little semblance of the true essence of the book."

","Before I am commence writing this review, I have to tell y'all that I am absolutely in love with the BBC adaptation of Pride & Prejudice - so much so that I even have the soundtrack of the series. I hated Bride & Prejudice when I saw it and now that I have seen Pride & Prejudice on the big screen my faith in adaptations has been restored.<br/><br/>The thing I liked about this film was it was so different from the first. It was an entirely new approach. They changed the scenarios and the meetings but these changes are more than welcome: for example when Mr. Darcy meets Lizzie again it is in Lady Catherine DeBourgh's parlour and the proposal is outside in the rain (which I think captures the moment beautifully). The approach to the characters was also different - their lives and characters aren't as polished as the one in the BBC adaptation. There isn't that kind of restraint.<br/><br/>Next, the dialogues - I loved them. The film-makers did an excellent job of condensing the film without losing the essence. The last scene with Lizzie and Darcy is proof of excellent dialogues - they are not completely true to the original but they are fantastic. Dramatic and kudos to the actors for delivering them beautifully. The other thing to note about the dialogues is the fact that in condensing the film, some sub-plots have been removed but the film does not try to refer to them (or 'stuff' them in) everywhere - what they have left out they do not refer to at all (such as the strength of the relationship between Lizzie and Jane).<br/><br/>Next to the acting. Keira Knightley was not one of my favourite actresses - she is now. I think she did an excellent job as Lizzie Bennett - she was very convincing and when she spoke I felt that she believed was Lizzie Bennett. Matthew MacFayden has had unnecessary flak - he was a brilliant Mr. Darcy given the environment and restrictions he had to work with (limited time) - he is completely believable. He is very silent but his eyes - they speak volumes.<br/><br/>I do have one issue though - the portrayal of Mr. Bingley - I had him down as a nice man not a goofy man but then that is my perception. I think Rupert Friend also got a rough deal as Wickham because he didn't have many scenes to do his character justice - but with the scenes he did have the made him seem cowardice and pathetic throughout so for that reason the character didn't detract and managed to looked believable.<br/><br/>The scenery and cinematography of this film were excellent - one of my particular favourites is when Lizzie was standing on the rock formation in Derbyshire (I believe she is at Peak District).<br/><br/>People need to stop thinking about the old adaptation and look at this as a completely different kettle of fish - it is an excellent film and that is solely because they have taken a completely different approach to the film. The old adaptation had 5 hours while this had merely 2 hours. This is a fantastic film and like a previous comment said - I can't understand why the film is getting negative press from some quarters.<br/><br/>WATCH THIS FILM! It is something to be seen."
"amberlein","1","33","68","8 November 2005"," Could Jane Austen be any more slap-dash?
","I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice and was really looking forward to the remake. But what a slip-shod affair it turned out to be! Vital story lines excluded and improvised dialogues inserted at will, no continuity or factual correctness regarding the locations (does Joe Wright even know where Derbyshire is?) or the style of life back then (Bingley walking in on Jane IN BED?).<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley left me speechless at her complete lack of acting talent, especially alongside Judy Dench and Donald Sutherland. Rosamund Pike was also very well cast but those were the highlights of the film. There was little emotion, the whole discussion surrounding pride and prejudice was absent...Mr Darcy looked ""vexed"" but little more. Definitely NOT proud.<br/><br/>If the BBC does something, then they do it damn well. Why try to make a Hollywood rehash of it? Did Joe Wright even read the book beforehand? He certainly hasn't seemed to have understood it. All in all, an insult to British cultural heritage."

","Pride and prejudice is my favorite book ever, I read it twice a year, and it always thrill me... Maybe I expected too much be I was very disappointed... Keira Knightley is quite OK, but she always keep the same expression on her face during the whole movie (pouting most of the time!), and she plays a very arrogant Lizzy. Matthew Mc Faydyen is OK too, cute and charming, but he looks like he's going to cry every second of the movie! The other characters are dumb (like Mr Bingley!) or vulgar (like Miss Bingley), or for most of them, transparent... you don't care about them... But the thing that really ruined the movie was the disrespect of the proprieties... They mattered so much to the society in this time, and are very important in the book... that's the basement of P&P... and here, they meet at night when they are in their nightdress, Bingley come into the room where Jane is lying ill, and start to talk to her... amazing to think it's in 1795 in the aristocracy...<br/><br/>To finish, the director tried to mix Jane Austen with the Brontë Sisters, which hated Jane's writings, by the way... and it's unbelievable to see Mr Darcy and Lizzy together under the rain, he, telling I love you... Where is Heathcliff? screaming and hitting tree trunks with his head?<br/><br/>Cant' believe that with a wonderful story, and so much money, they ruined the movie...

","I still can't believe what an impact this movie has left on me! Maybe one of the reasons is because I am such a big fan of Jane Austen and her novels, but I believe this is only a small part of ma affection towards this movie. The cast is amazing, the locations are beautiful and the atmosphere of the entire movie is simply wonderful. I love the way everything seems so natural. It seems as if someone with a camera traveled back in time and shot things just as they were 200 years ago. Although the movie is considered to be long, it is only normal for a novel adaptation. I personally wished for the movie never to end. Although it is a romantic story, it is not a classical chick-flick. I strongly recommend this movie to simply everyone. You'll love it."

","I had very low expectations for this movie, after all, what could measure up to the 1995 mini series...? However, i was pleasantly surprised, the movie retains all the wit of Austen whilst brining the story forward to todays audience. Mcfadyen brought an entirely different meaning to the character of Darcy, making the audience believe he is a character trapped in a personality not his own, but what he feels he must portray to society. Knightly was the best I've ever seen her, she sparkled as a youthful and headstrong Elizabeth, inquisitive in every look and intelligent in every word. <br/><br/>Not to be compared to the fantastic 1995 mini series, this adaptation was beautifully acted and directed in an entirely new and refreshing fashion."

","While visiting Bath for the Jane Austen Festival, I had the pleasure of seeing the new P&P not only once but a second time. I cannot wait to view it many more times. The concept of a film based on the book allows for additional visual information conveyed by facial expressions, body language, and camera angles. I have always wondered just when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett first had feelings for each other. After each viewing of the earlier versions, both the television series and the earlier film, I have gone back to the book to see just what Jane Austen really wanted us to believe. But the book is full of dialogue and little explanation of inner feelings. I think the movie did an excellent job of conveying the real people that we know in the story. Jane was especially well done. It is not easy to be an interesting person who is just ""nice"" even if very lovely to look at. This movie gave more life to her character. Also, the mother is portrayed in a much more reasonable fashion than in the TV series. She is a more sympathetic character. Now I eagerly await its arrival in the US."
"monkagemagic","1","21","41","10 February 2006"," Truly atrocious
","This is a poor film on every level. True, compressing an Austen into a feature-length film is no easy task, but ""Emma"" and ""Sense & Sensibility"" achieved it very well in the late 1990s (and ""Mansfield Park"" to a lesser extent). <br/><br/>First, let me deal with the good points: <br/><br/>* Keira Knightley as Lizzie is intermittently okay; <br/><br/>* Some of the scenery is pretty; <br/><br/>* Some of the houses were nice; <br/><br/>* Darcy doesn't hurl himself into a dirty duck pond purely for the pleasure of the watching ladeez; <br/><br/>* Err; <br/><br/>* That's it. <br/><br/>And the bad points: <br/><br/>* Mr and Mrs Bennet did not appear to be married - just two people who inhabited the same shabby house; <br/><br/>* None of the sharp wit of Mr Bennet was on display and his accent, in particular, was distinctly dodgy - when he wasn't mumbling his words; <br/><br/>* The director's attempt to portray the Bennets as economically short, compared to their neighbours, as asinine. Dirty walls and windows? <br/><br/>*The script was terrible, mixing some Austenisms with pretty bad modern dialogue; <br/><br/>* The film shifted from scene to scene in a way that would confuse anyone that was not acquainted with the book or previous versions; <br/><br/>* Jane barely had a look-in; likewise Mr Bingley (which was not such a bad thing considering how poor he was); <br/><br/>* The characters of the Bennet girls, Lizzie and Jane apart, were never properly developed - they were just a gaggle of giggling idiots, forever getting caught at the door. The same cliché so many times; <br/><br/>* Keira Knightley may or may not have read the book, but she clearly saw the 1995 BBC version and frequently aped Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie; <br/><br/>* Inadequate development of all the film's character's. Mr Bennet mumbled his words, Bingley barely bothered acting; likewise Darcy. I didn't originally think a great deal of Colin Firth's Mr Darcy, but he is truly alive with character compared to the excremental Matthew Macfadyen; <br/><br/>* Lady Catherine de Burgh's make-up - I don't think the zebra look was ever in fashion. And would a lady so fastidious have daubs of semi-naked men on her drawing room wall? I think not... <br/><br/>* The inside of Pemberly seems to have been modelled on the interior of the Louvre. Was it supposed to be the inside of an English country house or a museum? Terrible! <br/><br/>* The marching of the militia through the *village* was just plain cheesy. <br/><br/>Blimey, this film is just so bad I could go on and on. <br/><br/>To cut a long story short, the acting is bad, the script is bad, the directing is bad, totally lacking in any subtlety. Indeed, experienced actors and actresses, such as Rosumund Pyke and Tom Hollander (respectively, Lady Harriet and Osborne in ""Wives and Daughters""), look distinctly unhappy at the roles they were asked to play."
"mysteryg45","2","21","41","5 November 2005"," There are no words for how terrible this movie was...
","I feel like I went into the movie with a relatively open mind. I was really sincerely hoping for a good adaptation (of the book, not the miniseries), but was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, in response to an earlier review or two, if you're going to stick the actors in period clothing and put them in period settings, your aim is to be as close to the book as possible. THE END. To say that some random change from the book is refreshing or that we shouldn't be comparing it to the book...is just stupid. I'm sorry. If you're going to make a ""P & P"" adaptation, the majority of your viewers WILL BE people that WILL compare. It's a fact the director should have thought about when he decided to re-make this period romantic comedy that's been done and re-done three times in the past ten? years alone. Saying that he ""shot himself in the foot"" just seems so fitting.<br/><br/>That being said, some more specific comments (that i'm sure have all been said before) about the movie. First, the editing was just so terribly choppy. There was no flow. AT ALL. I guess I can understand some of it, what with the two-hour time limit, but really, if you know you can't fit it into the space of two hours (which I'm getting to think is really an impossibility), why even bother? And, at the beginning especially, the actors' lines were no better. Like in the dance scene that everyone seems to be so fond of: if you could understand them at all, they didn't space out their lines...didn't give them enough time to really CUT, like they're supposed to. And really, the time-limit excuse can only be taken so far. The cinematography was beautiful, but maybe we could have had a couple fewer images of naked Greek statues at Pemberley, a couple fewer random landscapes...but then dialogue that has the presence enough to make a point! which was really the intention of the book or really any adaptation therefrom. Seriously, you already have this huge hard-core audience (like the type that would have the time to watch the five-hour-long miniseries)...TAKE ADVANTAGE! Extend it an hour and make a movie that people will want to go see DESPITE it's being a little long!<br/><br/>And why exactly did they have to tone down Keira Knightley's looks? The sisters on the whole were supposed to be the belles of the county! (To anyone saying anything to the degree of ""she was too flighty and/or happy""...I donno...I kinda liked that change from the miniseries...she's still a young woman and really doesn't need to act quite as matronly as Ehle portrays her in the miniseries...that she laughs in this one really is quite refreshing :) ) And then, why would an upper-middle-class family who lives off an inheritance need to have pigs running around? These people may not have been royalty or anything, but they were still substastially wealthy.<br/><br/>And then...there was Darcy. **shakes head in disappointment** He is supposed to be tall, dark, and handsome. He's supposed to have a presence. The actor's voice was so gorgeously deep and could have been PERFECT for this role, and yet, it just didn't fit. First of all, I have to say, he comes nowhere NEAR to being handsome. Despite his becoming a good guy toward the end (which usually serves to INcrease the pleasant-ness of an actor's appearance), I thought he ended up looked worse than he began! And then, the awkward moments between him and Elizabeth, while cute for all of 3 seconds, were really out of place for most of the movie. Someone said this earlier--he's SUPPOSED to be proud and arrogant at the beginning...it makes him all the more charming when he TRANSFORMS into a good guy. All the awkwardness just makes him look pretty much as daft as Bingley (whose daft-ness is probably a bit overdone in all the movies). How terribly sad. He pretty much just single-handedly DESTROYS one of the most powerful romantic leads OF ALL TIME.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think in casting Keira Knightley, they could have made an EXCELLENT modern-day adaptation of the book without compromising its integrity, (much like ""Bridget Jones""). They really didn't need to go through all the time and expense of making a period romantic comedy if they didn't have the time to do it justice."
"katlm","2","33","69","8 September 2005"," Why???
","Why was this movie ever made?! The 1995 mini series is the definitive version and the only one anybody ever needs to see. This version has been made into a cross between some sort of modern chick flick (with some - often rather dubious - period costumes thrown in) and a melodramatic version of a Bronte novel. Caroline Bingley's outfits are ridiculous (not to mention Mr. Bingley's hair style), Darcy is boring, dull and completely unconvincing, and Donald Sutherland is completely miscast as Mr. Bennet. The Bennet sisters remind me more of the March girls in Little Women with their constant (and irritating) giggling and silliness and the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth is non-existent. Keira is a good actress and might almost be able to carry the role off if it hadn't already been so well done by Jennifer Ehle. Unfortunately for all the good actors in Pride and Prejudice (and don't get me wrong, most of them are good) they suffer from a truly dreadful script. Maybe it's just the purist in me but when a book has been so incredibly well written, why bother to change it? All of the subtlety and most of the wit and humour is missing making the film adaptation of arguably the best book ever written into nothing more than a mildly enjoyable rom-com. As for the good points of the film, Judi Dench is great (although it is too obvious a role for her) and the locations are fantastic. Unfortunately, the writers have tried for a Cathy/ Heathcliff look for Darcy and Elizabeth with lots of dramatic scenery and sudden downpours (so not Austen's style and totally unnecessary). Overall, provided you haven't seen the 1995 mini series or read the book, you will probably find it a mildly amusing, if slightly dull, way to spend two hours. Any purists out there - stick to the book and original TV version. You won't be missing anything special by not going to see it. Sorry to be so scathing of anything Austen-related but this truly wasn't worth the time, money or effort that went into making it. I've no idea why the reviews are rating it so highly (unless it's to make more people go) but your money will be better spent buying the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version on DVD."

","Pride and Prejudice was the best movie I've seen in a very long time,if not the best I've ever seen. It captured the very essence of Jane Austen's brilliant novel. In fact, I enjoyed the movie more than the book itself. Everything about the movie was perfect. The soundtrack is exquisite, and it complements the emotional plot; the sets are delicate and simple, but elegant; the acting, simply superb. Knightley proved to be a lovely Elizabeth Bennet, and Darcy was exactly how I envisioned him. Rarely do the author's, reader's and director's visions coincide to advance the very nature of human communication, but this movie did so. I particularly remember Darcy's first confession of his love in the rain - a timeless moment. This movie is a work of art, an emotional masterpiece. Watching this movie was actually a life changing experience."

","I was thoroughly pleased with the 2005 version of P&P! The story moves along much more quickly than the BBC Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version, and while both are excellent, I really enjoyed the atmosphere of P&P 2005. The class distinction was much more pronounced in 2005. In the BBC version, I never had a feeling of ""poverty"". This was displayed interestingly in this movie! Most of my comments have been covered in previous posts...my only complaint is with Lydia and Kitty. Much of the time their screeching and giggling masked the dialogue. I particularly enjoyed Brenda Blethyn's version of Mrs. Bennet, as I understood her motivation much better than the BBC's..she seemed to me more ""flittered"". I loved Matthew MacFayden's shy interpretation of Fitzwilliam Darcy. Although I truly loved Colin Firth's interpretation, there was rarely a glimpse of his softer side. His was a stiff performance, in my opinion, and I believe Matthew MacFayden gave a subtle yet provocative view on the multi-faceted Mr. Darcy. Dame Judi Dench was, as always, impeccable and although Keira Knightly was good as Lizzie, I don't think she was ideal..yet she gave me a different view than the rather haughty interpretation of Jennifer Ehle."

","As thousands of other fans of the A&E mini-series, I went into this movie telling myself to have an open mind.

Of course, nothing will ever compare to ""The Look"" in the mini-series, but the interaction between this version of Elizabeth and Darcy really made you feel the longing - especially on his part - he was FANTASTIC!

"andyandlindafisher","10","11","19","7 October 2005"," Fantastic - a must see for all girlies!
","I am a huge fan of all the Austen books, and will never, ever tire of reading them or watching mini series/films of them.<br/><br/>Frankly, I thought I would have to go a long way to find a better Mr Darcy than Colin Firth (1995) but if his Mr Darcy is Mr Smooth, then Matthew MacFayden's Mr Darcy is the bit of rough all girls crave sometimes.<br/><br/>The scene where he declares his love for Elizabeth had me gasping - don't worry, I am not about to ruin it for anyone, but remember where you read it first.<br/><br/>On the whole, I think his Darcy is a lot less insipid than Colin Firth's. Another reviewer noted that he did not act the part very well, seeming very disinterested in the whole thing. All I can say is that he acts with his eyes. The ""mirrors of the soul"" tell you that he has been struck dumb by Elizabeth, and that he is steadily falling in love with her. They show his confusion when he has been at Rosings and seen her again, the helplessness he feels when Lydia runs away with Wickham, and his pleasure at seeing Elizabeth at Pemberley. Top class indeed.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly is a different Elizabeth to Jennifer Ehle - but good nevertheless. She gives her the right amount of spirit, and couples it with a smile as big as the Miserable half of Derbyshire! I was worried out Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet, as I had enjoyed the performance of Alison Steadman so much, but she was very good and gave her the right amount of ""nerves"" and had some very funny moments. Donald Sutherland, whilst excellent at the uxurious Mr Bennet, did have very, very white teeth which rather ruined the Georgian effect. Wickham, alas, left me cold. Mr Collins - ah, what can you say about the comic timing of Tom Hollander? Genius casting. Just obsequious enough to satisfy purists and very funny to boot. Rosamund Pike was excellent as Jane, but the other three sisters just made me want to slap them - perhaps it was just good acting? I have now watched the film 3 times and can't wait until the DVD comes out - rumours abound that there is an alternative ending planned for the extras. How one could have an alternative ending to such a classic is beyond me."
"Tararaboomdia0101","2","16","30","25 March 2008"," Poor adaptation of a timeless classic
","I gave it two stars; one for the beautiful scenery, the other for the score, which was really very nice. Unfortunately, that's about all the positive things I can say about this adaptation.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the BBC A&E version with the incomparable Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I admit my expectations were high. But whereas I was able to enjoy both the Gwynneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale versions of Emma on their different merits, sadly, the same couldn't be said for this poorly conceived mess.<br/><br/>For starters, let's list a few of the many historical inaccuracies. I'm hardly an expert on regency England but even I was at first amused, then annoyed and finally downright horrified at the liberties this film took. Women wander round outdoors without bonnets, Elizabeth even goes to Netherfield with her hair down, and is outside in her nightdress at about five in the morning. Caroline Bingley wears a sleeveless dress, Bingley waltzes into Jane's room and no one bats an eyelid, Lizzy and Darcy meet unchaperoned in their nightclothes...the list goes on.<br/><br/>Wright makes his biggest cock-up in taking a novel that is primarily a book about social class and manners, and trying to portray it as something more akin to a Bronte novel. Hence we get long distance shots of bleak and rugged scenery, with characters staring pensively into the distance or caught in the rain looking romantically windswept. Most notably, the first proposal scene which in the novel takes place in a parlour, is transferred to a wild outdoor setting (of course, in the rain).<br/><br/>Characterisation is poor: I have to enquire what Donald Sutherland was smoking during filming, but judging by the end result, I can't say I blame him. Due undoubtedly to time restraints (or maybe just poor acting) multi faceted characters are reduced to cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>Keira's performance isn't terrible, but it lacks depth. Elizabeth's wry humour and ironic observations while all the while maintaining strictest propriety is sacrificed to giggling or toothy grinning for much of the film's first half. Her attempts to portray the character as feisty and independent instead come across as aggressive and, on occasions, petulant. Knightley evidently tries to make Elizabeth a 'deep' character, but putting a book in her hand does not make her intelligent, neither does gazing pensively into the middle distance give her depth. She clearly struggles with Austen's dialogue, on the rare occasions when it's present.<br/><br/>McFadyen's Darcy is equally uninteresting. He undergoes little or no character development in the course of the film; by the end he's just as dull as he was in his first appearance. Wickham makes an appearance just long enough for the audience to realise it actually isn't Orlando Bloom, just an uncanny look alike. Bingley, instead of being portrayed as a kind, generous man with sense, albeit overly trusting, comes across as more than slightly retarded. Blethlyn's Mrs Bennett was possibly the best of a bad bunch along with Judi Dench, but her Mrs Bennett was ultimately the only character I sympathised with, which shows the filmmakers are doing something wrong.<br/><br/>Much of Austen's sly humour is sacrificed for cheap laughs, and passages of the novel's original dialogue are awkwardly inserted between jarringly modern phrases ('Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!' - from Charlotte Lucas, of all people). All in all, this film is unsure of what it wants to be. Consequently, it doesn't feel like we're watching Austen, more a watered down Bronte meets the funny farm. If you want Pride and Prejudice, watch the 1995 version instead, or read the book."

","Pride and Prejudice. What a beautiful movie. It was absolutely better than the 1995 version; the best version I've seen so far.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly: Elizabeth Bennet. She is incredible. She radiates simple beauty, classy acting, and subtle confidence.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfayden: Mr. Darcy. I fell in love with him. Not because of his looks, or even his personality. Because he portrayed a love-sick high-class man of honor. He was absolutely phenomenal. You can't watch this movie and not fall in love with him.<br/><br/>Kelly Reilly and Simon Woods: The Bingleys. My face lit up whenever the took the screen. They were fantastic.<br/><br/>The casting. The costumes. The scenery. This movie was a work of art.

He is so incredibly funny! Lady Catherine only needed black and white hair and she could have passed for another Cruella DeVil! I mean no offense to Judi Dench who played the mean lady very well.

","I think that those who enjoyed the first Pride and Prejudice are being ridiculously harsh on the new one. The camera work was amazing and it captured my attention every second of the movie. I have also seen the first Pride and Prejudice. There are aspects that I enjoy from both movies. Of course, they left our some aspects. The point of this movie was to capture a new audience. I wonder if it ever occurred to the Jane Austen fans that the novel probably gained hundreds of new readers. Even thousands. I think Jane Austen would be proud to see people being inspired to read her book. I have had far too many people come up to me and tell me not to watch the new movie. If I had listened to them, I would have missed out. I think that what I am about to say would appal some relatives of mine who are die hard fans of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice as well as the ""original and good"" Mr. Darcy. I think that the new Mr. Darcy is capable of being overcome with emotion much more convincingly than the old one. So if you haven't seen the movie, do see it. But view it with an open mind, or you will be just as disappointed as all the other people who hated it. Trust me on this one. Mr. Darcy will steal your heart away..."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","10","17","26 February 2006"," Kiera Knightley, finally a movie to call her own
","More than one critic started by quoting Jane Austin's opening line ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a fortune must be in want of a wife"". This, of course, really talks about woman, not men. More specifically, it's about the helplessness of women at the Victorian era, helpless in the sense that without financial independence women today command, their entire life depended on marrying a man who can comfortably provide for their material needs. This predicament in not confined to the time and place in Pride and Prejudice. ""Love in a fallen city"" (1984) depicts how educated woman in China in the early part of the last century find themselves with the same fate.<br/><br/>The plot of P&P is about Mrs. Bennet's (played splendidly by Brenda Blethyn who appeared recently in ""Beyond the sea"" with an equally splendid performance) formidable task of marrying off 5 daughters. The opening scene takes us into the humble Bennet estate through idyllic, offscreen piano (or ""pianoforte"", to be exact) melodies, which turns out to be one of the daughters playing on screen as we followed the camera's eye into the house. The last time I saw (and heard) something like this was not too long ago, in ""The merchant of Venice"" (2005) but with a beautiful singing voice instead of a pianoforte. This brings me to another note on technique, in the superbly handled ball scene, with the camera penning from room to room in one continuous shot, capturing various scenes. This seems to be inspired by Russian Ark, which, if you haven't heard, is a movie comprising one single take over its entire 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Going directly to the summary line, I would stress again that this movie is all Kiera Knightley whom one critic aptly described in one word: ""knockout"". But this is to the extent of bending Jane Austin's novel considerably, because Elizabeth the second daughter (Knightley) is supposed to be plain, her beauty being in her intelligence, integrity and wit. It's Jane the oldest sister that is supposed to be a ravishing beauty, something that the movie makers do not have any particular interest in following.<br/><br/>The story is also considerably simplified, with character development and subplot trimmed, which is understandable and forgivable for a movie of two hours. It's the main story that we, as moviegoers rather than novel reader, should really care about. And here, Knightley projects all the inner qualities of Elizabeth that attract Darcy (competently played by Matthew Macfadyen). All we need to do is to pretend that she is not beautiful, a difficult thing, but helped by the fact that Darcy never said anything, to Elizabeth or anybody else, about being attracted by her looks.<br/><br/>There are plenty of characters, but no particularly week link. The sisters are fine, if not inspiring. The mother, as I have mentioned, is splendid. The rogue (Mr. Wickham played by Rupert Friend) and the clown (Mr. Collins played by Tom Hollandeer) fill their respective roles well. Judi Dench can do the sort of thing she does in this movie while sleeping.<br/><br/>Absolutely the best, however, is the father Donald Sutherland, who seems to be able to act with every muscle on his face. Most beautiful howvere is the scene with Kneightley at the end, a scene that lasts for maybe 3 minutes. Elizabeth is asking for her father's permission to marry Darcy. Here is an understanding father who values her integrity and appreciates her intelligence way above all the other sisters put together. It starts with palpable nervous tension because Mr. Bennet is under the impression that his daughter hates this conceited, arrogant man and cannot understand why she wants to marry him. When things are eventually explained, Knightley flashes one of her winning radiant smiles and Sutherland leans back in his chair and laughs out loud and heartily. It's for that one brief shiny moment (nothing to do with Camelot) that I place this father/daughter scene even above the Palthrow/Hopkins performance I saw not too long ago, in another wonderful movie ""Proof"".<br/><br/>""Bend it like Beckham"" (2002) and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (2003) put her on the cinametic landscape. In a sea of cinematic celebrities in ""Love actually"" (2003 Christmas), she not only held her own, but actually stood out. As beautiful and untraditionally wild Guinevere in ""King Arthur"" (2004) she stole quite a few scenes from Clive Owen. ""The jacket"" (2005) is all Adrien Brody's show but by boldly taking on a haggard, unglamorous look, she served notice that she means business. Finally Keira Knightley has a movie to call all her own, and even got a best actress nomination, quite surprising to many. Having now seen the movie, I no longer question the nomination. She is not strong enough to win, but is at least as good as Paltrow in Shakespears in Love - and Paltrow won an Oscar."
"baseballfanjm","10","10","17","28 January 2006"," A fantastic movie- and that's what it is, a movie, not a book or miniseries
","People, please, quit sniping about how this movie isn't ""true enough"" to the book or doesn't match up to the miniseries.<br/><br/>I'm certainly an admirer of the miniseries, but a film that has six hours to tell a story isn't going to be the same thing as a two-hour film. As for the book, never read it, but I also think that a movie has absolutely no obligation to be loyal to source material, only to be as strong a movie as it can be.<br/><br/>Is this movie overly romantic and passionate when compared to the book? Perhaps. But as a romantic film, it is superb. Knightley is mesmerizing on screen. Not just her beauty, but the life she brings to the whole movie. I do hope she receives an Oscar nomination. The supporting players are all fantastic, particularly Sutherland, whose final scene with Knightley is as warm and happy a scene as I can think of in a while, invoking for me a similar scene with Denholm Elliot and Helena Bonham-Carter scene near the end of ""A Room With a View"". The whole movie is about happiness, and the happiness of its characters. Its goal is to make you care about them and their happiness, and by the end, it's as warm and joyful a movie as you'll see this year.<br/><br/>Does it please Austen-ites? It doesn't matter, if their judgment is by how loyal it is to the book. It's just a plain great movie."

There are several unbelievable, incomprehensible moments - the film opens with one -who in their right mind goes striding along in the countryside reading a book?? A retelling of such a classic story must have something to say...provide a new twist while still retaining the basic truths. This version does not meet these requirements."
"tpanebia","2","14","26","30 June 2008"," Did anyone read the book???
","The many comparisons in these comments to the far superior 1995 mini-series with Ehle and Firth are quite apt, but I would also add that this adaption has little resemblance to Austen's book! What is present here is a lovely setting and a mushy romance, but that is not what Austen wrote. This version eliminates all the satire, all the wit, that are the hallmarks of Austen. Almost every character is likable in this film! Judi Densch portrays Lady Catherine as appropriately imperious and snobbish, but her portrayal misses the humor: Lady Catherine is an idiot, a higher-class Mrs. Bennet, full of nonsensical observations and overtly stupid, though no one tells her as much. The Bennet family is erroneously portrayed as endearingly eccentric and lovable, but again, that is not consistent with Austen's novel. Mr and Mrs Bennet are horrid parents: one is detached and neglectful and the other is selfish and a miserable role model for her daughters. Blethyn and Sutherland's benign Bennets are far from the creations of Jane Austen. This movie portrays the Bennets as good folks, but a bit on the trailer-trash side. Mrs Bennet was loud and vulgar but did not have animals running through her house nor would she have allowed her daughters to eat like pigs at a trough, as they do in this movie: she put on airs and lived above the family's means. You'd never get this impression from this adaptation.<br/><br/>The DVD's interviews of several cast members are quite telling. The actor playing Darcy says that Darcy isn't proud, but shy. Did anyone tell him what the name of the novel is? It wasn't ""Shyness and Prejudice""! The actress playing Mary Bennet gushed about how wonderful it would be to be a Bennet in real life, as though this were ""Little Women."" She had no sense that her character was intended to be offensively moralistic and foolish. Similarly, Blethyn and Sutherland went on about what good parents the Bennets were, Blethyn remarking that Mrs Bennet was a good mother to have married off three daughters! Brenda dear: Elizabeth and Jane married IN SPITE of Mrs Bennet's repulsiveness to their suitors, not BECAUSE of her, and Lydia's marriage to Wickham, which WAS the result of Mrs Bennet's poor influences on her daughter, is a disastrously bad marriage! In short, this is a poor movie because it took all the wit and humor and social commentary of Austen and made it into a cheesy romance flick. The first Darcy proposal was a gem: it looked more like Wuthering Heights than Pride and Prejudice, with the characters out in a storm, their emotions being tossed about with the wind. Where did Austen write such a scene? Elizabeth despised Darcy at this point of the story, but in the movie, she seems ready to jump his bones. Knightley was badly miscast here --- she is a raving beauty, and her beauty seems to be what makes Darcy interested in her. But again, that is not what Austen wrote. It is supposed to be Elizabeth's wit and character that attract Darcy, not her looks, which on first impression he has no difficulty resisting.<br/><br/>I was prepared to dislike this movie before I saw it, but convinced myself that it probably wasn't so bad and to give it a chance. It was much worse than I imagined, however. How sad that moviegoers unfamiliar with Austen will see this film and conclude that Jane Austen wrote sappy romances!"
"michelaobrien","6","14","26","16 September 2005"," What happened to Mr Darcy?
","The new ""Pride and Prejudice"" is pleasant enough, with stunning photography and locations, definitely a less polished adaptation than the BBC 1995 TV series. The action has been moved back about 20 years,to when Jane Auste started writing the book, rather than when it was published, so the costumes and period details are not the usual imagery we have of Jane Austen's work. The Bennet girls are presented as true country girls, with unkempt hair and modest clothing, and the house looks worn out and messy, chickens walking in the courtyard and everything. That has some charm, but, I'm afraid, there are more serious let-downs. First of all, they had to compress a rich book like ""Pride and Prejudice"" in two hours and that inevitably lead to cuts that didn't allow to sufficiently develop the many different characters. In particular Mr Wickham is a mere passing figure, while he has a much weightier role in the story. If your familiar with the plot it seems to run away at an alarming speed. Second: Mr Darcy. I went open minded, ready to give MacFadyen a chance, avoiding comparisons with Colin Firth. But there was nothing to save about him. He really is dreadful! Mr Darcy is supposed to be proud and arrogant, but MacFadyen looks flat and inexpressive for virtually the whole film. When he tries to show his caring and sensitive side, he then turns into this big puppy-eyed jelly of a man, devoid of all masculinity. Well, I'm sorry, but comparisons are unavoidable: Colin Firth did it a thousand times better! To be honest all the male figures are nothing more than caricatures of Austen's characters. Mr Bingly is exuberant, young and naive, but in this film he's transformed into a babbling idiot. Mr Collins is not bad, but not a patch on David Bamber's outstanding performance in the TV series. Even Donald Sutherland is not doing Mr Bennet the justice the character deserves, with an underplayed performance. The women fare much better. Brenda Bethlyn is perfectly adequate as Mrs Bennet and Dame Judy Dench is a tremendous Lady Catherine De Bourg. The Bennet sisters are as you would expect them, though Jane is a bit underdeveloped. But it is Keira Knightly who really shines. Her Lizzy Bennet is as good if not better than Jennyfer Ehle's. You really do feel for her, more than you do for the rest of the characters. Shame there is virtually no spark between her feisty Lizzy and the stone-faced Mr Darcy played by MacFadyen. <br/><br/>In short: if you've not read the book nor seen the TV series, you'll enjoy this. If you've done one or both of the above, you will find flaws that might spoil the enjoyment."

","I admit to a slight bias, having watched the 1995 version and loving it. But then, I've watched several versions of the same movie before, i.e. Emma, and Jane Eyre, and liked them all. My main concern with this movie was the length. How would the makers be true to the book, and still fit it into a shorter feature? I wanted to watch it, if for no other reason than to find out.<br/><br/>I think the only redeeming quality that I found in the entire movie was that the actors were about the same ages as the characters that they portrayed, unlike the 1995 version.<br/><br/>I didn't care for Matthew McFayden's Mr. Darcy. I thought he spoke too fast and was unconvincing. While I am sure he's a wonderful actor, I don't think this was a good part for him. Kiera Knightly didn't spark as Lizzie, her portrayal was a bit lifeless. I didn't even want them to get together in the end.<br/><br/>The makers glossed over so many parts, probably to fit it into the shorter time frame, that I really felt shortchanged by this particular version. Even Judi Dench, and Donald Sutherland (both actors that I love to watch) couldn't hold this movie up, since they're parts were too small to make an impact.<br/><br/>I would, however, recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't read the book. But for anyone who has read the book, I recommend the 1995 BBC/A&E miniseries."
"mchubirka","1","13","24","15 March 2006"," where's Colin Firth when you need him?
","This is the worst version of Pride and Prejudice I've ever seen and I've seen every one of them, including Bride and Prejudice (which was much better). The dialogue which isn't from the book is very obvious (and bad) and when the filmmakers do attempt to use something from the book they ruin it. All the subtlety and wit is missing. So many great characters are eliminated and scenes are abbreviated. Don't waste your time, go out and rent the version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I have read this book many times and nothing has ever captured it the way the A&E version did. There's a reason why this version is talked about so much. In fact, watch it and then read both Bridget Jones books. There are many amusing references to the film and Colin Firth."
"cupcakejayk","4","16","31","28 November 2005"," Inaccurate and trite, but not a total loss
","Let me begin by saying that I adore the book and loved the A&E miniseries. I was hoping to love this film, and I was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and abbreviating the actual story. However, this film scarcely resembles the original book. If only ""the names had been changed to protect the innocent,"" I would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining, if inaccurate, period piece.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, putting the name ""Mr. Darcy"" on a character who is emotional and weak, giving the name ""Elizabeth Bennett"" to a reckless, snippy, often teary-eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society, and making ""Mr. Bingley"" a wide-eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read Jane Austen's original story. <br/><br/>There are some really stellar moments in this movie -- perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins' proposal begins beautifully. She is 27 years old (quite near the hopeless-spinster age in those times), she is becoming a burden on her family, and she is not romantic. She only wants ""a comfortable home."" However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers, ""Don't you judge me, Elizabeth. Don't you dare judge me!"" and runs off in tears. Later, you see Charlotte kowtow to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, which was not at all in her character as described in the book. <br/><br/>Another good moment is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in the A&E series, but the film version with Keira Knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for Elizabeth. Very nice.<br/><br/>The ending also illustrated a level of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries. I actually appreciated that scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending, rather than just know that it took place. <br/><br/>Altogether, though, this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The characters speak in a jarring combination of Austen's dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms. Information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's only a short movie, yada yada. But turning a complex, beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br/><br/>Some have commented that they loved the moment when Darcy first sees Elizabeth, because it is so obviously a case of ""love at first sight."" Love at first sight? Huh? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty, and Darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness ... he literally ""loves her for her mind."" <br/><br/>This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first proposal) when the two are yelling furiously at each other, while leaning closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly step apart. Ugh! What a sad cliché. They're angry and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it doesn't matter that (at the time) they don't even like each other? Ridiculous! <br/><br/>The characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story. Mr. Bennet was dour, Elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own -- unlike the intelligent, slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel. Jane and Elizabeth's relationship is merely topical, instead of the deep-rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other. <br/><br/>All this I could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept all that in addition to the many, many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley walked around scarcely clothed (her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments). Elizabeth walked to Netherfield with her hair down and allowed to fly all over. The family lazed about one morning, though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances (or being called on at your own home). Elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown. And in a really appalling scene, Bingley walked into Jane's bedroom and conversed with her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was ill. <br/><br/>Most people would feel these are minor points, but I simply wanted either A.) an historically accurate film, or B.)an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. <br/><br/>The director/writer/whoever sacrificed accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight. I can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie, and there is nothing wrong with that. I simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces."

","After seeing this film, I came to the conclusion that if they had taken the same cast, sets, costumes etc, but instead of making Pride and Prejudice they had made Wuthering Heights, it would have been absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>As it was, in my opinion Colin Firth has nothing to worry about, his well-deserved reputation as THE Mr Darcy isn't under any threat.<br/><br/>The précis of the story was very well done considering there is an awful lot of content to get into 2 hours of film, but at the cost of much of the characterisation, comedy and humour.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure what the long scenic shots of Elizabeth staring (into the distance, at statues, at herself in the mirror) were meant to achieve. There could have been more actual content instead. Jane Austen didn't bother with elaborate scenic imagery and the film didn't really need to either.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth seeing this version, but for me the definitive one remains the 1990s BBC adaptation."

","I have seen photos of the movie, this newest one. I give it low points because of the utter lack of regard for it's period costumes. This is NOT Regency England! Jane Austen would not be amused... This reminds me laughingly of the MGM version of P&P that starred Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, so this is 2 for 2 of film companies getting Regancy England so terribly wrong! <br/><br/>I am sure that the acting is marvelous; the cast is stellar, but the lack of true Regency period infuriates me! Too many times glitz and kitch take over and surroundings suffer because of it. <br/><br/>Others have taken Jane Austen and made it true. Take Emma Thompson, for instance. She got her characters, surroundings, and costumes just right. Filmdom could take a lesson from Miss Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, as well as TV's Pride and Prejudice that starred Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, and Persuasion with Amanda Root as Anne Elliot.<br/><br/>All in all, I think one will prefer the 1995 television mini-series version, with it's complete story, costuming, and more of a true vision of that time. Television, when it takes on Jane Austen, seems to know who to do it right.<br/><br/>Pity, I was hoping for more from this newest film adaptation."
"jray-11","4","18","36","17 October 2005"," The film, while lovely to view, departs dramatically from Austen's novel.
","While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are re-set from the novel,and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&E; in P&P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust.And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!"

Both these adaptions are a marvel and a definite collectors item. This one looks like a made of rTV movie.

The chemistry between them, inside and outside the movie its completly loveable, and it makes actually fill the tense , passion and atraction between them. Completly loved the rain escene, incredible interpretations and also when they were outdoos and the dawn sun robbed the splendor of the scene was a great location.<br/><br/>
Now what really puts me a little bit down its the end, everybdy wanted to see a kiss between this two, but it did not happened and it made me a little dissapointed, but i´ve seen the end that they never put in the movie, a cut scene, and let me tell you if that would been the end i would have no critics against this movie, it would been one of those unforgettable endings.<br/><br/>Best pride and prejudice ive ever seen, great cast, costumes, editions, lines, everything was perfect."

"fozaibalisamraa","9","2","2","25 February 2020"," Indeed, a masterpiece!
","I must say: this movie deserves handsome appreciation as it perfectly deals with different aspects of human nature as well as society, at the same time. First of all it depicts a portrait of a middleclass family, consisting of a husband and a wife, who have five daughters. In the portrayal of this family, it signifies a dominant plight of society. It shows how burdensome it gets for middle-classed parents to find suitable matches for their daughters, especially when the society is flagrantly polarized and divided into classes. The mother in this family is almost always seen striving to get her daughters married to reasonable men; indeed her only whish while being alive.
Love, with its potency, is another important subject that has aptly been touched in this movie. When Mr Darcy finds himself head-over-heel in love for Elizabeth, he instantly gets ready to sacrifice even his much-cherished ego as well as his remarkable reticence. Under the influence of love, Darcy seems to be unbothered about his family's comparatively higher social status than that of Elizabeth's. He wants nothing but Elizabeth as her life partner, even if it is possible at the stake of everything else he has have, be it his family's status, his self-respect or anything else.
To sum up, this movie is highly recommended to everyone who desires to develop a better understanding of varied fault lines prevalent and ubiquitous in our societies."
"msdemetriou","9","2","2","20 February 2020"," Brilliant movie with amazing performances!

If you liked this movie and you are invested in watching other period dramas I highly recommend ""Anne with an E (2017-) series"" , ""Persuasion (2007)"" and ""Sense and Sensibility (1995)"" and ""Outlander (2014- ) series""."

","All this just takes from a classic novel, where there are aristocrats and fandangos, and ladies meet gentlemen ... So this atmosphere is unique. The plot is about a typical English family of the time. The family has five daughters, all young, so it is not surprising that they are ready to get married. Once all the girls meet Mr. Bingley, a rich and lonely man, and Mr. Darcy, who talks very coldly. Elizabeth, the protagonist of the film, is trying to find happiness and true love in a society full of morals and prohibitions, and to understand the act of Mr. Darcy, which changes in the film. this movie is fantastically amazing, cinematography is outstanding from the very first shot till the last shot, the costumes and film sets are mavellous. the cast is also great, the chemistry between Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden thought the movie is astonishing. Keira really did amazing job potraying intelligent, playful and witty Elizabeth bennet. the plot mainly focuses on the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy but Jane and Mr bingley relationship are nicely played and endearing the story tells how Lizzie that has a tendency to judge on first impressions and Mr darcy that hold on his excessive pride overcome their own pride and prejudice. the flow is nice, not too rush and not to slow. the movie might not be a faithful adaption from the novel and made it to a modern version but it still perfectly tells the story about pride and prejudice"

","My all-time favorite movie.<br/><br/>I have read the book, seen the BBC mini series with Colin Firth and this movie - all three more than once too and this version is by FAR my favorite.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, I believe that this version of the story should be treated as a separate entity entirely, a different spin on the story. It is not historically accurate, it does not reflect the book's atmosphere or tone. The BBC miniseries, however, is extremely accurate.

The movie is a cinematic masterpiece, a fresh interpretation of Austen's classic with a flair of Romantic elements and a subtle contemporary perspective, much more creative in its bold thematic and stylistic choices than the competent, if uninspired, 1995 TV show. <br/><br/>Everything from direction to cinematography, musical score, acting, costume design, art direction, and art-house symbolism is great.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two leads is palpable. The supporting cast excellent.<br/><br/>The best romantic movie I've seen in my life."
"Qanqor","1","11","20","26 May 2008"," Unpardonable
","I could forgive an awful lot. I could forgive cutting characters and reassigning dialog and so forth, given the enormously difficult prospect of cutting down such a large novel to fit into movie length. I could forgive inclinations to modernize, or take liberties with historicity. I could forgive a deliberate attempt to stake out a different take on a well-worn classic. Mind you, I wouldn't forgive easily, but I could forgive.<br/><br/>But the one thing I can NOT forgive: stripping this work of its humor! The sparkling wit and hilarious characters which make up Austen's original (and which shine through so splendidly in the '95 mini-series version) are undeniably what I love most about P&P, and to deprive me of them deprives me of all interest in the project. Whereas in the original, Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Collins are all *hilarious* in their separate ways, here they are most decidedly *not*. The problem is clearly in the script and direction, not the actors. Both Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins seem game and able, but the script/direction lets them down: Mrs. Bennett has clearly been *deliberately* sabotaged to make her more sympathetic, and Mr. Collins simply doesn't get enough screen time to wax on and on about Rosings and Lady Catherine (I mean, seriously, how are we to understand this great woman's outstanding character if we are deprived of knowing how she herself personally specified the shelves in the upstairs closets! :) ) But the worst offense is Mr. Bennett. I simply cannot believe Sutherland to be that inept, it had to be the director's idea to turn the witty, bemused Bennett into a henpecked nincompoop. Geez, at times he actually seems to be genuinely interested in and enthusiastic about his wife's ridiculous plotting! He was just AWFUL.<br/><br/>Truthfully, this production probably deserved more than the one star I gave it (maybe three), but when I saw reviews gushing over this mess, I simply HAD to throw some more weight on the negative side.<br/><br/>Just watch the BBC/A&E mini-series version, or read the book; they are both fantastic."
"i_uh","1","10","18","4 March 2006"," Overcondensed and not true to the book
","I thought this film was atrocious. This version has completely changed the personality of all of the main characters, (in particular Mr Bingley, who appears mentally deficient). The dialogue is inane, and doesn't gel, as huge sections of the plot are left out. It has also been partially modernised, creating a hideous pastiche, mixing 21st century speech with Georgian. Occasionally the odd piece of original text is thrown in, but in such a way that all sense and context is removed from it. Huge liberties are taken with the plot, and the scenery is changed for no reason. There is no subtlety, or suggestion, instead everything is spelled out to make it completely obvious. I'd suggest watching the BBC dramatisation, if you wish to see a version that has stayed faithful to the book."
"buehner","1","16","32","13 December 2005"," If you love Jane Austen, her humor is lost in this version
","Sadly, this movie did not live up to my expectations (which I must admit are low, as I own the 1995 BBC version of Mansfield Park). At least in Mansfield Park, they didn't change the intent of the humor and flavor of Jane Austen, it was only poorly cast. In this version of Pride and Prejudice, the Bennett family was not portrayed in the proper social class; Darcy and Elizabeth would have never met. Darcy would have never fallen for such a low class family. The scenery was exquisite, however it alone could not hold my attention. I couldn't look at Donald Sutherland and not ask myself, ""What the heck is he doing in this film?"" If you're a Jane Austen fan, I give this movie two thumbs down. Rent or buy the A&E six hour version, which is as close to the book as anything produced to date. Better yet, read the book, which is far superior to anything ever produced!"
"design_land","1","16","32","28 November 2005"," I so wanted to like this movie
","Keira Knightley is just plain horrible as Elizabeth. Yes, she's pretty but her Elizabeth struck me as shallow, silly and selfish. I never once believed she was someone Darcy would be ""bewitched"" by. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I started seriously checking my watch at about the one hour and twenty minute mark. Beautiful footage of the countryside is not enough to carry a film. Too bad. This is usually such a great story. I would like to see Matthew MacFadyen in something else though. He looks like he might be interesting. Anyone have any suggestions? As for the Americanized ending - I'd hardly call it romantic. Awkward was more like it. Some things are better left to the imagination."

The close-up of the heavy balls of the pig gave the final credence to my decision that the production was a poorly made sham of Austen's beautiful story.<br/><br/>It appeared that the director and photographer were attempting to show off themselves rather than Austen's timeless tale.<br/><br/>The A&E production with Colin Firth is far, far superior to this D-grade attempt at this classic."

"frerer","3","19","40","23 September 2005"," unintentionally hilarious
","This gets a three rather than a one simply because I have rarely laughed so much in a film, and believe me, I don't think the director had planned all of those laughs. Whilst this is undeniably a visually attractive film, it comes across as a send up of Pride and Prejudice rather than a ""new gritty realistic"" portrayal. Obviously the entire budget was spent on Keira Knightley's pay cheque, hence a ridiculous CGI shot of her on a cliff in Derbyshire (too expensive to actually go there was it?), and an obviously puffing smoke machine in the scene where Darcy comes striding through the ""mist"". The script is a horrific mix of lines lifted straight from the book alongside ones that sound jarringly modern. The plot, due to time restrictions, is literally told to us in huge speeches by the characters, bludgeoning the audience round the head with facts, rather than letting us find out for ourselves. Charlotte Lucas telling Lizzy why she has married Mr Colins is a case in point, as is Lydia telling Lizzy that Mr Darcy paid for her wedding, and the most ridiculous example is when Lizzy is telling her father that she does in fact love Darcy, because he's not proud or prejudiced at all, he's actually really nice and they've all been wrong the whole time. Thanks for that, we would never have known. And then Mr Bennet actually cries! The acting has highs and lows; Rosamund Pike and Brenda Blethyn shine, Keira Knightely reveals that in fact she is nothing but a pretty face and couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, and Donald Sutherland doesn't even attempt an English accent. As your reviewer in Belfast noted, the film is simply too short to do the book justice, and instead of being bold and attempting a brave new adaptation, Working Title have simply shoe horned information into a visually arresting but patently ridiculous new film, which neither justifies its existence by taking a new look at a classic or backs itself up with good performances from its cast. The emotion and humour of the novel have been beaten to a pulp by terrible acting and a shameful script. I laughed til I cried at the pure schmaltzy crassness of some of the scenes, and was literally embarrassed at some points for those members of the cast with any talent. I read in one review that none of the cast nor the director had ever read the book before embarking on this film. Believe me, it shows."

Lizzie smiling so so much all the time almost, the pig in the house,the dialogue -oh how I missed the humour of the book, the little details. The only thing in the movie I thought improved from the 1995 version was Tom Hollanders portrayal of Mr Collins. But if you never read any books, this condensed version might suit you. On my part, I will watch Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle again instead, where you really feel all the strong and suppressed emotions behind the surface, where just one look will say so much."

This remake failed completely to build any of the characters, to really show the early animosity between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, let alone give reason for it. There was little to show the terrible plight that the youngest daughters elopement brought on the family or the importance of Darcy's help, in fact the whole film charged through the story like a high speed train, showing a bit of scenery but not being able to stop long enough to appreciate any of it. The characters were dull and lifeless, I have always felt some emotion, if not quite a bit, watching the films but this gave me nothing at all and I can cry at adverts.<br/><br/>I was utterly disappointed in everything about the film and was amazed that they even felt the need to alter the story unnecessarily when there was far too little time in the 127mins to do justice to the story without the improvisation.

","Although by far most of the reviews find this movie great, I found it choppy. I thought the acting was strained at best. The best acting was done by Judi Dench. I thought Donald Southerland made the father seem totally inept, a disservice to the part. To me, if one had not seen earlier versions of the movie or read the novel, they would have had a hard time following the plot. Part of the problem may lie in whoever wrote the adapted screen play.

","If you can sit through the first mindlessly boring half hour of dancing crowd scene (and stomach a few others; this director really gets his moneysworth from the extras) then you may find a spark of interest in P&P. <br/><br/>Not though if you know anything at all about the manners and traditions of 18th century England.<br/><br/>The whole premise of Austen's writing was based on certain elements which are totally lacking in this movie. For instance, the Bennetts were a respectable, well-heeled family of good stock but in that society, riddled with class awareness and false values, far below anything Mr Darcy could have been expected to marry into.....unless the object of his affections was so totally captivating that he couldn't help himself.<br/><br/>It was Elizabeth Bennett's unusual charm and unconventional ways which totally captured him and made him flout what were the very, very strong conventions of the day.<br/><br/>However, what we were given were Bennetts who looked little better than street people (uncombed hair, shaving stubble, no periwig when company called, and a dress code which bordered on the barbaric)with no manners whatsoever (and manners were everything in Austen's day).<br/><br/>Elizabeth was far from charming with virtually nothing to recommend her to the hide-bound Darcy - and a mouth so full of teeth it was a wonder they didn't all fall out on the floor when she smiled.<br/><br/>So where was the winsomeness? Where the prejudice or the pride for that matter, except that exhibited by the wonderfully tart Lady Catherine (Judi Dench).<br/><br/>Close your eyes and listen to Keira Knightley in this role and you'll hear Princess Diana; Mr Bingley could double for Jamie Oliver (complete with weird hair) and am I the only one in the whole world who does not see Keira as ""stunningly beautiful""? She is, as Darcy first states, 'tolerable' but only just. Forever-open, pouting mouth (which, in Austen's society would have spoken of abject stupidity) and constantly scruffy appearance betrayed absolutely the smart, funny, and witty Miss Bennett Jane Austen portrayed.<br/><br/>There was so much wrong with this movie that it hard to remember that it was made for fun and entertainment and not meant to be (like the book) a dissertation on 18th century manners, just a wildly inaccurate bit of froth for the overseas market (Americans will love it I suspect)which made little or no attempt to stick to what Austen intended.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm a grumpy old curmugeon but I went into the movie expecting some attempt at least would be made to show us what P & P was all about and how love can conquer even the most rigid and iron-clad tradition. Alas, the disappointment and hence the grumpiness."
"melp1981","8","8","14","19 August 2007"," What a beautiful film
","Negative comments about the absence of the wit of the novel as well as the lack of detail and explanation found in the Colin Firth depiction are understandable. This is a movie, constrained by time limits, I have yet to meet anyone who would happily sit in a cinema chair for the length of time it would take to fully explain and illustrate the titular 'Pride & Prejudice'. There are some stunning historical liberties, and the Hollywood ending on the DVD is a crime. <br/><br/>Having said that I enjoyed it immensely; both leads are very well played and the supporting cast is excellent, particularly Tom Hollander, as always. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy is palpable and believable. I have to say I did find the last scene between Mr Bennett and Elizabeth slightly cringe making and I am disappointed that Wickham, a character who serves as an interesting insight into both Darcy and Elizabeth was largely sidelined. <br/><br/>Matthew McFaddyn has both the sex appeal and aloofness necessary to pull off Mr Darcy and as someone who usually avoids Keira Knightely like the plague my fears of her destroying one of my favourite heroines was unfounded, she caught the knowing look and forthright nature of Elizabeth very well. <br/><br/>The real star however has to be the cinematography, who would want to reign in the person who created such a feast for the eyes? Who cares if the lighting is Hardyesque? This novel was set in a time when England was not besieged with cars and coaches and monstrous motorways and the director was quite right to show England and it's best. Am I wrong in thinking that both Hardy and Austen set their novels in the same country? The locations are as beautiful as the music they are set to and whoever came up with Stourhead as the location for the first proposal is a genius. Yes, the Peak District scene where Elizabeth stands on the rock looking out over the world is straight from Wuthering Heights, but in my mind it captured the emotion of the film. <br/><br/>This is a well meaning and entertaining film, not for the purists among us but film adaptations of classic novels rarely are... I sometimes think these people watch the movies solely for the pleasure of moaning about them."
"MizzouGal","8","8","14","24 September 2006"," Not Perfect, but Thoroughly Enjoyable!
","This movie was very good! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I do not understand the harsh comments on this film. If you've read the novel, you may be slightly disappointed by the movie. There are many people who are trying to compare the movie to the 1995 miniseries. Well, that is all well and good, but one must remember to keep in mind that you cannot get all of the story into 2 hours worth of time unless you divide it up into a miniseries. Sure, important story lines were shortened or left out entirely. However, I think that the scriptwriters did an excellent job of condensing the story into the highlights. I do not know how people can complain so much about the script because most of it is taken directly from the text of the novel.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was pretty good. I could not have picked a better Elizabeth Bennet than Keira Knightley. She captured the essence of the character beautifully. Matthew Macfadyen was a good Mr. Darcy. However, I think that he should have based his portrayal more on the novel rather than what was scripted. He seemed more like a shy schoolboy rather than an arrogant and prejudiced aristocrat. The secondary characters were casted well. Brenda Blethyn was a wonderful Mrs. Bennet (she could have been even more obnoxious if you ask me!). Tom Hollander was a perfect Mr. Collins. He made you want to squirm which is exactly the effect that was needed for the character. And as always, Judi Dench was superb as Lady Catherine.<br/><br/>The cinematography for this film was excellent. The settings and costumes for this movie were so lush that you longed to be there with them. I also felt that the music was good for the movie. It fit well with the story and helped you feel the emotions that were meant to be felt during specific parts of the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this film a lot. I do not think that it would be a disappointment to Jane Austen like others have said. It doesn't capture all that it should from the novel, but movies rarely do. If you can accept that the movie will not be able to fully do justice to every part of the book, then I suggest you give this movie a try!"

I wanted a dashing Darcy to stride purposely through a field to tell me that he loved me! There was some stuff they left out. Like the Hursts. Who? Exactly. I didn't even know they were left out until I started to read the book again last night. The film stayed true to the story of P&P and rendered it hopelessly lovely."

","I've seen this film three times already and adore it. It's an adorable version that stands up to other more well known versions. Keira Knightley was wonderful as Lizzy and brought sympathy, feistiness, spunk, loyalty and confusion to the role while Matthew MacFadyen was equally wonderful in his role as our new Darcy. He had a lot to live up to, but, didn't disappoint and, by playing it his own way instead portraying him like other versions, he brought something new to the role as well and I hope to see a lot more of him in future roles.<br/><br/>Matthew and Keira had such lovely chemistry as Darcy and Lizzt and you could almost believe them falling inlove and both stars shone in the roles that must be their best yet. All the supporting characters were equally well performed by excellent actors, the storyline remained the same, but, different and touchingly lovely and my only complaint is that for the first time I could easily have watched far more of this film and these characters I can't wait for the DVD to watch as many times as I like"

","A wonderful production, full of colour, character, humour and emotion. Clearly an abridged version, mainly focused on the relationship between Lizzie and Darcy, so don't expect everything from the book ... just enjoy what what you do see! The acting is superb from all of the actors involved, the almost hysterical laughter at times between the sisters manages to capture the sheer excitement of first love, while the dedication to the point of nervous exhaustion of Mrs Bennett in securing a suitable marriage for her daughters shows love of another kind. Mr Bennett too almost surprises you with the depth of his feelings. Actors cannot please everyone, but I left feeling involved, moved and happy, I only wish it was longer! A word of congratulations on the scenery, lavish, moody, magnificent .... a reminder re-visit the Peak District and to renew my membership of the National Trust!"
"maewynia","3","16","33","9 December 2005"," Too grim
","I didn't like the dark, dirty, grim aspect of the movie. The mud, the dreary dresses on the Bennett girls, the mumbling, unshaven Mr. Bennett, the general frowziness of it all. And that scene of the boar being herded into the house/shed...what in the world was that all about? I accept the Bennett family as less wealthy than Darcy, but NOT grabbing for food at the table and walking barefoot in the mud. It seemed more a film set in the backwoods of Kentucky in the 1800s. And who would like that Bingley with his strange hair and bumbling ways? However, Judi Dench did a wonderful portrayal of Lady Catherine. I appreciated Brenda Blethyn's Mrs. Bennett, fluttery but not screechy. And the episode of Lydia running off with Wickham was touched on so lightly as to be a mystery, if I hadn't already seen this film in about 5 other versions, plus the book. I fear the average movie-goer, who had not seen or read the story would be puzzled by many parts of it. For me, there was too much dirt, and not enough character development. Alas, there's always a next time."
"Devize","10","16","33","15 September 2005"," I was all ready to dislike this, but... wow!
","I am a huge fan of the 1995 TV series. To me, no new production could top that, it was just about perfect, but I was ready to try this, completely convinced that it could never ever be as good.<br/><br/>I was wrong. It had all the joy and spirit of any good Jane Austen adaptation, but with a subtle but incredible vein of passion, intensity and humanity. Likewise, I didn't think Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen could ever live up to their 1995 counterparts. They did. Beneath the thin layer of early 18th century propriety, were two very real human beings quietly torn apart by the confusion of their feelings.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were wonderful, funny, convincing, while giving little moments of completely new and sweet insight into these so familiar characters. I was particularly taken by Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet.<br/><br/>And the other star is the direction - almost choreographed at times, especially in the ball scenes... and I don't mean the dancing! In a screen full of activity and bustle you were drawn to the tiniest of details - a look, a stillness, the movement of a hand. And there were shots and moments that I found reminiscent more of a Thomas Hardy film such as ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" rather than previous Austen adaptations, all of which boosted the reality and the humanity of the characters and the situation.<br/><br/>The one bad point? It wasn't long enough!! I could have immersed myself quite happily for another three hours! And, inevitably, with a film adaptation, there are time limitations and certain elements have been cut. But overall, it doesn't matter. I've fallen in love with Lizzie and Darcy all over again, and I can't wait to see several more times!"
"ehenders","5","18","38","15 October 2005"," disappointing adaption, poor casting choices.
","As an Austen fan, I must admit that I was not really expecting a great deal from this film - and I was right to have low expectations. One of the big problems with this adaptation is time; the film absolutely races along, trying to cover the main plot devices. The dialogue made my head whirl - the characters push their lines out as if they were on a dead race to the finish line, with little emotion or connection to the material.<br/><br/>Many of the characters were woefully miscast (Kiera Knightly as Eliza! Who ever thought this was a good idea? She pitches her entire role on the same note, and it was wincingly bad in places. She seems to have had collagen injections into her top lip, with lopsided effect - very distracting!) Mathew McF, who was terrific in My Father's Den, was awful in this role - and there was really very little chemistry between the two - even the clever device of the empty ballroom couldn't cover up the lack of spark. But it's not just these two - most of the other characters were also poorly cast - even though I appreciated the effort to make the younger sisters look their ages, they just didn't seem that interesting. Notable exceptions are Donald Sutherland and Judy Dench, and the actor playing Charolotte Lucas - they were terrific and it's a pity we didn't get to see more of them. I didn't think much of the costumes or hairstyles either - the hair styles in particular seemed quite out of period.<br/><br/>There were a few bright spots; I liked the more realistic country notes - the dirty backyard, the pigs in the kitchen, the small table with the grabby family members. I also liked the only effort in the film to show how slowly time must have seemed to pass at times, with Eliza turning in the swing as the season passed. I also thought the choice of assembly rooms was inspired, and loved the dance and ball scenes.<br/><br/>Overall though, this is not a film for lovers of Austen, and those who loved the BBC Colin/Jennifer adaptation will be really disappointed here."
"Sarynne","2","11","21","3 June 2006"," Infuriating
","This is one of those films I like to call my ""rant and rave"" movies. Meaning you find so many things wrong with it you can't stop complaining.<br/><br/>My Pride & Prejudice history: First read the book when 13 (finnish translation) and it became one of those read once a year things. Current round: 11. Switched to English after the fourth year. So, a huge fan. <br/><br/>The wit in Austen's writing opens up in new, different ways with each reading. As a consequence my first problem with this version was the dialog. A mash of altered Austen lines and ridiculously modern utterances. The underlined frankness of Elizabeth's dialog makes me want to scream in frustration! Where is the subtle, clever girl who can laugh at herself and everyone around her? The girl who ultimately tempts Darcy because her mind clearly stands out from the rest? In this film she is reduced to a silly giggler who believes every word she says is true.<br/><br/>Speaking of giggling. I'd like to know if it was in the script or if it was a version of improvisation. Yes, Lydia and Kitty were gigglers, but there is a limit. Sillines can be portrayed through other means besides this nerve wrecking, teeth grinding, migraine brewing GIGGLING.<br/><br/>I know movies have a limited time-frame. Maybe, if the director had used more time with the characters that were left, instead of the scenery the result might not have felt so rushed. On the other hand the scenery is almost the only thing I actually LIKED.<br/><br/>A film is a visual media. Seen on a 10 meter screen every detail is clearer. So why in the name of gods could we see Keira Knightleys shorn hair for what felt like half the movie!? Production company ran out of money to hire a hairstylist? And don't get me started the costumes and accessories. I always thought that when making a period film some knowledge about historical facts should be involved. I stand corrected. <br/><br/>Dame Judi was great, if a little obvious choice for Lady Catherine.<br/><br/>I expected more from Donald Sutherland and disliked his characterization of Mr. Bennet. He should have been the driest of wits but ended up coming across as a high-as-a-kite/couldn't-care-less -like hippie. <br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn's does a good job in portraying Mrs. Bennet but I think Alison Steadman still wasn't topped. <br/><br/>Sweet, kind Mr. Bingley: what happened to you? This idiot lacking all propriety is not someone kind Jane Bennet could love. Rosamund Pike is a vision but I thought her performance somewhat bland.<br/><br/>Pompous Mr. Collins is well portrayed by Tom Hollander, but again I found some of this character's too-contemporary ""funny mannerism"" annoying. Still, overall: two thumbs up for him.<br/><br/>Mr. Wickham's crucially important character's screen time counted in minutes and actor's easily forgettable presence made him float by like soap bubbles on a windy day. Coming - almost here - gone!<br/><br/>Then those two we follow this story for: Keira Knightley is an actress that annoys-me/annoys-me-not. This case was the first. Pouting and flash grinning her way from scene to scene with a little pensive gazing thrown in does not an Oscar nomination worthy performance make. Her distinctive voice and accent haven't bothered me this much before.<br/><br/>Mr. Darcy *sighs*. Could I get one of him, please? But on the Firth. Matthew Macfadyen has a screen presence you stay and watch but in this case he seemed very unsure of his work. Lines are delivered in such fast pace it's hard to keep up. Towards the end I liked his work more, the final proposal was quite well performed.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the main leads is non-existent. Chemistry between persons is something other people react to, unwillingly or not. It's on screen romance without chemistry what makes audiences indifferent.<br/><br/>Pride & Prejudice is NOT a story about instant attraction and this is the main thing the filmmakers seem to have forgotten. Love between Elizabeth and Darcy grows through them getting to know themselves and slowly casting aside their prides and prejudices. It's not a clearcut ""he is pride she is prejudice"" case but they are neither and they are both. The original story is about true growth as a human being and this movie simply doesn't portray this journey. Instead of Elizabeth and Darcy starting from opposite ends we have a story where girl meets boy, boy meets girl, instant attraction, things get in the way. Knightley's Elizabeth doesn't despise Darcy at any point. ""...and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."" I don't believe her!! <br/><br/>The much highlighted unconditional love between the members of the Bennet family is something I never found in Austen's story. I've always found Elizabeth's feelings border on anger because of the acute embarrassment she feels when it comes to her family (minus Jane and daddy). Love, yes, but also a wish to be far away from them to see different society.<br/><br/>To sum this up 'cause even I can't listen to ME rant anymore. Hated: - Meet-you-in-my-underwear scenes. - Modern dialog - Keira's costumes (see that overcoat?) and hair - Lack of periodical continuity in wardrobe department - Bingley's hair - Family Bennet's commonness (table manners, pigs inside the house etc.) - Assembly Hall dance scene<br/><br/>Why 2/10 for this movie? There was the scenery, as mentioned before. Liked the make-up department with very natural looking skin (read shiny) on the people, very subtle colors and enhancements. The music worked as did the locations and sets (excluding the horrid barn-dance disco-like assembly.)<br/><br/>See this movie if you can for free. Then pay good money to get your hands on the BBC mini-series from 1995. Better yet, read the book."
"JonathanWalford","2","11","21","3 March 2006"," Jane Austen for Dummies
","I realize many people will like this film but it is the equivalent of a Coles notes version of the Jane Austen novel. It is difficult to translate an entire novel into a two hour filmed presentation, however this version subtracted a little of the storyline from all over the place rather than just write out entire characters and thereby simplifying the story for its time frame. The viewer is left feeling confused and incomplete. This was most obvious in the lack of character development of Elizabeth Bennet's sisters. Most viewers, unless already acquainted with the story, won't even understand why they are all there, and if you audibly blink, you are likely to miss why Wickham is in the story at all. This abbreviated version also lacks historical accuracy. The Bennets are portrayed as impoverished farmers with pigs running the hallways, entertain friends in the kitchen, and dress like mill workers -- not the gentry and social equals of Mr. Darcy that they are, albeit not as wealthy. Their home is not portrayed as an 18th century Gentelman farmer's abode but rather as a 'shabby chic' interior. Austen's feminist concerns for her gender's inability to inherit is almost completely missed. Subtlety is abandoned in favour of over-modernizing situations and sets so that one feels they are being screamed at 'GET IT?' throughout the film. The director seems to miss that the only reason Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy do not get together at the beginning of the film is due to pride and prejudice, not social class or breeding. Jane Austen is not just a romance writer, she is an acute observer of her times and its modes and manners. This film misses portraying these subtle although important elements of the storyline. This film has visual charm and artistic merit but falls well short of an authentic rendition of Jane Austen's classic."

The producers of this film have completely disregarded Austen's crucial messages, or perhaps this is too harsh but the issues Austen portrayed in her novel are not represented to a degree that does this classic justice. Is the title not ""Pride and Prejudice""? Why, then, have the directors decided to reduce Darcy's pride? Why is Mr Collins barely the ""silly, pompous, narrow-minded man"" described in the text? I have loved this novel since I was 7 and am DISGUSTED to see it so terribly portrayed with a complete disregard for the pride of Darcy, Mr Bennet, Mr Collins and especially Elizabeth Bennet herself.

"SaxxoneGirly","8","11","21","19 September 2005"," Captivating in style and characterisation
","I have never seen the ""Colin Firth version"" (I was nine at the time) which I would see as an advantage. Matthew MacFadyen is an excellent Darcy, and the chemistry between him and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet worked well.<br/><br/>I agree that Darcy's painful attempts at small-talk with Elizabeth in Mr Collins' house is one of the best in the film. I was captivated by MacFadyen's performance, and although there is only so much you can do with the two hours worth of film, I think he showed the change in Darcy's character very well. And, on a shallower note, I think he looks best in the film during his dishevelled, coat-billowing walk through the dawn mists.<br/><br/>Knightley is charming as Elizabeth, which honestly surprised me. She sort of sparkled in places, and came across as intelligent, if a little too sharp for her own good. At times she was the personification of feisty, and the way she showed Elizabeth's changes in mood were done subtly, there was no huge flash of emotion, which fit well with the character's independent and self-contained streak.<br/><br/>Kelly Reilly (Bingley's sister) and Judi Dench also add weight to this film, with great sense of character in quite small roles. The other Bennets in this film are not really given much development, apart from Jane, and I think this is a waste.<br/><br/>There were some dazzling scenes in this film that would not come across anywhere near as powerfully on the small screen. The scale of the story itself is also one that benefits the full cinema treatment. The locations chosen for the main houses in the film were very good, and as a general fan of ball scenes there were enough to delight me.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I suppose it helps that I'm a hopeless romantic. A very very good adaptation, although die-hard fans will probably find enough to pick at. And move over Colin Firth - there's a new master of Pemberley."

Bingley was absolutely horrendous - far too stupid and foppish. Worse still the story was distorted to such an extent that anyone who has read the book must wince and cringe. In fact at points I was quite angry at what I was seeing.<br/><br/>Trying to take the film in isolation and remove my disappointment at the terrible things they did to the story line, I think the term that best describes it is ""over-acted"". I was left wondering if this was supposed to be a comedy at times and to be honest it failed dismally as that too - somewhere in-between but not quite either.<br/><br/>Hugely disappointing for this Keira and Jane Austen fan."

","Because the story is compelling, and they kept the dialog almost exactly the same as its predecessor, the whole thing wasn't too painful to watch. It got bad when Kiera Knightly with her wimpy demeanor and little girl lost voice spoke. Elizabeth Bennet went from spunky to bratty. Her ideals went from wanting to help her family but being unwilling to compromise her heart to simply not wanting to do what anyone said like a little two year old. I kept expecting her to pout and throw her peas at Mr Darcy, whose name escapes me. He was OK. Donald Sutherland seemed more like he was one of the three musketeers. In fact all the costumes were a bit off and very lavish instead of the rather plain white empire waisted dresses typical of the time. I can see little girls, middle aged ladies, and anyone that spends a good deal of time at the shopping mall enjoying this movie."

","Jane Austen is one of the best English writers of all times. Her novels have endured the passage of time. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is perhaps a masterpiece that is captured exquisitely by Joe Wright, who with the adapter, Deborah Moggach, has created a beautiful film that will live forever.<br/><br/>Much has been said in this forum about the movie and how some people feel this new version of the Austen's novel compares to other screen treatment, most notably the 1995 mini series. Comparisons are unfair to this new installment because it should stand on its own merits. In fact, credit has to be given to Mr. Wright for the exquisite treatment he and his cinematographer, Roman Osin, has given the finished product. The atmospheric musical score by Dario Marianelli enhances the film, and the editing of Paul Toehill is great.<br/><br/>The only recommendation to anyone is to go to this film without any preconceived ideas. Just take in the glorious colors exploding in the big screen and fall in love with the Bennets, and all the Austen characters that come alive under the direction of Mr. Wright.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly is the best excuse for going to see ""Pride and Prejudice"". She is a young actress doing an amazing job with her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet. Matthew MacFayden cuts quite a figure as the dashing Mr. Darcy. The two stars have the right chemistry to make this film a winner because of the love we know they feel for one another from the start.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn, as the calculating, and silly, Mrs. Bennet has some good moments. Donald Sutherland underplays his Mr. Bennet to give us a man that is out place among all the Bennet women with their conflicts. Judi Dench is seen as Lady Catherine de Bourg, the bitchy noble woman who thinks her nephew, Mr. Darcy is too good for Elizabeth. Her scene toward the end of the film when she confronts the young woman is one of the highlights of the movie, as we don't expect Lizzie's reaction toward this harpy.<br/><br/>Go see ""Pride and Prejudice"" and just enjoy and absorb the wonderful trip back in time that Joe Wright has invited us to take with him."

","A joke! A mockery! What was good about this? May I remind you of a certain book by Jane Austin, this book was written well and was good for the genre it was aimed at. Highly popular. Well this film managed to cut half of what was in the book out of the film! The Book and award winning novel was wrecked by this travesty of a film. The worst film I have ever seen! No following of the plot, poor acting by most of the stars baring Judi Dench. No emotion, didn't make a big impression with it's target audience or any audience. Just pathetic. A waste of time and space. Rosumand Pike loved herself far too much, Keira Knightly gave a sickening performance and should never be allowed to act again and Donald Sutherland- well, no comment! Acting classes needed for the cast and the part everyone waited for was between Lizzie and Mr Darcy, but any emotion which could have been expressed was simply thrown out of the window when MacFayden and Knightly took the roles. They didn't display and emotion, they ruined a perfectly good novel and I cannot stress enough how dreadfully sickening this film was. Highly unreccomended. <br/><br/>I give this a one- <br/><br/>To improve the film- A new cast who can act well. (This would get it from a one to a four) If it hits it's targets and target audience. (four to a six) If the novel is portrayed in an entertainingly good light for it's genre and target audience. (six to an eight)<br/><br/>The above would get it an 8 if all of it was achieved.

","This production felt extremely flat and somehow managed to bore most of the people in the theatre. Kiera Knightley was okay but she'd basically ripped off her performance from Jennifer Ehle. Matthew MacFayden was wooden. One mark of a poor film is a high number of close-ups. Directors can use them to hide turgid acting or characters that do not gel. Joe Wright's film is full of close-ups. It is also full of fancy rotating tracking shots that cannot cover up the fact that the film feels flat and lifeless. The dipping in and out of conversations by tracking an entire house or party also leaves one unable to get involved with any of the characters. The result? You simply do not care what happens to any of them and none of the relationships in the film develop any chemistry. None of the romances and none of the sibling/sibling or even parent/child relations. And the final scene? What a lacklustre way to end this great story?! Some nice shots of the English countryside, but they've been seen before. Do not believe the critics or the advertising. And ask yourself how many people reviewing on IMDb work for or represent the studio. This is not a patch on the BBC production and even if that version had not existed, this would still be a lousy movie. It made two hours feel like eight."

","I'm afraid that I'm going to be a lone, controversial voice about this movie! Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed in this movie. The BBC production with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was just so perfect and true to the book; anything that followed was bound to disappoint me. I never really felt drawn into the movie until the last scene with Mr Bennet & Elizabeth after Mr Darcy had asked for her hand.<br/><br/>If I have to pinpoint what I felt was dramatically wrong with it I'd suggest three main causes : firstly, there was an imbalance. Some scenes, such as the dancing scenes were drawn out, while other - more important scenes - such as the one where Charlotte Lucas told Elizabeth she was marrying freaky Mr Collins, were truncated to a few lines.<br/><br/>Secondly, I felt the director/producer should have taken a bigger risk in allowing the actors to give more original interpretations of the characters. To me - and having watched the BBC production 6 times! - the actors played the characters almost identically (I'm thinking particularly of Mrs Bennet, Mr Bingley & Mr Collins) to the BBC production and ended up coming across as inept shadows of their thespian predecessors. <br/><br/>Finally, and this was perhaps the biggest flaw, it ended up being a commercialized historical version of a bubblegum romance the likes of ""Sleepless in Seattle"", rather than a serious literary movie. The director/producer relies on, for example, photographic long shots of the misty moors, and the floating dust sheets being thrown at Netherfield, etc and weak humor (Mr Bingley pacing before asking Jane to marry him (and then using that awfully colloquial ""I was an unmitigated ass...""); Mr Darcy pacing while Elizabeth was in with Mr Bennet; Elizabeth pacing when she read about Lydia's elopement, to bring in the audience, rather then real characterization and deep emotion to capture the viewers. How this movie got nominated for 4 Oscars, including best actress, I have no idea!!!"

We both had liked the DVD of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet. I must say I was a firm believer in the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth version, however yesterday I spent time with director Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice film again on DVD at home. The first time I had liked it, but seeing it again in the intimacy of my home, I learned new details and had a new feeling about it, and listened to the director's commentary. This Keira Knightley-Mathew MacFadyen version is excellent, very romantic, there are special moments in the closing sequence with a sunrise, it is a revelation for other directors to note. An extremely sensitive orchestral piece reminiscent of Delius or Ravel closes the credits. The talented direction is from a young man, Joe Wright. He is insightful but how does he have so much experience? The National Trust locations, including Burghley House and Chatsworth in Derbyshire had me totally immersed and enthralled. Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Simon Woods and the rest of the cast are excellent. Rosamund Pike playing the other sister is so stunningly beautiful,I could not take my eyes off her. I loved the dancing at the ball, it was so jolly and authentic. English dialogue interests me a great deal, and I like to browse into the making of a film, and that's when I came to the realization that this movie is after all a masterpiece from a young and new director. Long afterward, the romantic memory of it lingers with the viewer. Remarkable and rewarding, 10 stars.

"bnymph","10","7","12","7 December 2006"," best screen vision of a classic novel
","I'm not a fanatic Austen-film follower, but I'm always interested in screen versions of her novels, particularly because I read a lot and also work in film and video games (CG programmer). I think this is the best staging of _Pride and Prejudice_ I have seen. (And I believe I've seen most of them.) It wasn't a mini-series version of a three volume novel, it was a _movie_, and yet stayed true to the novel itself. As much as I admire Ang Lee's film version of _Sense and Sensibility_, this one is better. Since the actress/screenwriter Emma Thompson was involved in both, I suspect she got some ideas from the prior experience with S&S. However it happened, it's a well-done screenplay. It diverges in certain ways from the novel, but how could it not?<br/><br/>This version employed two interesting tactics -- picking out the most striking bits of dialog from the novel, and then filling them in with some more direct dialog; and replacing the many contemplative, letter-reading portions of the novel with cinematography. The fact is, Austen began this novel in the 18th century, when gentlefolk read a lot. And wrote letters. This is almost incomprehensible in the current day. The many scenes in Austen's novel where the heroine goes out for a walk to study a letter, or just to contemplate her family, are replaced with film work that conveys her mood and thinking. <br/><br/>The casting was also excellent. Austen wrote to her sister from London that she looked in some museum (the BM?) for a picture of her heroine. When I saw the movie, I felt that I was really seeing both Elizabeth ('feisty') and Jane Bennet (Jane's 'celestial' good looks). Austen would have approved.<br/><br/>There is a lot of musical anachronism, in this movie, yet the score works very well, and supports the cinematography.<br/><br/>I don't understand why anyone would want to make screen versions of Austen's novels, any more than I understand why they made TV versions of Trollope's Palliser novels. Something to sell to Masterpiece Theater USA, I suppose. But this version is both true to cinema and true to the novel. Something that could be compared to Visconti's _Garden of the Finzi-Continis_ and Karel Reiscz's _Who'll Stop The Rain._"

This is really an excellent film, and as a fervent Austen fan I'm happy to say I was really impressed with the translation from page to screen, as was my Mum, with whom I went to see the film. We had both seen and loved the 1995 mini-series (I own it, in fact), but we still enjoyed this very much and some parts we actually preferred to the TV version. I have lost count of how many times I have read Pride and Prejudice since I first picked it up at the age of about 13, and it is one of my all- time favourite novels, so I'm quite a strict critic when it comes to adaptations (I tend to be, anyway - my sister has to practically gag me if we go to see an adaptation of a book I like, to stop me pointing out faults).<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen is really a great Darcy. I would have liked him to get more screen time, because I thought he really captured the character as I had imagined him. He is also rather easy on the eye! He really convincingly conveyed Darcy's internal struggle over his feelings for Lizzy, and also the two sides of Darcy's character - the supercilious, proud side, and the more humorous and affectionate side he showed in the Pemberley scenes.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley was excellent as Lizzy. I always had a slight problem with Jennifer Ehle as Lizzy - she is a great actress, but I felt that in looks she overshadowed Jane - which was the wrong way round! Keira, whilst being very attractive, does not appear quite as overtly stunning, and you can see why Jane and not Lizzy is considered the beauty of the family. Elizabeth is an emotional and complex character and Keira really pulled it off. <br/><br/>The interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy is superbly scripted and very well handled by the two leads. There was physical tension between them as well as emotional, especially when they were dancing and after Darcy's first proposal. If you look in the special features on the DVD there is a section on 19th Century courtship which discusses the importance of dancing as the only physical contact between men and women in this period, and the choreography in the movie really shows this. I think it was very wise of the screenwriters to end the film without any kissing between either of the two engaged couples. This is exactly how courtship would have worked in this period, so it adds to the authenticity of the setting.<br/><br/>The rest of the casting was also very good. Tom Hollander was perfect as Mr Collins, Judi Dench could play Lady Catherine with her eyes closed if she so chose, and Simon Woods brought a perfect balance of eagerness, sweetness and humour to Bingley. The other Bennets were also very well cast - I had reservations about Donald Sutherland, but he was excellent, and Brenda Blethyn absolutely nailed Mrs Bennet.<br/><br/>For a first time director, Joe Wright has handled this difficult project with amazing skill. The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent and the costumes are wonderful.<br/><br/>The adaptation of books to screen will always be controversial. Everyone has their own ideas about how people should look, dress and behave, and no film crew will ever be able to please every fan completely. However, with this film, they've done a very good job of bringing Austen's own favourite of her works to the screen, and for that, I for one applaud them."
"caromeo","3","10","19","17 March 2006"," I just couldn't bring myself to like it.
","Bear with me. I do get to the point soon enough. A friend gave me the book 'Pride & Prejudice' when I was 15. It took me at least a year before I really decided to give it a chance as I generally despise fiction of any sort. I became a part of this new world, intimately aware of the people whose lives I now intruded, and my own desires for Lizzie and Darcy, Jane and Bingley, compelled me to read more than I ever had before. In 2003, I was made aware of a BBC production of the same book, and I did everything I could to get my hands on it as soon as possible. Well, the pace was perfect, the actors more than suitable, and the characters, scenery, and conversations exactly as I had imagined them to be. I later bought the book again, this time with Jennifer and Colin gracing the cover. Late last year (2005), I saw the ad for a new P&P movie. I can't say I didn't have my doubts about it. I've just seen it, and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. I don't mean to seem crude, but all the girls seemed so young and underdeveloped. Their lifestyle reflected the wrong image also, I thought. They seemed extremely poor, and all seemed to have no class, though Lizzie and Jane were just slightly above the rest of their family in that regard. Also, I couldn't see the beauty in Lizzie, but Jane seemed fairly pretty. Lydia was pretty, but Kitty looked and acted not much better than a vagrant, I thought, and Mary was prettier than she really should have been--as per the book. The dancing seemed very crowded and slightly disorganized. The plot was far too rushed for me to become intimately aware of anyone at all, and, for the first time, when Lizzie turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal, I didn't cry. I couldn't. I could barely keep up with the pace of it all anyway. However, it seemed to slow down a bit by the end. The last scene with Lizzie and Darcy was the only moving one in the entire movie for me, but I still couldn't cry because she was not my Lizzie. She was not the girl I followed in my reading. She wasn't a bad girl. She just didn't touch my soul. He also wasn't my Darcy. One of the things that made it so strange for me was the way different parts of the story were forced together, as though they happened simultaneously. Another was the difference in what was really said by the characters from the book. I didn't see the need to change that. It was already so perfect. Also, where was my sweet, quiet, charming Jane? Many have complained that Susannah Harker was not more beautiful than Jennifer Ehle--though Jane Austen did say about midway through the book that the girls were equal really--but it does depend on how one defines beauty. Susannah is one of those classic beauties, I think. I do prefer Jennifer, but I could as easily imagine someone favoring Susannah. I've digressed, but I don't want to give it all away, so I'll leave it at that. I wouldn't buy this movie, nor do I care to watch it again. I feel the need to watch the good old BBC production now though to unadulterate my view of my favorite story."
"liz_benet","1","10","19","15 January 2006"," Bronte light
","I finally got a chance to watch this latest version and I found it lacking in just about every category. The movie's gloomy, dark undertones didn't capture Austen's beautiful story nor does it compare favorably to the far superior BBC version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. I felt like I was watching Bronte light rather than anything remotely related to Pride and Prejudice. The producers behind this production should have been more honest and simply adapted one of the Bronte sister's works rather than butchering Austen's classic.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints is the decision to replace Austen's beautiful language for inferior dialog and modern terminology that sounded awkward and inappropriate. As far as the acting, while I liked Macfadyen's Darcy, I thought Knightly's Elizabeth was insipid and unappealing."
"sevendayholiday","3","10","19","20 December 2005"," Expected Little, Received Less
","I admit that Jane Austen's novel and the BBC adaptation of it hold very dear places in my heart, and I cannot help but speak with bias. But judging this film not only as an adaptation, but just as a movie in general, I cannot help but speak with disdain. I of course did not expect the film to achieve a perfect vision of the novel, but I expected a quality film at the least.<br/><br/>However, I was disappointed. I shall try to be concise:<br/><br/>Script: Poor. I can appreciate the difficulty of adapting this novel into a two hour screenplay, but still the film lacks depth of plot and character. Furthermore, the expositions and transitions are practically nonexistent, and those who have not read the novel probably would have had difficulty following the story.<br/><br/>Casting/Acting: Decent. Keira Knightly's flirtatious, artless portrayal of Elizabeth lacks the subtlety and wit for which the character is cherished. Other actors, however, do justice to their characters and do not disappoint. Mrs. Bennet, Jane, and Bingley were done particularly well.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Horrible. For some of the scenes, I felt as though the camera man had been spun around ten times and given a hand-held camera. Everything else was unextraordinary.<br/><br/>Music: Insignificant. For someone who values the quality and usage of music in a film, I was disappointed to hear such a meager score. Music played little or no part in this movie; yet another dimension lacking in depth.<br/><br/>A mediocre adaptation and a shoddy film."
"mafaulkner","6","10","19","21 November 2005"," Mixed feelings
","Although I've seen this new version twice, I still have to give the advantage to the Firth/Ehle version, and not just because the mini-series had more time to develop the characters. Yes, Keira Knightley is lovely, but she has a very modern look and isn't suited to play this character. She doesn't convey Elizabeth's maturity and intellectual strength, and MacFadyen as Darcy doesn't convey his painful stiffness and upperclass snobbery. Instead, MacFadyen acts more like a sullen and tortured Heathcliff. Romantic, yes--but not Darcy. This new version is much less true to the manners of the day, such as when Bingley visits Jane in her sickbed, Darcy just walks into the house and leaves a letter for Elizabeth, or Elizabeth wanders outside in her nightgown, barefoot. And why did they dress Keira in such unattractive costumes? Brown homespun? Elizabeth wasn't an adolescent tomboy, but that's the look they've given her. Finally, I had seen the film previously in Scotland, and was surprised that another ending has been tacked onto the American version--one that was again distinctly untrue to the book."

","It was awful! I think, that nobody , who did not red the book can understand, whats going on and why! The long scenic shots imply , that it was not a time problem. It was a bad script!!!!!There were huge holes in the storyline, so that the story does not make any sense. The motivation of characters were left out in order to show rainy meadows and minutes of walking in them.Even as a independent love story , the film did not make any sense to me. If it did not had the famous title , i am sure, you could not see it even broadcasted on Hallmark channel. I was so pleased with the adaptation of Emma , I hoped to find the same kind of competence.

"Olias_UK","4","12","24","1 October 2005"," ""Jane Austen Lite""
","This is pure and simply Jane Austen dumbed down for an audience who is assumed to have the attention span of a dead frog.<br/><br/>All the beautiful language from the book is hopelessly mangled and delivered at machine gun pace - ""Gabble, gabble, gabble!"" Also, I expect a certain standard of dress in a period drama and everyone - even the dreaded Lady Catherine - looked rather worn and shabby in this film.<br/><br/>I've given it 4 stars simply because Mr Darcy is fairly nice to look at, some of the scenes were filmed at Stourhead (where I spent a wonderful day with my other half) and I loved the sneer from Caroline Bingley, who incidentally had the only decent frock in the entire piece (a gorgeous red number).<br/><br/>And as my 80 year old mother says, ""No one can beat Colin Firth""."
"wedraughon","1","14","29","8 November 2005"," Hasn't anyone seen the 1984 version?
","All of the reviewers here rave about the 1995 version (which was made by A&E). The BBC version was made in 1984 and starred Elizabeth Garvie (Elizabeth, not Susan). The BBC version of 1984 was by far the best of the four movie versions of the book. The script was written by Fay Weldon and followed the book. The cast was superb. This version has recently been released on DVD. If you want to see Pride and Prejudice as it should be, get this version. You'll never think of Colin Firth again. The 1940 script was written by Aldous Huxley. Yes, Aldous Huxley. And it was a lively abridgment of the story. The costumes, acting, etc. left a lot to be desired. This 2005 Hollywood chic remake will sell a lot of copies, thanks to the reputation of Jane Austen. But word will get around, and then this atrocity will be history."
"smellygreebocat","1","6","10","31 December 2011"," Far and away the worst adaptation of this book I have ever seen...
","If you have never read the book, know little of the story but the basics and have no interest or knowledge of the fashions and etiquette which existed in England during the period in which this story is set-then you could be forgiven for not feeling the outrage which I felt when I watched it and for even feeling that it was a reasonable, if patchy and slow, film. However, anyone who has read and understood the book and can appreciate the subtleties of English life at the time can only be appalled by what is a dreadful hash-up of bad casting, horrendous script writing and the most blatant dumbing-down and Americanisation of the delicate and subtle humour which makes this classic tale the much loved story that it is.<br/><br/>Darcy is a plank, Matthew MacFadyen's attempts at stoic pride and haughty superiority simply result in his coming across as blank, boring and severely constipated. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is flat and lacks all of the playfulness of the original character and, for some inexplicable reason she chose to play her as though she was a silly, giggling little child who takes pleasure in verbally attacking anyone she meets whom she deems her superior. All of the subtleties of Elizabeth's character, her playful wit and her ability to see the ridiculous side of others without breaking the social taboos and etiquettes of the day, have been entirely lost in an awful rendition by Miss Knightley.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses used for many of the other parts are far too shiny and attractive for their purpose (the entire basis of Mr Collins is that he is a disgusting, embarrassing man who no one would ever want to marry and yet they use an actor who, though he does a tolerable job of acting the piece, is actually quite attractive and would have been quite a catch!) and they actually seem to have completely omitted Mr and Mrs Hurst giving Caroline Bingley no one but Darcy to fire her nasty observations regarding Elizabeth at. Whoever thought of casting Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett should have been shot-he plays it as he plays every character he has ever played in his life, and completely loses all grasp on the role as the film goes on. Don't get me wrong, I love Donald Sutherland-but Mr Bennett he is not. After all, you wouldn't cast Dawn French as Elizabeth would you? Vin Diesel as Heathcliffe? Danny DeVito as James Bond? This casting was just as ridiculous.<br/><br/>Casting aside, there have been changes made to the story which are inexplicable, unnecessary and detrimental to the viewers' understanding of the film. The two changes which made me most annoyed were first, that for some incomprehensible reason Lady Catherine's visit to Elizabeth at Longbourne is made in the middle of the night! And their conversation is had in full view of the rest of the Bennett family who are standing around in their nightwear watching the scene progress! Not only would no visitor have been admitted to the house at that late hour, but no woman of any social standing would commit such a flagrant breach of etiquette for fear of losing face and no family would ever have been seen by visitors whilst wearing their nightgowns unless someone was, literally, dying! Second, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth was made at night, alone with both 'again' wearing their nightclothes-an offence which would be unpardonable at that time and would certainly result in the lady's being shunned by society and becoming un-marryable and the man would also likely lose much of his previous social rank.<br/><br/>Generally though, this film omits such large portions of the storyline as to provide the viewer with no basis for either Pride or Prejudice and therefore no understanding of the basic premise of the entire story can be had. If you have never read the book, you would never be able to gain an understanding of the story from this terrible excuse for an adaptation.<br/><br/>Never before have I encountered a film adaptation which made me genuinely angry and the makers should be ashamed of themselves for butchering such a wonderful story in a blatant attempt at adapting it for an (sorry, it has to be said) American market. For gods sake, and for the sake of your own sanity-if you have read and loved the book as I have do NOT watch this dreadful travesty of a film. The Colin Firth version had its issues, but at least it tried so I'll take that any day over this piece of twaddle..."
"sara-warner","1","6","10","29 March 2011"," Painful to watch
","I have tried watching several times and usually don't get past the first 10 minutes but I have forced myself to watch it all the way through (in the vain hope that it would improve).<br/><br/>The Bennet's are a reasonably wealthy and high status family just not rich or titled. As Elizabeth herself says 'I am a gentleman's daughter'. Yet they are portrayed in the film as farmers, with mud and livestock in front of the main door of the house. The house was a shambles, dark and dreary. In the most part their clothes would not be fit to be seen in 'polite society'. And their hair and complexion looks more like a poor farmworker than a genteel family. Where are the servants? There is no attempt in the film to explain one of the basic issues of this period in history - which is that if the five Bennet girls do not marry money, when their father dies they will have nothing (as it would by law all go to Mr Collins). This issue drives the behaviour of all of the characters.<br/><br/>The whole film seems to run on the premise of poor girl, pretty but with attitude, fancies rich bloke, and gets him in the end. This is not the point of Jane Austen's work at all. The point of the book as I see it is that Elizabeth's character will not allow her to compromise her own feelings to secure her future (and thereby also secure the future for her sisters). Her prejudice against Mr Darcy builds based on his pride at their first meeting (the assembly), her perception of the poor treatment of Mr Wickham and the understanding that Mr Darcy influenced Mr Bingley in such a way as to upset her sister, Jane.<br/><br/>The cast had potential, all very talented actors, but I think was let down by an awful script/screenplay and terrible direction.<br/><br/>I do not feel that this film is fit to use the title Pride and Prejudice or the name of Jane Austen as it does no credit to either.<br/><br/>If anyone want to see a more representative production of Pride and Prejudice then watch the BBC series (screenplay by Andrew Davies) which I would give 9 out of 10."
"vicdragon19-1","6","6","10","8 March 2008"," Jane Austen's world altered too much.....
","I was looking forward to this adaption of JAne Austen's masterpiece. The BBC series was absolutely perfect, as it went at a reasonable pace in episodes so you felt you didn't miss out on anything. This adaptation takes what made Austen's work intriguing as a social study subject and wrecks it by modernising it that it portrays society that was not like it was back in the 19th century. Keira Knightly does a seemingly good job though, but lacks the intelligence that Jennifer Ehle had. The women act more bubbly than is allowed in this time. For example, Mr Darcy's sister meeting Elizabeth was one of the worst scenes in the film, and did not stay true to her character's predicament or personality.<br/><br/>It is difficult to adapt Pride and Prejudice on the big screen in just roughly two hours, so I could say that it is a modest job. However, the elopment of Lydia is done way too quickly to feel any remorse for the Bennett family and their situation. However, the feel of the film, the art direction and casting is quite well done, but the whole pace and tone of the film does not match well with their surrounding environment.<br/><br/>All i can say is, is that if Jane Austen saw this, i'm sure she'd be pointing some things out during a screening of this."
"violetcrystal","10","6","10","25 January 2006"," Excellent, magically romantic rendition.
","I have over the past few months read many comments about the 2005 rendition of Pride and Prejudice. I confess that I only read the book after seeing the 2005 version of the movie and only watched the 5/6 hour mini series after seeing the movie and my take on it is that Joe Wright and the entire cast of the 2005 movie has delivered a Platinum performance.<br/><br/>I have watched both the A&E series and the 2005 movie multiple times and this evening after watching both again, the movie at the local theater and the TV series on DVD this evening, the realization struck me so clearly as to why I LOVE the 2005 movie so much more than the TV series.<br/><br/>It all comes down to the very tangible emotion in the movie. Both Keira and Matthew just ooze with that incredible emotion/feeling  you can see it in their faces, in their body language, the way they speak, expressions, it's all there! And let's not throw away or forget about the supporting cast. I just love Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, and Brenda Blethyn makes Mrs. Bennet so believable without making the character a whiny really irritating entity. She is fun to watch and she is so good. And the three younger sisters were cast so well  Kitty and Lydia are so much fun you cannot help giggling along with them! There is also the sisterly love between Jane and Lizzie that is almost tangible. It is real and when I watched the affection between them I missed my own sister so very much.<br/><br/>When I watched the TV series that is what I found so lacking and maybe that is more true to the time that the book is based in but the movie still just wins hands down.<br/><br/>A good romance is said to have intense conflict and then intense resolution and we have that in the movie but I feel not in the TV series. Colin Firth is good and though Jennifer Ehle is pretty to a degree, her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet held nothing for me  I found her portrayal of the character bland and somewhat patched, lacking the spirit and fire that Keira Knightley brought to Lizzie, Jennifer Ehle for me by no means brings the kind of fire to the screen that Keira did. Keira in my opinion is the most like the Elizabeth Bennet I imagined when I read the book. And together Keira and Matthew brought Lizzie and Darcy to life, and as Joe Wright said, ""when he was as Darcy and she was Lizzie, something happened and they were just perfect together."" That is what I felt when I watched the movie, each time I watched and I have seen it probably about a dozen times now.<br/><br/>I love romantic stories and I loved this one  the direction was excellent. Joe Wright seems young for a director with such vision, so a job well done, I believe. The cinematography was fantastic  different and beautiful.<br/><br/>It is well to remember that every movie cannot please every individual who watches it, and if I did not like the kind of romantic tales that just melt your heart and make you appreciate the romance you have with your own partner, then I would still rate this movie as excellent for a great story, well told, and beautifully presented.<br/><br/>I learned that the UK has some really beautiful scenery and it was wonderful to get a glimpse inside the elegant homes that one mostly just hear of.<br/><br/>All in all for me the best movie of 2005!"
"Tamarah","10","6","10","7 December 2005"," Lovely Film
","I loved this new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The cinematography was lovely, and I think they did a good job of putting this book on film in just over two hours.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, but I have to say in many ways I think that Ms. Knightly and Mr. McFaddyn really shine in this version, and in most ways, I like their performance better. I'm laughing now as I imagine all my friends gasping collectively, as they know I'm a huge Firth fan. But I really do like Matthew's portrayal better of Mr. Darcy. And Keira embodies Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Big kudos for the supporting roles, too. Mr. Collins was especially a delight and Judi Dench never disappoints.<br/><br/>I also LOVED the score.<br/><br/>Go see it--you *can* like the 1995 *and* 2005 versions!"

She will marry for love and nothing else. While Mr. Darcy may ""seem"" proud, he is a charming character that the audience will fall in love with. There is just enough humor, romance, and intelligence combined to create the perfect movie. I also love that they cut out the more dull parts of the book and just move right along. Trust me when I say that you will not be ready for the movie to be over. I recommend that everyone see it; it is the best movie I have seen all year! Jane Austen would be proud."
"loucrunch","9","6","10","28 November 2005"," Enjoyed it immensely
","I just saw it yesterday. I've read the book numerous times and watched the BBC series endlessly (in fact, it just happened to be on TV on Friday!). I still loved the movie. I think comparing a 5-hour mini-series and a 2-hour movie is an exercise in futility. The bottom line: the movie broadened but kept the humor of the book. It exaggerated the differences in class/income between Darcy and the Bennets (Longbourne is shown as a working farm/Lizzie and Jane share a bed -- which JA did with her sister...). It switched around some dialog and condensed and telescoped the story to basically Lizzie/Darcy, but I thought it was effective, albeit impressionistic. The movie also had a refreshing vigor. I was pleasantly surprised by Keira Knightly though she is a bit too glamorous at times (I could see her eye makeup). Matt MacFadyen makes a wonderful -- and different -- Darcy than our Colin. I love eye acting and he does that in spades. He makes him more vulnerable, a young man of high rank who's not that quite confident in himself. A friend who has not read the book but owns the mini-series quipped after we saw the movie, ""Colin who?"" There are Bronte-esquire touches. (But there were some Bronte-esquire touches to the mini-series -- like the bath scene, the lake scene and some of Colin's brooding alone moments.) And yeah, the US ending scene PP3 is Harlequin saccharine. Another member of our movie watching group, who is not a Jane Austen fan and actually disliked the book when she read for her book club, said the movie changed her mind. She had become impatient with the seeming frivolity of the characters' lives and the movie made her appreciate better how women of the time were desperately dependent on good marriages. If nothing else, it may have made a Jane Austen fan! Favorite minor character: Mr. Collins, who kept the audience howling. And Donald Sutherland's last scene is divine."

","Deeply moving; very touching. I've seen every version of Pride and Prejudice previous to seeing the 2005 version. Every version has its beauty. The beauty of this version is that it touches the depth of love with sometimes the simplest of words, but allows the viewer to feel the gravity of their meaning by how they are portrayed by the characters. This film is very effective in involving the viewer in an emotional finale by gratifying the viewer's wishes, the way ""Sense and Sensibility"" did. Honestly, I'm very critical of film, and although there were moments when I thought ""oh is this cheesy,"" by the time phrases were repeated often enough in different tones instead of my not identifying with the film, I was crying along with the film. I left in tears."

","*Pride and Prejudice* is my favorite Jane Austen novel and the British mini-series version is my favorite video version of the novel. I am so pleased to say that this new production of P&P is absolutely enchanting. Needless to say, much of the story had to be cut from the book--the mini-series, therefore, will always be my favorite video version--but the movie, while flawed, is still excellent.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is effervescent and charming. Hers is a younger Lizzie than Jennifer Ihle's, but what a delightful character! Indeed, I think I sometimes heard a phrasing of lines that came straight from Ihle's performance.<br/><br/>MacFayden's Mr. Darcy is very different than Colin Firth's portrayal. His Darcy is a passionate, shy man, perhaps not as truly prideful as the Darcy of the novel, but the performance works. Most importantly, there is a true screen chemistry between Knightley and MacFayden.<br/><br/>I will definitely be going back to see this movie and will purchase the DVD when it is produced."

","Over the top is the first thing that comes to mind within the first 30 minutes of the film. Too many giggles, too much exaggeration, a supersaturation of color and movement, and with no loyalty to the dialog and subtlety which makes the characters and the storyline of the novel so unforgettable. At times it seemed as though I were in Willy Wonka or the Wizard of Oz with so much motion and chatter and elaborate expression.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is ineptly cast as Elizabeth Barrett. She is too pretty and misses in engaging the nuances of the Lizzie we've all come to know and love. Mr. Barrett, an overly relaxed Donald Sutherland, seems henpecked into a state of lethargy by his overbearing wife. The sophistication of the characters who are admired in the story are completely lost in the attempts to force a laugh or two from the audience. A complete disappointment."
"mycellardoor24","1","9","17","21 August 2012"," Pride and Prejudice? Where?
","I am happy to admit before anything else that I entered into the viewing of this film with a great deal of existing bias against it, from what I had heard from others about the differences from the book and BBC Miniseries. I wasn't hoping for much, but I was going to give it a chance and was thoroughly prepared to be blown away by the supposedly breathtaking backdrops and soundtrack.<br/><br/>The only thing that blew me away was boiling indignation and towards the end, sheer boredom.<br/><br/>What connection this mess has to Austen's masterpiece remains a mystery to me. Apparently Joe Wright has never read the book, nor any of the cast or crew. He does seem to be a big fan of Wuthering Heights, though as that is the closest approximation I can make of this wreckage - it is a horrible, modernised mash-up of Austen and Bronte.<br/><br/>To begin, I'll say that I usually always try to find one good thing about a film, even if I hated it but with this I am genuinely struggling. Everyone says the scenery is amazing, but to be honest, I live in England. It's lovely and all but nothing that blew me away. I'm sure that to American viewers it was spectacular and all, but to me I barely noticed it.<br/><br/>So. The horrendous anachronisms. They seemed to be unending and by the end, I gave up screaming at the screen, much to the amusement of my sister. It seems to me that if Joe Wright wanted to make a period piece he should know a little about the period. While some of the mistakes are forgivable to some extent (not to me) other mistakes are simply not. Wearing a sleeveless dress in Regency England would have been like walking around topless and would caused an immense stir. Married women wore white caps inside their own houses. Mr Bennet was a gentleman - a gentleman would not allow pigs to run riot around his ""farmhouse"". Nor would he allow his daughters to be seen outside with their hair down, no bonnets and gloves. I could go on forever, really. Empire waists, dancing with the lower classes...I'm aware that Wright's goal was to severely dumb down Austen's brilliance, but to purposefully make mistakes is unforgivable.<br/><br/>Then there was the acting. WHO cast Knightly as Elizabeth as WHY? In fact, whoever was in charge of casting for this entire film should be banned from anything to do with movies for life. I remember seeing posters for this film before it came out; the posters were of people in the film and their names beneath. I was horrified even then. Donald Sutherland? REALLY? Judi Dench was the obvious choice for a cowardly director and fit the role well enough but was given little to work with. The sisters too I thought were badly cast as I couldn't tell one from the other most of the time. Jane I suppose was pretty enough, but at times lacked the overall sense of goodness that I wanted from her.<br/><br/>Who the hell is Matthew Macfadyen and why was he cast as the immortal Mr Darcy? He speaks like he's reading lines in a rush and has all the presence of a rusty teaspoon. He had no pride, only a pathetic emo kind of shyness.<br/><br/>Lizzy was reduced to a giggling, pouting moron. My great and wonderful Lizzy...destroyed by the simpering moron and occasionally gurning Knightly. She had no time to be prejudiced as her interactions with Wickham (Orlando Bloom's deformed cousin) lasted all of 45 seconds. At best, Knightly could be seen to be copying the greatness of Ehle's Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Then there was the issue of how frantically rushed everything was. I understand completely that 127 minutes is a squeeze, but it is possible to make a great film from a long book. Sense and Sensibility, anyone? Sometimes speeches were spat out so fast, I thought the DVD was skipping ahead. The first proposal scene felt like it was being speeded by digitally. A little less of Knightly looking off into the distance and little more plot might have meant a little less rushing.<br/><br/>Then for some reason, Wright decided to mix and match Austen's legendary words around! I was screaming at this point. He gave lines to characters who had no place in that scene, added horrendous colloquialisms and completely unnecessary modernisations. Lines were cut and simplified as if Austen wrote in Latin and needed translating for the bubblegum generation. ""Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!"" had me pulling my hair out.<br/><br/>The film was dumbed down so much it was barely recognisable. So much of the wit and exasperated humour was eradicated in favour of a much more grim approach to scenes that I'm not sure Wright understood whatsoever. Mr Collins, for example, became someone that I found disturbing and occasionally sinister. He was a comedic element, a buffoon for Lizzy and her Father to mock and abhor. In this, however he was serious to the utmost and at times, far too dull to be borne. Scenes that in the books and BBC series make me laugh out loud, were serious and boring.<br/><br/>Some characters were gone entirely. Mr and Mrs Hurst were where, exactly? Apparently in this version, Mr Bingley (better played by Ron Weasley at this point) only had one sister. Wickham had almost no presence whatsoever and as a major character and device in the story, this was shocking. How did any of this make sense to newcomers of P+P? It was an incredible mess, with nothing to redeem it. I could go on forever, honestly, but I'll leave it and beg true fans of Austen to avoid this abomination like the plague. It takes true determination to ruin something as perfect and incredible as Pride and Prejudice and for that, Joe Wright can have a trophy."

","I didn't really expect that much when I popped this into my DVD player, but I was still disappointed. There is so much wrong with this movie it's difficult to decide where to begin.<br/><br/>Firstly, the script is abysmal. I know they had to cut stuff, but why did they have to mutilate Austens' beautiful language and perfect story? Here, Longbourn House is not the house of a gentleman but more or less a barn and the pig wandering through the kitchen gonads a-dangling is apparently the scriptwriters' idea of compensating the viewer for leaving out all of Austens' humour. Also, the characters are butchered almost beyond recognition. Elizabeth is portrayed as rather silly and quite aggressive at times rather than prejudiced but sensible. If you were looking forward to seeing any of the wonderfully crafted tongue-in-cheek banter Lizzy directs at Darcy in the book, you will look in vain. Darcy himself is portrayed as a man who conveys the impression of arrogance for a very short while but then becomes rather soppy. The Bennet girls are portrayed as fools who run around the house screeching like banshees. I also cannot forgive how the scriptwriter ruined the first proposal scene. For starters, Darcy and Elizabeth are standing in the pouring rain. How very modern and unnecessary! Then Darcy makes a surprisingly obsequious declaration (while the actor wears the facial expression of a frightened dog), Elizabeth turns him down and ensuing quarrel almost leads to yelling which is very unlikely for gentlefolk of that time in general and NOT what's in the book. Then, Darcy leans towards Elizabeth as if to kiss her. And she – who claimed to hate him 10 seconds earlier – doesn't recoil from him but rather gives him a look that seems to say ""are you as turned on as I am right now?"". What were they thinking?!!! I didn't like the interpretation of Bingley either, he is portrayed as completely spineless and the actor doesn't look much older than 18. At least Bingleys' proposal scene was alright. But Darcy and Elizabeth have no such luck, even the second proposal was written to smithereens. Darcy and Lizzy both wander through a field in the morning because they can't sleep. Luckily, they are both up at exactly the same hour and meet (yeah right) and are both half undressed because – naturally - in the regency era people often went out in their pyjamas. They declare their love while the sun is rising and Darcys' perfectly cringeworthy ""I love, I love, I love you""s which are set off by the tacky moodlighting are enough to make anyone puke.<br/><br/>Also, though I'm no expert, some of the historical inaccuracies are just too blatant to pass unnoticed. There are almost no bonnets and gloves for three quarters of the movie, then they seemed to remember ""Oh hang on, I think women wore bonnets back then"". So they put in a couple of scenes where nearly everyone wears a bonnet but then they seemed to think ""Oh what the hell"" and the bonnets disappear again. The dance where the Bennets and Bingleys first meet is not the classy amusement the gentility of the period would have indulged in. Instead they staged a sort of peasant folk-dance in another of the many barns used in this movie. And at some point Miss Bingley wears a gown with straps instead of sleeves. Come on! I have already mentioned how Darcy and Elizabeth wander through the fields in their pyjamas - unlikely. When Jane is sick at Netherfield, there is a scene where Bingley just walks into her bedroom. And Darcys' letter of defence after the first proposal is delivered by him personally in the middle of the night to Lizzies' bedroom. As if! It would have been so simple to avoid these mistakes. So why didn't they? It almost seems like they weren't bothered.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, some of the casting is off. In fairness, some of the actors' abilities were probably hampered by the abominable script, but judging by this movie alone it's quite hard to find anything to like. Matthew Mcfadyen is insipid as Darcy. Apart from the fact he isn't handsome enough and that he wears his hair mullet style, he seems to have only two expressions at his disposal. Arrogance and soppiness. Keira Knightly does slightly better, she's got three. Boredom, anger, and a very toothy girn. Donald Sutherland, brilliant actor that he is, is simply wrong as Mr Bennet. When Lizzy tells him she loves Darcy, he actually cries. It's so wrong it hurts. The girl who plays Lydia needs acting school. She uses very chichi hand gestures and her screeching gives the viewer tinnitus. I was pleased to find, however, that Caroline Bingley is portrayed as good-looking. She is so in the book and earlier film versions tended to use absolute scarecrows to portray her. Kelly Riley does a decent job. I was also pleased with Tom Hollander as Mr Collins and the formidable Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. The brief appearance of Rupert Friend as Wickham is quite funny, but for the wrong reasons. Someone described him as looking like Legolas and that is precisely what I thought when I saw him in this. It's the only time I laughed while watching this film.<br/><br/>To end on a more cheerful note, the camera-work is good and the scenery gorgeous. Especially when Lizzy is on tour with the Gardiners there are a couple of achingly beautiful landscape shots. But that is all that can be said in favour of this movie and it isn't enough.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, I absolutely hated it. Although I'm not an Austen purist this left me completely cold. I've seen all the filmed versions of P&P and this is the worst. By far."
"Danusha_Goska","9","9","17","20 March 2007"," Beautiful, Beautiful, and Again Beautiful; So There, Austen Purists
","I watched this movie because another IMDb poster told me it was ""horrible."" I didn't expect to like it.<br/><br/>I loved it.<br/><br/>This ""Pride and Prejudice"" is beautiful, beautiful, and, again, beautiful. Colors are as artfully juxtaposed as in a formal painting. Shots are composed so beautifully I wanted to freeze frame at least a dozen times.<br/><br/>The beauty here is not static. It extends to the treatment of the material. This is the third or fourth ""Pride and Prejudice"" I've seen, and this is the first one in which Darcy came across as a human life form, rather than an insect trapped in a human body. He's no less hidebound than in other versions; it's just that MacFadyen managed to convey to me that there was a man in there, somewhere.<br/><br/>No, I didn't fall in love with Colin Firth as Darcy. Further, I find Austen's writing cold, dry, and snotty. So shoot me.<br/><br/>The negative reviews here claim that this adaptation is not true to Austen's style. Good, I say.<br/><br/>Negative reviews object to the Bennets living in an agricultural setting. I gotta tell ya -- it did not ruin my digestion to see a pig's hindquarters in an adaptation of an Austen work.<br/><br/>Further, I'm one of those people who, when watching movies like this, always thinks, ""Why should I care about the fates of these upper class twits? Why are these people's servants given less attention than their picturesque stock animals?"" I was moved by Elizabeth's and Darcy's plight as depicted in this adaptation because I was so won over by the artistry of the film-making. It seduced me, in a good way, to caring about people I normally laugh at and dismiss, or wish to see overthrown in a revolution.<br/><br/>I loved the piano soundtrack. I usually don't take note of the soundtrack until I've seen a movie a couple of times, but in exceptional cases it will make itself known to me, in a good way. it did here. The music enhanced the experience for me. I felt tender, sweet, open to the experience.<br/><br/>I'm not an Austen fan. I'm not an Anglophile. I'm a movie fan. I love good movies. And this was a good movie. I think that the Austen purists who gave this movie one-star reviews are riding their high horses so hard that they missed what could have otherwise been a beautiful experience. Wake up and smell the heather, people."

I fully understand that an interpretation is not an exact dramatization of a book but the latest adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is just not Austen. Some people want us to understand that this is a 2 hour movie but it is not the length of the movie that is the problem here,although think Sense and Sensibility, but how the book was interpreted.It is way out there.

","I can't begin to tell you how unspeakably awful this adaptation is. Luckily this has been done admirably well by previous comment makers on these pages. Although I will quickly mention the one bit that actually makes my blood boil it is so unbelievably wrong. In the Regency period in England if a man went barging into a ladies bedroom when she wasn't dressed there would probably have been a public scandal!!! If you enjoy Jane Austen then do not see this film and please ignore the panderers who gave it 10/10 and then proceeded to make excuses for all the mistakes in the script, casting, locations, costumes etc. Nothing makes up for the mistakes, this is just a very bad film and it's best if we ignore it - perhaps it will go away. The BBC mini series is so far beyond better than this unwashed toilet bowl of a film so please see that instead and be happy!"
"AnnikaLen","5","11","22","23 November 2005"," Quite a letdown
","I am an avid fan of the novel, and although I am exceedingly fond of the 1995 mini series (I own it on DVD, watch it every so often, and have memorized several lines by heart!), I watched this newest version with an open mind. I didn't want to be prejudiced against it or end up being too proud to admit that it was good.<br/><br/>Alas, however hard I tried, I could not bring myself to fully embrace it. To be sure, it is a visually gorgeous film and generally well-acted (I thought Brenda Blethyn was excellent). But by the end, I was stunned that I had felt so unmoved. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet are two of the most popular and beloved figures in literature, and yet watching the movie, I didn't find myself caring for them in the least.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is lovely and a competent actress. But perhaps it's because she has had so much exposure lately that I couldn't distance her persona from the character of Elizabeth. People often rave about actors disappearing into their roles. Unfortunately, in this film, the spirit and substance of Elizabeth eluded me, and all I could see was....... Keira.<br/><br/>As for the ending that a lot of people seem to swoon over, it affected me only to the degree that it induced a gag reflex and made me cringe."
"HlZg","1","5","8","19 December 2015"," Shame & Ignorance but not Pride & Prejudice
","This should not be considered an adaptation of Austen's Pride & Prejudice. It is far more like somebody has tried to build a script from a high school pupil's crit of Austen's Pride & Prejudice. Unfortunately, they chose the crit of a decidedly below average high school pupil who could only relate to the story by turning it into a teen soap opera.<br/><br/>This film simply does not deserve it's name nor it's association with Austen's work.<br/><br/>There is honestly nothing to like about this film. It beggars belief that so many talented and high profile actors were prepared to associate themselves with a project so rotten to its core and in every single aspect.<br/><br/>The writing is truly appalling. It is one thing to take a few liberties with a novel when condensing it into the comparatively short form of film. It is even understandable that the language will have to be dumbed down a little for a mass market. However, the hatchet job done here on Austen's dialogue is unforgivable. It strips the story of all meaning leaving only the blandest and most uninspiring of insipid, middle of the road romances. It strips the characters of all intelligence, humour and insight leaving only dull, spoiled, nonsensical blobs trundling forward without motive or cohesion.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the dialogue, story, direction, sets, hair, costume and make-up relating to the period is crude and downright wrong. It is like watching a cross between a Disney cartoon and the worst of those 60s/70s period pieces where everything was a pink and orange polyester version of Victoriana regardless of actual period. It even has the ugly fruit sorbet vomit tint to the colouring.<br/><br/>Whilst, there was a lot of acting talent on offer, the leads were woefully miscast and are two more appalling points of this awful film.<br/><br/>Knightly's acting aka open-mouthed gawp is the polar opposite of the bright-eyed and subtle humour that belies Elizabeth's intelligence. However, the addition of some very obvious filler to the top lip said open- mouthed gawp does at least provide very welcome distraction from every other aspect of this film.<br/><br/>Macfadyen looks flabby and bloated and that is the best description possibly of his performance. Darcy is also supposed to be intelligent with an air of superiority. Macfadyen looks like the stablehand, who was already a bit simple before the horse kicked him in the head, has been asked to impersonate Darcy because the real Darcy couldn't stand the stupidity of the company on offer. <br/><br/>Between them, the challenging eye-contact and meaningful, longing glances of Darcy and Lizzy become the confused, expressionless, empty glass-eyed stares of someone who has had far more than one too many and is struggling to stay awake on the ride home (or the kind of glazed, bored beyond belief yet confused expression you'll have watching this film).<br/><br/>If you enjoy Austen, don't watch this - it is worse than you can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>If you have never read Austen, don't watch this - it is just a really really bad film."
"PlatypusesRus","3","5","8","25 March 2011"," It is too bad...
","I agree wholeheartedly with mkazmierczak's review. Having first read the book, I became a die-hard Jane Austen fan. I felt surely no movie could ever do the book justice for it would have to be at least four hours or more to truly capture, and do justice to, the characters and marvelous dialog.<br/><br/>However, in the early 80's, I was blown away by the faithful production I saw as a mini-series on Masterpiece Theatre with Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul. I didn't think anything would ever hold a candle to it, but later came the Jennifer Ehle-Colin Firth version and, though at first a bit put-off as I so loved (and wore out the VHS tapes to) the Garvey-Rintoul version, after a couple of viewings when it aired on A&E, came to love it dearly as well, adding it to my DVD library. Fortunately, the Garvey-Rintoul version came out on DVD as well, so I was able to add it, having worn out my tapes.<br/><br/>At any rate, unlike the 40's film with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, which is untrue to the book simply because movies did not last more that 90 to 120 minutes so, hence, had many, many liberties taken with the script, this new version with Keira Knightley, et al, was dreadful because the liberties it took were so completely out of the world in which these characters lived as to be laughable.<br/><br/>The actors are not bad actors, most are brilliant in the roles they've played in other, finer, films. But any actor working with such a dreadful script, and working under such poor directorial judgment, is bound to look bad as a result. I don't think Deborah Moggach read the book at all, or maybe just merely skimmed it. I notice in the credits that Emma Thompson provided some additional dialog (probably the only faithful portions), which greatly shocks me as SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is one of the best Austen adaptations so far. I wish Ms. Thompson had done the *entire* screenplay. Why didn't she? She took liberties with S&S, too, but not to the detriment of the story. She kept every single pivotal and important part, and was faithful to the storyline, characters, and time period. So, again, why didn't she write this screenplay?!!! Or if not Ms. Thompson, why didn't Douglas McGrath, who did the wonderful screenplay for EMMA with Gwyneth Paltrow, write the screenplay? Or if Moggach was so intent on modernizing the story and making Elizabeth Bennett a liberated female, then she should have set the story in PRESENT DAY.<br/><br/>If you have never read the book, if you have never read Austen, period, and if you have never seen any of the films or mini-series based on Austen's works, and if you've absolutely no familiarity with British aristocracy and its history and many changes over the last 2 or 3 centuries, then you may very well enjoy this movie in and of itself. Otherwise, please stay away lest you be tempted to fling yourself into the abyss after watching this bastardization of Austen. I imagine this was geared precisely toward the very audience it seemed to appeal to most: young pre-teen and teenage girls who have probably never read Austen and possibly don't read much anyway."

It's he I hope to see, who I watch for to appear in every scene, background....foreground....where is he? But, why he, you may ask? Well, it's because of the ""Darcy's fall"" which we begin to see that he is giving us. And we know, if we but think of it, that from that first sidewise glance he gives Lizzie in the film's beginning ball scene, he is lost and ""Darcy's fall"" has begun.<br/><br/>There are just two scenes that I can watch, watch, watch, re-watch, rewind and watch again. In order of my passion for them, they are: (1) The pouring rain, outdoor pavilion scene where ""Darcy's fall"" has neared its end and he declares his love to Lizzie (the intensity of that final moment, with their physical closeness and their seen and felt overpowering desire to kiss, is overwhelming for us). (2) That near-dawn, meadow scene in which each discovers the other walking, Lizzie because her fear of lost love keeps her from sleeping, Darcy because he must seek her out for one last try. And when their approach one to the other is done, and we hear him--emotions on fire--stutter out to her: ""I love....love....I love you,"" we know then.....at that very moment.....""Darcy's fall"" into love is now complete.<br/><br/>****"

","I cannot believe I almost passed on Pride and Prejudice. I wanted to see it all along, but I chose other movies instead. This week, the only thing that was new and nearly enticing was the Kid and I. I chose the better of the two.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice was without a doubt the best romantic period piece I have ever seen. I tried Vanity Fair and Girl With a Pearl Earring and others in the past but none were as delightful. The others were so stiff and stodgy by comparison. They usually are aren't they? P&P was so beautiful and lively.<br/><br/>Every performer was perfect. Nearly every camera shot was a work of art. Even one of those ""line dances"" was so artful and absorbing, I nearly didn't notice in one scene that the ballroom was subliminally emptied to imply Elizabeth and Mr Darcy were so drawn to each other that they didn't feel anyone else's presence. When I finally caught on, I thought, ""DAMN good camera work and direction!! DAMN good acting!!"".<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland was given a chance to show his best stuff ever! He is a great actor but now he has proved he is a GREAT actor! Judi Dench was great as well. Of all the characters, hers was the most distinguishable due to the wickedness and cold-heartedness of her character. She was someone you could easily despise and pity at the same time. Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike...WOW!!!! I had no idea Keira was such a fantastic actress. Sure we all know she is a beautiful woman, but what a wonderful performance she gave. Rosamund was equally as attractive and will be on my list of talented beauties to watch.<br/><br/>All of the performers were so talented and easy to watch, I had no time to let my mind wander as it often does. But it is not all due to the acting of course. Joe Wright was THE right director for the job and Deborah Moggach succeeded with a succulent screenplay. Thanks to everyone involved for making this move as beautiful as it is.<br/><br/>I have a widely varied taste when it comes to music and movies so I can attend most any style and remain objective and I encourage those with equally varied tastes to see this splendid, heart warming movie without hesitation. True, if you do not want to see this type of romance, you may be best off not seeing it. But you never know what may change your mind and your taste. This one may just be the one to make that change.

The dancing and lighting were lovely. The camera angles were clever. The mood shots were inspiring. <br/><br/>Not to mention, I thought Keira Knightly was a LOVELY Elizabeth Bennet!

"madiener","6","5","8","11 November 2005"," Pretty good, not great ... and not the BBC
","I do not believe there is only one way to play a character. But it's hard not to view the movie, as I did less than two hours ago, and not think ""not as good as the BBC"" or ""better than the BBC."" I am a junkie, and I own the 1995 BBC and early 1980s BBC version, and I have watched them with online versions of the book on the computer at the same time.<br/><br/>The BBC was much better. How can you expect to do in 2 hours what was well-done in 5? Let's look at a few of the things that get lost in a 2-hour version:<br/><br/>1. Elizabeth's cleverness 2. Mr. Bennett's detachment 3. Wickham and Elizabeth's strong attachment to him (initially) 4. Mr. Bennett's favoritism toward Elizabeth, which makes his siding with her on Mr. Collins more believable <br/><br/>But let's look on its own merits, with the unavoidable comparisons that help bring out what might have been.<br/><br/>I did not like Bingley at all. He is ridiculous and comes off like a dimwit. It's hard to believe that Darcy would be his friend at all and certainly not his best friend. And hard to see what Jane sees in him other than a meal ticket, which is not how she is supposed to see him (although I believe the role of duty to family gets underplayed in all versions). The BBC Bingley was excellent -- so good-natured he would be impossible not to be liked by other men and attractive to many women. And while he leaned a bit on Darcy's opinion, you still see he is his own man right from the start.<br/><br/>Macfayden's Darcy is passable, but he never really lightens up or has much time to. For many, Colin Firth will always be Darcy and rightfully so. He starts out snobby, but we see flashed of smiles and playfulness that grow through the series. You can see why he grows on Elizabeth, although we should not forget that while Elizabeth is romantic, but not stupid. The spectacular Pemberley does a fair amount of the seduction too. They say it's as easy to fall in love with a rich man that it is with a poor one, but certainly it is much easier.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""no one who could tempt me,"" who are we kidding? Knightley is gorgeous -- you'd be tempted to sell your soul. The portrayal was interesting -- more giggly and girlish, which may be appropriate for a 20 year old in a house of silly girls and mother. All in all, I thought it was a good job, and deficiencies of comparison are mostly due to the lack of time to develop themes. I'll still take Jennifer Ehle's portrayal, but she had a big advantage of time -- Knightley has little time to show her cleverness. Note that in the book, Darcy makes clear at the end that it is her liveliness of mind, more than her impertinence, that attracts him to her.<br/><br/>Because of the run time of the movie, we do not get to see her depth of dislike for Darcy, her attachment to Wickham which causes more dislike, and a confidence in he decision to refuse Darcy, even though she has clearly failed in her duty to her family. In a longer version, she is more confident in what she has done, and has time to change her opinion. In this film, she seems to have doubts about her own decision, except for her dislike over the matter of Jane. <br/><br/>Jane is lovely too. I did not find the BBC Jane was not all that attractive by comparison to Lizzie, making the difference less credible. Here, too, Knightley as the less attractive, unable to tempt one? Only if you very strong lean to blonde women ... and then only maybe. Unfortunately, the film does not have time to develop Jane's naive sweetness as the BBC did. <br/><br/>The scenes of the home are much different from any seen before in showing a little more rustic, and almost subsistence farming. The home is shabby and run down. Animals are all about the house. Seemed a little over the top, but a refreshing and interesting change from the usual sanitary conditions. I'd have to leave this one to the true historians.<br/><br/>While the mother is a little too rough in appearance for a gentleman's wife, she is not so over-the-top as the portrayal in the 1995 BBC, which was quite unfortunate. Also, the 1995 BBC Mr. Collins was way over the top. In some ways, I think the early 1980s BBC version of Collins was best. The 1995 BBC was too over-the-top -- the character is ridiculous enough without having to beat you over the head repeatedly. <br/><br/>I was disappointed on Sutherland. He looked less clean cut and probably more accurate in that sense,. we do not see or feel his detachment, his lack of respect for his wife, and his favoritism for Elizabeth, which allows him to side with her on Mr. Collins and to authorize her to turn down Darcy's proposal. The BBC 95 version is excellent -- respectable, likable, but perhaps too detached and dismissive.<br/><br/>While this has been more negative than positive, there are things to like, and on the whole I believe this is worth seeing:<br/><br/>scenery -- especially house and ball scenes<br/><br/>cinematography -- the moving through the room and moving between conversations (a la West Wing) was a nice piece of work<br/><br/>Knightley's younger portrayal -- not necessarily better, but different and interesting<br/><br/>I plan to see it again."

","To understand the world of Jane Austin, is to understand the subtle layers of upper-class society in Georgian England. Austin doesn't write about common farmers, she doesn't bother with the lower classes at all. Her novels deal with upper-class society...more often that not, with a gentleman's family that faces hard times due to the death of a relative, or possibly a financial reversal, but these are all upper class people who don't work for a living.<br/><br/>The Bennett family are wealthy, upper-class people. They have many servants, they have tenants, they have an estate that is valuable. This production makes them look like pig farmers, poor, worn, torn, and desperate farmers....which is not the family that Austin wrote about.<br/><br/>Mr. Bennett has a private fortune of 5,000 pounds...that's over $1,000,000 in today's money...which he's leaving to his daughters. This private fortune is completely separate from his very valuable estate ...perhaps bringing in another million a year....which is keeping them very comfortably...but the point of the story is that this estate legally can only pass to male heirs. They are not poor, Mr. Bennett does not work...the daughters are refined , well educated, and perhaps a little silly.....but they are the daughters of a gentleman...which is very important to the story.<br/><br/>This production places the Bennetts in a common farmer's house with furniture that is 150 years old...how many people do you know who are millionaires who have broken old out-of-date furniture in a muddy old run down house? Badly done! <br/><br/>In Georgian society, a gentleman was someone who did not work...who might pursue hobbies, and entertainments, but they didn't work. Their estates included tenants who paid rent, who managed the farms, who produced the income on which the gentleman's family lived. A gentleman did not have pigs running through his house, nor a muddy stock yard by their front door. A gentleman's estate included his fine home surrounded by gardens and parkland, with nasty pig pens off somewhere on the tenant farms...not near the house. This production completely misses the point of the status of the Bennett family.<br/><br/>By the same token...while Mr. Darcy is rich...his 10,000 pounds a year equals about $2,000,000 a year in today's money. His grandfather is an Earl....he too is a gentleman, but of a much higher class than the Bennetts. Still, to use the Duke of Devonshire's palatial home, ""Chatsworth,"" to represent 'Pemberly' is really going over the top in the opposite direction. This production makes the Bennetts look like dirt farmers, and Mr.Darcy look like royalty....exaggeration would be the best term for the entire production. Badly done! <br/><br/>The costumes have the same problem...people dressed in widely different time periods...some looking like the 1780s, others dressing in the 1810s...when in reality, the gentlemanly class of society had new frocks made annually, and in the latest fashion...not from 30 year old patterns....everyone would pretty much be wearing the same style of clothing...unless they were gypsys and found their clothes in a dust bin or bought them from the rag man. No one in Austin's novels was so badly out of fashion as they are portrayed in this poor, poor rendition of this wonderful novel. Badly done!"

You feel like you're there with them, and you hold a smile almost throughout the entire movie when you hear one of the many witty comments by Keira Knightley (Lizzy).<br/><br/>The script was done very well. Whenever I watch the movie, I always find myself amazed how their dislike for each other faded away and they gradually began to get confused over whether they hated each other or not.

","I really wanted to like the movie; I even dragged my husband along -in the afternoon. I really was in the mood, but I was so disappointed. Pride and Prejudice resonates today, I think, because the most worthy girl gets the best man; not the most beautiful girl, for we all know rich and powerful men love beautiful women. (Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau used to walk into a room and pick out the most beautiful woman, airhead or not, and talk to her all night).P and P is a fantasy we like because Lizzy is 'only tolerable.' It's her mind that is superior. She makes the perfect match for Darcy because, like himself and like Darbyshire, she is a perfect balance of animal energy and civility. It would be hard being an atistocrat's wife (see Kennedy wife) and you do believe that LIzzy and Darcy would make a perfect couple. Knightley's Lizzie is too beautiful and too impetuous. She's even rude to both her parents! This LIzzie and Darcy would be a disaster, once the hormones had cooled down. I can see her dancing naked in the rain in Permberly and being locked in a wing by Darcy for the rest of her life. (Like Margaret Trudeau, the free spirit and beautiful wife of Trudeau, who lost it under the pressure.) And the dumbed down dialogue, eek. and when Knightley does utter classic lines, she sounds exactly like Jennifer Ehle. McFayden( is that the spelling) has a nice physique (I grant you that :) but he does not have Firth's pipes. You need a sexy voice to make the 'courtship' dialogue seem sexy, I think. But maybe I""m old fashioned..."

","but not good enough to tempt me out of my admiration for the miniseries.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, this is probably a nice primer if you want an overview over the novel without too many details. Knowing book and miniseries almost by heart, you cannot imagine my sufferings when Austen quotations were torn and stretched out of context... The good thing was that some people laughed at actual Austen quotes, even if they were in the wrong place...In some scenes, the rewriting hasn't been done very elegantly - compare the conversation about ""accomplished women and their figures"" in the book and the movie. And why was the dialog changed so that things Lizzie was to say were said by Darcy?<br/><br/>However, there is one thing I really hated: the portrayal of Georgiana. From the novel, we know that she is exceedingly shy, and even gives Wickham ground for his claims of her arrogance. The way she greeted Elizabeth upon first meeting her was, in my humble opinion, plainly wrong and contradictory to the primary source. <br/><br/>I also resent that almost all of my favourite lines were omitted: Lady Catherine's "" I must have my share.."", Darcy's ""I am in no humour to give consequence to young ladies slighted by other men"", Lizzie's "" My feelings... my feelings are quite changed..."" etc, pp.<br/><br/>I also thought that Elizabeth was, despite being a lively character, sometimes well out of decorum when talking to Darcy, effectively proving his accusations about her family's lack of Decorum right. She was a bit too frank to still be considered charming and accomplished. <br/><br/>Two minor things: Why did it have to rain, when the first proposal took place - why did it have to be delivered on the grounds anyway? The Collinses parlour was quite charming...and a lot warmer! And why is there such a total lack of hairpins? Even though being set in the regency era, people were able to have hairstyles...<br/><br/>An Austen primer, even if with a bit of a Bronte touch, but no serious adaption of the novel."

","It's a well-known tale from Jane Austen back in the early 19th century. In a society where the only thing anybody seems to think about is finding a good suitor for his or her children, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are busy with five daughters to stress about. Lucky for them, one of their five, Lizzie (Keira Knightley), has a good enough grasp on her own independence to figure things out for herself.<br/><br/>If you can understand the British lilt accompanying the archaic repartee used throughout much of this film, then more power to you. Luckily, it doesn't hinder my ability to comprehend the main story, but the problem lies in the lighthearted banter that picks up the mood between dramatic ambits. Some things may get lost in translation, but it gets its point across.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen does well as the famed Mr. Darcy. When you first see him on screen, he's so cold that you have no idea how that man is capable of love of any kind. He and Knightley's chemistry grows as their characters' does.<br/><br/>Lizzie, being from a more middle-class family, and Mr. Darcy, a wealthy personage of significance, have unspoken tensions and reservations about each other regarding financial status. And obviously, the point is that we should look past superficial attraction and at true character. However, this is derailed a bit as director Joe Wright's order of things gives us some reason to believe that Lizzie could, in fact, be falling in love with Mr. Darcy for those exact reasons. I assure you, this is far from Austen's original intent.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this 2005 adaptation means well and is a classic piece of modern cinema. It may not be my first choice of drama to watch on any given day, but the impressive performances by the whole cast, along with the very consistent pacing make for an enjoyable watch. The beautiful scenery and set pieces are a plus, providing a pleasurable watch all the way to the end.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 96"
"mirwais-orbit","4","3","4","30 October 2011"," Keep the book...
","I finished reading the book this week, and so decided to watch the movie. The differences between them are huge. Unfortunately the movie isn't that good for a lot of reasons.<br/><br/>What make Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice an amazing book isn't the love story between Lizzy and Darcy, but how she was able to concoct a full circle story full of subplots with so few in her hands. Even being written in the 19th Century, the book was some kind written to be adapted somehow. The chapters are divided like scenes. Those who are familiar to her books are well known that the lack of places and their descriptions are for the fact that she was a single home writer woman and never a person who traveled a lot or was interested or able to know different places, which also gives readers creative freedom to build in their minds their own places and locations. Jane's primer interests always were how people were able to relate to each other within their society and their different social classes in a era full of manners and customs. She was a gifted social observer, knowing perfectly how to outline and describe people's personality into her characters, giving to the readers the possibility to always differ characters by their ways and, the most important thing, their dialogs, by the way she structures them. She couldn't be able to describe perfectly a place, but she could describe perfectly and paint with words a character and its personality.<br/><br/>As the title says, all the gears of entire book resolves under both words and Jane plays with them all the time making them part of every single character, sometimes being a merit or sometimes being a flaw.<br/><br/>The movie not only cuts a lot of what is in the book but also misinterprets important meanings and characters. Also, it lacks of the subtlety, the irony and the sarcasm that are some of the most important characteristics of her style. Even the movie using most of the original dialogs, the actors seems to don't know whom they are exactly playing because they never give the impact or the subtle characteristics that Jane describes.<br/><br/>Mr. Bennet in the book is described as a man intensively sarcastic, dried by years of a marriage that slowly replaced the love by a day-by-day consideration and convenience, respecting and being comprehensible to everyone but never being a tender figure, completely the opposite of what Donald Sutherland portrayed in the movie and his remaining American accent. The same can be said about some other characters. Keira Knightley in my point of view wasn't the best choice and her 2006's Academy Award Nomination is a doubt in my head, but I prefer keep to myself my opinions about her as I know that there are a lot of people that intensively defends her performance. Mr. Darcy is a serious man tired of the hypocrite society that surrounds him and the usual formalities for being a public figure. He's almost a sociopath, because he loves the ones he likes and lives with, but he despite the ones he never met. He's a man of few words, but he's not impolite. He's subtle, he's clever and a great observer, and Matthew Macfadyen may have a strong figure and presence, but his performance is cold and empty, and not just contained and oppressed as Mr. Darcy really is. Mr. Collins, as Jane Austen describes, has a forced and inconvenient formality using difficult vocabulary when speaking to impress and seems noble, but he is not insecure and freak as the film shows. Most of the cast fades. Credits go for those ones who knew what they were doing like Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.<br/><br/>So... analyzing the movie as a whole, I think that Joe Wright could indeed have taken more advantage of the social criticism Jane Austen so implicit describes, also the relationships of people around their prides and prejudices, the subtlety and the sarcasm of the dialogs and the constant British formality."

The scenery in the version with Jennifer Ehle was beautiful and the acting was second to none. David Bamber was a perfect Mr Collins and Barbara Leigh-Hunt a perfect Lady Catherine de Bourgh. I give 10/10 for all the actors in this version, it is a pleasure to watch and the music is lovely.

"Amonute-Matoaka","1","4","6","29 May 2014"," I feel unbelievably sad and cheated
","This movie is a disgrace. To it's producers, to the movie industry and to the world as a whole. Never in my life have I seen a movie that made me want to scream at whatever deity listens for mercy.<br/><br/>Joe Wright, took a masterpiece of British literature and turned it into a cheap Rom com. Now all those men and women who don't know a thing about Jane Austen, have mistakenly associated her work with this God awful movie. That is the reason why I decided to write this review. Dear readers, please, do not watch this movie. Or if you do, watch it as if it were another Nancy Meyers film, don't connect it with Jane Austen. If you want to watch a Pride and Prejudice true adaptation, go and watch the BBC mini series. You can't possibly find a better one.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin to explain my desperation. Lets start with the plot. Pride and Prejudice is first and foremost, a book written to criticize in a humorous manner the ways of society in the early 19th century. On a second level, it is a novel of characters, meaning that it's progress and outcome depends on character development. It is not a romantic novel! I can't say that loud enough to be understood. Even if you ignore the book's purpose and only look at the relationship parts you have to be a fool to think Austen as a hopeless romantic. Those who have read Austen know, that her idea of love had nothing to do with romance and everything to do with true character and personal growth. The basis of Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth's relationship is mutual trust and respect, not love. Austen thought of love as the achievement of years of trials for those with true character. Austen's characters were not lovestruck puppies. That alone renders this movie useless. With it's melancholic shots, and Lizzy whirling around on swing and professing her love in the rain on a secluded location. What a load of crap. Maybe they were filming Jane Eyre but didn't yet know.<br/><br/>And now that the plot abuse is behind us, lets move on to the miscast. Matthew Macfadyemn's ""Mr.Darcy"" is a constantly constipated little rich boy. At the first part of the story, he isn't proud, or sceptical, or frustrated with what he then viewed as an inferior social circle to the one he was accustomed to. Not in a single shot do we see even a hint of his desperation and his inner struggle between the honour of his family and his affection for Elizabeth. He just needed a bathroom break. I could write a review on his awful acting skills alone(as far as Mr. Darcy is concerned). I am not going to grace Keira Knightley with analyzing her performance. I thought her jaw would pop out in some of the scenes from the constant petulant child gig. If that was Elizabeth Bennet I should just go up the roof of my house and jump. <br/><br/>Succinctly, Lydia was not an arrogant, wild teenager, she was just loud. Mrs Bennet was a servant into her own house. Mr.Bennet was boring and witless. Mr.Collins was not funny (among other things). How did you pull that off? He is the reason behind one of the funniest scenes ever written and I think I cried a bit at how awful it was in this film. Lady Catherine De Bourgh was serious, she was not at all the caricature Austen wrote. The rest were a blur. Oh! And ""Caroline"" was actually Miss Bingley. <br/><br/>Here is where I should mention that the creators were even unable to do a simple research on the period. The Bennets were farmers, with pigs running around their house. Lizzy met Darcy at 6 in the morning dressed in her nightgown for Christ's sake. ""Caroline's"" breasts were spilling out of her dress. Yes ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly how people dressed in the early 19th century.<br/><br/>Where is the characteristic wit and humour? Where is the character development? Where is the tension that suppressed feelings cause and the relief that comes with their expression? Where is the greatness of the secondary characters? Where is the ridicule of the inability of the characters to communicate? Where is Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice in this film?<br/><br/>To conclude, if it were just a period film, I would probably have simply watched it and forgotten it two days later. But they used Jane Austen's name and work and then made a farce out of it.<br/><br/>I have loved Jane Austen for the greatest part of my life. I read Pride and Prejudice for the first time when I was 12 years old and have read it hundreds of times since. To say I love Pride and Prejudice as a book, would be an understatement. It is a part of myself. It has touched me deeply, in the way that works of art are supposed to touch a soul but rarely do. This movie is a ridicule of said work. Watch with caution."
"maribel-aguilar","4","4","6","6 December 2013"," Pride & Prejudice (2005) Vs. Pride and Prejudice (1995)
","There are several versions of Jane Austen's pride and prejudice, but this one by far is a very poor version in comparison to the 1995 version. First I would like to point out how this shortened 2005 version with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen was an interesting attempt to shorten the long episodes, but there are many reasons why many state that it is a failed attempt. There are several facts that prove this.<br/><br/>This film was full of many wardrobe mistakes. This story is based on the 19th century and many wardrobe mistakes were done in the 2005 version such as not wearing bonnets outdoors, which was well done in the 1995 version. This just ruined the historical aspect of this story. I also personally did not like the impression that Elizabeth Bennet gave. In comparison to the 1995 version the 2005 version of Elizabeth was very poor. In the 1995 version Elizabeth would explore nature, walk a lot, she would have well thought out responses, seamed wise with her words, and give loving advice to her sister Jane, and was overall calm and respectable. But in the 2005 version Elizabeth explores less, gossips more, keeps secrets from her sister Jane, and just seams overall like she is bipolar due to the drastic mood changes from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Overall one of the mistakes that they did worst of all was how the scenes changed. It is understandable that this version had to be shorter which gave limited time to show each scene, but this made it confusing many times. Some examples of when the scenes were confusing were for example, when the scene just randomly changes to a running scene in the rain and Darcy is running after her and proposes to her for the first time. Also, there was the random scene were Elizabeth is with her aunt and uncle and she visits Pemberley. These scenes were just random and there were really no events that led up to it. There were several scenes that just randomly happened like this. Personally I think this could be confusing and there should at least have been a narrator or something to state what was going on in these events because the scenes changed very fast multiple times through the movie. Even if the 1995 version is longer, the scenes were nicely spaced apart. <br/><br/>Other comments I can make is that Mr. Collins in the 2005 version has a poor character and seems too boring, while in the 1995 version he is creepy, gross, and funny. And at the end of the 2005 version, there is not wedding scene, just a scene were Mr. Darcy calls Elizabeth Mrs. Darcy, which is a letdown considering that marriage is what was important thought the story."

","The script does not match the book because many passages were changed, which diminishes the quality of the entire film...and what bothers me the most is that almost all of the actors fail to highlight the qualities of their character. In my opinion, Mrs Bingley, Mrs Darcy, Ms Elizabeth, her mother, Mrs Collins and few more, simply can not live up to the requirements that the interpretation of such a character demands. This version of the ""Pride and Prejudice"" movie it doesn't even compare to the BBC mini-series, not to mention the 1940 masterpiece, when Sir Olivier Lawrence did a great job with the male lead role. I'm disappointed that nowadays they no longer make movies as good as in the '30s and '40s. It's a shame.. I advise you (after you read the book of course) to first watch the older version (1940), and after that you can watch this one. Pay attention to the details and make you're opinion based on the comparison between the 2 movies."
"LouE15","6","4","6","13 August 2007"," Some nice script touches and an original feel
","The story is so well known it seems superfluous to go over it again. If you haven't read and loved the book (one of the greats of English literature), shame on you. But knowing the story so well leaves the viewer at full liberty to pick as many holes in the film as we like. So here goes Keira Knightley I find captivating and infuriating by turns. At times her dark beauty eclipses everything else on screen - small wonder she's a huge star. But her jollyhockeysticks accent and gummy toothy ""isn't it FUN!"" smile drive me completely insane. However, overall she makes a pretty good Lizzie, and does the material  and herself  justice, carrying the film well enough.<br/><br/>Matthew McFadyen's Darcy is more problematic. I've revised my former opinion that he's just a 'wet' Darcy: this isn't fair. But his delivery is all wrong, and really, it must be part direction, not just his fault. He's not really engaging with the material or with Lizzie. His clipped and rushed lines were almost comical, racing to churn them out, and when he asks Lizzie in his plumiest tone; ""did you have a good trip?"" I burst out laughing  it's ridiculous! - Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson's Brief Encounter all over again! Alsoas a good looking man the cinematographer and director ought to have been able to 'find' the latent beauty in him, and maximise it. But I think this happens only rarely: for example, during his rainy first proposal, when his face has the luminosity to show that he really cares about Lizzie, proud and foolish as he is. I wonder (not for the first time) whether he's not been hoist, as it were, by his own petrifying 'period' hairstyle and clothes. Granted his character is itself at first stiff and formal, but once he gets to know Lizzie better, he should change subtly, and he doesn't. You don't get to see how she's affected him, and in his snarling ripostes to Lizzie's playful thrusts, he seems to be in a perpetual and sometimes rather bad-tempered sulk.<br/><br/>Casting and script alike reflect the charming/infuriating conflict. Wickham's chirping is bland, ineffective and not charming. Dame Judy seems to be the only actress of her age known to Hollywood: there are others, you know! I found Bingley  excellent in series 2 of ""Rome""  incomprehensible, sniggering and implausibly awkward, like a sort of Shakespearean buffoon. But I loved Brenda Blethyn's silly but nonetheless astute Mrs Bennett, and Claudie Blakley made a very appealing, down to earth Charlotte Lucas. Donald Sutherland's Mr Bennett is interestingly cast, an 18th century man, out of touch with the new century. This reinterpretation of period is one of the film's chief innovations and delights. The Bennett family and surroundings represent the rougher, less polished 18th century; while the expensive BIngleys and Darcys are the modern and determinedly fashionable face of the more restrictive and cold early 19th century (I know which I'd rather have lived in).<br/><br/>If I didn't know intimately what would 'happen next' in every single scene, I think I'd have got lost, as script rehashes paid every sacrifice to the constraints of the modern film format. Periodically, however, screenwriter Moggach dredges up beautiful snatches of long-forgotten original dialogue which truly add to the charm of the piece. I really disliked the second proposal: both of them looking like they've walked out of a commercial for a chocolate bar or a shampoo. I also didn't much like the brazen and showy use of Chatsworth as Darcy's home. Using so well known a building has an alienating effect, engendering disbelief at a point in the story when you most need to believe in Darcy as a real, and not a fairytale, man.<br/><br/>My favourite moment comes in a scene at Bingley's Netherfield house: Lizzie and Miss Bingley have been 'taking a turn' about the room, and meantime exchanging sharp witticisms and sly flirting with Darcy, who sits, writing, in the centre of the room. In the scene's final shot, Darcy, in the foreground, pauses, discomfited, pen in hand, while behind him the two ladies part and circle, for all the world like cats circling prey. A finely judged shot, and in fact the whole film is beautifully shot and lit throughout. However, I find myself preferring the 80s Fay Weldon adaptation more and more as time goes by. Elizabeth Garvie's delicately drawn, gentle Lizzie, and the stately pace and modest tone of the whole, seem to suit my taste much better. This sort of attempt  to sex up what is already plenty sexy if you only ensure that the leads have chemistry and the sparkling, witty dialogue remains firmly in place  just makes the least of the available material. Of course, as a woman in love with romanticism, that doesn't mean I won't be watching the DVD until it wears out"

I do not think I was the only one who sighed, giggled and wanted to be in Elizabeth's shoes more than anything throughout the night! If I should say anything not good about this movie is that it is a little rushed from time to time; famous lines from the book is swiftly said just to have it in there and one thing that I gravely lacked was the kiss between the two lovers (it's very annoying that the Americans can see it and we poor souls in Europe can not...) But even so, I dare say that 'Pride & Prejudice' is one of the best films I have even seen, and that is not just because I love the book.

","This must be one of the worst possible versions of P&P that could possibly be conceived. While I realise the difficulties in fitting such a rich story into a 2-hour film, the time constraints are no excuse for the absolutely appalling acting. I couldn't imagine a worse Lizzy Bennett. Keira Knightley seems to possess only two facial expressions and she turns a witty and intelligent young woman into a silly and insipid character. Mr Darcy too has none of the charm or mystery expected by those of us who love the book, hardly displaying any personality. The writers of the screenplay seem to have entirely missed the relationships and undercurrents within the Bennett household as well as the customs of the day when the story was written. The only saving grace of this film is the performance of Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Burgh, but one does wonder why she would wish to associate herself with this otherwise very poor production.<br/><br/>Anyone who wishes to acquaint themselves with the magic that is Pride and Prejudice should get hold of a copy of the 1995 BBC miniseries, which is much more true to the original story and characters. And as for an example of how to turn one of Jane Austen's masterpieces into a 2-hour Hollywood performance, I would highly recommend the mid-90s Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thomson and Kate Winslet who show that there is indeed a way of portraying 19th century women as something other than giggling fools."

Lizzy was shallow, Jane hardly 'reserved and shy'. Lydia and Kitty had nothing to them - I frankly couldn't tell them apart until Lydia's elopement. Charlotte far more emotional than she should be. Mr Collins was much too wooden. Caroline Bingley lacked screen presence. Mr Wickham was totally without charm. I will concede Mary Bennet was nicely portrayed in her few scenes. Lady Catherine was let down only by script - the acting was lovely. Anne de Bourgh looked too healthy though!<br/><br/>It had some moments and as anonymous piece of costume drama, it would do tolerably.

"argomac","8","17","39","2 September 2005"," on the whole very good, but weak in places
","With the mid-90's TV adaptation of Jane Austen's classic still a favourite in many fan's memories, the motivation for this big screen adaptation is not entirely clear. Nonetheless, it is a very faithful and ultimately enjoyable film. Director Joe Wright presents a visually stunning period piece. The choice of locations provide the ideal backdrop for the drama that unfolds around the central character of Elizabeth Bennet (played surprisingly well by Kiera Knightley) and her sisters. With American film investment, there is the occasional American star. Most notably, Donald Sutherland has been questionably cast as Mr Bennett, the calm father in the centre of the storm created by all the hysterical women in his family. Sutherland plays a different Bennet senior than we are used to, but brings such subtle humour and warmth to the role, you cannot help but appreciate his presence. The women in this film are all fairly standard. The younger and sisters simper and giggle as well as can be expected, and another American Jena Malone as Lydia copes admirably (if a little immaturely) when her character develops a brief storyline of her own. Rosamund Pike plays older bashful sister Jane with a quiet elegance, complimented very well by her suitor Simon Woods, charming to the last as Mr Bingley. By comparison, it is unfortunate the leading male role of Mr Darcy should have gone to Matthew MacFadyen. Comparisons to a certain Mr Firth aside, Mr MacFadyen delivers such a disappointing portrayal of Darcy, that it is only the sheer strength of the other cast members that save him from ruining the film entirely. It is all very well to look moody and raise an eyebrow occasionally, but this is not enough of a performance to give the character any depth, particularly as his love for Elizabeth blossoms. Perhaps it is the fault of the script, but since the rest has been so thoroughly written, this does not seem too likely. And in a standard little cameo, Dame Judi Dench thoughtfully refrains from stealing the scene as Lady Catherine De Bourgh. Having played Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, Lady Bracknell, and 'M' all within recent memory, her performance comes across as a stodgy mix of every formidable battle-axe rolled into one. Hardly stretching her acting muscle, but she is clearly an obvious choice to play her. Take from it what you will. The film has all the right ingredients to do the book justice, with the vast majority of the cast performing brilliantly, no matter what the role. Nearly let down by one or two, it manages to salvage itself from any real embarrassment, and eventually emerges as a very good film indeed."
"jondent21","6","11","23","18 September 2005"," My comments are partisan, but with good reason.
","I have read the book and seen the BBC version. I went expecting much what I got, but had not completely written it off.<br/><br/>First things first. It is a difficult task to reduce the book to a two hour film; really it is. I shall return to this point later.<br/><br/>Cast: Mrs Bennett was nowhere near as good as Alison Steadman's version, who was one of the two star performances of the BBC version. Steadman has been accused of being a caricature in the BBC version. Indeed, this is what Austin's book commands of Mrs Bennett.<br/><br/>Second, the other star of the BBC version was Mr Collins. Enough said about the new Mr Collins the better. Surely, he isn't a man that a girl would wish to marry and he is annoying - but that is where it ends. It should go much further than this. He should be utterly repulsive, as he is in the BBC version.<br/><br/>Third, Mr Bingley - drab and too silly. Forth, the sisters - not silly enough, just annoying. Lydia in particular, fails. Mary is better than the BBC version.<br/><br/>In general I did not like Mr Bennett, but where this film does do better than the BBC version is the final scene between Mr Bennett and Elizabeth, which here is better-scripted and acted.<br/><br/>Dudy Dench, good as she is, was not correctly cast I feel. Judy plays such roles well, but she is too famous to play such a small role well. When one sees such famous faces it takes a while to accept them to the film and stop seeing them as themselves. Judy does not have time to do this. So whilst the BBC's choice of actor could be improved upon, the script does not allow it.<br/><br/>And it is the script that I have most issue with. It fails on every count. The director does a good job of condensing the story to a film script, but this film should not be, as the book is not, about Elizabeth and some Mr Darcy meeting and eventually falling in love after some initial Pride and Prejudice. It should create an atmosphere and tell a story of society in addition. It should be acute in human observation. It should be everything that this film is not. I am afraid that the criticism is a damning one. Many money-making films are filmed for that reason and succeed because they prey on the fickle emotions of their audience. This film should have done much more than that but did not, and, in my opinion, did not obviously try to.<br/><br/>Kiera is perfectly good as Elizabeth given that I am generally no fan. On the other hand I am a fan of Matthew, but he fails somewhat as Darcy. I saw him as sexually in need and not proud enough. In fairness, none of his character's failings were his own but of the script (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>Elizabeth was given no reason to hate Mr Darcy so much. Indeed, apart from one comment he made about her being ""tolerable"", he was clearly in love with her every time he appeared, and the only negative thing she heard about him was that he did not give a living to someone his father wished one for: hardly a reason to hate the man with the passion she apparently did.<br/><br/>To conclude, I said earlier that it was a difficult task to reduce this to a film. All that I could ask myself as I sat and watched, was why? This film should not have been made. The only possible motive for its manufacture is surely one of finance, which irks me.<br/><br/>If you have not seen the BBC version and, or, read the book, then you will likely enjoy this film to some extent; though perhaps not consider it a must-buy. If you have seen the BBC version, then by all means go and see this film, if only to re-establish your appreciation of the former."
"NavyOrion","8","7","13","27 May 2008"," Who knew? Keira Knightley can actually act!
","I stumbled onto this adaptation of the famous novel on TV, only a few weeks after having viewed the Greer Garson / Lawrence Olivier version. I admit I honestly was not prepared to enjoy it much. After seeing Keira Knightley's - ahem - ""acting"" in the various ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, I expected something along the lines of Demi Moore's ""Scarlett Letter"". To my great surprise, she was quite good! <br/><br/>This movie definitely has a more modern feel than the 1940 version, which is to be expected. But with much of the formality stripped away, the emotions are better revealed. Knightley gives a very fine performance as the proud girl whose head will not be so easily turned, and refuses to let her family be trifled with; her anger and resentment when she learns of Darcy's interference with Jane's romance (and in rudely rebuffing his proposal) is much more genuine than that of Garson's Lizzie. Matthew Macfadyen also does well, playing Darcy not as Olivier's arrogant fop, but as a young man who wishes to do the right thing, but sometimes seems constrained almost to the point of stuttering by his shyness.<br/><br/>Smaller roles were also well cast: the somewhat surprising choice of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was a pleasure in his every scene, and Brenda Blethyn as his well-intentioned but frivolous wife was almost as much fun as 1940's Mary Boland. Rosamund Pike practically emanated goodness as the gentle Jane, while Judy Dench commanded her every scene as the blood-chilling Lady Catherine, who would not easily allow her stratum of society to be polluted by the upstart Bennet family. (That was the kind of role trademarked by Edna May Oliver, though, and I still prefer her, even if she did allow some sliver of goodness to peek through.) <br/><br/>I have not seen the oft-cited BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", but I can attest that this 2005 version was also an excellent production. It is quite accessible to modern audiences, and has been made so without the common error of ""dumbing down"" the story or characters for modern tastes. It's nice to see that enjoyable period movies from classic literature can still be made without tossing in a rock ballad or changing the setting to modern Los Angeles, just to please the kiddies.<br/><br/>Rent this one and get your teenage daughter to watch it (it'll be easier if you mention Keira Knightley stars.) Who knows, you just may open a whole new world to her."
"sceneshistoriques","5","7","13","21 December 2005"," Elizabeth Bennet is miscast
","Keira Knightley is not the Elizabeth Bennet of the book. Apart from this glaring mistake, the rest of the movie is good. The two elder sisters are supposed to be more dignified and substantial than the younger three. At some points in the movie, Knightley's Lizzie acts quite silly, which probably appeals to modern audiences, but is not in keeping with Lizzie Bennet's character. Furthermore, Lizzie is not supposed to be as good-looking as Jane. Her attractions are supposed to be more subtle. Keira Knightley is definitely better looking than the actress who played Jane Bennet. Again, I think this is to appeal to modern audiences, who just cannot have the heroine being upstaged in attractiveness by anyone else."

Another review thought they lacked any sexual attraction, I'm really surprised, in the rain scene they were so hot they sizzled. I thought Macfadyen was a great Darcy and perfect for the way the film choose to develop him, he managed to go from the stern pompous prefect to a proper love interest by little changes in demeanour and behaviour. Keira shone too although perhaps a bit toothy."

In fact I was so embarrassed by the whole affair, I had to turn it off half way through. And whilst it is well known that the Bennetts weren't extremely rich, they were rich enough to maintain their home and keep servants. what where the producers thinking when they chose that location to film this wonderful story.

","Oh dear! I have no choice but to give this movie a generous one star. This latest adaptation of PnP forgot to adapt the novel. They copied some dialogues from the novel here and there and then added some really dumb ones as if the novel didn't have enough spectacular lines. Babe the pig made a special appearance. Where did that come from? They made the Bennets as poor as the servants as if to justify Keiras malnourished state. Mr Bennet looks like he's on drugs. Mrs Bennet is not annoying enough to be Mrs Bennet. Dame Judi Dench's talent was wasted. Mr Bingley is a complete moron. I don't know why they bothered to put George Wickam in the picture, he didn't make any impact at all. Elizabeth is no better than her younger sisters. Keira should have eaten first before doing this film or perhaps her anorexic state is due to so much housework they made her do.Mr Darcy never had a strong presence and I never once thought he was handsome. Mathew Macfadyen tried very hard to make Darcy romantic but forgot to be proud in the process. The whole cast look as if they just came out of the washing machine. There are so many things that made this film a failure as an adaptation and I am not even going to compare this to the much loved 1995 BBC mini series because there is no comparison. This film made a mess of itself all on its own."
"jupersdupers","2","9","18","7 January 2006"," Sugar-coated Jane Austen
","I'll be gratified if this 2005 P&P pulls in a younger crowd and gets a few of them reading the incomparable Jane Austen, but the BBC P&P remains unvanquished as THE screen adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>This P&P offers few improvements over the BBC production, but there are some: 1) Jane is supposed to be knock-dead beautiful, but is played by a bovine-looking actress in the BBC production. The 2005 P&P got the casting here straight.<br/><br/>2) Ditto the Wickham actor. The BBC's Wickham was odd-looking and not charming enough to warrant Lizzy and Lydia (plus the rest of the town) swooning over him at first meeting. The 2005 P&P, again, did a much-better casting job here.<br/><br/>3) I like this 2005 Darcy, which surprised me. After Colin Firth, I didn't think anyone could ever again come close to nailing this character. But this 2005 Darcy did something that Colin Firth did not: he made the difficult shift from being cold and snobbish at the start to the final lovable Darcy believably.<br/><br/>This is where this newer P&P falls short: 1) Way too much time spent on close-ups of Kira Knightley. There's so much to pack into this movie. Why waste all that time on these pointless scenes? After the 4th one, I was sighing with boredom.<br/><br/>Also, couldn't the costumers have chosen wardrobe that better disguised Knightley's painful thinness? Something's wrong when you stop paying attention to the movie and instead, muse on whether Knightley has anorexia or is host to a colony of tapeworms.<br/><br/>2) Why oh why did they portray the Bennett's house, Longbourne, as something akin to a pig farm? Every wall was cracked and needed paint, the stones crumbling. There's nothing in Jane Austen to support this interpretation, and it ignores fact: even if the Bennetts are a heartbeat (the father's) away from abject poverty, they are depicted as gentry in the book. Pigs in the house - pah!<br/><br/>3) Mrs. Bennett was not silly enough. Look, I feel for her in the novel. If I were Mrs. Bennett, I'd be out with a lasso looking for rich husbands for my daughters too, but dammit, this is NOT the way Jane Austen saw her. An extraordinarily important point was missed here: Mrs. Bennett has be stupid and embarrassing enough that you can understand why Darcy steers Bingley away from Jane. She must make you cringe with mortification. She has to be silly enough to exactly balance Lady Catherine, which is exactly what Austen did in the novel. It's a delicious parallel that this movie did not pull off.<br/><br/>4) Not enough Lydia! The movie never gave Lydia enough screen time to establish her character. Ditch those overlong close-ups of Knightley moon-cowing around and add more Lydia! <br/><br/>5) Mr. Collins 2005: nice try,but not quite as good as Mr. Collins BBC.<br/><br/>6) Donald Sutherland a decent Mr Bennett, but this movie makes his relationship with Mrs. Bennett too warm, too intimate. The real Mr Bennett avoids the missus at all costs, irritably holing up in the library. When he has to be around her, his comments (all of which go over her head) hold her up to ridicule. Austen gets downright mean in her characterizations on this point. The 2005 movie had an improbable scene that showed Mr and Mrs Bennett in bed, talking and laughing together, a cuddly little scene that, considering everything Austen wrote, was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie missed out on some of the best fun in Jane Austen's novel: the biting humor, the occasionally mean (but horribly funny) wit. Yes, it was funny in parts but because it ignored the Austen edginess, it never achieved the depth of the BBC version.<br/><br/>Nice try, but nothing close to the BBC's rendition."
"Incalculacable","6","9","18","30 October 2005"," Not a patch on the BBC Miniseries
","I went and saw it today and my Dad remarked the BBC version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle sets the gold standard - every P+P will be compared to that.<br/><br/>I think the main problems with this movie are that some characters are dreadfully miscast, the limited time (the BBC version had 6+ hours, but this only has two) and the time wasted on unnecessary scenes instead of character building.<br/><br/>Bingley, for instance, is absolutely hopeless. He can't string two words together and is pathetic. You really wonder why Jane falls for him, and are even more bewildered to the fact that he is earning $5000 a year (he doesn't seem very intelligent!). The BBC mini series Bingley was well cast and didn't seem mentally retarded like this one. Keira Knightley is good. Same with the Mum. Jane was an angel. Darcy was surprisingly good. However, I found these characters didn't have the standard of the BBC version, and unfortunately a lot of characters were left out, leaving a huge gap.<br/><br/>Also, there was a lot of time wasted on scenes which didn't really have to be there. There was a lot of dancing, watching Elizabeth walk, dream like scenes there which could have been replaced with character building. It wasn't as evident that Lizzie and her Father were very close. A lot of the main points (e.g the incident with Wickham) are hardly main at all. Wickham hardly gets any air time and I think he too is miscast, but certainly not as bad as Bingly.<br/><br/>Another problem is that I think they tried to modernize this version a little to appeal to more people - probably more people who don't know a single thing about P+P, Jane Austen or the period in which this is Set. Some of the script isn't very old fashioned, as well as some of the hairstyles of the males.<br/><br/>This version seems to have interpreted the Bennets as more lower class. Longborn is hideous, with broken windows and pigs running through. The table manners are disgusting (each man for themselves), and there are some thing in this movie that just aren't right. The BBC version portrays them as more reserved, more upper class people but still quite poor. It is much more believable that way.<br/><br/>However this movie is not all bad. Lovely scenery, wonderful clothes, great houses.. but it's all a bit of an anti-climax, filled with miscast characters & inaccurate incidents. Not a patch on the beautifully done BBC miniseries. It's a hard thing to live up to."

However, the ground production values themselves (such as acting, plot) seem a bit hindered by the grandness of the visuals, as whilst fine in their own right, seem somewhat lame compared to the lush displays, thus harming the experience with a beautiful exterior almost destroying an adequate interior. Needless to say, it's still recommended, as it generally seems a good effort, and will probably be enjoyed by those who like period pieces."

It's watchable without being memorable and it makes all the right moves, about once in every reel there's a wide-angled chocolate-box shot to punctuate the less than exhilarating dialogue including an unashamed crib of Constable's The Hay Wain. The acting ranges from the mediocre to the highly competent - Judi Dench, for example, is NEVER going to be less than excellent in anything - but it's a pity that the acting honours are divided equally between the older generation, Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, at the expense of the young leads. Elizabeth Bennett and Darcy are direct descendants of Beatrice and Benedek so that if only subconsciously we don't just expect but demand clearly banked PASSION in the formal-to-arrogant exchanges but Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen fail miserably to deliver and both seem to walk-through it rather than attempt to act as if saving their real acting for other projects (MacFadyen was, in fact, appearing at the National Theatre as Prince Hal in Henry IV Parts I and II at the time).

It is beautifully shot by Roman Osin who uses glorious countryside and wonderfully colour in the exteriors and captures the sumptuous design in the interiors. And what design! It is a wonderful period piece with ornate and beautiful things to behold, all of which are held within the bracket of authenticity.<br/><br/>Credit must also be given to three others: Joe Wright for a stunning feature length directorial debut, Deborah Moggach for a superb adaptation of a novel that is sacred to millions and Dario Marianelli for his glorious subtle and splendid score.

","This was a horrible remake. I am a huge fan of the 1995 BBC/AAE version, and it is still up to date and relevant (not to mention, immensely popular), so I don't know why they even re-made this movie at all. The BBC miniseries was made for TV, but is of a movie quality. One could argue that six hours is too long, but as evidenced by this new version, you cannot do the story justice without giving it full time. It is too complex of a story to be told with short cuts. Despite this, I was willing to give this one a try, being a massive Austen fan, but I was extremely disappointed. The story was choppy and difficult to follow for viewers who had not already seen the other versions and/or read the book. The filming style was reminiscent of a bad day at sea and gave me a nauseated stomachache just from all the pitching around of the camera. I think that they tried to make the story ""earthier"" but, that ended up misrepresenting Austen's settings. Her characters are poor, but gentile, and no gentile country people would have chickens running through their house! Maybe in rural Appalachian America, but definitely not rural Napoleonic England. All of the casting choices were horrible. Mrs. Bennet was shrieky and completely without charm. It was a thinly veiled attempt at an imitation of the Mrs. Bennet of the 1995 BBC version. Donald Sutherland came across as an old lech and the Bennet daughters didn't even look like they came from the same family. They were all disheveled and sulky and any attempts at witty humor just came across as whiny sarcasm and vulgar humor. Jena Malone, especially, was a poor casting choice. Were there not any English actresses available? Why on Earth would you choose a mediocre at best American actress, when there are so many talented English girls that would be perfect for the part? Kierra Knightley was pretty, but seemed to rely on jutting her jaw out rebelliously as her main form of expressing ""Lizzy's"" character. She put no effort into her role at all and made me wonder if she'd even read the book or watched other versions. Darcy was boring, lacking any attractiveness, intensity or charisma. He also came across as whiny and sulky. I guess he was the only actor brave enough to attempt a Mr. Darcy after Colin Firth's famous lauded version of the role. Perhaps we should give him credit for his brave, if futile attempt? There was absolutely no chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy, which is supposed to give the story suspense and tension. You just didn't care if they got together or not. I just came out of the theatre feeling disgusted. I think Jane Austen would have been horrified at this slaughtering of her masterpiece. I know I was."

"claireems","6","10","21","17 September 2005"," Do not expect to be enthralled with this mild and 'aimable' version of Pride and Prejudice
","A new screen version of the universally loved and favourite Jane Austen book is always bound to have a hard time with the critics. Pride and Prejudice, with the heroine, Lizzie Bennet (played by Keira Knightley), has to be compared with the book and also with the early 90's BBC adaption. The makers have tried hard, but this Pride and Prejudice is just not as good as the Colin Firth BBC TV Series. Despite being well adapted to fit a fairly long novel into a two hour production, the film lacks the dynamics and feelings which should be evoked by the tale. The chemistry between Lizzie and Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) is not believable. The Mr Darcy of this version is not seen often enough on screen and therefore his character is not so developed and loved by the viewers. Mr Darcy was portrayed as wooden, instead of shy. Other characters were wonderfully portrayed, such as Mr Collins, who was played with such empathy to the disastrous little man vying for Lizzie's affections. Keira Knightley was very good in the film, and honestly played Lizzie with a modern twist to her character and to the film. Donald Sutherland, playing (Mr Bennet), however was a disappointment, whose character was not developed and did not seem to be well cast.<br/><br/>Now to the actual film... As I've mentioned before, the film was well adapted and the scenes were lively and energetic. However, the whole film was very Hollywood and clichéd. An example is Darcy's first proposal to Lizzie in the pouring rain, as well as the image of Darcy striding up to Elizabeth from the mist of the moors at the end. The love scenes were also not gripping and believable. Personally, I did not feel like I was watching the best sexual tension moments of all time.<br/><br/>All in all, Pride and Prejudice is worth the watch, just to see a new version of the book. However, it is not the amazing and wonderful film which some may be hoping for. I think that those, like me, who are in love with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and their story, should stay true to that version!"

","I prepared for this film by watching again the 1995 BBC version - perhaps a mistake. Still when the film started I was heartened by the opening scenes of the Bennett home and family. The assembly and Netherfield ball were terrific. But I gradually found myself getting bored. Plot development faltered, there was nil on-screen chemistry between Knightly and McFadden, the Lydia/Wickham subplot came and went with only one sentence to explain its significance to the rest of the girls' futures. The costumes and settings began to jar and instead of just enjoying the film I kept wondering about it's accuracy - did Mr Bennett really keep farm animals? Would he really have hugged Mary after the piano incident in quite such a modern-Dad sort of way?.<br/><br/>Knightly looks good, too good, but I just couldn't see her as Lizzie, and several times her voice tone and inflection exactly mirrored Ehle's. McFadden is not convincing. The music is excellent, the humming of the servant girl a lovely touch. The scenery and settings are beautiful, but again they didn't seem quite right for Austen. Much of the dialogue is dull. I just couldn't settle into this film."
"plaing","10","14","32","16 September 2005"," Excellent adaptation, better than earlier versions!
","Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. In particular I found the central performance by Keira Knightly carried the film, along with splendid support from Brenda Blethyn, the other Bennett sisters and some of the minor characters such as Tom Hollander's Mr Collins. The cinematography is ravishing and the music underscores the atmosphere very effectively. Maggoch has adapted the novel effectively, focusing it more strongly on Lizzie, with the male characters more to the background - just as in the novel. The principal casualty of this is Wickham, who is relegated to pretty boy louse with but a few lines. Inevitably comparisons will be made with the 1940 Garson/Olivier version, and the 1995 BBC TV mini-series - and this film, stands up very well compared to these - in fact, I'd argue its the best of the three. The 1940 version is principally interesting for the changes an American studio made to make the film interesting to its audience - the carriage race between the Bennetts and the Lucas family - the invitation with 'please bring this invitation with you', the Bennetts packing up to leave town after Lydia's disgrace, the choice of a Victorian setting, which the 34 year old star thought would more flatter her figure, the archery contest and the turning of Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a sympathetic character at the insistence of the actress, Edna May Oliver, playing her. The BBC version's tone was set by the opening titles - ravishing needlework, and glossy handsome locations, and heroines with improbable décolletage. Visually there is a big difference compared to the BBC version - here the Bennetts live in the country, mud and all, in the BBC version it was sanitised for its American co-producer's audience (dirty finger nails were not allowed). The other big difference between the BBC and this version is that in the former, given more time, adaptor Davies 'opened out' the story to show us more of Darcy - in the film Maggoch does not, arguably being 'truer' to the novel, for those who worry about such things. Both Ehle and Knightly make creditable Elizabeth's - Knightly possibly more 'girlie' and Ehle more 'knowing' - both excellent in different ways. On the secondary parts the film is stronger, with Blethyn avoiding the Dickensian caricature Steadman fell into in Mrs Bennett, similarly Tom Hollander's Mr Collins avoided the grotesque of his BBC precursor, David Bamber. Finally, Darcy - given the adaptor's focus on Lizzie I think MacFadyen does the lingering glances and aloofness hiding shyness as well could be done. Its difficult following in the footsteps of Colin Frith's wet shirt...but I think MacFadyen succeeds. In summary, a very successful adaptation, thoroughly enjoyable - and my favourite of the three."
"larrysez","1","6","11","24 June 2012"," WORST Adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in Decades
","Between Deborah Moggach's god-awful screenplay and director Joe Wright's dismal vision of a filthy, graceless English upper class, this is the most dismal of the many film versions of Jane Austen's classic since the laughably bad 1940 movie. <br/><br/>The Elizabeth Bennett of this movie is a slovenly, thick-headed country bumpkin who eats like a slob, plays the pianoforte like a ham-fisted 5-year-old and has the conversational skills of an autistic teenage boy. She lives in a grubby, falling down hovel surrounded by untended fields, dusty drives and muddy yards filled with free-roaming livestock. Compared to this version of poor Elizabeth, Tess of the Durbervilles was like Marie Antoinette. Elizabeth is not alone in this coarseness, however; director Wright gives us an entire class of people who look more like ragtag medieval peasants than 19th century aristocrats.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and ignore this travesty. The marvelous 1995 mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is vastly better in every way, especially its choice of sticking faithfully to Jane Austen's dialogue and plot line, instead of debasing them with a cheesy Hollywood attempt at embellishment."
"brianashay_007","10","6","11","8 August 2008"," one of my favorite movies of all time:)
","Not to be rude or anything, but to everyone who said that the movie was disappointing, horrible, blah,blah,blah, it doesn't to the movie, you seriously must not have been watching the same movie as me. The movie brought that book to life. And some of you may say that the older movies portrayed the book so much better. Honestly, the older movies put me to sleep. Neither of them had the excitement, romance, or even humor in them that this version had. I absolutely love this movie. It's my number two favorite movie of all time (p.s. i love you being number 1). There's so many moments that make the development of Darcy's and Lizzie's romance take place which is the entire point in the film. i could talk about this movie for hours, co I'm just going to stop while I can. But if you seriously don't like this movie, you either don't like romance what so ever (i'm a sucker for romance) or you're just plain ridiculous. I'm only 15 and i'm about to turn 16, so i've been watching this since i was about 12 and it has never bored me once. i continuously watch it over and over, and every time I watch it I find something else that captures my attention. I absolutely love it, no question about it."
"woo2510","8","6","11","29 December 2007"," It's not the book, it's a film so enjoy it for what it is.
","There are very occasions where a film surpasses a book and this does not change with Pride and prejudice. The only film i can think of off the top of my head is Jaws. However, we as the audience have to accept this and move on. Adapting romantic novels is especially hard as there is little action to speak of. Therefore the story must be altered slightly, hence adaptation. The Jane Austin purists may, and probably will despise this film. However all good adaptation's are not completely accurate otherwise they would on the whole be boring. To cover the novel in more depth would take hours. <br/><br/>This film should be enjoyed for what it is: beautifully shot, well directed and superbly acted. Kiera Knightley is superb as Elizabeth and is well supported by Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland and Mathew Macfadyen. However, the film is almost stolen by the surprisingly brilliant Tom Hollander who plays the sleazy Mr Collins. One point which has been widely criticised is the state of the Bennet household and the fact they have no servants. Yes this may be inaccurate however, it does give leverage for Mrs Bennet to be far more loopy than in the novel which Brenda Blethyn does superbly. <br/><br/>This film was always going to have its lovers and its haters. But when you watch this film just watch it for what it is, an accomplished piece of film making."
"ccjuniorgurl07","10","6","11","14 August 2007"," No Words Can Describe This Movie
","No words can describe this movie and still give it justice. While it does cut a lot from the novel, I never read it so it doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>I watched the 1995 mini-series and thought it was a complete bore. It almost turned me off to seeing this movie. Almost.<br/><br/>When I did see this movie I was treated to laughs, characters I could watch and believe and a story that was not only easy to follow, but pulled me in. I could see that Darcy and Elizabeth really liked each other, and I was left screaming at my television while watching how they interacted. It was like ""What is wrong with you, you like him, so tell him!"" Keira Knightely did an amazing job as the softer yet still tough Lizze. Most of the rolls Keira takes seem to be showing a more rougher and bad ass version of women, but she pulled this off amazingly well. Matthew Macfayden was exactly what Darcy should be, he was stoic and proud and rigid, yet he still was able to show how he felt for Lizzie with real emotions. Rosamund Pike (Jane) is a timeless beauty. Nobody in today's era could possibly pull off Jane the way Rosamund did.<br/><br/>I can find nothing bad to say about this movie. I loved the chemistry between Keira and Matthew as well as Rosamund and Simon. I hated Mr. Whickham, but at the beginning when he was first mentioned I found him charming and likable. And he was actually attractive, which is more than can be said about the '95 Wickham.<br/><br/>If I continue this review it will take up two pages, I loved this movie. If you wish to see a version of Pride and Prejudice with emotion and likable characters, I strongly suggest you see this movie. It is a beautiful and amazing adaptation."
"annie2078","8","6","11","6 February 2007"," A bright, sparkling adaptation
","I have to say that when I first heard they were remaking Pride and Prejudice, I was a bit incredulous. I've read P&P once a year, every year, since I was 12, and since seeing the 1995 A&E/BBC version, I wondered why another version was even necessary. I thought Kiera Knightly could probably pull off Elizabeth, but had never heard of Matthew Macfadyen...and who could compare to to Colin Firth? <br/><br/>But, never one to miss an interpretation of P&P, I went and saw it in the theater. And I had to admit, rather quickly, that it was exceptionally well-done. Not perfect, but in the short run time, they managed to fit a lot in, as well as convey some things that, frankly, didn't make it into 1995's near-perfect film. For one, the book leaves you with the impression that the Bennett family, while capable of employing servants, are not exceptionally wealthy. In the 1995 version, I was surprised at how, well, more than middle class they appeared. In this version, though, Longbourne looks more how like I always pictured it in the book: a bit shabby and lived in, but home. I was also impressed with the assembly in this version. It's fast and loud, joyful and infectious, and it truly conveys why the 5 Bennett girls enjoy dancing so much.<br/><br/>But the true surprise was Matthew MacFadyen. As Darcy, he grew on me, almost as Darcy grows on Elizabeth, becoming more handsome as the movie progressed. MacFadyen lends an intensity to Darcy that (and I never thought I'd admit something like this) Colin Firth's portrayal lacked. One of the touches of MacFadyen's Darcy that I particularly liked were his stutters in both proposals. Things become more real when you say them out loud, and here is a man, declaring his love to a woman that his entire upbringing has told his is beneath his notice...it's part nerves, partly (at least in the first proposal) fighting against himself, and it just worked.<br/><br/>The secondary supporting cast are all fantastic: Tom Hollander's Collins is less simpering, Dame Judy Dench's Lady Catherine is more imperious, Wickham is more handsome than his 1995 mini-series counterpart (so it's more obvious why Elizabeth is initially attracted to him), and Charlotte Lucas shows more of the desperation of her situation.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved it, just as much as the 1995 version, and it's found a home in my DVD collection, right alongside the mini-series. I think Jane would be pleased as well."

","Jane Auston's Pride and Prejudice has never been my favourite novel but this movie is certainly marvellous. To make a movie on a well-read book is quite a difficult task. The producer and director have to fulfill the expectations of the reader. In other words, film should depict characters and locations as the reader of the book expected them to be. It is quiet a task. So, usually, I don't see movies based on great novels or dramas. Generally , for me, they depict something different than my concept of the character. But this movie is not one of them. This movie gave me the features to my blurry concempt of characters and locations. It enhanced rather confirmed my imagination of the characters.Nearlly every actor of the movies is quite suitable to his or her character.Cinematography is charming. Kiera is brilliant in the character of Lizzy and Mathew is convincing as Darcy. Though sometimes I felt the script a bit sketchy but I know that they cannot bundle every detail of the novel in a movie of 127 minutes. Now I am thinking to change my opinion about the films based on novel. A must see for the lovers of Classics! I give it 7 out of 10."

"satchel-2","3","6","11","15 April 2006"," Putrid
","Overdirected, poorly paced, overdone and painfully obvious, this film was a disappointment in nearly every respect. 4 Oscar nominations?! What were they smoking? Cinematic clichés abound. Laboriously long slow approaches a la Walter Hill, grandiose wide angle vistas and cheap story devices made me wish I had rented a better rendition of a Jane Austen novel. If only this film were crafted with the studied restraint of Mr. Darcy instead of the juvenile giddiness of Lydia and the stubborn pride of Lizzie. Instead the result is the same torturous and relentless self-indulgence that Lady Catherine might display in telling this story."
"Trin22","9","6","11","3 October 2005"," A very cinematic adaptation, definitely worth a look
","I don't know what's with all those harsh comments. The standards applied here seem a bit unfair. Perhaps this is not an adaptation true to the letters of Jane Austen, but it captures an essential part of the story and unfolds it on the big screen in such a lusciously visual way. In the BBC adaptation, Mr. Darcy had all the extra scenes that explain his inner struggles and following transformations, but Mr. Darcy in this film is entirely colored by Lizzy's subjective perception. So that's why we feel a little bit blocked out from his point of view. However, Matthew Macfadyen is a very subtle and nuanced actor and gives much more than is required or allowed, for that matter. Seen from Lizzy's point of view, this story feels much more intimate and personal. I think the makers and the cast emphasized aspects of the story that are different from the BBC version. Although I'm a huge fan of '95 version and Colin Firth, I had no problem with this adaptation. To be fair, at least this film is much, much better than most films hit the theaters near you these days."
"realme_5","3","8","16","6 January 2007"," misses the point completely!
","This production misses the point of the novel completely- Jane Austen is all about dialogue- wit and formality- both of which are completely lacking in this film. The stunning scenery took up screen time which would have been much better spent on more dialogue- (which is not a distortion of Austen!) The film was just ticking the boxes for cinematography instead of being about the characters.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley worked well with her limited script and I think a lot of the characters looked much more the age they were meant to than in the 1995 one- but overall it does the novel no justice. <br/><br/>The complete lack of etiquette, politeness and formality was cringing. Its ridiculous as well to have important scene like the Darcy's proposal set in such informal settings which would never have taken place- it the language from the book had been used there would be no need for romantic settings."
"cloud_cherry","6","8","16","24 October 2005"," Speed Austen in 2D
","I went into this movie expecting much less than the BBC miniseries, and wasn't disappointed. However, half of this is the fault of the time constrictions to the film, it doesn't have the luxury of 5 or 6 hours as the miniseries did. As a result, this version is 'Speed Austen' - the book at warp speed 10. <br/><br/>We hardly meet Wickham at all, who is a huge part of the story, nor Lady Catherine, nor half of the family-there's barely enough time to develop Lizzy and Darcy. We see more of Kiera Knightly twirling round on a swing than any real Darcy-Lizzy relationship, and more random dancing than the best dialogue in the book, the repertoire between Lady C and Lizzy near the end. <br/><br/>The 'Pemberly' scene is one of the best in the miniseries, with all the piano playing and loving glances as Lizzy starts to see Darcy for what he really is, and starts to fall in love with him. There is no time for this in the movie. See the house, sneaky peak at Darcy through the door and all of a sudden she's head over heals for the man. He hasn't changed very much at all, which is the reason Lizzy falls for Darcy in the book - he gets over his pride and changes into a new man, caring, sociable and friendly (in front of Lizzy and the Gardiners anyway) all for her. Where's this in the movie? Who knows, maybe one of the pigs tromping through the house got into the cutting room and ate it. Jane gets proposed to, Lady C blusters through in the middle of the night and Darcy swoons Lizzy of her feet through nose-canoodeling in a space of 24 hours. How long did it take to travel from Lady C's estate to Longbourne, back to her estate, tell Darcy all about it and then race back to Longbourne on horseback? Certainly longer than 12 hours or so! E voilà, Speed Austen. This film jumps through the book quicker than kiddies playing hopscotch.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen is no Colin Firth. He isn't a bad Darcy - quite dark, quite sulky...just not quite right. His 'drenched wet' scene is a good equivalent to Firth's dripping shirt, but not quite. He's not too bad, and a bit of a hottie, but doesn't measure up to Firth, who fully encompasses Austen's Darcy.<br/><br/>Everyone has been picking to bits MacFadyen, but Kiera is not all cheese on crackers herself. Jennifer Ehle perfectly represented Lizzy-healthy, intelligent, spirited, witty, and with beautiful sparkly eyes. Kiera is 2D - when she turns sideways she disappears she's so skinny, which seems ridiculous when she is walking past fully bosomed and ample thighed Sistine chapel style paintings. She seems a little silly, giggles a lot, has no more of a special relationship with her father than the other sisters and does not strike oneself as especially intelligent or witty, nor does she have 'fine eyes.' <br/><br/>But, Austen is Austen and no matter what its faults, this new version is quite entertaining due to the genius of Austen's story itself. It's hard not to like it, although it is no way near the A+ grade of the miniseries or the book. It's quite an entertaining watch, but it is difficult not to sit there criticizing and comparing it. My advice is, watch it to be entertained but not for any deep character development or superb acting. If you want the real deal, grab the miniseries, or better yet, read the book."

","If you want to see the distilled version of Pride and Prejudice then get along to this one. I understand that containing the book to a 2 hour film might require some cutting of minor characters but they might as well have also left Mr Wickham out of the whole film for all the screen time he is given! He is such a central character and yet he is barely on screen before he has decamped to Brighton. Any newcomers to Austen might not realise that there was any great flirtation between Eliza and Wickham to warrant such a defense of his character to Darcy during the proposal scene. It all seemed too rushed and the language to butchered that you wonder why they bothered to compete against the Jennifer Ehle/ Colin Firth mini series adaptation."

On Costume, Character and the general X factor! I understand it was filmed with a tad more realism with regards to costume and a dangerous lack of make up but for those whom have seen the BBC version, I hope they agree that the most important factor in the film that was missing.....was the character development. Even in the first scene it was clear Darcy liked Lizzy where as the BBC clearly portrayed the friction and chemistry between them immediately. Of course TV has more time to provide the viewer with intimate touches and intense glances and the 'Mr Darcy' from Jenny Ehle could never be recreated.......on the whole the BBC had it right all the long...Lyme hall will always be my Pemberly and Colin Firth forever more my Mr Darcy!"

","The best thing about Jane Austen's heroines is that they are flawed people who are forced to confront their failings. In 'Pride and Prejudice', Elisabeth Bennet's flaws are multiple. She has most of the brains in the family and knows it; she is opinionated and something of an intellectual snob. She can also be rather priggish and holier-than-thou. All this adds up to the 'prejudice' that blinds her to Mr Darcey's virtues. None of the Austen's Miss Bennet is found in this visually attractive but rather empty adaptation. This Elisabeth Bennet is nice throughout the story, exhibiting not a trace of imperfection at any point. Even her bookishness is almost entirely cut out, lest we find it intimidating. As for her disapproval of Mr Darcey - all too paper thin - is based entirely on hard evidence. Anyone in her shoes would feel the same way, given what she sees and hears. In the end, it turns out her information was incomplete, and so she is able to accept his advances. That's it. As simple misunderstanding is cleared up. <br/><br/>Austen's novel is more than a romantic comedy in regency dress. But you would never think so from a timid adaptation that tries too hard to be liked, and ends up pitifully short of grit and substance."

","I understand that not every single film is intended to be a breakthrough in the history of the cinema. and that some films just want to entertain; I also appreciate that ""Pride and Prejudice"" is probably one of the latter. Nevertheless, if I have to judge a film, I'll judge it as a film, exactly, and not as a fun fair.<br/><br/>And, as a film, I reckon it shouldn't have been done. The story had to remain on the paper, written, because (besides nice postcard-wise sceneries and catwalk-wise women) nothing wanted to be shown, to take off from the paper and land on the big screen.<br/><br/>The film is not just intended to entertain (only): it also seems intended for people a little stupid, who need the things be emphasised in order to be understood. All the characters are caricatures: Mr Darcy was a ""do not dare to speak, do not laugh, look serious and dumb""; Elizabeth Bennet was witty and clever and not a single line was down to the earth; the nice mother didn't just wish her daughters be married, but DESPERATELY needed them so; and so on.<br/><br/>And, yes, the film does achieve its (only) goal: making people weep... but only at the very end.<br/><br/>This film reminded me of ""Little women"" (which wan not spoilt by all this artificial comicality) and Keira Knightley reminded me of Winona Ryder and, no, I don't think they are at the same level, nor that Keira has Winona's talent.<br/><br/>For me, 5 out of 10. The only nice thing at the screening was the company I was with. ;-) Luckily I can't say I'd been disappointed, because I already had a (bad) prejudice of the film before the screening and, of course, I'm too proud to admit I was wrong. ;-)<br/><br/>Marco"

For me the most important scenes of the story have been changed and underplayed and therefore ruined: Darcy's slighting Elisabeth at the ball and her falling for him at Pemberley. Saying that, it was beautifully shot, with amazing music that makes your heart flutter and with more flesh and energy compared to the BBC's version.

","Jane Austen's timeless novel of misunderstandings, pride, and narrow-mindedness is taken by Joe Wright and his capable team of Working Title to bring us the love story of Lizzy Bennet and Mr. Darcy, two people who couldn't be more right for each other.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Georgian times, when the rule of entail means that, with five daughters, the Bennet family inheritance is likely to be passed on to the closet living male, the dim-witted, sycophantic Mr Collins. Things start looking good when the sweet-tempered Mr Bingley joins Longbourne, and instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest daughter. The introduction between Lizzy (the second daughter), and his friend, Mr Darcy couldn't be more different though, as Mr. Darcy rudely snubs Lizzy, and she makes a vowel never to dance with him. But through various circumstances including Mr Collins, the ambiguous Mr Wickham and Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley, the two characters are brought closer and closer together.<br/><br/>As many Working Title titles, from Bridget Jones' Diary, to Notting Hill, all contain traces of Austen, it seems only fair that their interpretation of her greatest novel should rank amongst their best films. And I would like to think of the film as an ""interpretation"" rather than an ""adaptation,"" because, on the whole, there are many things in the film that I expected differently, having read the novel. Mr Collins, for example, played with restrained humility here by Tom Hollander, could have been more of a toady. The change of setting of Darcy's first proposal in the rain, was also a pleasant surprise, as, on the big screen, the rain just adds that extra oomph to the anger felt by Lizzy. So, on the whole, though the film has not been as true as it could to the novel, I'm willing to overlook most of this, as by adding these touches, the story has been made accessible for the 20th century.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress as the literary hero Elizabeth Bennet, in a relatively unbaity role, as, compared to recent Best Actress nominees, she does very little crying, sighing, or worrying. Although I wouldn't hurry to say it was deserved, one thing is for certain: it is her performance here is her best work by far. As Lizzy, she is playful, tomboyish and witty, and, if she did giggle too much, this is redeemed by the poignancy to which she plays the caring sister, loyal friend, and clever daughter. Matthew ""Spooks"" MacFayden is less capable as Mr. Darcy, underplaying the aloofness and giving somewhat of a wooden performance. As the sardonic Mr. Bennet, Donald Sutherland gives a moving performance, shining especially in the final scene, and Brenda Blethlyn uses her fussy mother neuroses to hilarious degree as the effortlessly annoying Mrs Bennet. Rosamund Pike, Tom Hollander and Judi Dench offer fine support, though Jena Malone is both too grating and too American as Lydia.<br/><br/>There is a gorgeous yet understated way in which costume designers, art decorators and the director of photography have brought the look of the Georgian middle class to us. The Bennet household, for one, delicately juxtaposes paintings and floor rugs with Mrs. Bennet's signature untidiness, and the opening sequence, in which Lizzy is followed around the garden, and the colours in the sky are captured on screen, is a feast for the eyes. Special kudos to Jacqueline Duran for her excellent costume design, which is appropriately earthy and simple, yet helps each of the actors shine in their personas. And to close this winning bundle, expert pianist Dario Marianelli calls on his Purcell and Beethoven influences to score the film, fuelling much of the romance, tension and atmosphere.<br/><br/>As a great fan of the novel I feared that I may be too strict on the film, but it truly is a very enjoyable experience. Whilst it might not be quite as exquisite as Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, it sits up there as one of the better Jane Austen adaptations to come along in a long time. Go in without wanting to scrutinise every detail, and you will find a joyful love story, funny, sweet and relevant in equal measure."

","Call me a purist, if you like.<br/><br/>I hated this film.<br/><br/>I tried to like this movie, and the actors tried their hardest...but the costumes, camera-work, and script outweighed any delivery the actors could displayed.<br/><br/>The Costumes: Anyone seen Little Women? The one with Winona Ryder? I would argue that her character of Jo and Kiera Knightley's character of Eizabeth Bennet were the same person. Same costume, same attitude, same expressions. Two different time periods, countries, and authors simply couldn't stop this movie from cloning the character. Also, to look at the world through the eyes of this movie, you would have to believe that no one dragged a comb through their hair until well into the next century. Yes, liberties are taken with a period piece, fine...understood...but this cast could have looked so much better.<br/><br/>The camera-work: Don't get me wrong, the landscapes and scenery were gorgeous. Now if only that cameraman could keep the camera steady. Classic example - when Catherine de Burgh and Elizabeth exchange a heated debate, the camera constantly shakes...and not in some ""artistic choice"" manner.<br/><br/>The pacing: Yes, I liked the book. Yes, I knew the movie would be condensed. No, I don't think that anyone in England and certainly not 20 or more people at once, would speak in such a rushed manner. It was as if none of the words mattered. After a while, listening to thenspeakinthisfastmannerinwhichwordshavenomeaning is annoying. It is as if the verbal space bar was not hit at all for 2 hours. The adaptation was charming in its settings, and overall the story progressed nicely, but most of the feelings and core of the characters seemed lost. Suddenly characters have no reason, no background, to love one another. The wit is lost is the pacing, and the love is lost in the lack of actions.<br/><br/>For me, watching this film was probably equal to a Batman comic book enthusiast watching Batman and Robin. I applaud the effort to make a movie based on Pride and Prejudice. I respect that the movie will reflect elements of the book, and not encompass the story in a pristine package...however, that does not mean I have to like this product...and, in fact, I detest it."

","I wanted to like this film, but in the end found it disappointing on several crucial levels. I don't expect word for word dialogue from Jane Austens' book, but I did expect the clever satire to remain in tact. The anachronisms within this adaption both of conversation and environment lead me to believe maybe both Deborah Maggoch and Joe Wright didn't truly understand the material or chose to ignore it. ( screenplay & director, respectively) If what's gone before can't be improved, then at least show us something new. There is neither here. The performances were good, given the canvas they had. But I was frustrated that this film had some moments and hinted at some potential to be very good. I have a much deeper appreciation for the work Emma Thompson did in adapting Sense & Sensibility. You had your romance, but the humor and sport making of society was not lost in it. Pride & prejudice is not just a romance. Both Darcy and Lizzy have certain prejudices ( so to speak) that must be demonstrated and overcome, by their actions and conversation. interpreted badly, and they become just a pair of spoiled brats. here is my argument about Direction and screenplay. Darcy and Lizzy must engage each other in a sort of verbal sparring match that exposes each of their flaws in a polite but pointed manner. Darcy must be shown in such a way that we believe his words & actions might possibly be misunderstood by Lizzy. He's elite because he believes the elite deserve their station. where Lizzy must demonstrate that she has qualities of deportment that would make Darcy consider her despite her not being among the elite class. here in this film, Darcy just comes across as snobbish and Dull Lizzy as impertinent with a sense of over entitlement. It's not believable, and all the subtle humor and caricature of class system is washed away for an attempt at grandeur and realism, and we are left to be told this is how it works out. instead of shown how it works out and why. It's not the cast at fault here, it's the adaption."

","I wasted 3 hours of my life watching this movie. I don't know where to start, seriously it was so, so bad. If Jane Austen was alive, she would have had a cardiac arrest. Firstly what on earth were they thinking casting Kiera Knightly as Lizzy? She is the worst actor IN THE WORLD and just didn't know Lizzy's character. That's my first complaint. Next it's the story itself. Pride and Prejudice is, personally, one of Jane Austen's best novels. The characters are deep and have real personalities that you can only see if you know the story inside out. This is where all the actors fell flat. They didn't know the characters well enough and they didn't act them well. The movie did the book no justice at all. Not only is the acting atrocious but they miss out vital parts of the story and they change bits of the story that shouldn't be changed. So don't waste your lives people! If you want an honest to goodness adaption of P&P, watch the BBC version. All the actors know their characters and the acting is good."

"Buddy-51","7","5","9","26 June 2006"," gets the plot details right but misses out on some of the humor
","It seems like every time we turn around these days some filmmaker has been hard at work producing yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's most beloved novel ""Pride and Prejudice."" And even though some of the versions have been quite good actually, we can still wonder if this glut is really all that necessary. The book's two most recent incarnations came in the form of miniseries produced by the BBC, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995. However, since 1940, there has not been a ""straight"" (i.e. set in the proper time period) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" designed specifically for the big screen. Well, now we have one, written by Deborah Moggach, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.<br/><br/>This latest version is distinguished from the earlier efforts primarily by its grittier, grimier and grungier depiction of life in early 19th Century rural England. With its peeling paint and dusty furnishings, the film certainly has a less prettified and more lived-in look than we are accustomed to seeing in movies based on Austen works. Yet, perhaps because we have been spoiled by the marathon lengths of those earlier miniseries, this film, at a mere two hours and seven minutes, feels hurried and rushed as it attempts to cope with Austen's complex tale of the five Bennett sisters and their mother's frantic efforts to marry them off. We are moved so quickly through the story that some of the more subtle details of character and theme get lost along the way. Still, it's quite remarkable just how much of the plot Moggach is able to cram into a little over two hours, so that even the staunchest of Austen purists will have little to complain about on that score.<br/><br/>What they may have reason to complain about is the fact that the film fails to capture much of the unique humor that distinguishes the novel. For the most part, the scenes are played much too seriously and ""straight,"" particularly those involving the odious Mr. Collins and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society. Tom Hollander gives a spiritless, leaden performance as the sycophantic minister, and Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine as if she were taking a stab at Lady MacBeth instead. The same goes for Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, whose pivotal role as the droll, dry commentator on the absurd Mrs. Bennett's matrimonial obsessions seems to have been lost on the actor. Matthew Macfadyen fails to make an impact as the haute Mr. Darcy, although Brenda Blethyn hits the right notes as the grating mother driven to despair at the prospect of her daughters ending up old maids.<br/><br/>In the coveted role of the high-minded, strong willed and extremely judgmental Elizabeth Bennett - certainly the most brilliant and fully realized of all Austen's creations - Knightley clearly means well but doesn't seem quite up to the task. Her annoying giggle and epicene expression make her far too silly and modern to successfully portray the rational but often misguided 19th Century heroine Austen intended Elizabeth to be.<br/><br/>Yet, despite all these weaknesses, ""Pride and Prejudice"" makes for a reasonably entertaining film, thanks, primarily, to the strength of the original source material and the liveliness of Wright's direction (the ball scenes are exceptionally well done). The film moves quickly and does a decent job telling its story. Perhaps if we didn't have better versions to compare it to, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" would stand up better on its own. It's far from a failure, but watching this condensed version instead of the two BBC miniseries is a bit like reading the Cliff's Notes instead of the actual novel. You may be able to get the general gist of the thing, but not that wonderful flavoring that makes the original so special."
"moutonbear25","9","5","9","7 December 2005"," So many ladies cackling
","Pride & Prejudice Written by Deborah Moggach Directed by Joe Wright<br/><br/>Writer's Note: This review is best read aloud in a fake British accent or a real one if you happen to actually be British.<br/><br/>I am quite the fool for a good period drama where a roomful of young women flutter about making high-pitched inaudible noises at the announcement of a new male prospect coming to town. Mothers trying desperately to marry off their daughters into good homes or even better, rich homes that will in turn provide the rest of the family with security and stature. Women who only speak in turn and do what they're told. I jest. Besides, you don't find these women in these movies any more. Modern period pieces are more concerned with disproving how proper people were. Less women sitting daintily and more women picking their noses. Joe Wright's ""Pride & Prejudice"" was exactly what I wanted. It is both beautiful and engaging, a challenging while light-hearted romance  Everything I needed to help erase the memory of the Bollywood Musical remake ""Bride & Prejudice"" I painfully sat through earlier this year. This being yet another interpretation of a famous Jane Austen novel, I certainly needn't rehash the story for you; I'm sure you know what to expect.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly plays Miss Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest daughter of five Bennet's. She does not have any particular talents or ambitions that would differentiate her from her siblings. She is simply not interested in losing her head over whether or not she gets married. Miss Elizabeth would rather be alone than be with someone for convenience sake. That maturity, that knowledge that there are more important things in life gives her a peaceful glow that is only shaken when her independence is threatened by a marriage proposal that will undoubtedly end in a loveless existence. Of course, there is still some fear in her that she will never find another to love but she braves on. After all, she does have her pride.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen plays Mr. Darcy, good friend to Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) who is interested in marrying Miss Elizabeth's older sister, Miss Jane Bennet (Rosamund Pike). He broods and skulks but we are still intrigued as he has such beautiful eyes. These are eyes that suggest something more sensitive beneath this brutish façade. Mr. Darcy is well intentioned but has yet to master the art of human interaction as is quite clearly shown as he flexes his hand and fingers awkwardly after touching Miss Elizabeth's hand. For her, it is a simple touch; for him however, a vulnerable revelation that he has likely never been loved nor allowed himself to love. Remaining safe in his tower above the commoners has shaped for him many a prejudice.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice meet on the dance floor when Mr. Darcy unexpectedly asks Miss Elizabeth to dance. When the dance first begins, the conversation between the two is cold, guarded and expressed in the third person. It is aggressive, confrontational. They are both angry that the other's existence remains with them when they are apart. As it continues though, they cannot deny their chemistry as the dance flows naturally until the end nears and there is no one left in the ballroom but these two. Fight all you like but you cannot will love away and that is a lesson that you must let go of both your prejudices and your pride before you can learn it."

Girl goes off and contemplates that she may have allowed prejudice to sway her before the facts. Boy goes off and contemplates if he has been too full of pride or just plain full of himself. Boy and girl meet again. Girl's sisters become an obstacle to their relationship developing further. And eventually all is resolved. There are finer details, and if you really want to know, read the book.<br/><br/>Performances by Matthew MacFayden, Kiera Knightley, Brenda Blethyn, Judi Dench, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander,and Rosamund Pike were especially good. I also liked Jenna Malone and Rupert Friend who set a standard for their roles.<br/><br/>I was pleased with some of the changes made in terms of portraying the characters. I feel this movie was more sympathetic towards some of Austen's characters who are often easily written off as caricatures. I like seeing Elizabeth portrayed as somewhat adolescent in her temper. I like the added scene between Mary and her father at the ball. I like Mrs. Bennet telling Lizzy that ""When you have five daughters, we'll see what you think of."" I appreciated the realism of this cast. I also liked how this film showed Mr and Mrs Bennet as having some relationship between them. I forgive them consolidating scenes. I even forgave them the alteration of the critical final disclosure scene between Elizabeth and Darcy. I forgive them cutting some of the smaller characters,I think that's to be expected. I think the story boils down to growth. It's about two people who challenge each other's view point and consequently become catalysts for change within each other.<br/><br/>I also want to add, that the scene between them on the Rosing's estate in the rain, was very erotic and a superbly fresh interpretation of the script.<br/><br/>And so in the end, that is why I vehemently object to the exchange between Charolette and Elizabeth after the former announces her engagement. It's believable that Lizzy opens her mind through examining the choices of her friend. It's less believable that Lizzy changes perspective because her friend tells her to. Also,in another scene, I vehemently object to the notion that The Gardiners would leave Elizabeth and drive back to town in their carriage without her. Not even remotely possible. So ultimately while I love what was preserved, and I love some of the enhancements, I walked away with a sour aftertaste in my mouth. But I still plan to buy it on video."

Anyone who saw this, should see the ""Pride and Prejudice""(1995) (min), which was an A&E production with a far superior cast, a truly faithful adaptation of the book, and produced as a mini-series which is the only way a production of a work such as this can be truly told.

","Thank goodness no fiber of Jane Austen's being is extant on the planet to bear witness to this, the least successful adaptation of her most famous novel.<br/><br/>An Austen enthusiast, I had misgivings when I entered the theater to see this film. Alas! they were sorely justified.<br/><br/>The problem, I suspect, is that director Joe Wright took pains to avoid the 1995 mini-series adaptation of this famous book...totally missing its single best screen translation. And the memory of that version is the single biggest hurdle to the film-goer here some ten years later. So what's the problem, you ask? In a word: Keira. Miss Knightley is almost too beautiful to be believed and, at times, the soft cinematography framing her seems best suited--with her in it--to a soap commercial. Previous Elizabeths weren't necessarily bereft of beauty or assets, but the earlier filmmakers were smart enough to cast actresses who would slowly grow on and win over an audience--to work the sort of magic on us that Elizabeth works on the aggrieved and lovelorn Darcy. Keira (bless her!) is a fine actress, but she seems to contain none of the tempestuousness found in a Greer Garson or Jennifer Ehle. She is out of her depth here. She merely sighs and looks off placidly, her big eyes almost eerily space-alien-like.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen (""Hey, it's the dude from SHAUN OF THE DEAD!!"") plays a stern, yet impenetrable, Darcy, and he--like Keira--gives us no qualities to dig for and slowly warm to. He must secretly rue the day Colin Firth ever laid his eyes on the 1995 script.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, however, is unimpeachable. Brenda Blethyn gives us a meddling and endearing Mrs. Bennet (though several decibels below Alison Steadman's screeching and haranguing--and comically masterful--Mama). Tom Hollander's Parson Collins is a dull and odious popinjay; Claudie Blakley's Charlotte is sweet; Dame Judi Dench's Lady Catherine gives the marvelous Barbara Leigh-Hunt's portrayal a run for its money. And Donald Sutherland gives us a wise and warm-hearted Mr. Bennet...which is liable to put a lump in the audience member's throat in the final minutes of the film. If there's justice, he'll be nominated for his work here.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, and Wright attempts some artful and interesting moments (including Eliza in her swing), yet the film ultimately falls flat. The last third, instead of being painstakingly rendered, as in the BBC mini-series, feels compressed, and there are elisions and collisions of scenes and text--by screenwriter Deborah Moggach--which have an artificiality to them. (See Elizabeth's revelation of Lydia's misfortune.)<br/><br/>Hindered by some miscalculations of casting, this version's necessity to telescope such a beautifully-intricate work of art cripples it, and, unable to support the weight of its maneuvers, the film topples into implausible dullness. The tacked-on ending also feels wrong. Austen got it right the first time: never show us the characters beyond that magic point of completion. It merely becomes pointless voyeurism."

","I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 11 years old and absolutely fell in love with its subtle humor and biting wit; not to mention the language and the carefully drawn characters. However, what I saw at the theaters presented no such picture. The dialogue was sloppy and unrefined, the characters poorly read (and cast), and the humor rather awkward. Having previously viewed the faithful 1995 Miniseries version of Pride and Prejudice, I was often distracted by the jarring gaps in the plot and its staggering underdevelopment. I've always enjoyed Keira Knightley's performances, but her acting felt rushed and, well, performed.<br/><br/>But the biggest annoyance of the film was the directing and cinematography of the shots. The director made overuse of long moving/panning shot which seemed completely out of place and made use of angles and framing that were unnecessarily peculiar in style.<br/><br/>It has not been one hour since I watched the movie in the theater, and I still can't help but shutter at the memory of it. Darcy was a joke, and by the end, the film dripped of repugnant cheese. I would have walked out of the movie had my shoe laces not entangled me to the seat.<br/><br/>Watch the 1995 Minseries people. Granted, it lacks pretty faces of the likes of Keira Knightley, Jena Malone, Matthew MacFayden, and Donald Sutherland and the overblown directorial style, but what it lacks in star power it makes up in acting ability and capable story telling. Although it's not completely lacking in the star attraction department; Colin Firth makes an incredible Mr. Darcy"

There was no real connection with them at all. If i hadn't of seen the original or the BBC series i would have wondered why Darcy loves Elizabeth so much. The movie didn't really go in-depth, into there relationship. Like in the BBC series, and Lizzie is helping Georgina with the piano. Darcy looked at her and u could tell that he loved her. Thank god for the BBC series.

","This movie is not bad, it's just it isn't Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, just as Bridget Jones isn't. It had the same plot line, but all the characters are different, and the aim of the movie is different from that of the book.<br/><br/>Jane Austen comments on social etiquette, and pokes fun at those who are too full of self importance. This movie is entirely about falling in love, and with modern attitudes and morals. Lizzie Bennet in this movie is not the smart, socially adept Elizabeth Bennet of the book, and nor is her sister Jane. <br/><br/>If you are willing to forget the book than this film is good fun. It is let down by some fairly wooden acting (espeically from Matthew McFadden sadly) in places, and by some rather strange choices in fashion (what was Caroline Bennet wearing?) and decor in some of the houses. It was also fairly obvious that Matthew McFadden hadn't read the book as his interpretation of Darcy was very odd, not so much arrogant as lost little boy. And the closing scene rated on a par with the ""is it raining? I hadn't noticed"" cheese of Four Weddings and Funeral.

","As a devotee of both the book and the BBC adaptation of P&P, I approached this film with a certain amount of trepidation but also kept an open mind, given the good reviews of it. Alas, I found it to be a real disappointment - while the story obviously needed to be condensed in order to fit it into two hours, I felt that it was so rushed that there was very little plot development, and we were allowed virtually no time to identify and sympathise with any of the characters. What really ruined the film for me however were firstly the lack of any subtlety in the story whatsoever; secondly, the modernisation of parts of the dialogue; thirdly, the whole film had something of a ""Mills & Boon"" feel to it, not Austen at all. I imagine that these aspects were intended to make the film appeal to a broader audience, and it has undoubtedly done the trick. The casting certainly could have been better as well, most were adequate at best but what on earth were they thinking in the cases of Darcy, Bingley and Wickham?! Appalling on all three counts! Fair dues however must be given to Tom Hollander who was brilliant as Mr Collins, and Keira Knightley who in spite of being too thin and conventionally beautiful for the role of Lizzy, did actually do a very good job and made the character her own. Not nearly enough to redeem the film in my eyes though."

","This version is simply marvelous. You can't compare it to a miniseries (that's unfair), nor necessarily to the book. The acting is superb (including the two leads), the photography is wonderful, the screenplay is brilliant, and the tracking shots are amazing. I laughed and was very moved. Although the dialogue was hard to understand at first, this is the best English language movie I've seen so far this year, and I see many movies, including most of the major American independent movies. Joe Nichols, the director, deserves lots of kudos for his work here. If there is any justice, this version will pick up some significant Oscar nominations."
"cwilliams-22","7","8","17","16 September 2005"," Definitely worth watching
","Its definitely better than I expected though not as good as the BBC version. What it does score points on over the BBC is the money that's been spent on it e.g. when the militia arrives in Merryton its a big procession of soldiers with band etc rather than just a handful of soldiers dotted about.<br/><br/>The acting was really good, Judi Dench as Lady Catherine was unsurprisingly very good, Brenda Blethyn was good as Mrs Bennett and played her slightly more sympathetic, she comes across more loving towards her family but just a silly and OTT! I wasn't sure if I liked Donald Sutherland at first but at the end when he gives his consent to Lizzie's marriage you really did feel sorry for him for loosing his favourite daughter. On a negative side i thought they made the guy who played Mr Bingley play him as a bit of a buffoon for comedy value which did get some laughs but they made him seem like a idiot! Some of the words and scenes were changed in order to condense it into 2 hours but on the whole I didn't think this spoilt the plot and in some places it added more dramatic strength. However one negative part of this was they really cut back the part of Mr Wickam to the bare minimum, you only get 1 scene with Lizzie and Wickam and the next time you see him is after he has married Lydia. If you didn't know the plot you would be wondering why Lizzie was so enamoured with him.<br/><br/>As for Mr Darcy, Matthew MacFadyen was very sexy and successful in the role. However i thought his proposals were not as good as Colin Firth's.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly as a whole is really good as Lizzie, in fact her skinniness works for her as it makes her seem quite gangley and stick like compared to her sisters and so she doesn't come across as 100% perfect.<br/><br/>There are 2 odd scenes, one were where Lizzie and Mr Darcy are dancing at the Ball and all of a sudden they are in a dream like scene where they are the only 2 in the ballroom dancing. CHEESY! Also when Lizzie is walking around Pemberley she seems to linger quite a bit looking at marble naked torso's of statues! Anyway i definitely wouldn't mind seeing it again as i spent all of last time comparing it to the BBC version, so I would like to see it just for itself next time!"
"mrdarcyforever","3","6","12","24 June 2006"," Waste of talent
","I was very disappointed in this flat, bloodless adaptation, in spite of the beautiful location and talented actors. Kira Knightlys Lizzie is too immature. She plays a teenager not a woman, and it is odd to hear here speak in that polite, polished and roundabout way sophisticated young gentle women used in the 18.th century. One would expect her to blow up her bubblegum or put up her middle finger. It is not believable that she is able to feel that great love this story is very much about. Mr. Darcy is too nice from the start on, only a bit sad. It is not a big challenge to impress such a nice, shy man, that's why there is not much going on between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy, the dynamics they have in the book are totally missing. Mr. Darcy is so sexy for generations of woman because he is so cold and haughty, jet one feels there is hot passion underneath it, and he is about to loose his self-control... (And what a pity the novel stops before he really does...) now, this nice, sweet little Mr. Darcy in this move is something entirely different. There is also quite a bit of new dialog written, which can by no means compare with Jane Austen's writing! It stands out like a sore thumb. I understand from the DVD extras that it is made a point to not play Mrs. Bennett as a comical figure. I don't see why? Jane Austen fully intended here to be comical! As to Mr. Bingly, he is played like he was half-witted, and one wonders what on earth a beautiful and intelligent women like Rosamund Pikes Jane want from such an unkempt, silly boy. It is true, all this characters are in there twenties in the book but that was a very much adult age in that time, (this young men had the care of families, estates and fortunes) and people then didn't had the pressure and desire forced upon them as we (and this move cast) have this days, to appear as teenager- like as possible."
"DestinyDeferred","3","6","12","10 May 2006"," Skip It
","My only positive comment about this adaptation is that I discovered the 1995 Miniseries because of it. I viewed this version before the 1995 classic and I didn't like it then, and my opinion has not improved on a second viewing. I was not impressed with Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFayden was woefully inadequate next to Colin Firth(not that I have any reasonable expectations of ANYONE filling those shoes)...and in general the cast was less than spectacular. It didn't capture the wit of Austen's classic...it also seemed to take a number of liberties with the mores and manners of the time...and while I'm not in general a stickler about details in a period piece, some of the best aspects of the story were sacrificed for a pretty scene. The passion between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy was more beautiful and powerful with a mere look, hidden under manners of the time than cheapened by overt actions the in big scene in the rain. <br/><br/>My suggestion is to skip this movie and watch the magnificent 1995 BBC miniseries and/or read the book."
"jwelkin","7","6","12","10 May 2006"," Period? Period!
","In general, this is an enjoyable movie and true to the book (which far outshines any movie made of it - which is why it's still read and enjoyed, and will be for the foreseeable future). Keira Knightley is smart and a delight to watch. But some things kept slapping me in the face, detracting from my experience greatly.<br/><br/>If a director goes about placing a movie in a specified period - as with Austen's works - he or she should take care to be true to the period in all matters, and this is the difficulty I have with the new P&P.<br/><br/>Ladies do not run! It's fine to show Lydia and the little sisters running indoors to show their ""wildness"", but Lizzie herself does not run - I believe it was at one of the balls. This was not done! <br/><br/>Ladies appear in public with their hair properly dressed! Lizzie would no more appear at Netherfield with her hair hanging loose than she would appear in her nightclothes!<br/><br/>Speaking of nightclothes, ladies do not leave their bedrooms in their nightclothes (except for middle-of-the-night emergencies, as when Marianne is ill in S&S); they do not come down to breakfast in nightgowns, as Lizzie did once (don't remember exact scene). (If this dress was not supposed to be a nightgown, well, then my gripe is with the costume designer.) <br/><br/>Ladies certainly do not sit tailor-fashion, as Lizzie is shown doing in the ""Mrs. Darcy"" scene at the end. In this era, ladies rode sidesaddle if they rode at all - legs were kept rigorously together! <br/><br/>The director completely missed the restrictions women had on the use of their bodies, certainly up through the Victorian era. Mrs. Bennett neglected many important parts of her daughters' education, but she would have trained her girls to comport themselves properly and behave appropriately. This was a mark of class, and the Bennett girls are a gentleman's daughters (as Lizzie reminds Lady Catherine). Even Ang Lee got this right in Sense and Sensibility (but he also had the superb Emma Thompson to assist him in this).<br/><br/>No, I'm not a member of any Jane Austen society (tho I've considered it), just an ex-English teacher. I like to see the details right, and Joe Wright messed this one up."

","I was greatly disappointed in this version in that several elements were missing. I have seen several versions of this movie from 1)Greer Garson & Sir Lawrence Olivier,2) Colin Firth and Jennifer Erle and 3) Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul. The second and third are by far my favorites because it stayed very close to the book which I've read twice. The version with Garson and Olivier were not as close to the book but very enjoyable. I greatly respect all of Jane Austens's literature but the newest version was quite disappointing in that they made all the Bennett girls serious. Elizabeth's character is suppose to be serious, while Jane is naive but good. Keira Knightley is character was to silly as well as the mother and sisters. Although Donald Sutherland is a very good actor this truly was not the part for him. I have seen Brenda Blethyn in much better roles. I love Dame Judi Dench but not in this role."

","I bought myself the 2005 Pride and Prejudice staring Keira Knightley and, well, was disappointed. The Cinematography is astounding the musical score was great, The location shots are breath taking, the actors were beautiful to look at, yes they were, but the costumes were not well done. I realize the Bennett family lived in the country but Pa-lease! This was way wrong. And while some things were well portrayed, as far as, Regency society some things were so horribly wrong that it ruined the movie for several minutes while I ranted about how wrong it that was.<br/><br/>This movie got nominations and praise out the wazoo and I was let down because I love Jane and the BBC miniseries production of Pride and Prejudice really spoiled me. I realized that the new movie would be edited, it isn't an over 5+ hour miniseries, yet the story adaptation itself was pretty good, however, the dialog in portions needed serious help. I'm sorry, but do not modernize Jane. All the smart wit is gone when you toy with the language for portions of, often, important speeches. My favorite Bennett family member, Mr. Bennett, was very poorly represented in this adaption. He has some of the best moments in the book and unfortunately for times sake, I am sure, most of his intelligence and fatherly love is lost in this adaption. I did, however, come to like Jane Bennett more in this Adaptation that the BBC miniseries. All the other sisters are little more than background noise in this version."
"maerrie1","6","6","12","26 October 2005"," A good but not excellent film
","I enjoyed this film, however I still thought it was flawed. While Mathew MacFayden was an acceptable Darcy, I thought his puppy-dog look compromised the pride and aloofness that Darcy should have had, in the beginning of the film at least. MacFayden's Darcy was too amiable really. Keira Knightley was good but not excellent. I never got the feeling that Lizzie had the intellect and depth to attract someone like Darcy, which is a shame because the whole film centres on the unlikely attraction between the two - unlikely because Darcy thought that with an inferior education and upbringing, someone in Lizzie's position could never equal him.<br/><br/>The scenery was just gorgeous, the costumes were lovely if a little mixed (ie the older ladies were wearing late 18th century fashions & the younger ladies were dressed for the times), the Bennet girls all talked over one another as any real sisters would do, and the general quality of the actors was very fine. I found the film extremely grainy at times, which detracted from the aesthetically pleasing way it was shot. The heightened emotion in scenes such as the first proposal and Lady Catherine's unexpected visit at Longbourn was done well by changing something about the traditional story (ie the proposal happens outside in a rainstorm & Lady Catherine barges into Longbourn in the middle of the night).<br/><br/>I loved Bingley, his bumbling and the way he was always tongue-tied around Jane was so endearing. Unfortunately by bundling Jane off to London immediately after Bingley left the country and keeping her out of the action for the next half hour, one does not sense her heartbreak, or understand just how close she and Bingley came to losing each other forever.<br/><br/>The story was fast-paced, which is excusable considering how much there was to fit into two hours, and some of the scenes (the first dance, the ball and the scene with Lizzie looking at the statues at Pemberley) slowed it down too much and also took up valuable room that could have been usefully employed with more character exposition or story development.<br/><br/>Despite some disappointments, I really enjoyed this film. A good one to add to the DVD collection for a rainy day (once it's released of course)."
"bumblebee1001","7","6","12","6 October 2005"," Great leading lady, disappointing leading man
","As a fan of the novel I have to say that it was with a little trepidation that I went to see this but it is an enjoyable movie. Keira Knightley is superb as Elizabeth, with the right mix of liveliness and impudence without losing the sense of propriety that was so dear to Jane Austen's heart. I also thought that Donald Sutherland was quite impressive and his accent was very convincing on the whole (although it did slip a bit once or twice). I thought he really carried off the role of Mr Bennett very well adding a strong edge to him. Dame Judi Dench is of course a scene-stealer as Lady Catherine de Bourgh (but then she never fails to disappoint) and Brenda Blethyn truly brings Mrs Bennet alive. All the female leads presented robust and enjoyable characters. For me the disappointment lay with the male leads (other than Mr Bennet). Darcy instead of being arrogant and proud comes across as a bit wet and frankly looks lost and miserable for most of the movie. Mr Bingley seems almost silly on a number of occasions. It is difficult to flesh out the characters of a novel like Pride and Prejudice in a movie but the male characters are very shallow and one-dimensional. Wickham is almost invisible. Perhaps just as disappointing is the dialogue. Jane Austen wrote some fabulous dialogue in this novel and it seems a shame that it was so little used. Why not have used some of the great lines already in P&P?"
"JimGraham","9","6","12","30 September 2005"," Superb adaptation
","As someone who's read the book and seen the 1995 BBC adaptation (and enjoyed both), I was very impressed with Joe Wright's take on Austen's famous novel. Director and cast do a fine job of making this 18th century tale seem fresh and modern - the acting is first-rate from both leads, the atmosphere is engaging, the touches of humour just right.<br/><br/>There are some real moments of magic here - the arguing in the rain, and the dance where everyone but Knightley and MacFadyen disappear from view spring to mind. Yes, it's overly sentimental in places, and the time constraints mean that not all the characters are fully fleshed out, but these are minor quibbles. Above all, it reminds you what true love really feels like, and by the end you'll want to swap places with either Darcy or Lizzie (unless perhaps you already do own half of Derbyshire). A finely crafted piece of cinema."
"Gary-161","Null","6","12","26 September 2005"," Benighted remake
","In Austen speak, I can but hope that the circumstances in which I found myself during the film did nothing to bring ill favour upon my good opinion of it. The blue rinse brigade talk more in the cinema than your average teenage hoody. ""Who is that?"", ""his cousin"" , ""look at that dress"", ""oh, a pig"". At least you can threaten kids. Any filmmaker that wants to make The Great Octogenarian Chainsaw Massacre will get my ticket stub. As it turned out, there was plenty to irritate by the film's own account.<br/><br/>My main curiosity in seeing P&P again is whether it could possibly live up to my favourite scenes in the 95 Beeb production. Liz bennet's blistering refusal of Darcy's proposal and Lady Catherine De Bourg's incendiary assault in the apple orchard. As for the former, Darcy's opening words were drowned in thunderclaps. That's it, let's not bother with the dialogue. It's not important in an Austen production. IT'S THE TEMPEST OF THEIR INNER FEELINGS!!! Go, director. GO BABY! As for the latter, let's cut Lady Catherine's classic punchline. Who needs it?<br/><br/>This version is curiously under-populated. It's use of passing light and shadow, mirror reflections and window blurrings suggests love as a waking dream of anticipation and uncertainty (no surprise when Darcy's big scene occurs at daybreak.) Although Austen's P&P has been said to be a comedy of manners, love as a moral force, in its ultimate sense as sacrifice, must also be of equal importance. The Wickham affair is central to it as Darcy is prepared to seriously humiliate himself before this man in order to win his true love. Without this he appears out of focus in the film, and the film without true gravity.<br/><br/>The cast is okay although Hollander and Knightley appear to be using a certain production as a crib sheet. After the failure of Thunderbirds, perhaps hard nosed economics was the motivation behind Working Title's remake. Whether fair or not, that's why you leave the picture not really caring."
"MartinPh","9","6","12","26 September 2005"," Not as authentic as the series, but thoroughly excellent in its own right!
","I went to see this film with a friend who, like me, is a confirmed addict of the BBc 1995 version of P&P. We were utterly prepared to dislike this new version (talk about prejudice...). And we both came out raving. Given the limitations inherent in a 2 hour running time, I find it hard to imagine a more enticing, entrancing way of bringing P&P to the screen. Authenticity is no option in such a time span - if you want close adherence to the book, stick with the series. The movie is not nearly as meticulously researched and takes ample liberties with the sense of propriety and etiquette that governed Austen's genteel circles. In fact, the approach taken in the film is contrasted to the TV-series in almost every aspect, but this has it own rewards. Whereas the series sticks to an authentically early 19th century idiom, and the intimate and provincial feel that is pure Austen, the movie inserts modern day phrases and emotions in Austen's text, and is altogether more worldly, cosmopolitan even. The people are more beautiful by our standards, even though I'm sure the BBC Lizzy and Jane are far closer to the type of woman that would have been considered very beautiful in Austen's days (just look at portraits from that time period). In the series the Bennet's are a seriously dysfunctional family with an aloof father and a hysterical mother, but with a sense of standing intact (as they are in the book); in the film they are a scruffy, chaotic, but lovable and, actually, loving bunch. Brenda Blethyn tones down Mrs. Bennet's madness to a level where she becomes a believable and even sympathetic character. It is not what Austen wanted her to be - her disgust of the character is obvious throughout the book. But it makes for a more involving movie experience. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet is a pleasant surprise, too, even though the make up department might have made some effort to disguise the fact that he has a very good dental plan. Keira Knightley is an excellent Lizzy. Feisty, effervescent, and melancholy in turn, she gets you involved in the character right away. Nor does Matthew MacFadyen need to fear the competition from Colin Firth. He is as dark, brooding and intriguing a Darcy as you could wish for, and his sudden emotional outpouring when he first confesses his love (set amidst the wide rainy vistas of Rosings (in fact, Stourhead) park rather than in the intimacy of Hunsford parsonage) is totally gripping. The movie very much pivots on these two characters, and the achievements of these two actors ensure that the essence of the story is there, completely. Where you loose, inevitably, is in the minor roles. Tom Hollander is, again, a more humanly believable Mr. Collins than we got in the series, but he is also somewhat flat, and does not erase memories of David Bamber's bizarre, yet peculiarly endearing rendition (and, again, Austen meant for Collins to be a comic caricature). Lydia and Wickham are reduced to devices needed to unfold the plot, and even Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is relegated to such a position. Her final confrontation with Lizzy was to me the most disappointing scene from the movie, and is no match for the power Barbara Leigh-Hunt brought to this scene, that ought to feel climactic. (An aristocratic lady of those days, by the way, would never have had such a tan...). All this is more than compensated for by gorgeous imagery. Locations, costumes, crowd scenes, landscapes: they are all stunning. The two balls in the first half of the movie are way more festive, inviting and crowded than the understated formal occasions they are in the series - raucous, too; though again, the series is probably closer to the kind of atmosphere in which people like the Bennet's and the Lucasses would have moved. Burghley as Rosings and Chatsworth and Wilton as Pemberley are way over the top, of course - no matter how grand Mr Darcy and Lady Catherine may look from the Meryton perspective, they most certainly do not belong to the circles of high aristocracy that would in actual fact have lived in houses of that size and splendor. Again, the series is more authentic; but what a feast for the eye these locations offer in the movie! In the end comparing this to the 1995 remake is as pointless as the endless discussions between proponents of period performance in classical music versus those preferring big orchestral versions of Mozart and Beethoven with modern instruments. For Beethoven as Beethoven knew it, you need the former; but the latter can offer no less, and sometimes even more musically and emotionally rewarding experiences. Both are valid in their own way, and we have the luxury of not having to choose, but being able to enjoy both. All in all, and judged on its own merits as a movie, this P&P is wonderful, and very much worthwhile to go and see!"
"rufus_me","6","4","7","2 August 2007"," A worthy adaption
","Having watched the 1995 mini series many times i was unsure of what to expect in the 2005 version of 'Pride and Prejudice.' I feel, that for a film, it did the book justice as there is so little time to fit in everything that takes place. However it felt very hurried and the script was atrocious at some points. I also felt the choice of actors for Mr Darcy, Lydia Bennet, Mr Bennet and Lady Cathrine were very poor and that neither did their character justice.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was due to the time limit of the film meaning they were harder to portray. I think if less well known actors/actresses had been used in the film it would have been slightly more believable and i wouldn't have thought of them as themselves but as the characters they were actually portraying.<br/><br/>I am only 16 years old and think the film is well worth a watch if you don't have time to watch the 1995, 5 hour version. Many people my age have said they thought the film was rubbish which i think is a shame as 'Pride and Prejudice' is an amazing love story and they most probably will not be inclined to watch Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle or read the book.<br/><br/>Perhaps i didn't enjoy the film as much as other people because i had seen the BBC series but i could definitely sit down and watch it again!"
"rjmatuse","10","4","7","1 July 2007"," Excellent portrayal
","Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. And as an avid fan, I must say that the movie excellently portrayed the novel. Granted, there were things that were shortened, edited, and left out. One can only expect that. The Masterpiece Theatre version, featuring Collin Firth, contained more of and followed the novel more closely, obviously. Because it was a mini series they were able to incorporate more. So one cannot argue that that version was better only because it was more like the book, given the circumstances and the fact that this was a movie, not a series. So for the time allotted and considering other circumstances, this movie was a very good adaptation of the novel, Pride and Prejudice. <br/><br/>The movie itself was, I'll admit, modernized and Americanized (for lack of better words). It became more of a romance, than a tale of the prejudices of historical English society and aristocracy. However, it was still made clear that Darcy and Elizabeth were not considered equals, as well as it was pointed out the prejudices they both held towards each other. Although it was much more romantic and focused more on the growing love between Darcy and Elizabeth, the movie's title was NOT left unexplained. Pride and prejudice was evident and adequately portrayed in the movie--though not as fully as the 1995 version, still enough to follow the novel, while still appealing to the hopelessly romantic audience.<br/><br/>The acting, as well, was superb in my opinion. First of all, Keira Knightley was absolutely amazing as Elizabeth. Absolutely. I am a big fan of her in all movies, but I thought she was especially excellent in this. She definitely captured Lizzie's pride, beauty, intelligence, stubbornness, and other qualities. I would go as far as to say that this might have been her best performance yet. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were excellent, also, which is expected, as well as Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. The rest of the cast was very believable and true to the novel, especially noting Simon Woods (Mr. Bingley), Claudie Blakley (Charlotte Lucas), Rosamund Pike (Jane), and Tom Hollander (Mr. Collins), all of whom I thought specifically brought Jane Austen's characters to life. The final character, who seems to be quite controversial, is Mr. Darcy, played by Matthew Macfadyen. Well, many seem to think his portrayal of the proud, aloof Mr. Darcy was not up to par. And where I can see that Collin Firth may raise the bar quite high, I must say that I though Matthew's acting was absolutely exceptional. Honestly, Collin Firth was a great Darcy, but there was just something missing. He played him excellently, yet just his appearance and overall self was just not what I had pictured Darcy to be (nothing against him, of course. I adore Collin Firth and find him one of the best actors in British ((and American)) film). Mattew, however, was the perfect resemblance to Mr. Darcy. He just had that air and appearance that I had pictured when I read the book. <br/><br/>I happened to find his acting amazing, despite the controversy. In my opinion, this movie was a very good adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, one of the few pictures to ever rival the novel."

"MaxBorg89","9","4","7","23 February 2006"," A stylish and funny romance.
","Before this film, I had never seen a Jane Austen adaptation, or even read any of her books. The closest I'd ever come was when I saw Bridget Jones's Diary, which is practically a modern version of Pride & Prejudice. Then I finally got to see the new P&P, and it was much better than I expected. The ending was a bit predictable, since I had watched the previously mentioned Bridget's Diary (but frankly, aren't all romantic comedies a little predictable?), but that didn't matter, because Pride & Prejudice is a remarkable, astounding picture.<br/><br/>Set in 1797, the film chronicles the life of the Bennet family, whose ""matriarch"" (Brenda Blethyn) is very eager to make sure her daughters get married as soon as possible. Actually, to define her ""eager"" is a huge understatement. Anyway, the focus is on two Bennet sisters in particular: Jane (Rosamund Pike) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). The former is attracted to Mr Bingley, a slightly funny-looking, but nice man, whereas Lizzie has to deal with the silly Mr Collins (Tom Hollander, in a small but amusing role), and, most of all, the cold, ambiguous Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). She can't stand him, and he doesn't seem very enthusiastic about her either, their like/don't like relationship being the core of the movie.<br/><br/>The film's greatness lies in the fact that first-time director Joe Wright makes an ""old school"" romance look fresh and interesting. The way men courted and proposed to women may seem a bit dated, but it's so true and utterly believable, it makes you wish all rom-coms were this good. Silence is as important as words, and locations and weather also have a crucial part in the matters of the heart (rarely has rain looked so romantic).<br/><br/>What also impressed me is of course Knightley: it's her best performance to date, as she makes Lizzie Bennet one of the most convincing characters to have ever appeared in a period piece (her Oscar-nom was slightly unexpected, but fully deserved). Macfadyen is absolutely perfect as Darcy, a complex role brought to life with top class elegance and style. But it's the older thespians who deserve more attention: Blethyn's Mrs Bennet is just a little OTT, while Judi Dench's presence is as memorable as her equally brief, yet flawless, appearance in Shakespeare In Love. The standout, however, is Donald Sutherland as the only male member of the Bennets. He's on screen for quite short time, but thanks to the right lines and attitude in the right moment, he's totally impeccable. Should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, Pride & Prejudice is an incredibly pleasant experience. Watch it, and you will understand why, after several adaptations, Jane Austen's classic still conquers audiences everywhere."

","I must admit that, after seeing the fabulous BBC miniseries (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as D'Arcy and Elizabeth) that a film version would be a poor patch-- a hurried story-line, banal dialogue, ... the list could go on.<br/><br/>Well, I was mistaken. This film is brilliant: tautly directed and scripted, with earthy dances and gestures which speak volumes. This is an excellent work of theatre, a brilliant piece of art, a superbly thought-out film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are stellar: and it seems churlish to put some ahead of others. As Mr and Mrs Bennett, both Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are good. Mrs Bennett can be tiresome and rather manipulative. Deftly played by Brenda Blethyn, she is tiresome but a product of her times.<br/><br/>Tom Hollander (Mr Collins) has some marvellous comedic moments, and the physical theatre moments (his shortness) are used to excellent effect. Simon Woods gives Bingley the air of a buffoon, but a likable one at that. Stellar performances from Rosamund Pike (Jane) and Keiira Knigjhtley (Elizabeth).<br/><br/>As D'Arcy (Matthew Nacfayden-- a superb performance) and Elizabeth reflect the PRIDE and PREJUDICE of the title, and alter as it dawns on them that there is a genuine love, the film holds its own.<br/><br/>It is one of the best classic adaptations I have seen: the committed cast are true to the SPIRIT of the novel.<br/><br/>An unpretentious film, glorious, emotive, well worth seeing. Don't miss it!"
"CinemanBear","10","4","7","12 February 2006"," Pride & Prejudice = Masterful & Stunning
","I have to admit that, personally, watching a film that takes place in a time so distant from a time I can relate to is sometimes so daunting a task for me. This isn't to say that I am in any way moronic or ill-educated. It's just that, occasionally, filmmakers don't do an adequate job with translating these classic novels into the film format.<br/><br/>Having said that, I want to tell you what a truly wonderful viewing experience this film was. From the fade in on, I was completely enveloped in this film, it's setting, and characters. The indication that lets you know you are watching a truly exceptional film is that you become part of the story, or the story becomes part of you, and you are not there as merely an observer anymore. There were moments in the film where I had to look down in order to make sure I wasn't dressed in tails.<br/><br/>The setting was truly marvelous. The director made excellent use of the English countryside. There is one scene in particular that stands out as having brought tears to my eyes. It's towards the end with Kiera Knightly standing on what I can only assume is a very small cliff. It's a wide shot, but it almost looks like a painting. It was beautiful!<br/><br/>Most of the actors turned in splendid performances! Donald Sutherland was an appropriate choice to add that touch of subtle humor. Judi Dench can always be counted on for that perfect brand of matriarchal superiority. Matthew Macfayden, who's work I'd never seen, gave a great performance in the role of Darcy, conveying with ease that his character had many facets behind his highly-polished, yet aloof exterior. The supporting cast was wonderful, too, and it's so refreshing to see an actress such as Jena Malone in a supporting role like this. I've been a fan of hers since ""Stepmom"". If she plays her cards right, this film could be her catalyst into more adult roles. Last, but, by no means, least, Kiera Knightley shines in this film! The only other film I've seen her in was ""The Jacket"", but this film really made me appreciate her more as an actress because, in that film, all I could think of was how much she resembled Winona Ryder, and how it would be interesting to seem them play sisters in something. While I loved ""The Jacket"", it's my opinion that that film kind of almost muted Kiera Knightley's abilities as an actress. What I realized from this film is that she is extremely proficient at knowing just how to deliver her lines, and also conveys emotion well through her facial expressions. It's hard to not focus solely on her in a scene because she unintentionally steals any scene that she's in. Kiera Knightley has been offically added to the growing list of actresses that have earned my total respect and appreciation. I can't wait to go through her filmography to experience more of this fine actress, and I can't wait to see what she does next."
"BSfan1281","10","4","7","23 January 2006"," wonderful movie
","I found that this version of pride & prejudice was a great one. It did skip a few parts of the novel but it was still good. The A&E version is wonderful as well but too long. If you're looking for a quick Jane Austin fix ,and don't feel like reading the book, i definitely suggest watching this movie. Anyone who does not like this film must be crazy because Kiera Knightly does a beautiful job as Elizabeth Bennet and though the man playing Mr. Darcey isn't very attractive, in the end he pulls it off well and increases his character. Though some of her facial expression can be frightening she was overall grand. I had absolutely no problems with this film in comparison to the other, as well as the book."

","I am not usually a person who cares for the ""lovey-dovey"" kind of movie. I also don't usually like to see movies that were taken from a book because the writers seem to leave out so much. However, after seeing Pride and Prejudice, I came to this conclusion: This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen! The script was amazing, the acting was spectacular, and the setting was breath-taking. Also incorporated was a bit of humor which went along surprisingly well with this classic story. The script followed the book very well and only left out unneeded parts. The preview for this movie was also very well done. I would Highly recommend seeing this movie!"
"atwoodsmith","7","4","7","5 January 2006"," A Harlequin version of P&P
","I really enjoyed this movie but, like most Austen interpretations, there were moments to cause me to wince. This one had more than the classic Ehle/Firth 1995 miniseries in less than half the running time, but the result was entertaining.<br/><br/>Plusses: <br/><br/>+ The film did a better job of ""show, don't say"" than earlier versions. My main complaint about the Garvie/Rintoul BBC version of the '80s was that characters too often mouthed Austen's words when there should have been a visual portrayal instead. This film cut letter-reading to an all-time low.<br/><br/>+ Related to the above, this version drew a sharp visual distinction between the costly gentility (and cleanliness) of Netherfield and the shabbiness of the Bennets' Longbourne. The Bennets ""cleaned up nice"" when needed, but they didn't live in spotless splendor.<br/><br/>+ There was a tendency to move scenes to more dramatic settings, like the portico of a rainswept mausoleum. This was both good and bad.<br/><br/>+ The film brought out the character of the father a bit more. Donald Sutherland was terrific.<br/><br/>+ Judi Densch as Lady Catherine.<br/><br/>+ I liked how the script compressed the early action and drew out the final resolution. Again, an opportunity for Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>+ Kiera Knightley is lovely, and a treat to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Minuses: <br/><br/><ul><li>Related to the above, Elizabeth was much prettier than Jane. Wrong.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie had too many ""Harlequin Moments"" in which the characters did the sort of gestures associated with hormone-driven romance stories. This had the most kissing and almost-kissing of any Austen adaptation I've seen. I wonder if this was just to provide imagery for the previews.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Related to the above: unmarried male characters spent an unrealistically large amount of time in the presence of unrelated female characters whilst the latter were clad only in nightwear. Titilating and suggestive, perhaps, but unrealistic for the period.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Time and story compression. At some points it seemed like we were being propelled through the plot at breakneck speed. The script does a reasonable job of covering the major events, but of course some are shortchanged in the warp speed presentation.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I had to get used to various bits of modern speech, like the clip from the preview where Darcy says ""Not if I can help it!"" </li></ul><br/><br/>Unlike other films, Elizabeth was shown to be only slightly competent at the piano, making it clear that Darcy could only like her for her ""liveliness of mind."" An interesting difference that I'm not sure is good or bad."
"gelman@attglobal.net","10","4","7","25 December 2005"," The Best Pride and Prejudice Ever
","Having seen every version of the Jane Austen classic, I say this is by far the best. Much of the credit goes to Keira Knightley, who, in addition to being the prettiest young woman in the movies today, is also a marvelous actress. (She may be prettier than Elizabeth is intended to be, but who can complain about that?) Keira is on screen almost constantly, and she runs through the full range of emotions in her dealings with her silly mother (Brenda Blythen), her gruff but loving father (Donald Sutherland), her sisters, the self-satisfied fool of a clergyman who seeks her hand in marriage (Tom Hollander), the terrible Lady de Bourg (Judi Dench) and, of course, with the prideful Darcy whom she eventually comes to love (Matthew MacFayden). Every one of these roles in perfectly cast and brilliantly performed. MacFayden is a new face to me but he is certainly a future star, and he is the complete Darcy: prideful, incapable of small talk, a loyal and generous friend, ultimately desperate to be loved by Elizabeth. The director, Joe Wright, gives it the Merchant-Ivory touch, gorgeous color, magnificent buildings, utterly faithful to the tone of the book. Doubtless this film is too small and uncommercial to win all the prizes it deserves but here's hoping that Keira Knightley is honored for the best starring performance of 2005. Her talent equals her looks, and that's saying quite a lot. Pride and Prejudice is a great book, and it is fully realized here for the very first time."
"TManley-1","9","4","7","17 December 2005"," Pride and Prejudice on SPEED....
","...2hrs. 9 minutes to tell a 10 to 16 hour hard read of a book? I think Joe Wright did a find job. I did feel like I had been on a bit of a roller-coaster ride of emotions but a mighty fine roller-coaster with beautiful well-crafted views. Was it a Knightley film feast... yeah you bet...but if I had to pick a leading lady to stare at for 2 hrs. she would be in my top ten list. I hope this film wins some award for photograph. I don't believe I have seen close-ups done that well in color ever before.<br/><br/>MacFadyen was a fine high speed Darcy, there was not time for him to be the quiet struck up Firth Darcy. In the time allowed I think he did very well... or maybe quite well as the case may be.<br/><br/>Supporting crew, yeah, well, OK. But really who cares as long as Lizzy and Darcy get it right. I must give my highest marks to Judi Dench who WAS Lady Catherine as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>Maybe if I had the time and education I would join the Jane Austenites, who have been decrying the shabbiness of Bennett farm and household but hey the little visual tour of England and the walk through some of the finer old homes more than made up for the pig in courtyard shot that has caused such a fuss.<br/><br/>To the end now... I loved the book (more than once) loved the BBC series (both a few time each) and I loved this movie. All are different in their way but all tell the wonderful story of two very interesting, very complex characters who are pushed and pulled to and fro by the strongest forms of Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>So unstuff your shirt, sit up straight, made shure you lap bar is secure and enjoy a fun whirl on this rapid-fire performance. If you want the Jane Asten dialogue read the book, if you have not seen the BCC series get ye to a library and check them out... all good and worth the time. As is this movie.<br/><br/>At your service. . . TManley <br/><br/>Sugar the only word in the English language where the ""su"" makes a ""sh"" sound. Are you shure?"
"sancticus","8","4","7","13 December 2005"," Truly delightful and enjoyable
","Pride and prejudice is a well know story that follows the 5 sisters of the Bennet's foray into relationships and marriage. The backdrop of the story is set in England of the late 18th century. An age where marriage pervaded more socially and financially than ones own choosing. This is even more evident in the Bennet's since their house will fall out of their hands if Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) dies. Hence why making a good marriage is of utmost importance. So we get to met quite a few eligible bachelors. Ranging from the tad shy Mr. Bingley to the proud and stout Mr. Darcy and the very inept Mr. Collins. The scenery and locations lends itself to your eyes and really enhances the love story by being truly visual amazing. And talking about a pleasure for the eye, Keira Knightley really shines in this movie. She has received Golden Globes nomination for best actress for this role and it's well deserved. Her performance is scintillating and she really fits the part as Elizabeth. Donald Sutherland is awesome and does his best part in a long time. Matthew MacFadyen (Mr.Darcy) provides both regal-ship and vulnerability to his character and really portrays him well. His chemistry with Keira is also quite good (unlike Keira and Adrien Brody in The Jacket) The rest of the cast is also magnificent. My only wish is that it should have been a bit longer so the elaborations of the relationships could really unfold. Jane Austen fans would surely miss some scenes. So I hope there will be a longer directors cut when it arrives on DVD. All in all a very enjoyable adaption and one that should not be missed."
"vglynn","10","4","7","11 December 2005"," perfectly cast - a gem
","This is, without doubt, the best film I have seen this year. I *adored* it. As a devoted lover of the original book, I was terrified that the movie would be some overdone Hollywood creation. I thought Keira Knightley might be too pretty, and that they might smooth over the character of the mother. Not so. The script was true to the book and very effective, the cinematography dramatic but lovely, and the scenery was perfect - Pemberly and Longbourn seem to have been taken right out of the novel, or maybe my head. The score, too, is worth a second listen. The cast was the real joy of this film, though. MacFayden was an excellent Darcy, and wasn't afraid to be a total jerk when necessary. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, perhaps my favorite characters in this film, stole every scene they were in, and the younger Bennet sisters were as ridiculous as they were meant to be, especially Lydia. Caroline Bingley was wonderfully passive-aggressive, Mr. Bingley adorable, and Lady Catherine regal and horrible. In her brief appearance, even little Georgiana charmed me.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Keira Knightley did Lizzy Bennet true justice. If she ever reads this (which I doubt, but hey, might as well) I want to say Thank you Keira! You gave me a perfect Elizabeth for 2 hours, which is the best present I could get this holiday."

The casting of major characters----Keira Knightley, Matthew MacFadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Judi Dench---is brilliant! Keira and Matthew were everything I hoped for from Austen's novel!

","As an avid admirer of Jane Austen and a long time lover of Pride and Prejudice, I was really nervous about how the Keira Knightly version would turn out. I've read the book dozens of times and seen the A&E version about as many. <br/><br/>The new version definitely surprised me. I expected to want to run out of the theater, but instead, I enjoyed it and stayed through the end. Of course, to compare it to the A&E version is completely unfair. As a two hour film, it can't cover everything a six hour mini-series can. Some of the events and the way they happen have been changed for the sake of keeping the audience entertained. <br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the film is that it presented a very modern interpretation and took itself too seriously. Jane Austen's wit and satirical view of the society in which she lived didn't come across at all. Instead, the film aimed at modern sensibilities and lost the true essence of Austen. All in all, I would say this is a good summary, but if you want a more accurate portrayal, turn to the A&E version or read the book."
"tssmith","8","4","7","3 December 2005"," Excellent for a two-hour adaptation
","Being a great fan of the mid '90s BBC TV production of P&P (the one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), and having read the novel, I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this movie.<br/><br/>But I think it succeeded. The dialog was less faithful to Miss Austen than was that of the 90s TV production, but some of the longer sentences wouldn't have worked in a screen adaptation. Still, one of the short but key sentences from the original (and the BBC production) was missing in this movie: Lizzie, on seeing the great grounds of Pemberly (Mr Darcy's estate), and having adamantly refused his previous arrogant marriage offer, had perhaps ruefully said: ""And of all of this I could have been mistress."" <br/><br/>I thought the cinematography and art direction was brilliant. The direction less so (too many lingering shots of Lizzie being moody)."

","I've always loved the book and even the Lawrence Olivier version (anything with Lord Olivier). I have a copy of the BBC version and I enjoy it, although I always thought the men in it were better cast than any of the women. I only wished the 2005 version was longer and am hoping desperately for a Director's Cut. This was as I had always envisioned Pride and Prejudice, with all the youth, vigor, and real people. I loved them all. The movie itself is just beautiful, layered to show so much going on that you must see it again and again. And every time you find something new to appreciate. I can't say enough, but I recommend it to all."
"terri5","8","4","7","2 December 2005"," Very enjoyable and passionate, but rapidly condensed
","The cinematography and authentic time period setting were the two major selling points of the film. The movie was filmed so close to the action, so when combined with the commotion of day to day life, I felt as though I could slip right through the screen and into the late 1700's. There were some flaws to the time period, such as Bingley entering Jane's bedroom and what appeared to be water spouts in the Pemberley pond, but overall, a magnificent time period piece. Kiera Knightly was superb as Elizabeth - I had a difficult time finding fault with her on any front. Matthew MacFaden's Mr. Darcy was wonderful too. He was by far a different Mr. Darcy than Colin's Mr. Darcy - each of which were good in their own right, but it took me a little while to get over his sullen mood - he seemed more depressed than arrogant. He was still very desirable and his Mr. Darcy was much more passionate and interesting. The supporting cast were all delightful, but did think the director made a mistake by making Mr. Collins as sympathetic as he did. He was clearly not a sympathetic character in the novel, but the ""alone at the ball with a pathetic flower in hand"" scene elicited great sympathy. I did feel the screenplay was about as perfect as it could have been considering there are so many important sub plots that were essential to the story. Pride and Prejudice lovers would have tolerance (and desire) for a very long adaptation, so I was surprised they didn't make the movie a bit longer to prevent such a rushed story that bounced from one scene to the next. With so much dialog speeding by, it would be impossible for a person unfamiliar with the story to really understand the dynamics of what was going on. There was simply not enough communication between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth either. I was left longing for more. I did love the movie for many reasons, but wished it was about 1/2 hour longer. and p.s. I loved the gushy ending us Americans were blessed to receive! It was perfect."

As his character grew in his love for Lizzy and we witnessed his expressions change on screen it was utter magic. And Kiera as Lizzy was perfect casting, she is stunning. The musical score is beautiful and almost haunting...you can hear it in your soul even days after you've seen the movie.

I had never read the book, nor had I ever seen another film version of the story.<br/><br/>However, that changed when I saw this Pride & Prejudice. Once the 2 hours were over, I was in tears and filled with a sense of romance that I hadn't felt in a very long time. This film was beautiful, in every sense of the word. The acting was enjoyable, the scenery pleasant, and the music breathtaking.<br/><br/>In comparison to the revered '95 series (which I promptly bought at the mall when I finally found a copy), this movie was more intimate and emotional. It didn't revolve around the English society or the very important theme of marriage. This film was a display of the numerous emotional changes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy endured in order to fall in love. It was a risky choice, and it worked.<br/><br/>In an era where blockbuster movies are filled to the brim with overused special effects and dry acting, this movie was found to be a refreshing breeze, a pleasant time well spent."

","As a Jane Austen fan since high school lit class, and a great fan of the BBC 6-hour production, I was not inclined to see yet another P&P production. I was more than agreeably surprised. The changes made to accommodate the two-hour screenplay were in keeping with the overall feel of Austen's writings. I feel this adaptation more nearly represents the class division between the Bennett family and the esteemed rank of Darcy and Bingley. I had also been somewhat uneasy about the BBC production as to Jennifer Ehle's age, vis a vis Elizabeth. She was perfect in execution of lines and to some degree the spirit of the character as portrayed in the book. However, her performance was easily eclipsed by the fresh and girlish Keira Knightley. She absolutely glowed. Stealing the movie was Matthew MacFadyen as the aloof but smitten Darcy. WOW! His performance is bound to bring moviegoers back to this movie for second and third viewing. Any Jane Austen fan will immediately mark this Darcy as the best of any who has attempted this character. I did lament the loss of more character development for Wickham and Mr. Collins but this is a small price to pay for the breathtaking locations, sets and performances of the principle characters. After two viewings I am looking forward to going again."

","This was an exhilarating movie to watch. Much of the credit goes to very intelligent direction, including fluid tracking shots and long takes that put viewers in the action (a ball sequence early in the film was especially effective). A concise script keeps the story moving in a compelling way. The single greatest source of exhilaration, however, was the performance of Keira Knightley, who brings one of the most attractive heroines in English literature, Elizabeth Bennet, incandescently to life. Knightley captures Lizzie's intelligence, wit, fierce pride and passionate nature perfectly and gives the most mesmerizing performance by an actress that I have seen in some time. This is the story of a woman who is acutely conscious of the limitations placed on women by the age in which she lives and who is very skeptical in her view of men, yet who is also capable of profound passion. Knightley and the others involved in bringing this most recent version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to the screen make watching Elizabeth Bennet's fate unfold intensely interesting and pleasurable."

It's like snuggling in your favorite blanket in front of the fire. Though no movie adaptation of this book could ever be as good as the A&E version this one runs a very close second.

This new version is much grittier than previous versions. The chemistry between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen in the lead roles was electric. I also appreciated that the director went with a younger cast than we've seen in previous versions as that is more true to the book.

","Any version of Pride and Prejudice gets a nod from me because the book is so dear to me but this is NOT Pride and Prejudice as Jane Austen wrote it; it's a good short story version of the book but the characters are not developed at all which is the cornerstone of Jane Austens' writing, it is hard to follow given the length of the movie and the characters do not say what is written in the book. Also missing is the two Bingley sisters which is capital to the book. The characters sometime speak the English of the day and sometimes not.<br/><br/>It is fast and furious at first with Mrs. Bennett being so bold as to go up to Mr. Darcy and introduce herself and her daughters; in that time she would never do that. Then it slows way down when Elizabeth visits Pemberly and I'm not sure why. And let's not forget the pond scene which is totally missing from this version. The pond scene and they way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy make love just by their eyes after she performs at Pemberly is well worth watching the 1996 version.<br/><br/>If you want to see Pride and Prejudice as a movie do yourself and Jane a favor and watch the BBC 1996 version with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth not to mention Mrs. Bennett is definitely better hands down. Now that IS Pride and Prejudice as written by Jane Austen.<br/><br/>This version is not true to the spoken English as Jane wrote it; it goes in and out of the English spoken as in the book. It is not true to the story which is no fault of the movie because a movie needs to be 1 1/2 hours long which cannot do a Jane Austen book justice.<br/><br/>Please, take the time and let yourself get swept away by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehles' portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy.

","It's just that it's been done so much better already . The 1995 BBC production for T.V. is far superior to this, rendering the 2005 movie version, nearly unwatchable. Jane Austen novels are gems in and of themselves but too many times, we see modern day feminists trying to wrangle in their views into a story line or setting where it was never meant to be. This not only makes the final outcome untrue to the novel but a sacrilege to Jane Austen fans. In real Jane Austen story lines there are men who are good, and men who are not, there are women who are good and women who are not. There is no one side is better than the other garbage. Jane Austen was not a feminists, she was a humanist. She saw good in both sexes. The men in this movie are either twittering idiots, indolent, charlatans or conceited. Case in point, Bingley is described in the book as easy going, friendly and socially proficient but in this movie he is a numbskull and couldn't hold a conversation if his life depended on it. Also, they didn't live side by side with filthy animals roaming about in their house. The Bennet girls also took great care in their appearance which wasn't evident at all in this movie. I just don't understand why so much was changed. It was a disappointment."
"bmwbird","1","7","15","12 January 2007"," I chide the movie makers for their Pride and Presumption...
","Why this adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice' fails in its attempt to accurately portray Jane Austen's beloved novel.<br/><br/>The most famous of Jane Austen's works, 'Pride and Prejudice,' was first published in 1813 and still remains a favorite among many with a love for good literature and well written romance. Ever since movies become popular, companies have tried to produce films that bring Austen's, (and other famous authors') books to life. We enjoy seeing character burst forth from black and white pages into vivid, realistic people thanks to actors and actresses that portray them. Yet, while viewing Focus Feature's 2005 adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice,"" I have come to the conclusion that were Jane Austen alive today, she -and other respectable women of the 19th century- would be horrified at the atrocious misrepresentation of Austen's characters.<br/><br/>The most obvious change is that of the book's heroine, Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Bennet. The first difference that I noticed was her lack of respect for authority. This is first apparent after her refusal of Mr. Collins, when she angrily tells her parents, ""I won't marry him, you cannot make me!"" and runs out of the house. Also, in the conversation that takes place between Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam during a Sunday morning sermon, and after wards, when her mother asks about Lady Catherine de Bourge, Elizabeth screams, ""For once in you're life, leave me alone!"" Jane Austen never allows Elizabeth to display such a lack of respect and self-control in the novel. The movie also fails to represent Lizzie's complete trust and affection for her sister, Jane. She denies even hearing of Mr. Bingley during her stay with the newlywed Collins, and does not tell Jane of Darcy's proposal. In Austen's book, the two sisters always confided in each other.<br/><br/>The changes made in Mr. Darcy's character are equally disturbing. He appears so emotionless and shows almost no change in expression when he speaks that one wonders if he feels anything at all. Jane Austen's Darcy was undoubtedly stern and proud, but the dull manner in which Matthew McFayden expresses -or fails to express- himself is very tiresome, indeed. Furthermore, in Austen's novel Mrs. Bennet is presented as motherly, and often loud and embarrassing; making inappropriate remarks at all the wrong times. In the movie, she goes beyond humiliating and well into vulgar as she dangles her legs off a table she's sitting on during the ball, and sloshes her dessert on an unsuspecting young man. <br/><br/>The whole film is filled with frustrating errors. You're extremely fortunate if you can determine which girl is Lydia and which is Kitty before the dreadful elopement with Mr. Wickham. Everyone listens to conversations behind doors and constantly talk over one another. Mr. Bennet always appears to be half drunk, Lizzie giggles after almost every sentence no matter the gravity of the situation which greatly downplays the drama, Lady Catherine arrives at the Bennet's to admonish Elizabeth in the middle of the night when all civil folk are asleep, and Kitty and Lydia wear pig-tails to a ball. The dialogue is so rushed that it leaves you with a feeling of something missing. If you can even catch what the characters said in the first place. If the movie makers were so short on time, they should have foregone the nauseating scene with Mr. Darcy's collection of naked statues which was a completely unnecessary addition. <br/><br/>Even in the wardrobe department, the movie went wrong. Mr. Darcy proposes for the second and last time to Elizabeth while they are both in their bed clothes. An idea which would have been scandalous to anyone living in Jane Austen's time period. Caroline Bingley is not even properly dressed at the Netherfield ball. She is shown in a plain, sleeveless gown with very thin straps in a time when lace was all the rage and long sleeves the newest fashion in London. Miss Bingley with her love of pomp and display of social status would never have worm a gown such as the one she wears in the movie. In the film, Caroline Bingley was about 200 years ahead of herself in fashion. <br/><br/>I could continue to describe the atrocities of the movie until there was enough to fill a book, but I will end my comparison by saying, that Focus Features does no credit to Jane Austen's wonderful romance in their ridiculous movie."

","I was really rather stunned after watching this film. An avid fan of the book and the 1995 BBC adaptation starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I went along with an equally P&P mad friend and settled down for a treat. What we got was not the gently romantic comedy of manners we were expecting but bosom-heaving, rain-soaked 'damsel-on-the-moors'-style melodrama. Now I know the film-makers didn't have nearly six hours to play with (unlike the BBC) but, with a mega-budget and a shed load of talent, they had every other opportunity to create something masterful. Shame they failed.<br/><br/>Why oh why did Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy continually bump into each other on wild, rain-drenched moorland, a la Cathy and Heithcliff? This WOULD NEVER have happened and, even allowing for the need for cinema to be somewhat more melodramatic than TV, was unnecessary.<br/><br/>Why in the name of Jane Austen was poor Mr Bingley reduced to the status of buffoon? Did no one else hear his goofy laugh? (When I say goofy, I mean the actor actually did sound exactly like the floppy-eared cartoon character). I reckon the film makers must have thought more comedy value was needed when thy scripted this part.<br/><br/>Why did the Bennetts live on a farm? The hazy, golden sunshine that seemed to permanently drench the place reminded me of nothing so much as one of those Hallmark dramas... all wrong for this film.<br/><br/>Why was Keira Knightley chosen for the role? I like the actress but she played this part with too much pout and too many modern, cocky tilts of the head. Elizabeth was strong, independent and, for a woman of her time, outspoken but she also lived over 200 years ago; women simply didn't behave the way Knightley's Elizabeth did.<br/><br/>But the question that baffles me most is this: why in God's name was the dialogue so rushed, to the extent that you are in great danger of missing entire scenes if you blink for too long? I am at a loss; Emma Thompson managed to cram an Austen novel into just over two hours of film when she wrote the screenplay for the excellent Sense & Sensibility. What was wrong with the scriptwriters of this ridiculous charade of a film? But on two positive notes, Rosamund Pike was the best bit about this film, perfectly cast and actually upstaging the Susannah Harker role of the 1995 TV version (though she was the ONLY thing that was better about this film than the BBC adaptation). Secondly, if you haven't read the book or seen any of the TV adaptations then you'll have nothing to compare it to and may agree that it looks very lovely and has one or two touching and original scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, extremely disappointing."
"neusbaras","1","7","15","2 August 2006"," worst adaptation ever
","I've just tried to see Pride and Prejudice and I simply couldn't reach the end. it's an awful version. The director has not understood a word about Jane Austen's book. The Bennet's are from the gentry, not farmers. They own a farm but that does not make them vulgar, poor and dirty (and certainly pigs do not run the house as if it was a pigsty). Country dances were much more elegant and refined than what is shown in the movie... Lady Catherine with his hair loose as she was a witch! I cannot believe nobody has noticed that the social classes that Jane Austen wanted to describe were not as they appear in the movie. Not to mention the appalling lack of chemistry between the main characters. I'm all astonishment, indeed!"

","if i could choose a vote less than one believe me i would, this film butchers a classic novel. The brilliantly done BBC adaptation, unlike this film, actually portrayed Jane Austens book in a true light showing characters, speech and places the way they would have been. i am a great lover of Austen and especially Pride and Prejudice, all the way through this film i became increasingly annoyed at how badly done it was and the thought that other people may actually like it. no offence to the actors but they did not fit the characters at all, the film lacked so much. there were some good shots but the just appeared to be there to impress. as a film it was OK but it was not Pride and Prejudice. i will say, plain and simply, YOU CANNOT FIT A NOVEL OF THAT SIZE INTO A TWO HOUR FILM.<br/><br/>This film would appeal on the whole to people who have no idea about the time the film is set in, the actual Jane Austen story and its humour (rather then Hollywood's distorted modern ""humour"")"
"torunn-liljegren","1","7","15","14 February 2006"," hit and miss
","The director of this version of pride and prejudice seems to have no notion that when times change so does our habits, morals and sense of propriety. To miss such simple details as dress in a costume drama is just unacceptable. People are constantly running around without head attire in this movie, even soldiers in uniform which is simply absurd even today, and really, what a thing to miss! <br/><br/>The movie makers have actually missed all historical fact of womens dependence in the early nineteen century. The reason why Austens heroines are so concerned with love and matrimony is that marriage was the only honorable way to live for women of her social class. If, as in this film, women could just hop on a cart and travel to London for some amusement they would be so independent as to make marriage less important. Really, if they could run outside in the middle of the night to meet with half-naked lovers without being heavily censured by society there would be no need for marriage at all! <br/><br/>I realize that it would be impossible to film a novel without changing bits and pieces but if one is to make a film about life two hundred years ago one should at least try to adhere to the more crucial historical facts. It is also pretty boring when characters are so modernized as to lose all characteristics. Why film an Austen novel if not interested in the essential points of her stories? Ang Lee's Sense and sensibility is not an exact copy of Austens novel but it does manage to express the feeling of her work and that is what's important when filming a book, especially such a famous one as Pride and prejudice."

I agree with the comments from ferrerogrrl, it's probably O.K if you know nothing about the author or book, but I suspect that even if you have read it only once or seen the BBC adaptation this film will annoy you to the quick. As someone who has read Pride and Prejudice at least 20 times, studied it for GCSE and who is also a big Austen fan, I sceptical of even the BBC adaptation. However having seen it and also having read about and watched a documentary on the making of it, I know the makers were true to the period and author. Keira Knightley is just far too scrawny and modern looking to be a believable Lizzy, Rosamund Pike too tough for Jane and as for Donald Sutherland, well where do I start!

Dreadful piece of garbage! they should be thoroughly ashamed of them selves. The man they had play Mr Darcy no more suited that role than miss piggy for Elizabeth.

","Those who do not understand cinema and story telling may like this movie. Those who do not know the story may like the movie. Personally from every aspect I think the movie was an abomination. The director and script writers did a horrible job trying to convey the unbearable anguish that should have been portrayed and the proof is that the audience was laughing the entire time (laughing because of the over emphasized humor.) The movie was very boring. Kiera and the actor who played Darcy lacked experience to play such deeply emotional roles. Also all the actresses who played the sisters seemed to lift Winona Ryder (and sisters) in Little Women. Please everyone do not waste your time and money seeing it in the theater or even as a new release.<br/><br/>The only credit I give is that there are excellent costumes. The sets were nice but the compositions and cinematic affects did not do the justice."

I accept the limitations of a two-hour movie encompassing such a massive, detailed story. There were several bright spots and pleasures but way too few. Donald Sutherland was a commendable Mr. Bennett to the ""nervous Nellie"" Mrs. Bennett. The greatest disappointment was with Dame Judy Dench's performance being so sad and lack luster. Dench appeared downright low brow and trashy. Mr. Darcy's character was insecure (huh?) and Mr. Bingley was a fool (what's with that?). Elizabeth Bennett was played admirably but she seemed to smile too much and at all the wrong times. The entire movie was such a jumble - a mismatched and patched up affair (not unlike a wedding therein). In a nutshell it came across like an abbreviated version of the 'Readers Digest' version. This Pride & Prejudice will probably hit the video shelves within a month. On the bright side, the book is widely available and a great bargain."

","As a very big fan of the wonderful 1995 adaptation of p&p, i was a little disappointed when i found out that p&p was about to be remade. as with all remakes it seems to ruin your memories. At first i thought that keira knightly was not the type of person i would have as Elizabeth Bennet whatsoever, she doesn't seem to be period type actress. period films are better when the actors are not that well known.(i feel that anyway). however i decided i would go and see it and just see what its like.<br/><br/>When the film began and showed the Bennett's house, i thought that it was very American in its setting. the house looked extremely old and was dirty and muddy. the family actually looked like they could have bath. their hair was considerably messy and i could not understand what the father was saying sometimes Cos he slurs when he talks.<br/><br/>there is no doubt that keira is a good actress and she did play the part well, except for her looking extremely skinny in her tiny dresses. she has the wit of Elizabeth, (no doubt watched Jennifer ehles performance). altogether she was quite good.<br/><br/>Mr Darcy, Mathew Mcfadden i did not feel was the real Mr Darcy that we all know, he didn't live up to Colin firth whatsoever, but he wasn't there to copy him. he did look stern at all times but didn't have enough pride in his countenance.<br/><br/>Kitty and Lydia were very silly, and they are supposed to play a big part in the firm especially Lydia, but i didn't feel that they were in the film much, and when they were it didn't seem important what they were doing because it wasn't delved into deep enough. Also the aunt and uncle, they were hardly in it and the scenes were rushed. Mr Collins was one of stronger actors and did make me feel kind of sorry for him at times unlike the 1995 one. Charlotte Lucas was a good actress and was great in the film. Mr wick hams part didn't seem important as his was rushed through and Georgiana Darcy. miss bingley was okay, her part was played well. the mother i thought would be a bit more neurotic but at times did make me laugh a little. the father i had explained he slurs when he speaks and is difficult to understand.<br/><br/>the main thing that i was very disappointed is that when i read someones review before i went to the cinema it said that the end was better than the 1995 version i was expecting a huge wedding and a lot more stuff to happen. but what did i find, there was no wedding! the film just ended on a happy note and that was it.<br/><br/>i found the film okay but nothing compared to the 1995 version, if you have seen the 1995 one you wont like this, to me it was incredibly rushed. if you haven't then you might like it, but it is not a brilliant version."

","Oh, yes, you definitely get the impression that Lizzie and Darcy are 'thinkers' - the reason why they are so confounded my their emotional responses. (The pride and prejudice). This version very eloquently displays the different personalities of the Bennet sisters and the way they position themselves for mating purposes. Not sure Rosamund Pike was the right choice for Jane - was she really so beautiful that she could play 'ignorance' of her beauty? I don't think so here. Keira's performance is a bit mixed but there is no harm in that as, surely, this is what makes her most authentic in the role. Judi Dench is absolutely superb as Lady Catherine and conveys in very little time the difficulty the young Lizzie will have after she commits to Darcy. Fabulous. Brenda and Donald work a dream as the much tried parents. I laughed out loud several times - a fine story well told."

","Pride and Prejudice captures the essence of Jane Austen's book, paying great attention to both characters and detail to create an emotional screen adaption. This is one film that uses cinematography to an advantage in capturing lush landscapes, enhancing the feelings of the characters with appropriate camera angles and shots, and representing period history through costume and rich rural landscape. I expect that everyone who sees this film will be 'blown away' by the cinematography, which is used in a major way to tell the story of Elizabeth and her family and Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>This screen adaption succeeds in attracting an audience through familiar faces and a timeless classic, which should not be regarded solely as a great love story but should be regarded as a timeless classic portraying social history and a class system. (This film has the potential to be enjoyed by many different types of individual.) In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice succeeds in this screen adaption through excellent cinematography that enhances the characters and emotions while representing a class structure. Good job. 7/10."

","I loved this movie. I did see the original BBC series too... this movie compares very well. Colin Firth's Darcy was intriguing and well-played in the old version, which originally gave me a fascination with the story, and compelled me to read the book. Matthew Macfayden's Darcy is also brilliant; he smoulders with hidden layers of passion and turmoil, with an engaging edge of vulnerability. He is able to convey a worried, haunted look in his eyes that speaks eloquently of his thoughts. This worked well in the BBC's Spooks spy series (when his character went off the rails)... he uses it to powerful effect in Pride & Prejudice too.<br/><br/>Kiera's Elizabeth is not as plain as the one described in the book, but it does not really matter, as Kiera completely inhabits her character, with a lively, spirited cheekiness that lights up the screen.<br/><br/>Judy Dench was magnificent in her role... formidable! At times even her (very tall)hair seemed to quiver with an air of imperious rage.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who loves Jane Austen, costume dramas, satire and romantic comedies.

This film has the perfect formula.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Benet) sarparkled as per usual, once again taking on a role that she played as if it was meant for her. Matthew MacFadyen (Mr. Darcy) was mysterious and strong from the outside, though he brought a sense of weakness to the role that we only saw (and rightly so) when he was with Elizabeth. Keara Knightly herself shone out from the crowd as well as she walked, shoulders straight, a slight smile across her face across the screen in the opening scene; I was lost to the world of Jane Austin already! I haven't seen the mini-series of 1995 but from what I have heard, it was a hard act to follow. Personally, I believe that this film was definitely in my top 10; the casting was unfaltering, the set was breath taking at times and the film as a whole was simply marvelous! My only reservation was that they had cut the story line of when Mr. Darcy goes to find Mr. Wycombe. However, I didn't feel it made any real difference to the overall script and if anything, helped us focus on the real matter at hand; the struggle of love between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film already, then what are you waiting for! This film will have you laughing at the ridiculous Mr. Collins, crying at the tears of a father and the happiness of a daughter and smiling with joy at the line ""If your feelings have not changed since last April ma'am then tell me so now. But if they have then I am inclined to tell that my feelings and wishes are still the same..."" This film is not to be missed and will have you leaving the movie theatre either wishing to fall in love, or clinging to your 'other half' in a renewed love."

The rest of the cast are also good. The audience at the cinema I was in laughed out loud on numerous occasions, so there is humour there. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it.

","The actor I thought I would be most adverse to was the one I was the most impressed with -- MacFayden. He portrayed a very believable Darcy and was - in his own choices and style - convincing and quite attractive. Less impressed was I with other actors and their character development. Knightly as E.Bennett was not believable and lacked a certain kind of, let's say, sophistication that Austin fans are so attracted to. I far preferred the Caroline Bingley that was portrayed in the mini-series. The character development was superior and timeless to the qualities of snobbery and prejudice. Kelly Reilly was transparently ""today"" and again, lacked the period sophistication portrayed so brilliantly in the book and mini series. Also, In the book and in the mini series, one could hardly wait for Lady Catherine de Bourg to be on camera. The editing choices in this movie left her part wanting and as much as I admire Dame Judi Dench, was not at all satisfied with the portrayal. Tom Hollander was a terrific Mr. Collins - physical type and acting ability, choices seemed a good match! I especially liked the camera angles and shots of the countryside.I wondered long and hard about the edits that would be necessary to make this movie and knew it would be tough. On the one hand it was believable to see the chickens, geese and animals back-dropped on the Bennett property and perhaps filled in questions that people have speculated about over the years. But, on the other hand,I did not get a sense of connectedness from character to character, family to family and an authentic connection especially to the period sophistication and mannerisms. I did not want the script changed or interpreted for me as though it were iambic pentameter or something. I wanted it portrayed exactly as it were - an enchanting piece of literature representing an enchanting period of time. That said, if you've not ever seen the mini series or read the book, it is a good movie."

","In the music industry there are some records that should never be 'covered', that is to say sung by another artist. This is because the first or an earlier version was just too good. I am one of many who has seen the 1995 Firth & Ehle version of Pride & Prejudice and I just thought that it would be difficult for that version to be matched especially in less than half the time. Maybe I myself am, dare I say it prejudiced however I can also say that I have read the book and here is where the film lacks consistently when the 1995 version did not.<br/><br/>The excellent language and turn of phrase brought forth by Jane Austen is missing and then some of the phrases are said out of order and some are said by the wrong character. Also for the sake of time some of the characters in the book was missing from the 1995 version(although this did not diminish the story) but for some strange reason the Knightley version added a character, to own the truth Mr Hill. WHY? All he did was put some food on the table.<br/><br/>I assume that because of time sub plots could not be developed for example Wickhams true's nature,Lydia's flirtations and the hatred all of the Bennett family had towards Mr Darcy. Having said all of the above I believe the actors worked well with the material they had to work with and I dare say that a person who has not read the book or seen the 1995 version would have found this film quite diverting."
"Rodrigobivaryvalencia","5","5","10","28 October 2005"," Good but the script was not
","The film was well presented, the acting was competent except for the scene between Darcy and Elizabeth where she finally accepts him: MacFadyean was a little hammy there.<br/><br/>Overall, the script was too far from the original text and it grated. Why change the classic lines for no reason? The rejection scene was well filmed and acted but the lines again were not right.<br/><br/>Where was that classic line, ""In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you""? Then Darcy goes and insults her family and in particular, her mother. Hardy Austenesque.<br/><br/>And then there's that absolute clanger after the Lady Catherine de Bourg confrontation scene. ""For once in your life why don't you leave me alone?"". Again hardly sounds Austenesque.<br/><br/>Also in the scene where Mr Bennett talks to Elizabeth about Darcy after his proposal, she tells her father all about Darcy's good deed. I wonder why the scriptwriter felt the need to include this unAusten invention. The book left the father in the dark and so it should remain.<br/><br/>One doesn't wish a faithful adaptation of Austen's original text, but at least leave the classic lines alone. Call me a purist, but too many people know and treasure these lines. To hear them mangled is a cringing experience. The sad fact is that these lines need not have been changed. Time would not have been saved and clarity would not have been added. It just goes to show that there is really only one Jane Austen and Deborah Moggach isn't she."
"c-rieger","5","5","10","24 October 2005"," Not sure about this one
","Yes, I have seen the 1995 version and the 80s version, as well. I have also read the book (more than once, more like a dozen times).<br/><br/>I never thought Ehle/Firth as the personification of Lizzie/Darcy but still was sceptical about Keira Knightley as Lizzie.<br/><br/>The movie has some good points, I liked the way the assemblies were pictured, probably more realistic than in the BBC adaptations. I also thought Jane was very well cast.<br/><br/>The main weakness, I thought was in the script. Some scenes were out of character, both for the characters and the original author. also some shots were more Bronteesque than Austen and you couldn't get further away from the original. This version spelt things out a lot (e.g. Lizzie's reaction to Collins' proposal, Charlotte's telling her, the exaggerated difference in status between Darcy and Lizzie) but these weren't necessarily the important bits. Did they really have to picture the Austen family as a slovenly family living with pigs?<br/><br/>It's a hard task to put Austen books into 2 hours. So much is happening. But than they had time for some added scenes which might have been better spent on elaborating the existing plot. And the second proposal scene was ridiculous. What were they thinking of!?! (No need to ask Mr Bingley for approval, how could he deny it with his daughter showing up in the early hours of the morning in her Nightshirt with a man?) <br/><br/>Oh, and I thought Mr Collins was a let-down. He seemed more malicious than stupid. His scenes should be funny but they weren't at all."
"pmxjefg","7","5","10","10 October 2005"," A good film.... but not the best P&P adaptation
","It was always going to be difficult to make Pride and Prejudice into a two-hour long film; on the whole, I thought this production made a decent stab at it - but I still prefer the BBC version.<br/><br/>The standard of the acting is generally quite high. For me, the standout performance was by Rosamund Pike as Jane. This may sound odd, as she only has a fairly small role, but I think this is one of the most difficult characters to play - nice, quiet and apt to think well of everybody, she could all too easily come across as a complete drip. In the BBC series, I always felt Susannah Harker's Jane was so serene you weren't sure if there was anything going on beneath the surface, but here Jane has some of Lizzie's intelligence and liveliness (whilst being less sure of herself), which makes their relationship as sisters more convincing. Keira Knightley acquits herself well as Lizzie - she certainly looks much more like my idea of the character than Jennifer Ehle did. However, I'm not sure she delivers the lines so well - she is apt to seem sharp and almost peevish, whereas Ehle in my view hit exactly the right note, teasing and amused by the follies of others, without being cruel. Darcy on the other hand, does not come across so well - admittedly, it's a difficult role, as he has almost nothing to say for the first half of the film - but he looks dead behind the eyes, and you don't feel any interest in him as a character at all.<br/><br/>Brenda Bletheyn and Donald Sutherland provide adequate support as Mr and Mrs Bennet, but don't reach the high standards of Alison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow from the BBC series. A conscious decision seems to have been taken to make Mrs Bennet more sympathetic and less hysterical - at one point she basically explains to camera that she needs to get her daughters married to ensure their financial security - but I think this point was clear enough anyway, with the background to Mr Collins' visit. Instead, we lose much of the comedy of the character - and it ends up seeming rather unjust of Mr Darcy to accuse her of any want of propriety! Another consequence is that we also lose the feeling of a special bond between Lizzie and her father, as the rational beings in a house of frivolous, empty-headed women. Of the other characters, very little can be said, as they're on screen for so short a time. Wickham almost completely vanishes - and when he runs away with Lydia, we don't really understand what the fuss is about. Tom Hollander has a couple of nice comic moments as Mr Collins, but is given too few lines to express the character's verbose self-importance, and similar difficulties afflict Judi Dench's Lady Catherine. The worst case though is Mr Bingley, who just comes across as an incredibly irritating, upper-class twit.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this film was the writing - one of the great joys of Austen is her elegant, lively dialogue - but here, modern phrases have been added, which jar horribly on the ear by comparison. I think the worst example was when Charlotte Lucas yelled at Lizzie, 'Don't you dare judge me!' after informing her of her engagement to Mr Collins, though perhaps Mr Darcy's use of the word 'relationship' in his first proposal was nearly as bad. The visual style of the film is quite unexpected for an Austen adaptation, and makes you think the director had confused the book with other great works of literature. Certainly, when pigs started wandering through the Bennet's house, I began to wonder whether I was watching 'Pride and Prejudice' or 'Far from the Madding Crowd', and Darcy's proposal in the pouring rain, and Elizabeth's rock climbing in the Peak District, seemed unnecessarily Bronte-esquire. However, these (rather pretentious) quibbles aside, it should be said that the film looks gorgeous, and I particularly liked the way they captured the lively, rough and ready atmosphere of the country ball, which contrasted well with the refinement of Bingley's party.<br/><br/>My criticisms of this film, then, are that it is shorter and takes a more modern (or less reverent) approach to the material than the BBC adaptation - which would probably be recommendations to all but the most devoted fans of the book. The generally high quality of the acting and beautiful sets and scenery elevate it above the level of most films that make it into the cinema. It's definitely worth seeing if you get the chance, but in my opinion, it's just not as good as the earlier TV version."
"cg7685","3","6","13","6 August 2008"," The movie does not do justice to the novel
","I think the only thing I found delightful in this film is the music, it more or less captures the youthfulness, cheerfulness of Elizabeth. <br/><br/>On other terms the book has been totally ignored. Many claim that you can do only this much in 2 hours, but I firmly believe that many mistakes could have been avoided altogether. The costumes, hairdos, even interior designs were not true to the era. Bennet's house looks more like a stable, with interior walls actually look dirty! Were they trying to make Bennets look totally poor compared to Darcy's grandeur? I think it was overdone in this case. <br/><br/>I was mostly appalled with the boring dialogues, lack of politeness in the dialogues and unforgivable use of cussing words! When Bingley walks in to propose to Jane he just demands everyone to leave the room so he can talk to Jane. No man with any dignity or respect to the family would ever say those words or in such a harsh tone! No matter what century he is from! And then he actually calls himself an ""ass""???!!!! while talking to Jane. There is no such language anywhere near any of Austen's novels! And use of such a language is unpardonable and truly dishonors Austen and her works.<br/><br/>It's worthless to take sides on who plays who better and in what version but pointing out obvious mistakes has to be done so maybe those who find this movie a great adaptation of the novel may actually realize that it greatly misinterprets the novel, its beautiful dialogues and is not a very accurate representation of that period. I think I wouldn't mind the movie this much if not for the obvious mistakes in historical sense and a horrible script."
"haikkepejling","5","6","13","24 June 2008"," Nothing will ever beat the -95 version
","When I first saw this new version of Pride and Prejudice my immediate response was that no-one who has not read the book or at least seen one of the two longer adaptions would leave the theatre completely confused and have no idea what the story is really about. All of a sudden in comes Kitty crying because she was not invited to go to Bath with Lydia and Mrs Forster. First question to the confused: Who is Mrs Forster?! That information is left out. Also, there is very little Whickham, very little everyone really. In short, one cannot do this wonderful book justice by squeezing it into a 2 hour film. One needs time to get to know the characters in order to get the story, since it is too complex and contains too many important incidents with each of them. As for the casting.... Well. I do understand that some think Keira Knighltey is too pretty for this part. She is a beautiful young lady and it might not seem all that credible that some man might not find her pretty enough to ""tempt him."" This is more the case with Jennifer Ehle and Elizabeth Garvie, whose looks one isn't perhaps stricken with at first glance. Also, their faces seem to fit the period more than that of Keira Knightley. What bothers me most about this though is the locations. Longbourn is too shabby. The Bennet family had servants, and as it seems in here they more live in an abandoned barn than a house. Mrs Bennet is also too shabby-looking. All in all they seem too poor. I did not get that impression in the book. The -95 version seemed a lot more true in that sense and was I think more of what Jane Austen had in mind. Darcy is OK, but seems more lost and shy than proud. In the case of the -95 version he managed to look like he despised the whole world. Always with a look on his face as if there was a constant smell of something rotten in the area. This Darcy mostly just looks scared. Though as a woman one does feel strong sympathy for him when he is rejected, especially considering those puppy eyes.... One does want him to get Lizzy. No, if one wants to get the true feeling of Jane Austen, read the book or see one of the two TV adaptions. I recommend the -95 version."
"blowfly13","1","6","13","25 August 2007"," as bad as most adaptations of Jane Austen novels
","Most adaptations of Jane Austen novels are horrible, with the exception of Emma Thompson's awesome Sense and Sensibility, which perfectly captured the spirit of the book and most of the dialog, and of the fairly recent Persuasion, which also did a decent job. This version of P&P is as awful as the previous few (including the horrific version with Lawrence Olivier). The main characters were done terribly. For some reason, no actress can seem to understand that Elizabeth is PLAYFUL and TEASING; Keira Knightley, like others, turned her into a bitchy smart ass. I also found that puppet-like jaw of hers highly distracting throughout the movie. Darcy seemed more depressed than full of pride and confidence - he was lifeless (although I did enjoy the scene near the end of him walking toward Elizabeth across the fields). Bingley in the book is a fun-loving, genuine, happy-natured person; in the movie he is an unattractive and laughable half wit. Jane is supposed to be beautiful - I have yet to see a version of P&P where the actress portraying her is. Mr. Bennett has none of the sharp wit from the book and is mostly a marshmallow, and the Bennett marriage has been converted to basically happy. The enjoyable Mr. Collins was played too heavily and without humor. Like the recent horrible movie about Mansfield Park, this version of P&P has been moved forward in time - there is simply no way that young women of that time would have been subjected to the naked statues in Darcy's house and the racy paintings in Lady DeBourgh's. Completely ridiculous, and certainly not part of the book. I can never understand how Hollywood writers have the hubris to rewrite absolute classics like P&P. Do they truly think they can IMPROVE on Jane Austen? I wish Emma Thompson would write more adaptations of Austen's other novels, including this one. She alone seems to have a feel for the spirit of the books. I would be surprised to hear that most of the people involved in the film even read Pride and Prejudice."

","Just like the 1940 version, this one seems like it's on speed. There's rarely time for a breath! Granted they've taken a complex novel and condensed it into 2 plus hours, but every bit of dialog seems rushed. There's little time for anyone to respond much less react. <br/><br/>What I really minded most was the choice of leaving everyone but Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) out of the story. We see nothing of her sister Jane, little of her interest in Bingley, none of the caustic wit of Bingley's sister, none of Wickham's dalliances, none of Lydia's stupidity. In fact, I saw so little of Darcy, that I wondered at any attraction. <br/><br/>Some of the changes from the novel were disturbing. Why was Charlotte Lucas an old maid instead of someone who simply wasn't romantic? What's with all the chickens in the Bennet's front lawn? <br/><br/>For this to work, the viewer must understand that there was incredible prejudice on everyone's behalf -- not just Darcy's. That Lady Catherine was just as embarrassing as Mrs. Bennet. But unfortunately, there doesn't seem to have been enough time for any of this. A shame really, because there were moments to be enjoyed."

","OK, i do admit-- this version has amazing scenery which is probably as close as we can get to the time period. But as for the acting---- it was HORRIBLE. The only person that every played Elizabeth well was Jennifer Ehle. And the best Darcy is HANDS DOWN Colin Firth. The complexity between Elizabeth's and Darcy's relationship is lost in this version. I also hate that the cut so much from the storyline and the ending was terrible. It definitely took away from the story.<br/><br/>All in all, the BBC version kept true to Austen's story. The actors were Impeccable, and definitely fit their characters to the T. Just because Keira Knightly is pretty, does not mean that she can play the role. And as for the actor who played Darcy...... boring. He had no life whatsoever. Watching him was like watching a blank wall."

","I was willing to give this new Pride & Prejudice a chance, after all it's one of my favorite books, but I was thoroughly disappointed by this version. Keira Knightly lacked the intelligent spark that makes Elizabeth Bennet one of the greatest characters in literature and instead became a tomboy without extraordinary personality. The Mr. Darcy became a man who was so gosh-darn shy and so gosh-darn boring instead of proud and awkward with emotions. The rest of the cast is pretty good and the cinematography was beautiful, but the two leads made the film painful. If you want a mindless romantic-comedy, I guess this would do it for you, but this film lacks the passion and intelligence of true Jane Austen."

","Well, I did have a review that was over 4,000 characters, but, unfortunately, I am only allowed 1,000, so Ill have to sum up briefly<br/><br/>I cant believe the critic for this site gave this movie 4 stars I'm being perfectly honest when I say that this was worst movie I have ever seen. Period. This is the first movie review I've ever written on a movie, and I felt motivated to do so simply because this movie was so horrible in every single way. First and foremost, the two main leads, Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy, were both terrible in their roles. I'm appalled that Knightley received and Oscar nomination for her role. Her total interpretation of Elizabeth Bennet in general was horrible she acted completely ditsy and air-headed. As for Macfayden as Mr. Darcy, he was horrible. Like Knightley, he just seemed just to read his lines from the script. However, he read them in a monotone, without any expression or emotion at all. He was, overall, just terrible in this role. Other than the terrible acting and casting in this movie, the way in which the story was played out was atrocious. I mean, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet meet two or three times for about twenty minutes, and in this short time, Elizabeth goes from admiration to hatred to love of Mr. Darcy. The same goes with the love story between Jane and Mr. Bingley. Character development and real relationships between characters in this movie is completely left out. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy remain their uninteresting selves throughout the entire movie, and Jane and Mr. Bingley remain their brainless selves as well. The close relationships between Elizabeth and her father, and Elizabeth and Jane are barely even touched upon in fact, everyone in the Bennet household hardly have any real character interaction with each other. Overall, do NOT see this movie. At all. I'm sorry to have wasted 127 minutes of my life on this, the worst movie I have ever seen."

A pig wandering in the home of the Bennet family? The family of a gentleman who, though poor, kept servants??

"cskoog-1","1","6","13","2 June 2006"," The worst of all modern Austen adaptations
","Central to the awfulness of this film is the brainlessly carnivorous vanity of Knightly's performance as Elizabeth. Note how few shots there are of her face closely relating to anyone else's. The faces are shot separately because she is evidently impossible to act with. Too bad that Elizabeth Bennett was supposed to be wise, sensitive to other people, and not self-absorbed. Her portrayal here lacks all of these aspects.<br/><br/>Watching the DVD extras for this film, it is apparent that Joe Wright is a sort of MTV kind of director, and this is why the film is really nothing more than a collection of overblown and syrupy tableaux. In addition, despite the manifest smugness of the screenwriter about what a good job she's done, every thing that she has added does little more than trivialize Austen's intentions, while what she has taken away leaves something that has no more depth than a bodice-ripper pulp novel.<br/><br/>The other actors are all at least competent though more often than not misdirected into caricatures."

On the plus side, this movie has some stunning cinematography, wonderful music and the incomparable Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet. For the rest, it felt like a Cliff Notes version of the story, too much attempted in too short a time. On top of that, it seemed as though the director actually never read the book. The director and screenwriter have somehow missed that the title of the book is Pride and Prejudice, not Elizabeth and Darcy. Every character has been homogenized for mass consumption in the service of the central love story. Judy Dench does the most she can with a character whose stinger has been plucked, Tom Hollander actually makes Mr. Collins a sympathetic character and even Tallulah Riley (as pedantic sister Mary) has a screen moment where the audience feels sympathy for her. In short, they have stripped the story of all its bite, wit and context, leaving poor Keira Knightly and Matthew McFadyen nothing to do but look beautiful.

"tulip4041","Null","6","13","20 November 2005"," saddened and mystified
","I was extremely frustrated and saddened by the latest version of Pride and Prejudice. I knew that it would be a challenge to capture the subtlety and humor of the story in two hours, but I was unprepared for the blatant changes in characterizations, the unforgivable paraphrases of perfectly written text, and the unexplainable alterations in scenes. <br/><br/>It was absolutely painful to watch Darcy's first proposal to Lizzie. There was no earthly reason why the scene had to be filmed outside in the rain. I can even understand that their argument would have to be curtailed. But they gutted the scene. They paraphrased (why?) the line that cut Darcy to the core, that was the reason for his awakening, the motive for his tender questions to Lizzie at Pemberly. Lizzie is supposed to say--had you behaved in a more gentlemen-like manner...but instead, she says some inane, modern version that falls far off the mark Jane intended. Furthermore, in the absolutely awful scene at Pemberly, Darcy never asks about her family. This was the one thing that struck Lizzie the most, that he would inquire after relatives he had previously insulted. This was the first hint of his transformation... She was so confused... This careless attention to the heart of the novel continued throughout. There were so many things wrong with this movie: jerky camera action, Lady Catherine visiting in the night, the Bennets living in sloppy conditions, Lizzie and her aunt hardly connected in spirit, the girls wearing corsets, Darcy appearing more confused and shy than arrogant, Bingly as a fool, Mr Bennett having intimate conversation with Mrs. Bennett in their bedroom, the silly final proposal in the morning, Mr. Bennett's relief and pleasure when he hears about DArcy's generosity. The underdevelopment of the characters could be due to the short film, but if you hadn't read the book, you would never know that Darcy was truly arrogant (not misunderstood or lovestruck as the movie suggests). You do not really grasp Lizzie's particular love for Jane, their intimacy, their elevated standing in their father's eyes, their disinterest in the regiment. Would anyone grasp that Miss Bingley is jealous of Lizzie? The thing that upsets me the most is that people will think this is Pride and Prejudice. I even read one reviewer from a prominent paper who considered this movie the definitive P & P. <br/><br/>I thought Keira Knightly was absolutely wonderful, the most perfect Lizzie, the only good part of the movie. When she delivered Jane's lines, she did so with great skill. Why didn't they give her more lines from the novel? Why did they water down Jane?"
"paterfam001","6","6","13","14 November 2005"," Sweet, but it isn't Jane!
","To start with, I am a Janeite: I have read Pride and Prejudice at least a half-dozen times, and enjoyed it every time. This may be a disqualification for viewing this movie, because, delightful as it is, it isn't really Jane. I agree with almost all the comments regarding the casting and acting, which have been highly praised. The combination of edgy beauty and intelligence make Kiera Knightly almost the only choice for Elizabeth Bennet, Sutherland and Blethyn as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are superb -- both are actually better than Austen's originals -- Sutherland suggests the weariness, the remoteness, the despair of the father, and Blethyn grounds the vulgar eagerness of the mother in real social and economic hope and despair. The three youngest sisters fill their roles very well, being nearly as insufferable on the screen as they would be in real life. Bingley and Jane are well-portrayed, he as an amiable doofus, she as a sweet, long-suffering girl, yet capable of deep feeling. Mr. Collins is sublime: I am sorry that there was not more of his pervy absurdity. Caroline Bingley is something of a one-note character, but well done. Mr. Darcy, however. The actor does what he can with the role, but he is, I think, wrong for it -- I think anyone who does not look like a young Olivier is wrong for the role. An imposing physical presence ('tall' is not enough) is an absolute requirement. Olivier had it in the 1940 film (its one bright spot). Firth had it in the 1995 TV version. This film doesn't have either actor, and thus falls short. Lacking an obvious reason for his conviction of superiority, he seems to be a mere snob. The worst acting and directing lapse, however, is from a direction you would never suspect. Dame Judy Dench is wrong-wrong-wrong for Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She is too dignified, serious, and intelligent-seeming to play the imperious buffoon, Lady Catherine. Actor-proof part, one would think, but I think Dench missed it, because there is too much cynical wisdom in her glance, where a lighter-weight actor would have made it a gem. The chap playing Wickham - did anyone else notice? - looked exactly like Orlando Bloom. I suppose you've made it when they start casting your clones. The art direction was splendid - and original - in the interiors. The messy, shabby Bennet house, cheek-to-jowl with the cowbarn, frigid Netherfield Park, the crowded assembly-rooms at the Meryton ball, all captured the period, and more important, the sense of social distinction, of the period. Though Lizzie Bennet tells Lady C. 'Mr. Darcy is an English gentleman, my father is an English gentleman; thus far we are equal.' The movie undercuts this to such an extent that the line, famous as it is, is not used. One sees Darcy's point. In the outdoor scenes, the art direction was equally splendid, in a postcardy sort of way. Did Mr. Darcy really have to emerge from the morning mist? But in the end it's the writing that makes the movie, and it's the writing that invalidates this as a definitive 'Pride and Prejudice'. Some choices were just stupid: Lizzie's description of her sister Jane as 'shy' is dead wrong - no one in the period would have used the word that way, and Jane isn't shy anyway, in the sense of 'socially inept'; what she is is modest, placid, even-tempered, good-natured, and, perhaps to compensate for her mother and sisters, not given to trumpeting her affections from the roof-tops. A very short speech to this effect would have worked, perhaps pointing out that men of Mr. Darcy's stripe demand just the qualities in a woman that Jane displays, and to dismiss her as unfeeling when she displays them is deeply unjust. I should point out that when the script and the direction turn to Jane, as in Lizzie's scene with Mr. Bennet after Darcy's proposal, it works perfectly. Is it possible that Miss Austen knew what she was doing all along,"

Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench were lovely, dare I say it better than the BBC castings for Mrs Bennet and Lay Catherine. Jenna Malonwas also very good, though her accent was not perfect!<br/><br/>As for the men,it was a poorer showing. Matthew MacFaydon was sadly disappointing. I loved him in Spooks, and was hoping that he would make an to be convincing. Perhaps he should stick to thrillers... Neither Bingly nor Wickham really managed to capture the part. Bingly especially, came off too silly to be believable. (Wickham just looked far to like Orlando Bloom!)<br/><br/>What did really catch my eye was the directing and cinematography. I loved the creative way that the camera was used to convey time passing and significant devlopments in people's emotions. It is worth seeing this film for that.<br/><br/>To sum up... This is not ever going to be a good version for the purists among you. Two hours is just not enough time to do Austen justice. Some of the subtleties of class and emotion have been expanded to make it clearer what is happening and why, so therefore it is more accessible to the Pride and Prejudice virgin than the BBC version. But like I said, it's not for purists."
"dianefhlbsch","1","7","16","16 September 2007"," Horrible adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.
","YUCK!!!!! Just shoot the screen writer and the director! But give awards to the cinematographer!!! What a misuse of the entire female cast.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this version, as I am a big Austen fan. But before the opening credits were finished rolling, I knew I would hate it. Why? Because there were so many errors with the direction, costumes and scene set ups, that I know Austen would be appalled! This film could have been good if it did not bear the same name as the novel, and said it was loosely based on it.<br/><br/>For starters, the Bennet family was not a bunch of frumps, they had a much better house and furniture, and there certainly would not be pigs in the house. The only women of the time who were seen in public with their hair down and loose were of the seedier kind. (Hence the expression, ""To let one's hair down."") Elizabeth Bennet would NEVER have been that fresh to her mother, or some others. She needed a few good slaps in the face. Mr. Bennet was no longer on love with his wife; as a matter of fact he almost had contempt for her! Matthew Macfadden did NOT look proud at all-he looked like he was on Quaaludes the entire film. I hope to NEVER see him on the screen again. He's pathetic! (Colin Firth in the previous version was alive, but looked constipated.) And what was with that STUPID closing scene with the shirt open?!! Definitely NOT appropriate for the character or the time period!<br/><br/>Again, Aunt Gardner's role is practically eliminated, which is a fatal error. This character is the third tip of Austen's typical triangle of comparison.<br/><br/>I do agree that Keira Knightly, and all of the women in the cast gave excellent performances with the material they had to work from. Hats off to Rosamund Pike who has sent the standard of excellence for the portrayal of Jane Bennet. I believe that Jena Malone would have also taken the same title for her portrayal of Lydia, but her part was reduced too much.<br/><br/>Suffer through the total production, if only to watch the ladies do excellent work with inappropriate and bad lines."

","In Georgian England, Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) raises her five daughters Â– Jane (Rosamund Pike), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Mary (Talulah Riley), Kitty (Carey Mulligan) and Lydia (Jena Malone) with the purpose of getting married with a rich husband that can support the family. They are not from the upper class, and their house in Hartfordshire will be inherited by a distant cousin if Mr. Bennet dies. When the wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley and his best friend Mr. Darcy arrive in town to spend the summer in a mansion nearby their property, the shy and beautiful Jane falls in love for Mr. Bingley, and Lizzie finds Mr. Darcy a snobbish and proud man, and she swears to loathe him forever. This is the beginning of their wonderful love story.<br/><br/>On the cover of the DVD ""Pride & Prejudice"" it is highlighted that it is ""the best film of the year"". I dare to say that this movie is one of the most delightful romances I have ever seen, and a perfect movie in every aspect. The story is intense, picturing a period of England history with a strong fight of classes and rules of society and people being categorized in different categories, trying to climb to upper classes through marriage. The screenplay is very well written and shows this period in a very consistent way. The direction of Joe Wright is simply stunning, and the long sequence of the ball is one of the most perfect I have ever seen in a movie. The top-notch performance of the cast is amazing, and the gorgeous Keira Knightley has my respects as an excellent actress, and not only a pretty face on the big screen. I am impressed with the exponential progress of the career of this British actress, who was nominated to the Oscar for her performance in the strong character of Lizzie. The Art Direction, Costume Design and Music Score deserved also the nomination to the Oscar. I have just included this movie in the list of my favorite movies ever. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Orgulho e Preconceito"" (""Pride and Prejudice"")"
"pink-feathers","10","7","16","22 September 2005"," A vibrant film, brimming with mischievous energy
","I really didn't think this film could match up to the BBC adaptation, but I was proved resoundingly wrong when I watched it. I was surprised by the amount of detail put into it, and couldn't think of anybody better to play Elizabeth than Keira right now. She had a wonderful propensity to almost always look as though she was on the verge of smiling. The intensity of the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth was incredibly tangible, particularly when they were dancing. Overall, a wonderful, energetic film with few faults - they even handled the cut material very well, so even though I was conscious bits were missing, it didn't detract from the story."

","Just have to say, as a 27 year old bloke i required a bit of arm-twisting to go to see this. Having taken a sabbatical from 'chick flicks' since my last season of seeing a lady. But like the fake-reluctant wedding guest making his way to the dance floor (UK Peter Kay fans know what i mean) i was captivated from the off.<br/><br/>From the opening dreamy shot of sunrise accompanied by the first chords of what is a beautiful classical soundtrack, this is a fine example of wonderful film-making combined with a really big heart.<br/><br/>As most will know this timeless Austen classic is essentially the most plagiarised story modern cinema knows as it provides the framework for every single romantic comedy you've seen.<br/><br/>Despite this there is a freshness about this movie as it teases great humour and warmth from many of the main characters. The director maintains a palpable tension prior to the inevitable 'Happily ever after' despite the certainty of the final destination. The journey before we get there is wonderful.<br/><br/>From the lovable Bingley to the almost 'David Brent' like Mr. Collins there are many laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>For me, and no doubt most blokes who can give their machismo the night off, the funniest elements were seeing every awkward moment you may ever have had the misfortune of encountering first hand right there on the screen before you. From Mr. Collins' totally misguided advances to Bingley and Darcy in a fluster as they struggle to muster the 'L' word.<br/><br/>Naturally Keira Knightly plays a well-pitched Lizzy with just the right amount of independent spirit paired with her unflinching quest for love above all.<br/><br/>As Darcy, Matthew MacFadyen, does rather overdo the brooding, skulky approach, looking positively disinterested with proceedings early on, though the ladies may disagree. He resembles Oscar the Grouch early on and becomes much more the smouldering type as scenes develop.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland is the stand-out performance bringing one of the most convincing portrayals of fatherly love to the screen you will see, and though some will say the ending is cut short it is his love that gives this film it's fitting parting shot.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the ladies are probably going to see this anyway, but fellas, seriously this is a lovely, funny film that will leave you feeling all warm and glowy without the sickly aftertaste of so many of its imitators. The best compliment I can give this film is it made me want to be more romantic and i couldn't even say who with. A lovely film."

"Hotwok2013","3","3","5","3 August 2016"," Jane Austen It Ain't.
","There are so many holes I can pick in this 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's great novel ""Pride & Prejudice"" that I scarcely know where to start. Let's begin with Matthew Macfadyen & Keira Knightly who represent pride & prejudice respectively. Mr. Macfadyen's portrayal of Fitzwilliam Darcy is just awful, in my opinion. His acting is so flat that he manages to make the handsome, proud & haughty nobleman seem so dull & uninteresting that you wonder how any woman could possibly fall in love with him. Keira Knightley does better with her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett but she doesn't seem at all like a middle-class young lady of the Regency period. This isn't entirely Miss Knightley's fault, of course, but more the fault of the production team. If you are going to adapt a novel from the time when Jane Austen lived then you have to give it some accurate historical detail which this production noticeably lacks. Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth's father Mr. Bennett seems completely miscast & Brenda Blethyn as her mother doesn't feel right either. She comes across more like a Dickens character than Jane Austen. Tom Hollander plays the pompous, somewhat comical parson Mr. Collins who proposes to Elizabeth & is rejected. He just doesn't seem anywhere near pompous enough or at all comical as written by Jane Austen. In my opinion only Dame Judy Dench playing Darcy's aunt Lady Catherine De Burgh can take much credit in the acting department. As was quite correctly pointed out by another reviewer the dance where we are first introduced to Mr. Darcy & his friend Mr. Bingley seems much more like a peasant barn dance than a refined regency ball. It would be very interesting to hear Jane Austen's opinion of this production but I bet she would have hated it!. Both the 1980 BBC production with David Rintoul & Elizabeth Garvie and the 1995 effort with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle were done very much better."
"angietravels","1","3","5","21 April 2015"," Positively cringe-worthy indeed!
","How anyone could give this trashy Hollywood production, which completely fails to capture the regency period anything other than a ""1"" rating and thats being generous is hard to believe. Keira Knightly pouts and performs with her chin for most of the movie, looking more like a farmhand than the lower gentry which the Bennett's would have been. If you want to see a true version then check out the 1995 BBC adaption online which captures beautifully every character and Colin Firths magnificent portrayal of Darcy will forever define this classic tale. Frankly I found this absolutely cringe-worthy from beginning to end."

","I'm not a Jane Austin lover. It's simply not my style. However this film, this film changed that. It is simply brilliant. The acting superb, the setting glorious, the costumes elegant and the story transferred well to the screen.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley is not my favourite actress by a long shot, but she is very good in this (apart from a stupid slip up in the last scene where she is far too giggly for my liking). But the real star of this film is Matthew McFadyen. Ladies, he will have you thinking about him as Darcy for weeks after you watch it. He is superb and that is no exaggeration. Simply divine."

I've read all of her novels and certain ones like Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility on more than one occasion. I've also seen the 1995 BBC version.<br/><br/>In fact, I had just finished re-reading P&P directly before seeing this movie for the first time (back when it came out) and I was impressed that a 2 hour movie could do justice to the novel and really incorporate all the important scenes. They did have to cut a few corners, but not much (Wickham is not fleshed out enough - but he isn't in the 6 hour BBC version either). A truly remarkable achievement. <br/><br/>The acting is good and the cinematography gorgeous.

"ackstasis","8","3","5","4 April 2010"," ""Oh, my goodness. Everybody behave naturally""
","I tend to associate such titles as ""Pride and Prejudice"" with stuffy melodrama, but Joe Wright's film is nothing of the sort. Rather than feeling stagnant, the film uses graceful and elaborate long-takes to suggest a sort of omniscient energy, the camera gliding breezily from character to character, watchfully aware of how their interactions are affecting each other's fates and behaviours. Throughout these long- takes, actors skip in and out of the camera's sights, jolting the audience's attention to different layers of the frame. During the ball scene, as the camera presses impatiently against the throngs of advancing ball-goers, I was reminded of Sokurov's 'Russian Ark (2002).' Whereas Wright's follow-up effort 'Atonement (2007)' was somewhat tarnished by a second-act that languished in aimlessless, 'Pride & Prejudice (2005)' benefits from its enduring source material, and Jane Austen's tale of unlikely love is consistently engrossing.<br/><br/>'Pride & Prejudice' could only have worked with a strong cast, and all here do an excellent job. I've never been particularly charmed by Keira Knightley, but here she displays a strong assurance in the leading role. Her Elizabeth has the qualities both of a protagonist and a narrator; she occasionally sports, in passing, a sort of conspirational smirk, as though fully aware of the absurdity of society's customs, but choosing to go along with it. Rosamund Pike, as sister Jane, is an absolute angel, the deserving jewel of the Bennet family. Gruff, surly Matthew Macfadyen is good, though his apparent ""transformation"" into a desirable husband never seemed to flow naturally. Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench, whose work is always appreciated, also contribute with their usual charisma and integrity.<br/><br/>The world of the Bennet family and the surly Mr Darcy (Macfadyen) is one steeped in formality. The characters never quite say what they're thinking or feeling, having to content themselves with hiding behind words and witticisms. In this sense, there's a sort of claustrophobia about their interactions; constrained by the expectations of an uptight society, Elizabeth never really speaks her mind. Recall her altercation with Mr Darcy mid-way through the film, and her seething hatred towards him. Even then, Elizabeth's words are admirably civil, biting but sapped of honest emotion. The film is a parade of nervous giggling, obligatory bows, and forced pleasantries. Additionally, there's something rather grotesque in how desperately Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) basically tries to sell off her daughters to the highest bidder."

","Very good considering the fact that it would be physically impossible to do real justice to what is easily one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time. My biggest complaint was the fact that the director seems to have taken it upon himself to alter the work of the great Jane Austin. The prime example is in the personality of Mrs. Bennet, who in the book is a rather unpleasant, superficial sort of woman and who in the movie (while keeping with the original personality for much of the film) is given several moments in which she comes off as a down to earth and overall entirely tolerable sort of person. I would have preferred that in this and several other aspects the director had stayed true to the original work."

","I saw this film only few weeks ago and fell in love with it, though I've got some objections to the ending (and even greater to the alternative US ending) which I consider too sweet....Compared to the 1995 miniseries Mr Darcy melts too easily :-)Though both Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen did a great job (especially Matthew must have touched every women's heart I guess:-)) I would say that some changes made were a bit misleading - I mean for example Mary, whose character seems to be much more prim in the original or Mr Collins, who I considered more spiteful (in the book and in the 1995 version) than he was in the 2005 movie. Anyway, as a whole the film is greatly pleasant way of escaping the severe reality of our time:-)and as far as the DVD, I highly appreciate the bonuses which give a even better insight of the Austen's times.

"FilmSnobby","5","3","5","30 April 2006"," Oh, why not.
","Hm. THIS is what we've been missing, right? Another cinematic adaptation of a Jane Austen novel! And, by all means, let's adapt Austen's most obscure, least-read work: ""Pride and Prejudice""! <br/><br/>Let's face it, Joe Wright's film has a lot going against it from the outset. I couldn't rouse myself to go see it when it was in theaters last year: the prospect of being utterly bored (ANOTHER Austen adaptation?) certainly encouraged the notion that I could wait to see it on a rainy afternoon at home. And the actual execution of the film hasn't entirely dispelled the boredom, as this material is so well-worn that you could almost recite it in your sleep. The cinephile can only think back with gratitude to the example set by Stanley Kubrick, who, after realizing that he couldn't get enough financing to make the film about Napoleon that he had wanted to make, turned to an almost-forgotten novel, ""Barry Lyndon"", by Thackeray. There are scores of 18th- and 19th century novelists whose works we've never read. Filmmakers: surprise us, for God's sake! <br/><br/>The good news is, Wright & Co. DO surprise us by making an adequately entertaining movie, despite the long odds. Much of the film's success has to do with Austen herself: stick with her (meaning, her themes, her interpretations of her characters, her narrative) and you'll be all right. Screenwriter Deborah Moggach pulls off a marvel of ruthless synthesis with her script. You feel that nothing is really left out; the highest points in the story are raised and illustrated with care, even if the richness of the details must perforce be excised. We're also grateful that Wright, Moggach, and their editors stick to their guns in terms of brevity. The fact is, a 3-hour movie would still be too short, and those rich details would still need to be cut -- therefore, it's eminently sensible that the filmmakers keep the length to just over 2 hours. The only plot element that seems to suffer from this otherwise praiseworthy effort of getting to the point is Elizabeth's flirtation with Wickham. Even if Wickham was always just a tool to get Lizzy's mind off of Darcy, he needs to be a bigger tool than what's evident in the five minutes of screen time the character is afforded here. In other words, he needs to be a real romantic possibility for Lizzy, and his lies about Darcy need to be deeply believed by not just her, but by us, as well. (Austen was a wicked plotter!) The romantic suspense gets lost, to say nothing of Austen's commentary on the predatory social climbers of her time.<br/><br/>All that remains are the performances. Matthew Macfadyen doesn't convince as a proud young grandee. He's morose enough, I suppose, but is also too clearly love-struck to fool Lizzy (and us) about his character and motives. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet seems too sloppy and too amiable: we never get the sense of deeply-felt irritation which is at the root of Mr. Bennet's sardonic witticisms. Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins affords a pleasant surprise, investing this character -- too often hammed-up as a slimy buffoon -- with a fussy little dignity and even a certain amount of decency. (Austen had always implied that if he was good enough for Ms. Lucas, then surely WE can tolerate him.) And two of Great Britain's grandest actresses, Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench as Mrs. Bennet and The Lady Catherine De Bourg respectively, are so well-suited for their roles as to render pointless any discussion of their portrayals: they're both perfect, obviously.<br/><br/>The revelation here, what makes this movie ultimately worth watching, is Keira Knightley in the lead role. Let it be said at once that a Star is born. Ms. Knightley displays a screen magnetism that heretofore had only been hinted at, for one thing; for another, she provides her interpretation with just the right admixture of tenderness, intelligence, and steel. Is she too young for the part? Actually, no: Elizabeth is 22 in the novel, as I recall; Knightley was about 20 during filming. (Her tender age makes her performance all the impressive!) Critics have complained about her girlishness, the giggling, and so on, but I for one thought that Jennifer Ehle from what women the world over call the ""Colin Firth Mini-Series"" produced by A&E came across too often as an experienced wife of a dozen years with children playing in the backyard. Knightley is far more plausible as an inexperienced young woman just past 20 who is nonetheless smart enough and tough enough to withstand the interrogations of the fearsome Lady Catherine. It IS possible for one of literature's greatest feminist characters to be YOUNG, just as Austen wrote her.<br/><br/>5 stars out of 10."
"train464","10","3","5","25 April 2006"," A fascinating story, retold as good as it can be.
","I preferred this version more than previous versions. Any of them have handled the story beautifully, but this latest version has several things going for it. First, Keira Knightley is somewhat better as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen is a wonderful, brooding Darcy. Donald Sutherland gives a solid performance, but not quite as sarcastic as Benjamin Whitrow in the previous version as Mr. Bennet. I found Alison Steadman's Mrs. Bennet (previous version) too annoying, but Brenda Blethyn in this version is just right. The other sisters are a toss-up; the pluses and minuses average out. This new version has beautiful scenery. I thought some of the directorial decisions in presenting the thoughts of the characters was extremely well done. During the dance scene with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, for example, they begin in the crowded ballroom (the place is really jammed!) and as they dance the camera comes to take in only Elizabeth and Darcy. If you weren't alert you might think they had slipped away, outside perhaps, and were dancing alone. Then we see the end of the dance and there they are, in the crowd. It startled me at the time, but it quickly penetrated what was being ""told"" in the story. Touches like this were scattered throughout the film, and I liked it. Joe Wright gets the credit for directing this beautiful film. If you loved the book or have seen any other screen version of it, be sure to see this one. It will stand out among all the others."

Mathew McFadden was brilliant as Mr Darcy. I would have liked to see him in more scenes. He is a very talented actor. Knightley was very good in the role as Elizabeth, but her costumes were a bit drab most of the time. Judie Dench was brilliant as she always is. Donald Sunderland was excellent. The locations are beautiful and the music. Tom Hollander was great as Mr Collins. He brought humour to the roll. I have watched the movie five times and I will watch it again. Great stuff."

There could not be a more pure and beautiful love story anywhere. Watching this, the story wraps its arms around you and carries you away into a place, time, and story that could not be more perfect.<br/><br/>For anyone who enjoyed either the novel, the A&E mini-series, or both, this movie is pure bliss. The casting could not be more suited to Austen's characters and the setting is simply divine."
"atya107","10","3","5","17 April 2006"," An amazing book adapted to an amazing movie!
","I just got my copy of the DVD on the 14th of April and have watched it twice already. This film is excellent considering the fact that there were only two hours to fit everything in and yet the movie didn't fell rushed. The entire cast shined particularly Matthew Macfayden and Keira Knightley as the leads. MM lent a certain boyishness to Mr Darcy and was in a class of his own while Keira Knightley took the spirited , lively Elizabeth to the next level. Jena Malone and Brenda Blethyn were especially refreshing and a pleasure to watch. Rosamund Pike lived up to her name and certainly looked like a blooming rose as her Jane was very fresh and innocent.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright has done a marvelous job in bringing this amazing story to the big screen after the never to be forgotten A and E version.Of course it will be compared a lot to that one but I feel that both are special in their own unique way and should be watched with two completely different frames of mind. Do give yourself the pleasure of watching this and you will not regret it!"
"rlh8947","10","3","5","10 April 2006"," Excellent!
","While the movie took some liberties and didn't follow the book exactly, it conveyed the love story with all the heart, passion, and confusion it deserved. If you have read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, you will greatly appreciate Knightley's Elizabeth: she captures the youthfulness and playfulness of Elizabeth much more than Jennifer Ehle's portrayal in the much beloved 1995 miniseries. And while many still consider Colin Firth the greatest Darcy to ever appear on screen, I would choose McFayden over Firth to play Darcy any day. McFayden's Darcy is more believable because we see his vulnerability, we understand how Elizabeth misunderstands him. Firth is handsome and can stare and frown with the best of them, but McFayden brings life into Darcy, and although you have to wait almost 2 hours for it, the definitive moment in his portrayal is his smile: it is incredibly cute and sincere, and it lets the audience see his softer side. Firth's Darcy never did. I have read the book approximately 13 times, so I feel I have a good viewpoint from which to critique the movie, and although there are certain scenes which I wish had been filmed in closer conjunction with the text, overall, this version brings to life Jane Austen's best work in outstanding fashion. Everyone should see this movie!"
"mngo-1","10","3","5","4 April 2006"," Does justice to the book
","I rented this movie a few days ago rather tentatively. I enjoy a genuine romance occasionally but today's standards of 'romance' are typically sappy chick flicks with mindless cliché plots and poor attempts at acting. Having read Pride and Prejudice in high school and loving Jane Austen's many other works I was afraid the new remake would be another disappointment. I must admit that I tried watching the BBC miniseries and was not captivated enough to finish so I had no true desire to see another remake of the film. This one however was a beautiful adaptation that keep the essence of the period, its tongue-in-cheek humour and captured the genuine 'romance' factor of the film in a very well done (cheese-free) storyline that kept me interested throughout and left me quite satisfied at the end. The ultimate period free good film that one can rewatch over and over.<br/><br/>The casting was brilliant and exactly how I had pictured them to look while reading the book. Knightley was a surprisingly believable Lizzie who captured the character's temperament and energy to perfection. Even Pike's subtle portrayal of the mild mannered Jane was brilliant. On need s to take the time to rewatch the movie like I did, to catch all the facial expressions and witty sidecomments.<br/><br/>Now, I know there are people who can't help but judge this movie by the popular BBC version and the inevitable Darcy comparison. I for my part preferred the Macfadyen version because he was how i pictured Darcy in the book. Many seem to think that his was not prideful enough in his portrayal- however I've always believe that Darcy was seen as arrogant due to the social awkwardness and his affluent upbringing. Lizzie embodied pride (b/c she could forgive him for wounding her vanity upon their first meeting) while he was prejudice (due to his view of the inferiority of her circumstances) Overall, unlike the BBC version I found myself completely captivated by this film and fully immersed in its story."

The ensemble of this film should be very proud as well, because every scene was cohesive and masterfully acted. Keira Knightley should win the Oscar for this film, her performance was one of the best of the year for any female in film. I loved the dialogue, it stayed very true to the spirit of Austen. Having read this book twice and being very familiar with 18th century literature, I was impressed at how closely Knightley resembles Austen's Lizzie. Really, this movie was wonderfully I only wish there were more done like it."

","I was having one of those days where I was just fed up with everything. So I left work early, and into the quiet recesses of a darkened movie theatre to watch Pride and Prejudice, a movie that is so luminous in its every frame. Keira Knightley is perfectly cast as the assertive Lizzy Bennett, her every movement so full of expression and subtlety, you find yourself captivated by her. The contents of the plot was not known to before I saw it, nor did I have any knowledge of the kinds of books Jane Austin had written. I went into this movie with a clean slate and left feeling so full of inspiration. Even though it all feels very dated (and of course this is a period piece) the feelings between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are very real and moving."

","The director, the actors, the cinematographer and the production design people -- and of course the screenwriter -- are to be commended for a wonderful movie. It was wonderful in many regards, and with all the baggage of being yet another version of what Jennifer Ehle starred in not too terribly long ago, probably the two most important *technical* elements were the very realistic reflection of how life was at the time, and the very modern and unstagey cinematography. Of course, the acting was great and save for my marriage and my age, I'd propose myself to Keira. Brenda Blethyn did, of course, do an outstanding job of characterization, as did Judi Dench, and all the other actors, including the male leads. All more than ably directed. (Anybody notice how ""ridiculous"" -- Elizabeth's words -- Mr. Collins looked like Paul Simon a while ago?)<br/><br/>I applauded and said ""Bravo"" at the end of the film."
"phillipstephenso","10","3","5","25 December 2005"," Love and Misunderstanding
","Jane Austen would probably agree that a gentle and loving mate is the crowning achievement of every human, whatever the epoch. Austen views from her perch in 1797 the ageless mating dance of our own peculiar species. Elizabeth is one of five young eligible daughters of the Bennett family, possessing only a modest fortune and income. They live in the countryside of England while geese and pigs tramp around the house. Darcy is a wealthy visitor who becomes smitten with Elizabeth. Meanwhile, misunderstandings are accumulated. The ability to correct misunderstandings enables the mating dance to end the prejudice and then the pride. However, this does not begin to fully describe the depth of emotions in this story. Filial devotion, fatherly solicitude, motherly hopes and fears, the concept of duty, the custom of arranged marriage, the loyalty of friendship and family, the discreet reticence and resulting incoherence of the age are described beautifully. Finally, the gentle love of a man smitten with a woman is the joyful climax. The courtly language and manners of the film reflect well the setting and habits of that unique period."
"leppakt","10","3","5","17 December 2005"," Joyfully magnetic
","First and foremost I was inspired by the wondrous cinematography. I love the movement of the camera in and out of the wondrous ball attendees. The wide scenic shots were magical. <br/><br/>And, secondly Keira Knightly glows radiantly in a first class performance. I would question however it's nomination for a golden globe in the comedy/musical classification. The comedy is more subtle than one might expect for such a nomination - I think of it as more of a drama with an occasional laugh. <br/><br/>As a drama it is definitely deserving of recognition for award nominations though. <br/><br/>A ton of great performances, and engaging story.

"SFexpat","9","3","5","16 December 2005"," Great Movie
","I think this is a great movie and many performances exceed the 95 version. Austen is renowned for her subtleties; too many modern actors over play her characters. Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett were over done in 95. Tom Hollander's Mr. Collin's is perfection, nicely elucidating his idiosyncrasies without overemphasising them. Likewise Brenda Blethyn. Too many web reviews of this movie exhibit prejudice towards Matthew Macfadyen. His performance is masterful in its subtlety. In the beginning we over look Darcy as we all did the first time we read the book. Yet as Elizabeth gets to know him, and we with her, he changes in the audiences eyes. Too many actors (Firth included) over emphasise Darcy's pride in the initial stages focusing our attention solely on it. In contrast, Macfadyen's Darcy is more complex and nuanced. Darcy's pride is there but it does not overwhelm the performance.The first proposal scene is very passionate and better than the 95 version (although in the beginning Macfadyen over acts by talking too quickly.) Keira brings a liveliness and youthfulness that is necessary for the role. Her eyes shine of there own accord making remarks on them unnecessary. However the script should have included Lizzy's defence of Darcy upon her mother's misinterpretation of his comments on the different level of society in the country. This is our first glimpse of lizzy's changing feelings towards Darcy and necessary to the plot. The script exploits Austen's humour; Austen purists should re- watch 95 and note marked departures from the book. Austen's novels should be redone every decade to give each generation its own interpretation."

","I was hesitant to see this movie at first...being a died-in-the-wool Colin Firth fan. I was convinced that the mini-series was ""the final incarnation"" of Pride and Prejudice....I was wrong. This film is beautiful in all aspects: cinematography, acting and story. It humanizes the characters and livens things up with the acting, writing, costumes and sets. It was a breath of fresh air for a classic story! I was surprised by Kiera Knightly performance. She had big shoes to fill and was excellent. It was difficult going in to think of anyone other than Colin Firth portraying Darcy, but Matthew MacFayden did an amazing job! The acting was top notch across the board.

","I really enjoyed the setting, costumes and actors in this film. The fact that the setting did not seem contrived added to the believability of the film. The atmosphere and landscape were wonderfully captured by the photographer. I admit the lower rating I gave to the film was due to the occasional confusion that took place trying to figure out which of the many characters were being discussed. If the length of the film would have allowed, I would have preferred a slightly longer film in order to fully develop the characters. The occasional tension between some of the characters seemed too short to be believable. Some of the film's outcome was predictable. Perhaps if I had not seen the original film, my criticism would be less."
"aimless-46","10","3","5","30 November 2005"," Why I Think Jane Would Have Approved
","It is my sincere wish that Jane Austen readers and non-readers not miss a big screen viewing of Joe Wright's ""Pride & Prejudice"" because they let themselves be influenced by negative comments from the Ellen Jamesian sect of the Jane Austen society. Particularly odious are those presumptuous enough to declare that Austen herself would consider the film a disservice. Attempting to discourage potential viewers in this manner reveals not just a staggering conceit, but an utter cluelessness about how to read a film and about the power of a visual medium.<br/><br/>This film adaptation of Austen's classic is the first one to fully capture its essence within the economical and efficient package of a two-hour feature film. And it does so in a technically proficient way (cinematography-production design-editing); with perfect physical casting, excellent directing and scene staging, and fine performances from the entire ensemble. In isolation it is simply the best film ever made, but because it is not an original screenplay the critics have downgraded it a bit from A plus to A minus (their acknowledgment of the debt it owns to Austen).<br/><br/>Jane Austen once said, ""an artist cannot do anything slovenly"". Joe Wright's film is not perfect but it is the least slovenly in cinema history. I was reminded of this by the film's treatment of Georgiana, Darcy's sister. Georgiana was a minor but extremely important character in the book. Elizabeth's point of view observations of Darcy's tender treatment of his shy little sister is how Austen shows Elizabeth's first realization that Darcy is worthy of her love. Initially I was disappointed that Georgiana only has two brief appearances in the film, but on reflection I realized that the scenes had been staged and scripted so well that they said everything needed about the relationship dynamics of the three characters.<br/><br/>The film successfully brings Austen's ironic (insert comic here) observations of character and manners to the screen. As the title proclaims, this story has a double theme, the pride of the aristocrat prejudicing the middle class heroine against him. But as Elizabeth explains to her father in my favorite scene, she and Darcy are the flip sides of each other as her pride has long blinded her to Darcy's efforts to overcome the prejudice of his class to hers.<br/><br/>The film also captures the more critical macro element of Austen's novel, the idea of a generous humanness that can transcend the motivations of social class. Society is imperfect and while the social order encourages foolish prides and mean prejudices, it also enables kindness, affection, and courage. In the film's movement of events there is a modulation between vices and virtues in which the latter more than mitigates the former. This was Jane Austen's primary ""value"" and what I think would have formed the basis of her judgment and ultimate approval of the film.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"saintly_lolly_pop","9","3","5","27 November 2005"," Stunning...you must see it
","I loved, absolutely LOVED this film. I love the book as well, which doesn't hurt.<br/><br/>OK, so the look of the film is beautiful. The lighting, colour choice, art direction, all superb. I had a special link to the film in that I've been to the manor house that they use to be Pemberly and met the owner (Chatsworth House and the Duchess of Devonshire). The rooms they showed are in the house, even the sculpture room, though the bust of Darcy is a new addition (lol).<br/><br/>I enjoyed how they made Elizabeth's beauty stand out, but not to overshadow her supposedly much more beautiful sister, by using drab colours (browns, dull greens). She looks earthly, like a wood nymph. I have always been a fan of Kiera's since I first saw her in The Hole and then in Bend It Like Beckham. Some of the scenes she played were wonderful...near the end when she is heartbroken over Darcy and runs upstairs to be alone and cry, and the end when she asks her father to allow her to marry him.<br/><br/>On to Darcy...no, I haven't seen the 1995 miniseries. I have however, like much of the world, seen clips of Firth emerging out of the pond, wet. I love Firth as much as the next girl, but I adore Matthew MacFadyen. I've watched him in the show Spooks (MI-5 to Americans on BBC America) and loved him then. It's nice to see him take on something different. Yes, I admit, he does seem a bit cold, but that's Darcy. He has his guard up. And there are scenes, obvious scenes, where you can see that he is struggling, that he has feelings (the close-up of his hand twitching after he helps Lizzy onto the coach, when he joins her in the cottage to try to ""practice"" with small talk). My two favourite scenes were when he emerged out of the mist (for quite obvious reasons...I think it's the sexiest thing I've witnessed on celluloid) and when he and his sister are speaking to Lizzy and her family at Pemberly. We get a glimpse of his softer side when his sister runs up and jumps into his arms, and he swings her around. But my heart skipped a beat when we see him smile. After the dozens of minutes of him barely opening his mouth, he smiles, and there is a warmth there not seen before, and gentleness. It is that that makes him irresistible.<br/><br/>Sutherland is great. He subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) gives a very good comedic performance, as well as Mr. Collins, and Mrs. Bennett. I didn't care for Mr. Bingley. I think they did him a great injustice. He is portrayed as a bumbling idiot, which he is not. Yes, he obviously loves Jane, but there is no need to make him out to be a simpleton.<br/><br/>Besides Bingley, the only other thing I can really think of that I didn't like was some of the camera work. In the end when Elizabeth is speaking with her father, the camera is incredibly jerky. Instead of smoothly zooming on, it jerks forward, then back, forward then back, over and over. It completely broke through my suspension of disbelief. Before that I had been engrossed, almost as if I were there myself, then I was suddenly thrust back into this century without giving my consent. But, BRAVO to Joe Wright. His first feature film, and what an excellent way to do it. I shall follow his career and hope that though he has set the bar so high, he can easily remain up there in the ether."

","Some people are talking about how this movie can't be amazing because it is only two hours. They are completely wrong. My friends and I went to go see it and we were still talking about it an hour later. This is the movie for any hopeless romantic. The whole movie is romantic. You will leave wanting to fall in love. This is a feeling that is not common anymore, because of divorce, infidelity, and abusive relationships. The movie takes you on a ride that you don't want to leave when it is done. I love the previous versions of this story, but this one is also amazing. Everyone of them is different, but that makes them so much more interesting. Would you want to watch a film that was just like the last version of the film? This is a timeless story and watching two people fall in love on a big screen is amazing. This isn't a action film with love on the side. Or a romantic comedy that is so sappy. This is a romantic film. I would suggest grabbing all of your girlfriends and watching this movie. I do not think that there was a single girl in the entire theater that did not enjoy the movie. Leave men to go watch an action movie and get down to your heart as a woman and fall in love."

Reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn with the acting chops of Katherine Hepburn - Ms. Knightley more than carries this 2 hour movie - she takes the reins in her teeth and rides with it. Supported by an excellent supporting cast including Judi Dench, Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Tom Hollander - all are worthy of Oscar nominations. It's been a long time since Albert Finney did the same feat in Tom Jones - where a period piece actually comes alive before your eyes. And the direction, photography and sets are all first rate. Much has been made of the leading man Mathew MacFadyan a relative unknown and he has been unfairly compared to Lawrence Olivier and Colin Firth. But I think with further viewings purists will come to accept his Darcy as very good. Expect this move to be in everyone's Top Ten lists of 2005"
"evanston_dad","9","3","5","14 November 2005"," Leave Your Expectations at the Door and Just Have Fun
","Let's get this out of the way: this is not the A&E 5-hour version of Jane Austen's novel. This movie does not star Colin Firth. This version takes greater liberty with the Austen book than does the A&E version.<br/><br/>Good, I'm glad that's behind us. Now just sit back and enjoy what happens to be a stellar film. Of course this version is a less literal adaptation, but it doesn't have the luxury of being 5 hours long. And there is much about this version that I thought was actually better than the A&E version. For example, this version is much more cinematic and never more so than at the astoundingly filmed ball scenes, when the camera takes off swooping and swirling around the actors in some of the most complexly choreographed shots I've ever seen. Keira Knightly and Matthew Mcfadyen seem more right for the roles than did Jennifer Ehle and Firth; they're at least closer to the age of the characters as depicted in Austen's book. Brenda Blethyn improves on the character of Mrs. Bennett, turning her into a real human character rather than a broad caricature. And Judi Dench has a ball storming on to the screen in a couple of scenes and decimating everyone in her path.<br/><br/>This film is for people who already know the book and Austen's characters. It's a very fresh and exciting telling of a very familiar story---who really needs yet one more ploddingly faithful movie that dares not deviate at all from the novel? We already have a faithful adaptation that's not going away just because this movie came out, and the book is always there to reread if you need your fix of unadulterated Austen. All I can say is, I was in an audience full of obvious ""Pride & Prejudice"" junkies, and they were on the edges of their seats through the entire length of this film. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Get ready guys, the theater will be filled with fantastical women. The Cinderella story has always fascinated (tortured is probably more accurate) woman who think the handsome, rich prince will rescue them by falling in love at a glance and begging them to live in his giant castle. This is so much more romantic and efficient than actually getting to know someone! That said, Jane Austen was a master of creating the love story. Her dialog was light years ahead of its time. First, lovers of her books must understand that you will probably be disappointed by comparing the book to the movie. Two hours is a short time to cram in the details of subtlety of Ms. Austen's writing. Secondly, casting is key and this film surprises.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley was selected (amidst protests from dedicates of the novel). Many know Knightley from her breakout role in ""Bend it like Beckham"" and the few of us who saw her in this years' ""Domino"" couldn't help be surprised at her ability to handle the demanding role of Miss Elizabeth Bennett. No question, she has the eyes and smile to handle the first half of the film, but her effectiveness for the second half could be debated.<br/><br/>Relative unknown actor (at least in the U.S.) Matthew MacFadyen wins the lottery with his casting as Mr. Darcy. MM has the necessary ability to stand tall and not smile. He fails a bit in the romantic moments, but most women-viewers will have swallowed the hook and will not even notice.<br/><br/>Screen veterans Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland (not really a Brit) are fine in their paternal roles and it is always nice to see the underused Jena Malone - even when cast as the slightly off center sister. And of course, no actor spews venom with the fierceness of Dame Judy Densch.<br/><br/>Not sure how Joe Wright was selected for the director spot on this film, but he does an admirable job of filming the beauty of the countryside and capturing the pageantry of the parties. Those not familiar with the times, may be a bit surprised at the lack of color in the clothes, but Mr. Wright went for accuracy.<br/><br/>Screen film versions of classical works will always disappoint those seeking perfection, but this one will definitely please the casual viewer and reader."
"chdach","Null","9","23","21 April 2008"," The un-Austen Pride and Prejudice
","I can't give this movie any more than a 1- it's bad enough to be considered a parody. It follows the basic plot of Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but in such a way that Austen's rich characterizations are regrettably flattened, her humor cheapened, and her wonderful dialogue ""updated"" so that it is easily understood by a modern audience fed on the romance genre's most overused clichés. Missing are the satire of Austen's novel and the psychological depth of her characters. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth bears little resemblance to Austen's, acting more like a spoiled teen than a thoughtful woman. In fact, the movie seems aimed at young girls in its celebration of sass and modern idiotic notions of girl-power as feminism. Generally, the tone of the movie is romantically overwrought, and employs romantic conventions that Austen herself mocked. But even if you've never read Austen, or if you can try to judge the movie on its own merits (as I did, after realizing the filmmakers took major liberties with Austen's story), you will probably be disappointed by the terrible acting, from Keira Knightley in particular. Her scenes with Matthew MacFayden's Darcy are belabored and laughable attempts at conveying an undeniable passion.<br/><br/>I suppose that to a person who's never read the book or who cares little for faithfulness to the source, the movie could pass for good romantic escapism (so long as you can abide the cheesy dialogue and bad acting). But if you're past your preteen years, not a huge fan of romantic Hollywood clichés, and if you believe Austen deserves any measure of respect from filmmakers, you'll most likely be sorry you saw this movie."

This movie would not give you the least idea of the richness and elegance and sheer enjoyment of the novel. I am sooooooo glad I didn't spend money to see this at the cinema thanks to reviews on this web site!!! Out of curiosity I did rent it (much cheaper). It was awful in my opinion. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was merely the worst of the casting of this film. The dialog was totally ""valley girl"" and hardly true to the period. That aspect was quite nauseating. The dialog between the characters was boring and so artificial. The was nothing to please the ear or the eye in this one for me."
"alfa-16","Null","7","17","21 September 2005"," Four weddings and the funeral of common sense
","P&P is often compared to a Swiss watch and very few novels are this intricately woven together. There are numerous love stories, successful and unsuccessful fortune hunters of both sexes, embarrassing and wilful parents each impinging one on another, each bringing the two principle lovers, Elizabeth and Darcy closer together or driving them further apart. At the beginning characters are grouped according to their fortunes and status. By the end of the novel, they have rearranged themselves according to sense, ability and intelligence.<br/><br/>If you take the screws out of a mechanism this complex, you will never get it back together again. Andrew Davies, in the 1995 version, had six hours of screen time and left them where they were. He was neither required to cut essential characters, or miss out essential plot items. The downside of putting so much of Austen's dialogue on screen is that his own attempts, such as the scenes at the inn at Lambton and Pemberley stick out unattractively from Austen's crisp satirical work and sometimes, especially when he trying for irony, his script work can look positively crude.<br/><br/>Attempting to be true to the principle character, however, in two hours has here entailed throwing away vital bits of the Swiss watch. Wickham is there, briefly, and so is Lydia. The Gardiners are almost out, the Hursts are gone completely. There isn't time for Darcy's letter, the express from London and Mrs Gardiner's letter explaining Darcy's discovery of Lydia isn't necessary because it's not clear what Darcy has done to help.<br/><br/>And why would he need to do anything? What could scandal mean to a family living as the Bennets do in this version? I appreciate the need for a different look to the 1995 version but putting the Bennett's into a house that looks like a pigsty from a much earlier age is the real problem with this version for me.<br/><br/>The comedy of class and manners is destroyed by degrading the life of the Bennets to the sort of sub-gentility that might have been appropriate to an adaptation of Tom Jones or even Moll Flanders but is ridiculous for the family of a wealthy country attorney. In the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, daughter of a middle class gentleman marries someone from the upper middle class with dubiously aristocratic connections. In this version, the daughter of a family about to fall into extreme poverty marries a belted Earl (Pemberley is Chatsworth here - one of the largest stately homes in England - definitely NOT where the Darcy's would be living). The Bennett's home would have been large, clean, genteel, separated from the farm and well run. The Gardiners, would have had half a floor to themselves in the Inn at Lambton and would never have dreamt of dining with the drunken regulars. The pantomime with the letter in the inn is inexcusable. The characters pop in and out of shot like Bill and Ben.<br/><br/>Since the the comedy of class and manners is tossed away, you're left with the performances. These are patchy and condemn the whole to disintegration. <br/><br/>Elizabeth is justabout OK but the other characters don't take off. Brenda Blethyn, excellent as usual but criminally underused and playing someone other than Mrs Bennet. Matthew McFadyen got the message and didn't try to be Colin Firth but forget to be Darcy. Donald Sutherland, accent all over the place and where was the sardonic cynicism? Judi Dench didn't have enough time. Jena Malone as Lydia couldn't be outrageous enough for who would look unusual or out of place in that household?<br/><br/>On the whole, a version that might not go down as the worst ever, even if it can't possibly be used by students.<br/><br/>Belongs on the shelf next to the Patricia Rozema Mansfield Park. Complete and utter failure as an adaptation but watchable on a Sunday afternoon if you can put the original aside."

This makes the 95' version seem a bit too ""pretty"" and clean cut. The romance was better shown in this version as well with the first engagement scene showing how well Darcy related to Elizabeth.

The trailer is a trailer not a resume of the movie.Ttake it from me it does not do justice to the complete production.<br/><br/>I went to see this film as a sceptic. Like many others I thought that the essence of the novel could not be condensed into 2 hours and that Kiera Knightley was a bad choice for the central role. Luckily I did not go to see it with any 1995 TV miniseries baggage. I always thought that that adaptation was far from perfect.<br/><br/>The director and writers did a fine job in getting the essence of the story into the time available. Yes a lot is cut out, inevitably, and there are some changes to important parts of the plot but the film structure means that the essence is there. The cinematography is fantastic and, I have to admit, Kiera Knightley comes of age as an actress. Particularly good also was Rosamund Pike as Jane.<br/><br/>One major gripe. Why give the US and Canada a film 8 minutes longer with a superior ending. Do the producers think we Europeans have a shorter attention span? I feel quite cheated by this decision."

The movie transports you to a time and place where you feel the moods and care about the characters. Beautiful scenery, emotive music, great architecture and excellent acting made for thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. Keira Knightley, perfect for the role, transparently illuminates her thoughts and emotions. Others in the cast fit their parts well, except for Donald Sutherland's pearly white teeth, an intrusion of this century into the 18th, which the film otherwise believably transports us into. Great scenes include the dance hall sequences, the proposals, and Judi Dench's nighttime visit. The final scene, however, seemed unnecessary. After seeing the movie, I watched the five-hour television series and read the four hundred page book. What's clear is that more can be shown in five hours than two and a book is a different experience than a film.

","In the 2005 edition of this timeless tale of hate and love, Keira Knightley shines. She portrays Elizabeth Bennet with the right amount of balance, giving some and taking some in each scene. She was well deserving of her Oscar nomination. It is by far her best performance. Other characters, such as Dame Judi Dench in her subtly cruel role as Lady Catherine de Bourg and the cute Jena Malone as melodramatic, hopeless romantic Lydia Bennet also pull off their parts well. I can't bash any of the acting in this movie.<br/><br/>I was in bed with pneumonia when I first saw it, therefore I got a little lost in between plot and language, but I rented it again. Right then and there, it shot up to, if not close to, my top ten favorite movies list. It is a must see for everyone, whether you are a fan of romance or not. You will be completely immersed in its beauty as well as the sharp and crisp language.<br/><br/>I know there has been some heated IMDb debate about what version of Pride and Prejudice is best. I have not seen the older versions, so I cannot speak from that standpoint. But please, if you are wary about renting it because it may not compare to your favorite P&P, don't listen to your conscience. It is totally worth the 2 hrs, 5 min spent watching."
"einezcrespo","9","4","8","20 June 2007"," This version is not all that bad!
","I have to admit I never saw the BBC series so I don't know why the critics are harsh. I liked the film. OK so it doesn't have Colin Firth and that Matthew MacFadyen looked ""nerdy,"" to the eyes of the fans of the BBC version but I loved the interaction between him and Keira Knightly. His Mr Darcy and Miss Elizabeth has attraction written allover. Both Knightly and MacFadyen are great. Her Elizabeth embodied the spirit of an independent mind who brought out Mr. Darcy from his dour prudishness to a passionate though still reserved but attractive man. Another couple who had great chemistry is Donald Sutherland as the patient and harassed Mr.Bennet and Brenda Blethyn as eternal nagging wife Mrs. Bennet. Despite appearances these two showed their characters love each and tolerate whatever imperfections they may have. Rosamund Pike is ethereal as Jane while Jenna Malone nailed the irresponsibly spoiled Lydia while Tom Hollander is perfect as the pompous Mr. Collins. I wasn't too keen with Simon Woods as Mr Bingley. He really looked like the nerd here but one can feel the earnestness he brings to his character's apology when Bigley confesses to Jane of his love for her. Dame Judi Dench's bit role as the imperious Lady de Bourgh reminds me too much of her Queen Elizabeth I turn in Shakespeare in Love. One can't help but feel she is in danger of being typecast. This movie may split Austen fans but it is worth watching even for curiosity's sake."

","For a year this DVD was sitting idly on the shelf as I had not come around to watch it. For someone who has fast forwarded through the book and has not been able to sit through the '95 mini series, this didn't seem so tempting.<br/><br/>But I have to say that brevity and taste in adaptation of the book for the sake of a movie has played a strong role in making it appealing to the impatient audience of the 21st century. Furthermore, acting and selection of the characters has outdone anything that I could have had in mind. Beautiful cinematography suited for a hate/love story, marvelous sets and costumes, also great editing has made it even more rewarding. It also boasts a great score and I can't help but say that this movie did bewitch me body and soul... to the degree of watching it three times already in the past few days. I never thought that one day I'd be obsessed with Pride & Prejudice. Amazing!"

","I did not think the BBC's 2005 serialization could be surpassed but it turns out I was wrong! This is a superlative adaptation - surely one of the best movies of its type to have come out in recent years. The acting is uniformly brilliant. Matthew MacFayden and Keira Knightley, in the lead roles, both show dimensions I hadn't thought they possessed, and the supporting cast is a veritable galaxy of top talent: Judi Dench a splendidly haughty Lady Catherine, Donald Sutherland a pleasingly shambolic, kindly, wise Mr Bennet; Brenda Blethyn agonisingly vulgar as his wife; Kelly Reily really excellent as the arrogant Caroline Bingley; and a lovely cameo from Tom Hollander as the ghastly Mr Collins. Above all, though, Miss Knightley makes an intelligent and luminous Lizzie, and fully deserved her Oscar nomination. Elsewhere, Deborah Mogach's screenplay manages to preserve and convey as much of the book's greatness, in the time allotted, as is possible; Joe Knightley's direction is faultless; the cinematography breathtaking - a tribute to the beauty and charm of England's countryside and architecture. There is a shot of Miss Knightley atop a rock in Derbyshire that made me catch my breath. I have watched this movie three times, and each time, as D'Arcy strode towards Lizzie through the mist at the end, the tears streamed down my face! A must see."

"gordonm888","10","4","8","29 May 2006"," Like Darcy: a rough-edged movie to love forever
","First things first. Keira Knightly is brilliant. She is in almost every scene, not always at the center of the scene, sometimes as part of a crowd, but she lights up every scene she is in. She is beautiful and winning, and in-turn fun-loving, sarcastic, giggly, confrontational, concerned -a virtuoso performance. The character of Elizabeth is a role to die for, and Knightly knows it - but she steps up to it and becomes the definitive Elizabeth for a generation of movie-goers.<br/><br/>The Bennett family comes across as a real family - the interactions between the daughters is rarely the focus of the action, but its always present and creates a believable context for the story.<br/><br/>And the movie is beautiful -from its rural scenes to its manors to its landscapes, it lavishly, almost indulgently, shows a place and a time.<br/><br/>And the camera-work! Watch as the action at a party proceeds without any cuts - the camera backs out of a room follows other action, enters another room. Its not only breath-taking (was anyone else reminded of Hitchcock and Rope?) but it pulls the audience into the scenes, shows the physical size and layouts of the rooms, and the relational frenzy of the party.<br/><br/>But the bottom line for me was that this Pride and Prejudice has great emotional power -while maintaining all the various plot threads of the book. I loved it. Loved it. Loved it. (And I'm a guy!)<br/><br/>Rough edges. Yes, there were some. At the end of the movie Elizabeth uses the phrase ""Incandescently in love"" - in an age before electric lights, I doubt this word was well-known or used in this way. And several scenes struck me as wrong: the dance at the stately ball was too crowded and low-class. But these are nits. This movie is like Fitzwilliams Darcy - its beautiful at its core and worth loving forever."

Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen did a phenomenal job creating love between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. All of the actors in the movie seemed like they portrayed their characters exactly how Jane Austen herself would have wanted it. The scenery is beautiful, the script is brilliant. Overall I think this movie deserves five stars. It has thousands, if not millions, of people wishing that this could happen to them. The love that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett have is very powerful and many people want that in life. This movie is a perfect example of love and romance.

Keira Knightley acted so well. She could show all the special characters that Lizzie Bennet had. She is also very beautiful. I also like the facial expression and the eyes of Matthew Macfadyen, it gives a special feelings to the audience that although he looked proud, but he needed ""protection"" and it makes people feel sad with him.

"Chris Knipp","7","4","8","6 December 2005"," It's fun but it's not Jane Austen
","""Pride and Prejudice (1940) -- This literate movie is a reasonably faithful transcription of Jane Austen's sparkling comedy of manners. . .but when Jane Austen's characters are brought to life at M-G-M, all is changed -- broadened. Animated and bouncing, the movie is more Dickens than Austen"" <br/><br/>That's Pauline Kael on the 1940 Laurence Olivier, Greer Garson version with ""that great old dragon Edna May Oliver, as Lady Catherine."" Kael's description of the 1940 movie works pretty well as a template for the new Keira Knightley-Joe Wright Pride and Prejudice. This time the ""old dragon"" is Judi Dench. We can't say Wright's version belongs to Darcy, because it hasn't got Olivier: Mathtew MacFayden is strong enough, but no Olivier. The movie belongs, as it should, to Elizabeth Bennett, and hence to the charming, pretty Keira Knightley. It's also, like the 1940 one, ""changed -- broadenedanimated and bouncing."" ""More Dickens than Austen"" won't work, and the recent critic exaggerated a bit who said this new movie is Austen ""Brontëfied,"" and so did the one who called it ""a film that turns Jane Austen's nimble satire into a lumbering Gothic romance."" But they're all onto something -- something that's not there.<br/><br/>Not quite Brontëfied or Gothic, this new Pride and Prejudice has definitely been romanticized, and more than that it's had the essential elements of Jane Austen taken out. Austen's elaborate irony and rational thinking, and most of her beautiful and elegant sentences -- the essence of her books -- are all excised in favor of bouncy dancing and vivid color photography and nice-looking people -- very nice-looking ones, with nice period clothes, who more often than not overlap voices Altman style or just interrupt each other.<br/><br/>And since we don't have to hear all that's said, the gaps are filled in with surging strings and powerful piano music, music no instrument in 1821 could have come close to matching. These movie ladies sit down to their little period pianofortes -- and out comes Jean-Yves Thibaudet playing a modern Steinway concert grand. True, Jane Austen lived at a time when a lot of the great classics were composed, but she lived in the country, far from a symphony orchestra, and it's unlikely she heard anything but a little Hayden and Mozart, maybe, and minor English composers and some Italian songs, all played on an instrument with a relatively very limited sound. And of course though the ladies may have been accomplished, they were not Jean-Yves Thibaudets.<br/><br/>The looks are pumped up too, like the sound. The young men are all so handsome or cute the country balls come out looking like ads for Ralph Lauren or Abecrombie & Fitch. The economic levels are exaggerated, so you can't grasp the delicate details of income that are so important in Austen's novels. Lady Catherine's house is as grand as Buckingham Palace, and Darcy's is very nearly that grand. His estate as we see it here would easily have made him one of the half dozen richest men in England. His mansion has a huge sculpture gallery in it like a major room of the British Museum, and the other rooms are decorated with murals that look like the Vatican. At the other extreme, the Bennett girls' surroundings are taken from the Squire in Fielding's Tom Jones as represented in Tony Richardson's movie, with pigs coming into the house, and Mr. Bennett always, always, needing a shave.<br/><br/>The irony -- there is one irony, though not in the movie -- is that you can't really make a movie of Jane Austen. Her books are easily visualized on film. Movie makers can come up with the costumes and the sets. But her books aren't essentially visual. They are meant to be read. They're all about prose style, and the turns of phrase that make one think, sentences that flow gently and come down easy, catching you unawares so you may have to read them again, sentences that delineate the development of character through thought and experience with infinite clarity and subtlety. On screen, that development is there, but it's visual. It just happens. The camera just focuses on Ms. Knightley, thinking. But in Jane Austen it happens with words. Ultimately that isn't cinematic. So you can't make a Jane Austen movie without taking out the Jane Austen. Why do people do it, then? Well, people just like to make movies of her books, I guess -- and people like to watch them.<br/><br/>Joe Wright's film is fun, but it's not a masterpiece -- or Jane Austen. The directing largely isn't there, not in Jane Austen's terms: character development. Nobody really develops. Mathew MacFadyen is a young man who looks glum, and he looks that way all through. He doesn't really seem haughty and nasty at first, just like a man who can't dance. Keira Knightley is charming -- so is Simon Woods as Bingley, which is fine, because that's all he needs -- but she isn't sharp and she doesn't come through as a keen intelligence or a woman who is transformed. What Joe Wright's good at is getting a bouncy, sweaty bunch of good-looking people out on a dance floor in a stately home, and walking folks across pretty English landscapes. Walks in Jane Austen are about talk, or economics, like everything else. But in Joe Wright's film they're about sweeping strings and Chopin. Everybody is too nice, except the tiresome Mrs. Bennett -- though Brenda Blethyn is okay, not a caricature as some have said. My regret is that Donald Sutherland's smiley and weepy Mr. Bennett isn't drier and more ironic. Like everybody else in the movie, except Lady Catherine, he's been made likable, at the expense of Jane Austen's wit."
"celebworship","6","4","8","5 December 2005"," Mixed review
","I understand what they were trying to do with this film, provide a more modern interpretation of Austen's famous book.<br/><br/>They fell short because they hacked Elizabeth's dialog. Instead of being witty, sharp and playful, she comes off as slightly shrewish and spoiled. Elizabeth's talent (which she shared with her creator, Jane Austen) is the ability to put the pompous down without them understanding what she was doing or saying . She also didn't take herself too seriously.<br/><br/>I disagree with the reviewer who said to chill, that only a little of the dialog was changed. Not so, a lot of the dialog was tampered with, for no good reason.<br/><br/>A few examples: Why did Lady Catherine make the comment about using the piano in the servants quarters to Charlotte instead of Elizabeth as it was written? It sets the tone for their relationship.<br/><br/>The first proposal scene. By removing so much of the dialog between Darcy and Elizabeth, the humor AND the outrage is dimmed. It is hard to appreciate why Elizabeth is so insulted, other than she is mad about his role in the Bingley/Jane affair.<br/><br/>The reunion at Pemberly. Why was she wandering around poking in doors, where was the housekeeper? By not allowing Darcy and Elizabeth to see each other face to face, the shock they both feel is lost. Where did the Gardners go? They play an important part in that scene. This is the first time Elizabeth sees a reformed Darcy being civil to her companions.<br/><br/>The final proposal scene. I have no problem with Elizabeth going out in her nightgown and running in to Darcy. However why the Fabio like slow mo of Darcy with the swelling music? I did like the affection between the Bennets. I thought the final scene with Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth was really nice. I also liked Mr. Collins.<br/><br/>MHO, this movie could have worked, it could have carved it's own place next to the Firth/Ehle version, but there are too many missteps.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend paying top dollar to see this, but you could do worse on a rainy day to rent the DVD."
"ashircliff621","10","4","8","28 November 2005"," I never thought anyone could outdo Colin Firth as Darcy...
","I still love the A&E version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" but this new version has much to recommend it as well. It's much earthier and, I must say, sexier than A&E's version. Matthew MacFadyen is wonderful. You could hear the women in the audience gasp whenever he came on the screen. I saw an interview with him where he said that his take on Darcy was that he was just shy. That was an interesting slant on the character, and makes him much more human and less haughty than other versions. Keira Knightly is lovely as always, and Brenda Blethyn was a hoot as Mrs. Bennet.I also thought the actor who played Mr. Wickham was much more attractive than the one in the A&E version. It was harder to believe that he would turn out to be such a rat, he had such a sweet face. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a wonderful story of which I never tire. They could make a hundred versions and I would see them all."
"DanceShlWe","10","4","8","28 November 2005"," A transcendental experience
","This movie had me laughing, crying and feeling just everything in between. The chemistry between Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley is extraordinary, more, in my opinion, than the famous Jennifer Ehrle/Colin Firth duo, parts of which I re-watched when I came home. You can feel and see this Darcy struggle with his own arrogance and then his emerging feelings. Most other Darcys have been less accessible and this one hits just the right note so you can go along with Elizabeth from feeling angry and insulted to the natural progression of her feelings as she realizes the depths of this man. It is so wonderful to see an incredibly sexy scene without any groping or clothing removal, and yet sexier than anything I've seen involving nudity. The screen fairly crackles with the undercurrent! Keira Knightley is such a delight, making us feel everything she's feeling. The supporting cast, as always in British movies, is first class. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are the best Bennet parents I've ever seen. A movie I will buy when it comes out on DVD and watch over and over again."
"SheilaKE","9","4","8","13 November 2005"," An unexpected delight: Keira & Matthew own their parts as Lizzy and Darcy!
","I admit that when I first heard news that this movie was in production, I automatically resolved on never seeing it, because it seemed like such an insult to make yet another movie adaptation of ""Pride & Prejudice"" so soon after the definitive A&E/BBC production. <br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised and thrilled with this movie. The central spirit of the novel has not only remained intact but has been brought alive in many ways. With the scenes of farm life, minimal makeup, worn clothing and lived-in interiors and exteriors, I could not help but be reminded of 1995's ""Persuasion"" and its gritty realism. However, this production thankfully had no shaky camera movement and felt much more cinematic with its lighting and mise en scène.<br/><br/>As for the script, I was surprised at how much was kept into the narrative by the screenwriter and director. While many lines were transposed and shortened, there were quite a few lines that came verbatim from the novel - more than most viewers might think. For an example of transposition, even though Darcy says, ""You have bewitched me body and soul"" in the movie and not in the novel, there is a line in the novel that describes Darcy as having been bewitched by Elizabeth's manners. For an example of a line taken verbatim, there is the scene where Darcy tells Lizzy, ""You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings were what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever.""<br/><br/>Despite the brevity of the movie in comparison to the 1995 adaptation, I feel that Keira Knightley added more gravity to her part than Jennifer Ehle. From Keira's performance, I got more of a sense of Lizzy's affection and respect for her mother despite her foibles. Her Lizzy is overall more introspective and melancholy  and yet she also able to demonstrate how she hides all of this under her smiles and vivacious wit. Also, Keira makes a more convincing twenty-year-old than Jennifer and her range in this part genuinely surprised me. I wonder if she'll get recognized come Oscar time.<br/><br/>I never thought I would ever see any actor equal Colin Firth's performance as Mr. Darcy. And yet, this movie's performance actually surpasses it! Matthew Macfadyen adds more layers to Mr. Darcy's prideful arrogance  it is actually the shield behind which he hides an insecure, shy heart of a person who has been used to getting his way until he meets Lizzy. His interpretation of Darcy is not only more emotional, but you get more of a sense of how misunderstood Darcy is by the world.<br/><br/>There are definitely echoes of the A&E production throughout  and I wonder if Joe Wright has done this intentionally. First, I noticed that Lizzy and Darcy's dance at Netherfield is the same  Mr. Beveridge's Maggot. Another scene  the scene where Darcy gives Lizzy a helping hand into the carriage at Netherfield  echoes the scene where Darcy does the same at Pemberley in the A&E version. The difference is, that we get a close-up of that hand being affected by that briefest of touches. One more echo: the proposal scene in the rain reminded me of the infamous ""wet shirt"" encounter in the A&E version.<br/><br/>The only elements that keep me from giving this production a perfect 10 out of 10 are the following: pretty-boy Wickham, who looks like Orlando Bloom, didn't really have enough of a presence to merit being an obstacle or object of jealousy and the Gardiners' reduced roles (which, I suppose, couldn't be helped due to time. <br/><br/>The elements that I absolutely adored: Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet (his tears of joy at the end made me cry too)  a wonderfully complex mixture; the fact that Mary, Lydia and Kitty were a little more individualized than even in the A&E version; Brenda Blethyn's Mrs. Bennet who still inspires affection and sympathy despite all her social faux pas; Judi Dench's Lady Catherine  her midnight call was not only intrusive and rude, it was also a way of emphasizing her capriciousness and controlling nature; the scene at the Netherfield ball where Darcy and Lizzy appear to be alone  emphasizing the fact that they stand as equals above the crowd as well as momentarily forgetting the world surrounding them (reminded me of Darcy's line in the novel: ""We neither of us perform to strangers.""); the dance scenes and how they seemed so authentic because they didn't look totally rehearsed and there was such a crush of people gathered together; Darcy and Lizzy's stolen glances in church during Mr. Collins's sermon; the way that Darcy delivered his letter and the way that Lizzy was in such a state that he becomes almost an illusion; Georgiana's knowing look at his brother after introducing Lizzy; that proposal scene that, despite Lizzy's rejection almost seems to end in a kiss; the entire reconciliation scene at dawn; Darcy and Lizzy's shared look before he enters Lizzy's father's library; the fact that the movie chooses not to end at the wedding.<br/><br/>There are definitely more Romantic elements in this movie...you can't help but think of the moors in ""Wuthering Heights"" when we see Lizzy on one of the peaks in Derbyshire. Some ""purists"" may claim that this movie contains some anachronisms. However, when reading the novel, there is not only the heart of a Romantic beating within, but also a tale of female empowerment, and all of this is wonderfully alive in this movie.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10"
"ejnewton","10","4","8","12 November 2005"," Two stubborn people ... mad at each other or mad for each other?
","Beautifully filmed, fine attention to detail, subtle musical score, excellent performances, very moving. The hand held camera work is engaging in the festive ballroom scenes and engages the viewer. The lighting is exceptional--from dark candle-lit interiors to the brightness of full sun, the lighting is Oscar worthy. It really brings the reality of 19th century England closer to one's reality and imagination. The film has a somewhat different interpretation than previous versions of the classic novel. Keira Knightley's smile is very engaging. Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy is brooding and understated, but manages to convey the depth of his feelings. I commend the direction by Joe Wright. The English countryside looks lovely as usual. Judy Dench is good, but her presence in every period English movie is beginning to seem a bit cliché. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Best film I've seen this year."
"danpatter2002","6","4","8","12 November 2005"," A humorless Pride and Prejudice
","The movie is reasonably enjoyable and often attractive to look at. The leading lady, Keira Knightley, is charming, lovely and frequently bewitching as Elizabeth Bennett, but this Miss Bennett is not quite Jane Austen's Miss Bennett, nor is this Pride and Prejudice quite Miss Austen's Pride and Prejudice. For one thing, the humor has been leached out and the whole story taken very seriously indeed. This has the effect of making Austen's affectionately caricatured folks (such as Mrs. Bennett or Mr. Collins or even Lady Catherine) into somewhat monstrous characters. Instead of seeming silly, they seem almost malevolent. The whole picture is very realistically depicted: the assembly ball feels claustrophobic, hot and stuffy; the Bennetts live on a working farm, with plenty of messy livestock. The whole emotional tone of the picture is serious indeed. Elizabeth's final interview with Lady Catherine is brutal, played with heightened emotion, far from the mannerly but cleverly hostile scene written by Austen. <br/><br/>Judi Dench is in her dowager duchess mode as Lady Catherine, effective but too little used; a treat nevertheless. Matthew McFayden's rather hangdog Darcy passes muster, but I think most fans will prefer Colin Firth in the A&E miniseries. Simon Woods as Bingley and Rosamund Pike as Jane are just perfect, the best ever. Brenda Blethyn is fine indeed as this particular kind of Mrs. Bennett, but I can't say as much for Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett; he seems miscast much of the time, and what in blazes is he doing at the assumbly ball? (He grins entirely too much, too).<br/><br/>I prefer the old BBC miniseries (with its limited production values) even to the very lavish, handsome and enjoyable A&E miniseries. The BBC version was scripted by Fay Weldon, who maintained the perfect Austen tone throughout. While A&E did not manage to do that all the time, the new movie doesn't even seem to try. The final tacked-on scene will be a real jolt for Austen purists: a romantic scene for the married Darcys in the garden at Pemberly, very atmospheric and purple dialog abounding. Why not just tuck us in bed for the wedding night? <br/><br/>But you know, maybe this will lead a few more people to the immortal book itself, so I wish the movie a huge success. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."
"ksavira","10","4","8","12 November 2005"," Original, unique, and brilliant!
","Some great movies it takes more than one time to fully appreciate every aspect of them. Joe Wright's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is original, unique, highly sophisticated, and just remarkably beautiful.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley crates a beautiful, naturally charming, and an original version of Elizabeth. Her performance is just flawless. I love her deep emotion, her girlish beauty combines with her tomboyance and the strength of her character. She has really proved herself as a leading lady at such a young age.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is also brilliant. Yes, this is the film that is worth seeing in theater because it was just so beautifully shot. You will see several shots of country life: grass, mud, rain, animals, farming. You will also see beautiful landscape and sceneries of Lady Catherine's house, Darcy's house, Elizabeth's trip, etc. The whole film is like a series of beautiful photographs, but with much emotion and beautiful music. And don't forget the scenes at the dances where the camera keeps rolling and following the situation without stopping for a second. How brilliantly organized that is and how everybody has to be ready and right on the spot....it was just genius.<br/><br/>And yes, the music does so much work in building up the intensity of the story. The dance in the honor of Bingley where Darcy and Elizabeth dance together for the first time started of a bit comedic but ended with an intense anger. Knightley and McFadyen did their best job, but it was the music that builds the tension and releases it.<br/><br/>The Bennett family shows an honest relationship. The five sisters give the same vibe you would get from the March family from ""Little Women."" Brenda Blethyn's character may seem like the clown of the story, but in her we see how deeply she cares for her children and we see reasons for her over-the-top action. The film also takes the time to build a relationship between Donald Sutherland and Knightley as a loving father and his most favorite daughter. We see their connection during the scene when they argue, and the scene when she consults her feeling with him. It's deeply moving and touching.<br/><br/>And what more can I say that I haven't already? A lot. But I want you to experience the film first. This is a truly great film that deserves much more attention than it has received so far. Jane Austen's fans shouldn't be disappointed, and non-Jane Austen's fans might even want to start reading her works. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a timeless story and one of the most beautiful and intelligent love story of all time. It's a study of human characters, culturalism, feminism, and romance. And this film does it total justice."
"jhrichards","8","4","8","4 November 2005"," A good attempt
","Having seen the BBC version, I was expecting to be disappointed. However, I wasn't. It is really quite good - a new look at a well known drama. It ran along nicely - the sets were authentic looking. Most of these period pieces have sets that are set in some master plan somewhere. This was a cut above. I thought Keira Knightley was absolutely gorgeous. Mind you, she was so lovely that surely Mr Bingley would have gone for her, rather than her sister. Matthew MacFadyen didn't strike me as being as handsome as Colin Firth, but conveyed his awkwardness well; you really felt he didn't know how to handle women, especially sparky ones. Personally, I always want to strangle Mrs Bennet; I thought Brenda Blethyn was an improvement over Alison Steadman, who sounded like Edna Everage. Mr Collins was very good, but not as good as the previous version, who was truly excellent. I particularly liked Kelly Reilly as Caroline Bingley. She had a really bitchy feeling about her, but sexy with it. Judy Dench - please! I am completely Denched out. Dead Ringers had it right - Judy Dench plays every middle aged middle/upper class English lady who ever lived. Barbara Leigh-Hunt in the previous version was absolutely fantastic - much better than Dame Judy, I am afraid. Donald Sutherland was a mistake - was he dubbed? Just stuck in for a name, I suppose. Not as good as the BBC classic, but enjoyable just the same."

The Bennett girls' giggling is annoying and makes the twits in Bring It On (a much funnier film) seem like Regency wits. And the vulgar, obvious script makes Airplane (waaaay funnier film) seem subtle.<br/><br/>If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice, don't bother with this film.

","My mother has been begging me to watch the mini series Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, I never really had the time since it's 6 hours and it seems like a lot to swallow. So, she told me to rent the remake, it seemed like a summed up version of the story, and I now cannot wait to watch the mini series. I really enjoyed Sense and Sensebility and now I am a new fan of Pride and Prejudice, what great stories! They have such rich characters and incredible stories that will melt your heart.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly shines as Elizabeth, one of many sisters who is feeling the same shared pressure of being married by her mother. When she meets a man named Mr. Darcy, she is disgusted by his arrogance and swears that she will never marry him. After seeing two of her sisters getting purposed to as well as one being married, she is feeling lonely as ever, but is very stubborn and opinionated where she will not settle. After realizing how wonderful Mr. Darcy is though, well, you get the picture.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful adaptation of Jane Austin's masterpiece novel and I would highly recommend it. Like I said, now I'm excited to see the mini series, I love Colin Firth, I'm sure he will make a great Mr. Darcy. But this cast has won my heart already, it really is a great film! <br/><br/>9/10"
"archienhi","3","5","11","1 December 2008"," Appalling Inaccuracies
","I'm a fan of many the actors in this film and I really loved the movie Atonement, by the same director. But this movie appalled me at so many points. I honestly wondered if the director had read the novel properly. Listening to the commentary on the DVD makes me think he did not - he shows a complete lack of understanding of Jane Austen's world.<br/><br/>I don't mind when adaptations veer from the sequence of events in a novel - not everything in a novel translates well on to screen - but I strongly object to adaptations straying away from the spirit of the novel and the spirit of the characters. If you want to do that, make up your own story rather than mangle someone else's - Jane Austen would have turned in her grave at some of the stuff put in.<br/><br/>Yes, Elizabeth Bennet of the novel is spirited and playful; a free-spirit and an independent thinker. But she also has a deep respect for social propriety, and for her elders, and has many moments of gentleness and weakness.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Bennet of this film lacks finesse, and is often uncouth, rude and abrupt in a way that would never have been tolerated in a young woman of the time. The number of times she reprimands others in this movie..! She even insults her mother at one point and actually snatches things out of people's hands and eavesdrops outside people's doors twice. Completely made up by the movie makers of course - they never occur in the book. In the scene where her mother and sisters visit Netherfield, it is her mother who reprimands Elizabeth in the book, not the other way around! And the dialogue is all wrong too. Words meant to be delivered by one character are delivered by another, or made up dialogue is created that uses painfully modern language rather than language of the time.<br/><br/>Mr and Mrs Bennet are not supposed to be a happy couple who have the kind of intimacy implied here. Mr Bingley is not supposed to be the fool portrayed in this movie. The entire assembly would not have made way for the Bingleys and Mr Darcy as though they were aristocracy. Elizabeth would not have shown up at Netherfield with her hair completely down and Caroline Bingley, though supercilious, would not have been so rude as to not perform her part as hostess when Elizabeth appears.<br/><br/>And Mr Bingley would NOT have appeared in the bedroom where Jane lay ill!! Mary is not in love with Mr Collins as implied - she approves of him, that is all, but she believes herself superior to him. Charlotte would not have exclaimed ""Don't you dare judge me!"" Miss Bingley's dress should not have been sleeveless as it is at the Netherfield ball. Mr Darcy would not have tried to meet Elizabeth at the crack of dawn improperly dressed, nor would his aunt visit the Bennets in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>I could go on and on...<br/><br/>I enjoyed the chemistry between some of the characters, in particular the two main characters. The women wore little make up as was consistent with the times. And there was some really lovely scenery. These are the best things I can say about this movie."
"lobaugh","Null","5","11","12 April 2008"," Phenomenal Cast
","First of all, I must say that I have not seen the oldest production of Pride and Prejudice...only the one with Firth and this one. I am rather torn of which of the two are better.<br/><br/>First, the length is to be spoken of. When I first saw the previews for this movie I was instantly excited but then quickly realized than in the normal length of feature films, there is no way that they could cover good ground. It would have to be at least as long as Titanic or Pearl Harbor (3 hours+) to even touch all the important points. I realize that the oldest of two had the luxury of episodes and that most people would not have gone to see a 6 hour long movie. However, I found that there were times in the movie in which they wasted time. I sat there thinking...STOP...you have so much ground to cover, keep it moving. And though I know the reason, I thought it was insufficient. In order to balance, I found they spoke way too fast and moved too quickly from scene to scene. You are hardly getting the point of the past scene before they are headed into the next. Pace should be thought of and considered...<br/><br/>Next, was the casting. I have to say that, for the most part, the casting was excellent. In fact, I have little criticism at all. I didn't like Wickam. I thought he looked too much like a Backstreet Boy or something. That's just my opinion. But Matthew and Keira did beautifully. I even like that Matthew was a bit warmer than Firth. He played more of a shy, socially awkward type instead of cold and arrogant. Donald Sutherland was genius, and Judy Dench was amazing. Even Poor Mr. Collins was a perfect match! I laughed every time he was in the shot.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought this was an awesome movie with a phenomenal cast. And I guess my only criticism of it was that it didn't use its time wisely. When you have so much ground to cover, don't idle with nonsensical takes."
"wlh_916","9","5","11","24 March 2008"," I was hooked!!
","What is the likelihood that someone that you swore to loathe for all eternity is your soul mate? In Elizabeth Bennet's case this is very probable. Jane Austen's romantic comedy Pride and Prejudice is a classic that has been adapted for film several times, though the 2005 adaptation, directed by Joe Wright blows its predecessors out of the water. <br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is set in late 18th century in London. It tells the compelling story of Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightly) and four sisters all of whom are out in society. Elizabeth is the second of Mr. Bennet's daughters and though not as beautiful as her older sister, Elizabeth attracts the attention of Mr. Darcy (Matthew McFadyen). Mr. Darcy is perceived to be proud by all but those closest to him, so when he hurts Elizabeth's pride she decides to loath Mr. Darcy for all of eternity. Thought as fate has a way of changing things these two are forced to get to the bottom of their misunderstanding to truly get one another. <br/><br/>When I first saw Pride and Prejudice I was hooked. I've seen this movie more than is necessary with any film and have been known on occasion to restart it as soon as I've completed it. In my opinion it is just that great. The director has a way of making the viewer really feel for the characters and their well being. It's hard not to fall in love with the quirky Bennet family. The film also gives insight on what life, marriage, and love was like for the Bennet girls and the men and women of this time period. The director also does a great job of showing the relationships between sisters and how influential they are, especially in the case of Elizabeth and her older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). <br/><br/>After viewing this film I did read the novel, and as much as I love this film I do feel that a lot of meaningful information was scaled down for the sake of time, though it did not affect the integrity of the film. For the most part the dialogue of the film keeps with the novel allowing the film to feel more authentic with the time period. A film I've more recently seen Atonement, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightly, the theme in this movie also dealt with the fate of soul mates. It was a great reminder of how fate doesn't always choose the path which we would necessarily choose for ourselves. <br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel and must see movie. I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for a laugh in hopes that you will fall in love with the Bennets as much as I have."
"TheEmperorsBride","6","5","11","1 December 2007"," Not Proud And Hardly Prejudiced
","Before I say anything, I have to mention that I'm a huge fan of the famous 1995 BBC mini-series adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I own it on DVD, and I've watched the entire series several times from start to finish. It's by far the best adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I've ever seen. Therefore, I may be a little bit subjective, but I try not to keep comparing the movie to the fantastic TV-series.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's classic novel about five young sisters whose mother desperately tries to marry off to wealthy men to avoid a future of poverty and loneliness, the witty second-born Elizabeth being the protagonist. The sisters' luck seems to turn when two such men, the cheerful Mr. Bingley and the haughty Mr. Darcy, enter their lives. While Mr. Bingley courts Elizabeth's beautiful older sister Jane, Elizabeth finds herself clashing with Mr. Darcy, an immensely proud man who seems impossible to please, but who turns out to conceal a gentleman Elizabeth is too prejudiced to see.<br/><br/>The plot is faithful enough to the original novel, so one can't really blame the story for not being interesting enough. However, it is still much less compelling than any other adaptation of the novel. Why? Because it completely overlooks the central dilemma of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's relationship - that they can't be together until Mr. Darcy stops being too proud to treat Elizabeth and her family with the respect they deserve, and Elizabeth stops being too prejudiced to see past the false rumours and misunderstandings which have stained her opinion of Mr. Darcy. On the contrary to the book, the movie's Mr. Darcy appears to fall for Elizabeth at first glance, displaying none of the disdain the original character regards her with when they first meet. Their love is shown beginning with immediate mutual attraction, instead of being shown as something they both grow into once they get over themselves. There's no pride, and hardly any prejudice, both of which are essential to the character development. Hence title, Wright, hence the title.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not someone who gets overly obsessed with staying loyal to the original source when translating novels into the silver screen. I don't mind changes because I understand that movies and books are two different mediums. In fact, I fully embrace even the boldest changes when they improve the quality of the movie. However, the tiny little thing changed in Pride and Prejudice is simply unacceptable because it destroys the tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, which is a crucial element in their story.<br/><br/>The casting is also all wrong. While I personally didn't mind Keira Knightley's bubbly take on Elizabeth Bennet, I cannot over-emphasize how bad Matthew Macfadyen is as Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a strong, supercilious man whose arrogant exterior conceals a respectful, honest heart. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy seems like a brooding, insecure teenage boy with a dull, sheepish, submissive look in his eyes. His acting is wooden, every word he speaks is empty, and there isn't a hint of the character's defining traits about him. This is where I absolutely must make a comparison with Macfadyen and Colin Firth, who portrayed the same character in the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. Where the superb Firth was able to inject the battle of pride and passion which rages inside Mr. Darcy when he finds himself falling for a woman who he considers unworthy of him in a single look, Macfadyen cannot channel his character's emotions even when he's pouring out his soul to his beloved. With a leading man like him, how could the movie work? <br/><br/>While I personally quite like Joe Wright's way of portraying the hot, lazy summer days in the lush English countryside, he doesn't have much to offer than some breath-taking shots of the surrounding nature that aren't enough to compensate the movie's flaws. Most of the time he seems rather clueless about the story he's telling, struggling especially with dialog-heavy scenes. I much preferred his next title, Atonement, a movie similar in style but remarkably advanced in quality."
"vboerner","10","5","11","30 October 2007"," Incredible version that improves with each viewing...
","After seeing both, I have to say that I felt that the BBC version did not make Elizabeth as true to the book. It truly is fine work, however, Elizabeth lacked strength in comparison and was put down in the BBC version where I felt she held her own in the book. Colin Firth, as handsome as he is... and as well as he did with the role, Matthew offered subtleties in the acting that both came across as more genuine and sympathetic to the growth of Mr. Darcy as he falls in love with and expresses his feelings for Elizabeth. (... and when he finally smiles, what a warm and joyful reward!) I enjoyed both, but I have to offer a counterpoint to some that I read as I strongly preferred the newer version... call it blasphemy, but at least I admit it. Love all your comments!"

"redtomatoe123","1","5","11","18 June 2006"," Soiled
","This movie was quite possibly the worst adaptation. It left out so much of the wonderful Jane Austen-esquire soul of the book. The director and screenplay writer destroyed the plot and hired a mediocre actress, one Keira Knightley to play the heroine. Certain characters who play significant roles are downplayed and key plot occurrences are kept out of the film. There is no excuse for this, as the movie was only 2 hours and 8 minutes (approx.) but it still was too long. The ending happens to be extremely lame, from the time Darcy walks through the field in the morning until the last ""Mrs. Darcy."" I am utterly and hopelessly romantic, and I found this ridiculous, not even romantic, just lame and horribly cliché. As an Austen Loyalist, I say the work is amateurish and completely leaves the book in the mud, soiling Austen's masterpiece."
"imagineer99","9","5","11","2 June 2006"," Romance in Subtlety
","To put it succinctly, there's something beautiful about director Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's famous novel, Pride and Prejudice. Maybe it's the stunning British vistas that appear on screen, completely saturated in subtle tones of yellow, green, and blue. Maybe it's the delightful and classically poignant musical score that meanders unobtrusively from scene to scene. Maybe it's the understated, but expert performances given by a stellar cast. Or, maybe it's simply the fact that Pride and Prejudice is a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Jane Austen's original novel is legendarydetailing the affairs of the predominately female Bennett family (five girls in all) as they all attempt to find love in a time period where convenience and ignorance were the most attractive qualities in a partner. The eldest Bennet girls, Lizzie and Jane, find out directly that first appearances can sometimes be the greatest form of prejudice and falsehood.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright succeeds because he's not afraid to embrace a style that is unpretentious, but also engaging. During a visually majestic ball scene, we are treated to a long, impressive shot that dollies from room to room, following each character as they interact with other guests. Outside the Bennet household, the camera moves from window to window, detailing the actions of all the inhabitants inside. It's a visual treat to be sure, but it also seems that in the process Wright creates an authentic worlda cinematic realm that appears to exist long after the camera has stopped rolling. As a result, Pride and Prejudice has managed to surmount one of the biggest problems of contemporary romances: we actually care about the characters.<br/><br/>And, what characters they are. Young Kiera Knightley excels as the quick-witted and skeptical Lizzie Bennet, finally putting to rest her ostentatious pout and delving into Austen's literary subtlety. Matthew Macfadyen plays the stern and ""disagreeable"" Darcy with enough pizazz to make even the legendary Colin Firth blush. But, beyond their separate performances, the sparks really fly when the two leads share the screen together. Here the romantic tension is so palpable that every handhold feels like a long passionate kiss. Every brief touch is charged with sexual energy. The supporting players are equal to the precedent set by the leads. Donald Sutherland stands out especially as the Bennet patriarch, both loving and smart. His wife, played deliciously by Talulah Riley, is both comedic and convincing as the woman who wants all her daughters to, above all, find a match that is financially sound.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice proves that romance is more about chemistry and atmosphere than showy smooches or diamond rings. The entire film simply feels authentic. And, in the process, it shows how sexy subtlety can be."
"Abunai","4","5","11","12 March 2006"," Not a patch on the miniseries
","The characters in this adaptation seemed watered down versions of those in the miniseries. Both Matthew Mcfayden and Keira Knightly lacked the passion that Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle shared in the 1995 version. Jennifer Ehle had a sparkle in her eye and quiet passion that I missed in Keira Knightly's performance and where Colin Firth had a simmering, sexy reserve, Matthew Mcfayden just looked plain miserable. That there was not even a kiss between them made the whole affair a bit of an anticlimax too.<br/><br/>Another disappointment was Mr Collins, who acted very well but lacked the ingratiating flourishes and sheer repulsiveness of David Bamber's Collins. The general feeling of the film was dull and miserable as opposed to lively and exciting, the relationship between Kitty and Wickham also hurried and confused. Judi Dench was very good as Lady Catherine but the plot failed to allow Elizabeth to win her grudging respect in the end as she does in the miniseries."

David Bamber of ""ROME"" was such a fantastic ass as Mr Collins, Alison Steadman was brilliant as the ditsy Mrs. Bennet...not to mention Colin Firth...who just may have portrayed the quintessential Mr Darcy...certainly one to emulate.<br/><br/>First, 127 min isn't enough time to devote to such a big story. Also Judi Dench was so lackluster it seemed as if she was forced by contract to act in this movie. Donald Sutherland was embarrassingly miscast. It seemed to me that Keira Knightley (how did she ever get an Oscar nomination for this role?) and Matthew Macfadyen were so one dimensional...nowhere was the vivacious humor and intellectual sparring that rocks the book? Too very dull for Jane Austin...rent or buy the BBC version...it's still so much better!"
"ilovepansies","6","5","11","19 November 2005"," Acting Needed Improvement
","I understand they had to fit a lot of content into this movie, but I did not feel that many of the characters were developed as they should have been. Mrs. Bennet was not as tiresome as portrayed in the book, Mr. Wickham seemed kind and hardly deceitful, Lydia was tolerable, and even Lizzy wasn't as quick as I would have liked her to be. I felt that many of the lines were delivered without reaction to the other actors. In one scene, Mrs. Bennet made a statement and Mr. Bennet started his comeback before she'd even finished her statement. The movie rushed through the important character-building details, yet took lengthy latitude with unimportant details...and there was a particularly nauseating moment when Lizzy just sat on the swing and circled around for a full minute. <br/><br/>Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins were the only truly convincing actors. <br/><br/>All in all I was disappointed, and wished there could have been more passion and tension between the actors. And how could they not give us a kiss at the end! That is just cruel after sitting through 2 hours of courtship.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the funny moments, however, and the scenery was beautiful and believable. All in all I give it a 6."
"Sophia-Drossopoulou","7","5","11","25 September 2005"," A shortened, simplified version of Jane Asuten's novel.
","A very entertaining film. But not in the spirit of the novel, where nuance, restraint and decorum are of paramount importance. In the film, instead, the actors show and shout their feelings at top voice. <br/><br/>The most ""unsubtle"" issue is how Elizabeth and Darcy fall in love. After his original refusal to dance with Elizabeth, Darcy is all attention and longing for her. His ""pride"" is hardly shown, and it is not difficult to see why Elizabeth would like him. Elizabeth's love for Whickam is not shown, and even while she is refusing Darvcy, she is almost kissing him. We are not surprised by Darcy's first marriage proposal, and it is not difficult to imagine Elizaneth falling in love with him. The plot is easy to follow, but less surprising and refined.<br/><br/>Jane Austen values restraint and decorum. Her Elizabeth would not sniffle in public, and would not scream ""leave me alone for once in my life"". Her Mrs Bennett would appear comic, without the eavesdropping. Her Lydia would appear reckless, without jumping and shouting in each scene. <br/><br/>It may well be, that Austen's clever and complex book cannot be reduced into two hours of film without losing its subtlety. The film ""works"", but Austen it ain't."

"julia2702","4","2","3","21 December 2016"," A lovely caricature on great Austen's classic
","Interesting thing: usually it does not bother me that tastes differ, but when I see that quite a few people out there honestly enjoy this attempt at adapting Austen – it feels crazy. I try to soothe myself, however, saying that not everyone watches it because they like Austen in general, or have always loved this particular book. Maybe they just came across a nice romantic movie, and romantic in some ways it is, indeed.<br/><br/>My own heart was totally captivated when I saw 1995 series, starring Firth and Ehle, so of course I couldn't help a certain bias. But I kept repeating to myself words of Jennifer Ehle, who once said that nobody owns this story,that it's still ""in the public domain"" and everyone is free to experiment with it – something along those lines. Finally I achieved a pretty much open-minded state, gave in to my curiosity and pressed Play.<br/><br/>And here comes a big sad sigh. I have basically two criticisms: 1) unfaithfulness to the Austen original; 2) bad and immature film-making. And if one could put up with the first objection – perhaps even enjoy the so-called ""fresh take"" on Austen, the second one just seems unpardonable. In a way, I'm grateful to the crew behind PP 2005 – because they taught me what a good quality film really is by offering its opposite. An amateur viewer takes so much for granted before an experience like that happens – when you see clearly what can be done by different people with the same material.<br/><br/>For a while, I used to blame the wrong casting and poor acting. But then I thought – well, I generally like Keira and I find her beautiful. And Matthew, though he is not Firth – is a nice Darcy option. Just the other day I watched Simon Woods in ""Cranford"", and truly enjoyed his Dr. Harrison as a pretty lovable (though not a swoon-worthy) romantic hero. And who would dare hold anything against divine Judy Dench? Then my eyes suddenly opened. All this stiff and wooden acting, reading out lines instead of fleshing out the story-line with heartfelt dialogue – perhaps, somebody else is responsible for that. Someone behind the scenes, that we do not get the privilege to see. As a lovely quote goes, ""If everyone in the cast is bad, and bad in the same way, then the fault is the director's"".<br/><br/>Returning to my first objection – read somewhere that the story has been ""de-austenized"" and ""brontefied"". That the scenery would rather befit gloomy ""Wuthering Heights"" than Jane's light and sparkling comedy of manners. This would be a less grave claim for 2 reasons – first not every viewer is Austen puritan, and second it's kind of amusing to see how Austen's material might be enlivened with a more emotional, romantic drama twist. Some of the invented romantic scenes, I admit, deserve a big thumbs-up. Though others, for instance Darcy tearing along on horseback through a dark night forest, border on the ridiculous. And still, I cannot believe that Bennet girls had such untidy hairdos. Though I'm not an expert on the subject, we do not typically associate English middle- class gentry with such a messy household. The film crosses the line here, not merely fails your expectations.<br/><br/>Howsoever, romanticizing experiments may all be well and good, but the core – for which the world has been turning to Austen again and again – still must be about something else. P&P is traditionally considered a love story, especially by those who haven't read it, but if it were the only feature – this story would not be so magically fascinating. Austen wrote a very clever book, all based on the battle of wits, making elegant fun of the contrast between sanity and silliness, especially that of social conventions as opposed to a healthy outlook on life. Missing this point – is exactly what 2005 movie does. Instead of being exquisitely funny, it becomes dumbed down and downright stupid at times. <br/><br/>What's all this giggling, squeaking and hiccuping is about? Lizzy looking like an awkward teenager, Bingley looking like an imbecile, and Mr Bennet - like a retired alcoholic? Come on, guys, there's serious stuff going on! Affairs of the heart and all this matrimonial race with financial ties.. Why do you act like kids in a school performance? Eventually it just seems hard to take this rendition of the story seriously.<br/><br/>One last thing, which I think was a crime to destroy is the feeling of restrained passion, which gives the original P&P such a special sexy allure. Here, nothing is simmering beneath, all romantic tension you get is so bluntly in-your-face, that it becomes annoying at times.<br/><br/>I give it 4 stars instead of 1 or 2, just because everything that bears the trace of P&P is sacred to me : ) However, the 2005 film will remain a caricature in my eyes. Perhaps a lovely one, but still a caricature. And I secretly wish somebody made yet another P&P adaptation. Just for the sake of this not being the latest. Otherwise, there's a risk the younger generations will stick with it and miss the whole point of the timeless classic."

","Story: In this case I presume story does not need to be addressed too much. It follows the book very precisely and does not change it in anything significant. Only of course it had to be shortened for a movie but the basic story from a book is intact.<br/><br/>Acting: Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet is just irresistible. She is very beautiful (perhaps too much for Elizabeth), funny and sweet. She perfectly captured Elizabeth in her evolvement form smart but still a bit immature young woman to grown up woman. As for Matthew McFadden he is good, but I must say he did not really seem to capture the role to me. Half of the time he more seems to have toothache than being proud. Brenda Bethyn as Mrs. Bennet is great as is Tom Hollander in role of Mr. Collins. Judi Dench is very good as DeBourg. All in all acting is very good and I see no real weak spot here.<br/><br/>Direction and camera: This film is beautifully directed and camera is just great. The sceneries are full of atmosphere and shot are very carefully chosen to have the biggest impact possible. Joe Wright really has a great talent for atmosphere and choosing of sceneries. I would only have a slight problem with directing: the film is too fast, people sometimes behave how they would not at the time also the language is sometimes simplified. Some things were made because of length of movie, but some of the behavior (Mr. Darcy bursting to the room without even knocking) are unrealistic.<br/><br/>Music: Not bad but I did not notice it very much.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Grate adaptation with minor hinges but all in all very food film, mostly thanks to director and Ms Knightley."

","Pride and Prejudice, the novel's latest adaptation by Joe Wright, is a delightfully charming film that surprisingly works well for its limited runtime of 129 minutes. I will not compare this film with the ever-faithful, ever-acclaimed 1995 television serial, for both work equally well but just on different levels. The selling point of this film is the fact that it will easily appeal to the younger generation; it is a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the novel or Jane Austen (as it was for me). A modern rendition of the classic novel, it still manages to maintain the wittiness and romance through the impressive performances of the young and attractive actors/actresses.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses currently, delivers a pinpoint portrayal of Ms. Elizabeth Bennet that sparkles with witty personality. Her execution and deliverance of the novel's smart, memorable dialogue is spot on – her talent is evident, having able to meet the high standards that have always tagged along with this particular character. Her counterpart, Matthew Macfadyen, does an equally good job as Mr. Darcy, and his transformation throughout the film is well acted. Some may be dissatisfied with the youth or the lack of maturity of the cast, but as mentioned above, being an adaptation aimed at appealing to a younger audience, one must allow proper applause for the cast; it is by no means an easy task to effectively act as a set of defining literary characters.<br/><br/>My only complaint was it being too short; there were a few scenes that seemed to arrive much too soon, but it is understandable considering they were trying to compress it into one film. I'll be more than happy to redirect you to the above-mentioned television serial – just under 6 hours, it is given plenty of time for the events to play out.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those who have yet to succeed in sitting through the novel – it is a hilarious and emotion-provoking film – or for those who desire a fresh and lively look at their favourite novel. Highly eloquent, highly intelligent, this modern telling of an all-time classic is worth the watch."

","I wish it were within my power to say something astounding regarding this wonderful new version of Pride & Prejudice, ""something that will amaze...<br/><br/>and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,"" as the enduring Ms. Austen had Lizzie say to the haughty Mr. Darcy. Alas, it is my poor fate to merely echo the sentiments of many others when I say that I was almost outraged to hear there was to be another version of this wonderful novel. How, when the pinnacle of perfection had been attained by the 1995 miniseries, could anyone hope, or dare, to attempt another. My outrage was further increased upon learning that Keira Knightley was to attempt the role of Ms. Elizabeth Bennett, the beloved heroine of this tale. I hold no dislike of Ms.<br/><br/>Knightley, but she was far from my image of Lizzie, a lightweight, to me, in more ways than merely her slender frame. I was therefore not tempted to see it in the theater, for I feared it could be no more than ""barely tolerable,"" and, at worst, a desecration of one of the most beloved novels of all times.<br/><br/>I was subsequently receiving little dribs and drabs from a variety of sources that, nay, this movie was quite good and enjoyable, even in the opinion of the reviewer to whom I turn most often for intelligence of this sort, the estimable Mr. Roger Ebert, who, though occasionally wrong in his facts, is seldom wrong in his criticism. Therefore, by the time the DVD was to be released, I had worked myself into a fair degree of anticipation and hope and, thus, made it my mission to obtain viewing rights upon the first opportunity.<br/><br/>Gentle Reader, I cannot honestly say that my approbation was achieved upon the first viewing... for this telling seemed so dreadfully rushed as to be sometimes incoherent. I fear I might have been quite lost had I not been fortunate enough to have a thorough grounding in this story by the previous reading of the novel (at least thrice) and the enjoyment of the 1995 miniseries (at least twice), and even the former viewing of the 1940 execrable version, which one can only recommend for the pleasures of the wonderful Ms. Greer Garson (sadly, too old for the role), but completely ruined by someone's decision to turn the odious Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a matchmaker, all simpering approval of Lizzie's becoming her nephew's bride.<br/><br/>Anyone who wants to talk about a movie version being abhorrent to Ms. Austen would have a challenge to find a more disturbing example of the misrepresentation of a major plot point.<br/><br/>Ah, but there WAS something about this new and very youthful telling of the classic story, so I found that it must be seen again, and then a third time, followed by a feverish reading of almost all of the external reviews on IMDb, followed by a reading of many user reviews on IMDb, followed by a rereading of the novel, followed by a first time viewing of the 1980 BBC miniseries, followed by a reviewing of the 1995 classic miniseries.<br/><br/>Was I obsessed with Pride and Prejudice? Gentle Reader, I confess that I was... and am. I was loathe to leave the story behind and only by all of these myriad contacts could I continue to live within the confines of this experience.<br/><br/>I am, indeed, grateful for the many wonderful reviews that I read, that taught me to understand why, ultimately, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" was so compelling to me. At last, a version that touched my heart, where before it was only my mind that had been satisfied. Despite all the naysayers who compared it to a Boon & Mills romance (upon research, translated to the American: Harlequin Romance), who complained of its lack of historical accuracy (in some cases they were entirely justified criticisms), still I cannot deny that this version won me over with its fidelity to the spirit of Ms. Austen's intentions and that ultimately I found it to have ""bewitched me, body and soul."""

","I thought it might be a little cheesy at first, but as soon as I started watching it, I was instantly enthralled. The filming alone almost made me cry - it was beautifully done. The cameraman was absolutely phenomenal.<br/><br/>I thought the actors fit their parts perfectly - a rare thing for me, since I am usually very finicky with certain actors after reading the book. They were wonderful.<br/><br/>And of course, being a music student, I found particularly interesting how authentic the piano sounded. It had the slightly muted aspect that pianos of that time frame had, and that really excited me! This was a gorgeous movie and immediately made it to my top 10 list. I have always loved the book, and this version of the movie is perfect.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend it!"
"hockey-girl228","9","2","3","24 February 2006"," Best Film I've seen in years
","I adored this movie. It was funny, dramatic and romantic in all the right places. I adored the book and the truth was that i was definitely hesitant to go and see a Hollywood version of this film, especially when i found out that Keira Knightly was going to play Elizabeth. I was very pleased to be wronged for once. I have nothing but praise for the actors, Keira Knightley especially. She brought to life one of my favorite characters and was so convincing that when i imagine Elizabeth i imagine Keira. Matthew MacFadyen makes an awesome Darcy, he is at least Colin Firths equal. Brenda Blythen play's Mrs Bennet to perfection and Donald Sutherland play's Elizabeth's doting, yet sarcastic father perfectly. The set was so much better than the 1995 version, the set than was immaculate but if you've ever read the book Austen describes the Bennett home as a farm. That is exactly what the set designers have done and it is amazing. All the sets are amazing and i actually liked these costumes they are better than the empire lines. The only thing i have against this film is that they type-casted Jane as a blonde, i would honestly like to know where they got the idea that Jane is a blonde. Apart from that i really adored this film and would recommend it to anyone. It is one of the best movies of 2005 and very enjoyable film."
"Cube_TX","9","2","3","23 February 2006"," Wow!
","I only went to see this movie because it was at a theater opening for free and my wife had wanted to see it. My expectations were very low and I was ready for another stuffy British romance full of boring scenes and pretentious behavior. I was proved completely wrong. I never imagined that this film would be so outright funny the entire time! While the acting and script were very sophisticated they never dragged on nor treated the audience as low class. Keira Knightley was outright fantastic in her portrayal of Elizabeth. She completely deserved her Oscar nomination and it is unfortunate that this movie happened to come out at the same time as Walk the Line. It appears that Reese Witherspoon will be the one to win.<br/><br/>The story was very descriptive and never left anything open. This was a true tale of a couple separated by circumstance. The final love scene, while brief, was very emotional and so beautiful that the viewer can almost feel how much Darcy loves Elizabeth. Because this film is not ""politically correct"" it didn't receive all of the attention that Brokeback Mountain did, when in fact this film was outright EVERYTHING the boring Brokeback Mountain claimed to be.<br/><br/>Cinematography for this film was very underrated. The shots of the landscapes and backgrounds were so beautiful that I wished I could visit England. The scene where Elizabeth stood on the cliff alone deserved the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>When the scenery, costumes and acting were not being featured the movie kept the audience entertained with its comedy. This film was never boring at any point. I've seen several comedies where I have laughed less than I did watching this film. Though listed as a drama, this movie was actually the true definition of a romantic comedy. Also, the characters and acting were so incredible that I found myself rooting for the protagonists and legitimately hating the snobby or deceptive characters. This was truly a great film.<br/><br/>This was a true date movie. Seeing this movie with my wife made it even more emotional. I look forward to buying this film on DVD eventually."
"themanhattan_project","10","2","3","17 February 2006"," A lovely, breathtaking, delightful movie!
","For anyone who appreciates a well thought out love story with a happy ending, Pride and Prejudice is your movie. I loved Jane Austen's book and enjoyed almost every version of it I've seen, especially the A&E version, and even the Bollywood musical. This version, however, made me appreciate the book all over again and in a completely different way. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting delightful. Though this version was relatively short and left out some amusing details, it was emotionally intense and managed to convey the ""spirit"" of the book throughout the entire movie. The settings, the lighting... I just loved it. If I regretted anything it was that little time was spent on Wickham and some of the best lines from the book were left out, slightly changed, or said very quickly. Overall, it was awesome experience that no fan of romantic movies should miss."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","3","16 January 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Pride and Prejudice
","I'd say I must thank Heavens for bestowing upon me, a second chance to finally watch the most excellent Keira Knightley version of the timeless Jane Austen classic Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>Most of you would already be acquainted with the rich story about the sweet romance amongst the wonderfully beautiful Bennet sisters, in age old England. But this movie, in my most humble opinion, tended to place focus on the love between Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), and between Jane Bennet (Bond girl Rosamund Pike) and Mr Bingley (Simon Woods), allowing us audiences to witness folk dances while they tease each other.<br/><br/>And we also bear testament to the challenges of love in those days, where manners maketh a person, and prim and properness the order of the day. With gentle bows and curtsies, we learn of Elizabeth's rebellious streak to break all norms, and the lessons everyone can take home, in not judging a book by its cover.<br/><br/>It makes you count your lucky stars (or do we?) about how we approach relationships these days, although some things, like the second guessings, and the waiting games we people play, seem to continue its stickiness like glue. Class and prestige make marriages like a business alliance more than that of love, and with age, makes some like a matter of convenience.<br/><br/>Supported by an experienced veteran cast of Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench, the lovely Keira is up for a couple of awards for her role as Elizabeth, and I'd say, give them to her. Bravo! Her performance was most delightful, and brought to life a range of emotions that you cannot deny make this role hers. Matthew Macfadyen too holds his own opposite Ms Knightley, with his Mr Darcy so pompous, and yet so gentlemanly.<br/><br/>Oh, I haven't read the classic (please pardon me on admitting to this most unforgivable sin), but for what it's worth as a movie, it's jolly good entertainment, coupled with a fair bit of eye candy. Though I did hope that the movie did have more time to explore in depth, some of its rushed subplots.<br/><br/>(P.S. I know the review reads weird, but heck, after 2 hours of that accent and language, it gets to you. Ha! And yes, I know it isn't perfect too)"
"gtodmon","8","2","3","7 January 2006"," Just what it is ought to be
","I adore Jane Austen's novel, so I went to see the movie with a little skepticism, convinced that it would be a weak attempt to retell a great story. I was, however, surprised by the fact that the film followed the book almost precisely - there were no big lapses in the story and no annoying elements, added by the director. Keira Knightley gives a very good performance, presenting Elizabeth exactly as I imagine her, and the other actors surely succeed to create an atmosphere almost the same as the one Austen has created. Applause also for Judy Dench, who is perfect for the role of Lady Catherine De Bourg. What I consider to be the flaw of the movie, is the little attention given to Jane and Bingley's relationship, which is certainly not as important as the one of Lizy and Darcy, but really deserves a little more. Basically, if you are a fen of the novel, you'll get what you want from the movie. And if you just want a witty romantic story, you won't be disappointed either. 8/10 for this one!"
"sesyte","10","2","3","4 January 2006"," Don't understand harsh reviews
","I would have to strongly disagree with the negative comments of mkazmierczak, carole-wilbraham, seraph_sister and others, and although it is true that this movie has some historical accuracy problems, after all it is an adaptation to a novel, not a real life event. Such accuracy is often expected in the documentaries, however who in their right mind actually look for the inaccurate portrayal of what is already a ""made up"" story. I started my reading of the book after I saw a movie, and maybe because of that I can actually compare how well the movie represents what Jane Austen portrayed in her ""Pride and Prejudice."" Even most of the dialog is used in the movie, which I thought to be extremely pleasing. As for the actors, I think all did a great job, especially in the roles of Elizabeth, Darcy, Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet and Catherine DeBorough. I would assume that this movie is more likely to be enjoyed by the female population, I have no doubt that once the DVD comes out-my male acquaintances will equally find it amusing."
"pegd-1","7","2","3","13 December 2005"," Isn't It Romantic? Better than Comfort Food
","Saw it twice. The first time I went I realized that I had started an internal dialog comparing it to the 1995 5 hour plus mini-series, and this comparison continued throughout the entire picture. So I went a second time, put Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle out of my mind, and sat back and thoroughly enjoyed it. Just over two hours, the film is fun with all the comedy, silliness, and ups and downs of the Bennett family.<br/><br/>It's a great romp through Jane Austen's England, and I was surprised to read that this was the directorial debut of Joe Wright. Everyone sparkled in the film, although Mr. Collins seemed a step behind. Keira talks too fast or is it that she cuts off her words in certain scenes, and the background music sometimes overwhelms the spoken lines of the actors. Hats off to the new Darcy. He was excellent, seductive voice and looks better and better as the camera closes in on him. The chemistry was palpable. The cinematography and locations were very, very good. All in all, this film will satisfy those of us who are incurably romantic. I have a feeling that Jane Austen would have had a few chuckles watching her masterpiece come to life."
"iohefy-2","6","2","3","30 November 2005"," Two different opinions
","I went last night with my wife to see Pride and Prejudice because she wanted to see it so badly. As listed in the summary above we had different opinions of this well acted movie. I thought the story was a good one and the acting of Keira Knightley as the main love interest, and the mother Brenda Blethyn was outstanding. I thought that the acting by Matthew Mac Fadyen was stiff and had no body to it what so ever. On the other hand my wife thought all the acting was very good and liked the story very much. I know that this will not help in making a decision to see this film, but this is the honest opinion of two different people. Good Luck which ever way you go."
"colonel_green","9","2","3","27 November 2005"," An old-fashioned piece of film-making.
","First off, unlike so many posters and reviewers, I have not read Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"", nor have I seen the storied BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth, who apparently was to-die-for in a wet shirt. I approached this film knowing very little about the story or characters, beyond the most important plot points, and the fact that critics generally liked it. I liked it too; it was very enjoyable. The film has an absolutely terrific cast, including Academy Award-winning screen veterans Dame Judi Dench and Brenda Blethyn, and should-be Academy Award-winning Donald Sutherland; the young cast is led by Keira Knightley, Rosamund Pike (the allegedly more-attractive older sister), and Matthew MacFayden. All are terrific, although, as a man, the constant giggling of the Bennett sisters was occasionally too much. The film is gorgeously shot, and should earn Oscar nominations for set design, cinematography, and perhaps an acting nomination or two (Knightley is first in line, with Sutherland (whose part may be too small), Blethyn, and Pike not far behind). I give this film a strong recommendation, and a 9/10."
"Orator33","8","2","3","27 November 2005"," Different but surprisingly pleasing adaptation!
","I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I went in to see this movie. I've been a little bit of an Austen freak for many, many years so I *had* to see this movie, but I had qualms. Partly wondering what Hollywood would do to this classic, and partly wondering how Keira Knightley would carry off the role of Elizabeth. I was mildly disappointed on the first, but very much pleased on the second. To explain one, I have to explain the other so I'll do that.<br/><br/>The *worst* part of the movie is probably the fact that much of it felt rushed. They couldn't spend time on the different parts as they needed. It seemed like they were trying to make it artistic, but to me it still felt rushed. However, it was rushed because they were not cutting out nearly as many parts as I fully expected them to, so I cannot complain too much on that. Still, although this detracted from the enjoyment of the movie, I couldn't say that was what disappointed me. As my sister (yes, we are *all* Austen freaks) said, this was an adaptation but an interesting one. It's not in the mood of the book. Pride and Prejudice is heralded as Austen's most ""sparkling"" story. Rightly so. This movie does not convey that feeling; it is more ""somber"" as my sister put it. It's a different interpretation of the story. I enjoyed this even though it slightly disappointed me.<br/><br/>I was really impressed with Keira Knightley's portrayal of Lizzy. As I said I wasn't sure how she would do; I was afraid she would over act the part, and spoil it somewhat, but she did not by any means. Her acting was definitely the best in the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The character was slightly more somber than what Jane Austen has, but this was fitting for the rest of the film and done very well. She was witty, cute, and *real* for lack of a better word. I gave the movie and extra point for her.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was excellent too, in my opinion. Darcy and Mr. Bennet's characters were not like in the book but were nonetheless pleasing and very well acted. Matthew McFayden did a pretty fantastic job and I liked him a lot (this coming from a *former* ""only Colin"" advocate, I must admit). My only problem with his acting was that in some few parts he delivered his lines way too fast. Still as I said, he was surprisingly good. The rest of the cast did the characters straight from the book, and very well.<br/><br/>All in all I gave this movie 8 out of 10; extra points for what I considered good acting. The way the film was ""put together"" was a slight detractment, but I still enjoyed it and would see it again by all means!"

"gerryscott2001","Null","2","3","24 October 2005"," understanding how a book becomes a feature film
","A movie for the age, and a keeper for the ages,""Pride and Prejudice"" brings Jane Austen's best-loved novel to vivid, widescreen life, as well as making an undisputed star of 20-year-old Keira Knightley. Making positive use of actors closer to the characters' real ages, but also benefiting from a visual approach by young British director Joe Wright that melds realism with romance in a canny balance, film looks set to appeal to more than just Jane Austen purists.<br/><br/>Aficionados of the 1995 five-hour BBC miniseries, with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, won't necessarily be convinced by this big screen version. But anyone coming to the movie fresh and not demanding a chapter-by-chapter adaptation will respond to the picture's emotional sweep, sumptuous lensing and marvelous sense of ensemble. <br/><br/>Wright, 33, who comes from a realist tradition in British miniseries (""Charles II: The Power & the Passion""), and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, a novelist and miniseries adaptor in her own right, extract the youthful essence of Austen's novel, as well as providing a richly detailed setting. Scenes barely sketched in Austen's dialog heavy, description-light prose leap fully detailed onto the screen, thanks to Sarah Greenwood's terrific production design and Jacqueline Durran's textured costumes. <br/><br/>Taking their cue from when the novel was first written rather than published, both designers go for a softer, late 18th-century look rather than a stiffer early 19th-century one. More relaxed vibe fits better with an adaptation that gives a slightly modern twist to the characters. As an evocation of period English life in the shires, ""P&P,"" though set around a century earlier, is the most flavorsome since Phil Agland's under-rated version of Thomas Hardy's ""The Woodlanders."" <br/><br/>Moggach's solution to paring down the novel is to concentrate on Elizabeth (Knightley), the second of five daughters belonging to a couple (Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn) of reasonable but by no way lavish means. When news comes that a wealthy young bachelor, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), has moved into a nearby stately manor, Elizabeth's mother smells a convenient match in the making. <br/><br/>Film's knockout first reel, composed of two long sequences, scoops the viewer up into late 18th-century market-town life and the main characters' lives. Opening sequence, with the first of many long steadicam takes, follows Elizabeth as she walks up to and inside the family home. Pic then cuts straight to a local ball, where Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane (Rosamund Pike), comes under Bingley's eye but Elizabeth herself gets off on quite the wrong foot with Bingley's handsome but standoffish friend, Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). <br/><br/>As Elizabeth and Darcy start their convoluted, sour-sweet courtship, events swiftly etch the novel's main developments. Elizabeth becomes interested in a dashing soldier, Lt. Wickham (Rupert Friend), who has an awkward history with Darcy; meanwhile, she's pursued by a boring reverend, William Collins (Tom Hollander). <br/><br/>Initial set of romantic entanglements comes memorably together at the 35-minute mark in another, much more upscale ball, this time at Bingley's residence. Helmer Wright's use of long steadicam sequences and Moggach's ability to keep a large number of characters on the boil come into their own here. Elaborately but not showily choreographed, and giving the viewer a precise sense of social geography within the interlinked rooms, it's the movie's set piece, as Elizabeth negotiates advances from both Collins and Darcy. <br/><br/>Picture starts to tighten the emotional screws just prior to the hour mark, with the first entry of romantic piano-and-strings scoring. Darcy's passionate proposal, and Elizabeth's equally passionate rejection, show both actors at the top of their game, emotionally fueling the long final act and coda. <br/><br/>Looking every bit a star, Knightley, who's shown more spirit than acting smarts so far in her career, really steps up to the plate here, holding her own against the more classically trained Macfadyen (as well as vets like Blethyn, Sutherland and Judi Dench) with a luminous strength that recalls a young Audrey Hepburn. More than the older Ehle in the TV series, she catches Elizabeth's essential skittishness and youthful braggadocio, making her final conversion all the more moving. Thesp's only weakness is her over-clipped delivery, more Kensington than rural Hertfordshire. <br/><br/>Macfadyen makes Darcy a more conflicted, softer figure than Firth's indelibly etched performance, but one that fits the movie's more realistic mood. <br/><br/>Other casting is aces down the line, with Blethyn reining back her Mrs. Bennet into a believable mother hen, Sutherland overcoming a sometimes wobbly English accent in a performance that pays dividends at the end (in a beautiful scene with Knightley), and Dench perking up the picture at key moments as a waspishly commanding Lady Catherine. <br/><br/>Mass of smaller roles add texture to every scene, increasing the sense of ensemble and keeping the screen busy. Pike's well-meaning Jane is a touching study in selflessness, while Kelly Reilly's Caroline Bingley brings a tart sexual jealousy to her early scenes with Macfadyen and Knightley. <br/><br/>Film's most controversial changes are in the characters of Collins and Bingley, both of whom are used for comic relief. But despite being completely different from the novel's Collins, both physically and emotionally -- as well as being considerably older -- Hollander does make the role work dramatically in Moggach's condensation, allowing modern audiences a way into the social rituals without direct satire. <br/><br/>Amazingly, given the book's enduring popularity, this is only the second big screen version of the novel, 65 years after MGM's Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier black & white production, typical of studio-bound English literature productions of the period. Current production was entirely filmed on location, using a variety of period structures all around England."

","This film is refreshing it brings life into the book. Previous BBC adaptations were good but they lack the emotions of Kierra's fine performance you really believe these people are falling in love. Collins is great too. I was very surprised by how good it was I expected it to not come up to the standard of the BBC version. The way that the film deals with the time element of what took the BBC some 8 hours to achieve were well managed with intense scenes being inter-spaced with visual clues to show the passage of time or to move the plot between the key scenes. Photography was magnificent with the early morning mist in the final scene allowing the focus to be on the actors and not the scenery."

","Nowadays the world is full with books and movies about the greater love which destroys all the stereotypes and strict society rules. However, there are immortal world known love stories and truly my favourite one has recently been released as a wonderful movie ""Pride and Prejudice"".

During their first meeting, she thought he is too arrogant, while the behaviour of her relatives completely ruined his good attitude towards her. However, over time Elizabeth changes her opinion and realizes that behind this mask of arrogance, there is actually a kind and noble man. Their love survived through misunderstandings, social stereotypes and arrogance.<br/><br/>The film is a worthy adaptation of the book. Especially I want to mention the excellent play of the cast. The director managed to accurately capture not only the atmosphere of that century, but also the subtle flutter of the main characters' souls, which keeps viewers interested for the whole time. The film correctly reveals all the main twists of the plot.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching as it is a classic love story, that will never die."

","Excellence is ability, it is courage to dare to be excellent, it is luck to meet people who can appreciate you, and it is the same for women in ancient and modern China. What moved me most about Elizabeth was that she had never wronged her excellence. She transcends her time with her excellence. Jan Austin is good for the same reason. But it is not necessary to hold a hate for Zhang Ailing because it is also a kind of luck to meet others, although it cannot be compared with Sister Lin. Ai Ling must know that the common people have their own Qing Jiayun Road, and they must not imitate a fairyland.
I really like Elizabeth's sturdy figure by the lake, thoughtful and waiting. ""I'm patronizing, worry-free and fearless."" Her father's words are true. I worry that no one in the world can match you. His words are not right, don't worry that no one in the world can match you."

","Outstanding ... A timeless adaptation of a timeless Jane Austen novel. MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And again, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long."
"selinuyarlar","10","1","1","29 March 2019"," Truly beautiful.
","Starting off with Mr. Darcy; Matthew Macfadyen has definitely brought a whole new significance to the character, portraying the arrogant, socially awkward but also very dazzling leading male role. Despite his offensive pride and selfish disdain, Macfadyen shows the accessible side of Darcy, by depicting his vulnerable and fragile character behind his stiff manners. Thus, his portrayal makes his love for Elizabeth more believable. Moving on to Elizabeth Bennet; the female protagonist, is portrayed by the very successful Keira Knightley, who has many more leading female roles in the period movies such as; Anna Karenina, The Imitation Game, Atonement, The Duchess, A Dangerous Method etc., making her very experienced on the portrayal of such women. She brings out different aspects of the character while giving her the adequate sense of humor with the lively intelligence and sharp-minded wit. Her performance in the movie makes the chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy much more affectionate. Starting off with the pride of Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth, the transition of abomination to ardent love is reflected so elegantly, with the shots from the rain scene, to the breathtaking sunrise, that it is impossible to resist the romance.
As for the production and direction of the movie, it is adapted perfectly. The cinematography captures the environment with such wide and spectacular frames, which makes the movie, even more, prettier with the gorgeous scenery.
All in all, Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books and the movie is beautifully made, reflecting the book accurately as the brilliant classic it is. I can easily say that the story itself, the actors and the characters have ''bewitched me body and soul and I love, I love, I love it.''"
"rockazertyrock","10","1","1","26 January 2019"," Absolutely Perfect 2 Hour Adaptation!
","While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done.
Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagine that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here.
The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies.
This Pride and Prejudice adaptation perfectly captured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of Jane Austen's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it many times, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much of the dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of the more subtle dynamics of the novel.
But this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing! True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it has to rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authentic and true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. You simply do not want it to end...<br/><br/>All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving."
"hsabgardner","10","1","1","1 January 2019"," One of the true classics.
","I read the book half a century ago, so I have not watched it with aggressive attention to the details that many do. I watch the movie as one familiar with the story, but not obsessive about minutia.<br/><br/>What is important about this film is that the story is fantastically done. The casting was well done, every character has their role perfected.<br/><br/>One thing that stands alone with this high budget version is the magnificence of the film. The sights and sounds of the countryside, the marvelous scenes and sets, the score, the film can absorb you completely.<br/><br/>Watch it on a large screen and let yourself be overwhelmed."

"maxastree","8","1","1","27 August 2016"," Excellent remake of a remade remake.
","The lighting, costume design and art direction alone make this film a standout, but also the cinematography and editing match the material and make this ""timeless"" film highly entertaining.<br/><br/>In Joe Wright's high-end retelling of the story, a young woman at the lowest, and most economically vulnerable end of the landed gentry of early 1800's England, must find a suitable partner. The man she finds is basically a total asshat, but as the plot unfolds, it's revealed that the negative allegation's made against him aren't actually true, and although his family would forbid it, he's prepared to transcend the class structure of his era for ""pure love"".<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is effortlessly beautiful in every scene, even when she falls in the mud or throws a tantrum, she basically grits into a photogenic grimace, and her 'petulant' look somewhat betrays the underlying entitlement of the actress.<br/><br/>The weather is perfect in every scene though and every prop, costume piece, window frame and even sagging, unappealing street view looks like a work of art.<br/><br/>The film's romantic core is something of a contradiction; ultimately, Bennett is a sexually attractive woman of lower social standing and the pompous, self-regarding Mr Darcy that loves her has a lot of money and property - making the plot seem somewhat more like a marriage of material gain rather than anything remotely revolutionary.<br/><br/>Regardless, generations of new readers pick up Jane Austin's classics, although as a newcomer you can be left wondering a little as to what readers see in their literary hero's concept; Austin's story is essentially a film about a women's lack of self-determination in an era before any real political and labor representation, and the film wallows in the pretensions and resentments of Britain's entrenched class system of yore. Thank god for the Sex Pistols."
"sharonjessicasinurat","6","1","1","27 July 2016"," Far under my expectation. But not really bad.
","To be noted, I've read the novel but never watched any adaptation of it, except this version.<br/><br/>When I read the novel, I thought this was a great story. I fell in love with Mr. Darcy, absolutely. And, I had my own imagination of Mr. Darcy in real life. I started to imagine a charming Mr. Darcy, though not in a really clear image. When I see the glimpses of Mr. Darcy in this movie, I thought it was Mr. Darcy totally brought into life. Actually I imagined Mr. Darcy was slimmer and younger than Matthew Macfadyen was and had no idea of Mr. Darcy's hairstyle in my imagination. So, Matthew Macfadyen wasn't a total resemblance to my imagination of Mr. Darcy but I thought he's far better, physically, than my imagination of Mr. Darcy. I felt so enthusiastic, couldn't bear myself to wait to watch the movie.<br/><br/>But, when I watched the movie, all my expectations were ruined. The main actor and actress, Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley, were far from personality-resemblance with Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. I couldn't feel the admiring-and-loving sense of Mr. Darcy toward Elizabeth that were repressed by the sense of pride. Even I didn't know at which time in the movie he started to admire Elizabeth. (Anyway, I'd been informed that Matthew Macfadyen had never read the novel, he only read the script, which really lacked of originality; and it's proved by his poor playing of Mr. Darcy's role) And, about Keira Knightley, I thought the director's opinion not to place her in Elizabeth role (which I'd been informed by an article before watching the movie, but I felt sure that Keira Knightley could still nail it) was true. I didn't feel the liveliness of Elizabeth in her. Instead, she looked much giggling like a freak. (Sorry, Keira. Perhaps, it's true, the role wasn't for you.)<br/><br/>Next, the plot. Really, really, ruined. What I really loved from Pride & Prejudice were the awkward but lovely moments of sudden meetings of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. But, the scriptwriter just did trims and changes everywhere, unfortunately, at my favorite scenes of such meetings. 1. At Collinses Parsonage. When Mr. Darcy came there to find that there's only Elizabeth. There ought to be more to the conversation. There ought to be more fun awkward moments. And the next days, when Mr. Darcy often came to the Parsonage just to meet Elizabeth, such scenes weren't presented in the movie. 2. When he proposed to Elizabeth for the first time. The proposal should had been preceded by Mr. Darcy rushing to inquiry the Elizabeth's health. Instead of showing such scene, the movie presents such proposal-and- quarreling scene under the rain. I didn't know what's going on the scriptwriter's mind. She, perhaps, thought it'd be so dramatic but for me, it made the story looked so poor. 3. At Pemberley House. You know the scene's totally different from what it ought to be. It'd be amazing if Elizabeth got a total astonishment of meeting Mr. Darcy, just like how the novel told. Instead, the movie used a really ordinary way of their meeting in Pemberley.<br/><br/>Then, about the deepest things about the story, Elizabeth's and Mr. Darcy's characters (the pride and prejudice) and relationship. The pride and prejudice weren't described well by the story (whereas, ""Pride & Prejudice"" title clearly told how the story ought to be). About relationship, I could hardly see true love between them. I couldn't see the depth in the relationship. You know, there were just too many scenes. The movie, though had been much trimmed, seemed to be still long, seemed rushing from one scene to another, and failed to reach the heart of the relationship.<br/><br/>And, there were a lot more details that weren't really good. I just couldn't tell each of them here. My review would be to long.<br/><br/>However, I could tolerate it because the movie only had 2-hours duration, which definitely wasn't adequate to present the span and the depth of the original story.<br/><br/>I tried to tolerate the lack-of-originality of the story. Perhaps, the scriptwriter, the director, or whoever behind this lack- of-originality, wanted to focus much on mere love story and want to make it much easily accepted by modern audience. <br/><br/>It would be unbalanced if I only told the negative sides. So, I'd tell what I liked from the movie. 1. Of course, Matthew Macfadyen. Instead of being failed in playing Mr. Darcy's role, He's physically the perfect version of Mr. Darcy. And, I loved his silky voice. His voice sounded like so perfectly romantic. With these such perfect physical animation of Mr. Darcy, perhaps, if the script-writing was perfect, he could explore more in Mr. Darcy's character, and he'd do much better in his role. 2. Pianoforte-playing that became the soundtrack of the movie. It really engaged me to the story, brought me to the very situation of the story. 3. The settings (especially in the balls) and the costumes really entertained my eyes. 4. The Bennetts. The opening scenes framing them really entertained me. Throughout the movie, it's always fun to see the Bennetts. One of the most amusing is Mary. She looked really ignorant and indifferent in many things, yet so funny. 5. The beauty of Bennett sisters, just like what the novel told. 6. When Mr. Darcy took Elizabeth's hand when accompanying her to get on the carriage. So awkward yet fun. 7. Despite the negatives and positives, I always admired old-time-setting British films.<br/><br/>So, I decided to give 6 out of 10 stars for the movie. And, I decided to watch the 1995 mini-series version for seeking out more original film adaptation of the story."

","Pride & Prejudice is the good movie than I've thought I would. People who don't read Pride & Prejudice of Jane Austen should watch this film because this movie is not same content as historical book. Unlike now, at this era man rarely say that I love you and I feel painful and I'm sorry. Student like me maybe know that, but can't imagine that. By watching Pride & Prejudice, students can fully understand the rank and position of men. Also, in this movie there are many scenes of countryside and scenery. People must be moved by them and can feel calm. Many wonderful cloth that women wear are so beautiful, so people who watch this movie maybe attracted.

The back music is quiet. The music is a perfect match for the landscape. It is great. The movie shows the audience culture on that time. For example, Elizabeth, a main character, and her family go to the party and dance with men. It looks good and fantastic. Also, Elizabeth's and Darcy's love is impatient. I hope they notice their each feelings quickly. Darcy has pride and Elizabeth has prejudice. His pride and her prejudice interfere with their love. However their love is beautiful. The audience can see their love developing. In the movie, there are a lot of points of seeing. The audience should watch the movie very carefully and find good points."

The only annoying part in this movie was Brenda Blethyn who played Mrs. Bennet, she was a bit over the top in the movie. Donald Sutherland was perfect as the part of Mr. Bennet.

","Although I have a great fondness for the MGM version of Pride And Prejudice that came out in 1940 probably this English version of the pinnacle of Jane Austen's literary talents is probably closer to what she had in mind. Women have certainly come a long way since those Victorian times Ms. Austen chronicled so well.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethlyn play the Bennetts the proud parents of five lovely daughters that is a source of great concern. In those days with no careers open to women the idea is marry well. The parents are concerned that suitable matches are made for them. One daughter Jane looks to marry a handsome and pleasant but rather dull young man named Bingley. Looking good till Bingley's friend Darcy warns him off the husband hunting Bennett clan.<br/><br/>This sets up the main plot of the story the growing love of Jane's sister Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley and Darcy played by Matthew MacFayden. Both read each other wrong at first. Darcy like all the others is first shocked by Elizabeth who does not conform to Victorian standards for young women, she speaks her mind. And Elizabeth misreads Darcy's character totally at first. It turns out that character is something he has a lot of.<br/><br/>This version of Pride And Prejudice got four Oscar nominations including Keira Knightley for Best Actress. One of the other nominations was for Art&Set Design. The 1940 MGM version won the Oscar for Art&Set Design for what they created on MGM's back lot. Here the cinematography and the sets made ample use of the English countryside. See these versions back to back and see which one you think did better in the Art&Set Department.<br/><br/>As for the story Jane Austen and her times continue to fascinate."

"JohnRayPeterson","7","1","1","4 February 2012"," An 1813 novel, a timeless love story and a media fit to revive it.
","It is no mystery that this most successful Jane Austen novel did so well in the TV miniseries and has repeated the feat in this 2005 film. Over the years, many movies of love stories between people of dissimilar classes and or culture have always found an audience and a faithful one; the struggle to overcome what separates the lovers from their destiny is what fantasies were made for.<br/><br/>The movie, as you would expect with its wonderful cast, brings to life the characters as vividly as one would have hoped. The cinematography punctuates the palaver with beautiful quiet moments that allows the audience to take in human nature's flaws of false virtues and ruminate over the solution to overcome them. The director's job was to do just that it seems to me, and Joe Wright did it well. Few characters have been cited or referred to in other works (movies or plays), such as that of Elizabeth Bennet, with the possible exception of Jane Eyre of course, typical with the leads in classics. Keira Knightly, I thought, was made for this part; the camera loves her. The bodacious Rosamund Pike, in the role of Jane Bennet, acquitted herself equally well; with all the experience and training she possesses, I would have expected nothing less. Matthew Macfadyen, in the role of Mr. Darcy, excelled at playing the reserved and aloof character; reigning in all manners of emotions, well most anyway, was called for and the choice of Macfadyen was admittedly a smart one. Collin Firth had already played the part so well in the miniseries (so I read), that any other actor might have felt the challenge of such a part; Macfadyen appeared not to, and this is much to his credit. Besides, Jane Austen's dialogue was not to be overshadowed by visuals and non verbals, simply highlighted. I was very pleased with Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn in the roles of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.<br/><br/>In this era where the bookworm has been replaced by a fixated erudite, I can't think of a better way to initiate the youth to a beautiful classic than by having it told in the media that is the replacement to the manuscript. Try prying the iPad away from a focused preteen and watch the reaction; I would have sooner skipped a meal than put down my favourite book. Okay my youth was not that typical. So it goes with today's new generation; I hope the movie finds that young audience, and with the story in film, the likelihood is that more possible."
"Dewens","6","1","1","10 January 2010"," Doesn't quite make it all the way
","I desperately wanted to like this adaptation, but the odds where against me from the start since I'm not very fond of Kiera Knightley as an actress, although she did a decent job portraying Elizabeth Bennet. <br/><br/>The first problem is the casting which is almost completely wrong all the way through. I don't have a anything against the actors as such, they are all brilliant, but not right for their roles. The only roles that are right is the one of Mr Bingley, his sister and Jane. Donald Sutherland who is one of the most brilliant actors around doesn't quite come to his right. This might be due to the poorly written script or because none of the actors fit.<br/><br/>Another problem is the length of the film. We do not have time to get to know the characters and they are forced upon us in the most obnoxious way. Everything is rushed and there is no natural flow.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem and the one that really made me dislike the film is all the historical and etiquette errors in the film. There are so many of them that it is impossible for me to overlook them. Here I will at times quote another review I read at amazon.com<br/><br/>Elizabeth showing up at Netherfield with her hair down around her shoulders. It would not happen, and Elizabeth (the character) would have been mortified to be seen so (especially by people she detested). It is enough and unusual enough that the hem of her dress was covered in mud.<br/><br/>Mr. Bingley coming into Jane's bedroom at Netherfield. I don't care if she was on the verge of dying that very minute, it would never happen. <br/><br/>Mr. Bennett apologizing and consoling a crying Mary after he ordered her to stop ""exhibiting"" on the piano. This is a serious breach of the character for him. The essence (and fun) of Mr. Bennett is that he is detached (emotionally and usually physically) from his family (except at times from Jane and Elizabeth). <br/><br/>Lady Catherine showing up to confront Elizabeth at night, and Elizabeth (as well as her entire family) receiving her in their nightclothes. Again, none of these things would happen. Not only are both of these things severe breaches of etiquette, but they also are large steps out of character for all involved. <br/><br/>5Elizabeth walking outside in the dawn in her nightgown. Again, a large breach of etiquette. Elizabeth would have dressed even before going downstairs, much less outside. Not only would Elizabeth have been embarrassed to find herself this way when she sees Darcy striding over in the distance, but Darcy would have been shocked to see her that way as well.<br/><br/>Darcy just walking over to her house at the end. Not only is it way too early in the morning for him to be calling, but he comes over partially dressed. Now, remember that this is the most staunch, prideful, proper character in the history of literature. I don't care how in love he is, he is not going to show up at the house of the woman he loves without getting fully dressed first.<br/><br/>But there are some golden moments in this film that I will never forget.<br/><br/>1. The scene where Darcy hands Elizabeth into the carriage and as he walks away, he has to flex his hand because he can still feel the heat of her touching him. (Very sexy).<br/><br/>2. The proposal in the rain, and the sensual, deep look on Darcy's face when she told him no. (Also very sexy).<br/><br/>But these two moments, I am sorry to say does not make up for the many errors in the film."
"anusha_chellappa","8","1","1","6 October 2006"," Interesting though not flawless effort
","The latest version of P&P delights one with its cinematography and beautiful cast but is not without its inherent flaws. I have loved the book for many years now and so I cannot wholeheartedly consent that this is the vision Jane Austen (JA) had, especially since many people will try to take a shortcut to learning what the book is about through the visual medium . It is therefore imperative to give warning that this is not what she or her book is about in totality. I do not doubt the casting, for JA does not give minutest portrayal of looks beyond tall or short ,pretty or simple, fat or thin etc. SO one may take liberties for want of better information (with the exception of Mr. Collins who is much too short to suit the book and perhaps his clumsiness on the floor has been downplayed because of it. Being short he is easily ignored but because he is in reality/fiction a tall man he is very obviously absurdhence the director loses the physical advantage at the very outset) Mr. Darcy and Mrs. Bennet are much too apologetic of and euphemise their character flaws when they are quite the essence of the storya Mr. Darcy who is just reserved and taciturn would not suit the title at all. In all other ways he is quite apt though. There is no need to explain her mercenary attitude towards her daughters, the idea is both amusing and practical and an intelligent audience would be able to appreciate both angles. But she is seen explaining her rationale and her methods and thinking which is unnecessary and goes against her character and takes away from her absurdity which is a pity. I liked the openly vivacious portrayal of Lizzy but sans the blatant rudeness towards her mother. It is not only not a part of Elizabeth's sweet temperament and her respect for her mother at least as a parent but also quite a useless weapon in the face of her mother's total disregard of anything sensible and subtle. Also Lizzy would not have been so affected by Mr. Darcy's criticism of her looks. She would have sooner laughed at his absurd directness and superior scorn in such a sensitive matter. Here she looks hurt and takes revengenot a trait in Elizabeth. But the scenes delight all the same. Just know that is not what the book says. What is most preposterous, presumptuous, outrageous and basically unacceptable is the total lack of respect for the sort of language that would have been prevalent in that period. There is simply no excuse for this liberty since it does not find its place in the movie even. A totally miscalculated attempt at some very crass humour. I can't imagine anyone finding it funny even if they are not familiar with the lines of the book. It is too anachronistic to evoke anything but disgust. Also unnecessary was the interchange of dialogues between characters. A good writer has ample reason for choosing her characters to say certain dialogues. It is mostly in keeping with the character. Using the same for keeping everyone in the scene in conversation is hardly good direction. On the plus side the confrontations between the leads are interesting and passionate though like everyone else I am disappointed with the way it ends. It all seem to fizzle out as it reaches the climaxlike all other elements in life? It was heartwarming to see the portrayal of Mary's relative insignificance in the household affairs, Lydia's frank and uncensored manners and conversations, Kitty's impressionable and sensitive airs. But of all the sisters, perhaps even better than Keira Knightley's Lizzy, Jane is best and most honestly portrayed. She is pretty, sweet, gentle, unassuming, friendly but reserved and sedate at all times and yet never dull. She expressed much through her eyes and is in all senses very satisfying. I could not find anything wanting in her character depiction. Of course the same cannot be said of Mr. Bingley who seems to attempt to equal Mr. Collins in silliness. It is amusing to start with but Mr. Bingley is not absurd or silly he is simply modest and easily persuaded. That is not a crime or a flaw that repulses. One is not repulsed by Bingley here but you know better than to think a Jane, as we have here, would be interested in such a Bingley.<br/><br/>So all in all it is far from a masterpiece but it is a good collective effort without his base completely in the book. It would have been better for someone with years of reflection on the book to have directed than someone who read it superficially. The book has stood the test of time for 200 plus years it is not to be unraveled over one reading!!<br/><br/>An ardent admirer of Pride and Prejudice"
"ivette1742","Null","1","1","8 April 2006"," Which ending is better: US vs British.
","I haven't had the time to read all of the message board entries, but have to smile at how much the writers are comparing the US ending to the British ending, deciding one over the other. I myself enjoy the US ending, but actually wanted more still. This is DARCY, dang it! After all that teasing, I want more than a few kisses around the face!!! Definitely more. Having said that, the US ending allowed us to imagine what may come next, since we get to finally see Darcy in his most romantic mode. What's wrong with that? I have loved this book since I first read it 30 yrs ago and I visit it often. Jane Austen successfully conveyed what could be written in her times, with enough undercurrents that any remake has many avenues to take if they want to develop ideas and take the audience in other directions. Such a small book with such a big heart! I thoroughly enjoy the 1995 miniseries version and find it a classic. It (and Colin Firth, of course!) is my benchmark. So I watched the 2005 movie with a bit of trepidation, especially with such a stylized set-up and the two main characters appearing to have to take a big stretch to reach their roles, Especially Matthew MacFadyen. But then, I had read that his version would win you over as you saw the character develop. I am very pleased to say, I could see that and enjoyed the film. Finally seeing him not be shy, in the US ending, really gave him depth and allowed us to see just HOW MUCH Elizabeth could be happy with him. And - although it left me wanting to see more - it gave me visions to dream about. And THAT is truly a successful ending to a film - that it allows you to carry it with you long after the movie is over.<br/><br/>My only other observations are: 1. I didn't get why she ran to that building in the rain and how Darcy happened to go there, too. Did I miss something or was it a coincidence? Any to see romantic turbulence in drenching rain! 2. I was able to enjoy how Mrs Bennet really loved her daughters and was driven by the despair of having five daughters to marry off, with three of them appearing ""unmarriable"" with their personalities.I was able to dislike her less. 3. What a nice surprise in Donald Southerland's version of Mr Bennet. His last scenes were so heartwarming. But I'm glad I have the DVD that didn't end it there! (Ladies, all together: Darcy! Darcy! Darcy!) <br/><br/>And to my fellow Austenites, it's a pleasure to read your views on this story. As a foreign language teacher, I push Jane Austen on my students constantly even though it's not in my curriculum, so as to have them get a feel of what life was like in the early 1800's. You prove that this book is alive and well.<br/><br/>Take care, Ivette"

","I was rather disappointed when I watched the movie. I have read the novel many times; over and over again and it's one of my favourites of all time. I guess I was expecting a lot but for me I feel the movie failed to deliver to my expectations. I found the storyline rather choppy; jumping from one plot to another without warning. People who have not read the novel would find it rather confusing. I watched the movie with my sister-in-law and I ended up having to explain to her the plot because she couldn't make head or tail of it. The movie which had Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy was better; in terms of storyline and acting. I am surprised that Keira Knightley was actually nominated for and Oscar for her role as Elisabeth Bennet. The storyline never really truly allowed her to shine."
"Red-125","7","1","1","27 November 2005"," A for Effort, but that's not enough.
","""Pride & Prejudice"" (2005), directed by Joe Wright, is an honest--but not very effective--attempt to bring Jane Austen's novel to the screen.<br/><br/>The plot of the novel and the film boils down to the love/hate relationship between Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). I thought MacFayden was adequate as Darcy, although possibly somewhat coarse in appearance and manners. (Darcy is a snob, but he should be portrayed as an elegant snob.)<br/><br/>Keira Knightley obviously works hard at portraying Elizabeth Bennet. She's a fine actor, but she's very much a 21st Century woman, and I had trouble accepting her in this period piece. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I never caught any true chemistry between the two lead actors, and, without that, nothing else can really work well.<br/><br/>Simon Woods was miscast and/or misdirected in his role as Mr. Bingley. Bingley may not have the strength of character that Darcy has, but he shouldn't be portrayed as a callow fool.<br/><br/>All the other actors did a competent job, especially Rosamund Pike who was luminous as Jane Bennet (Elizabeth's older sister), and Kelly Reilly, as the very beautiful and vicious Caroline Bingley.<br/><br/>The outdoor scenes were predictably colorful--what director can resist dogs, pigs, geese, chickens, ducks, and swans in a period film? However, I found these scenes--as well as the ball scenes--to be overly orchestrated and too meticulous.<br/><br/>Finally, I can't see how any discussion of this film could suggest that it was overly sexual. I can't even understand why it was given a PG rating--I think G would have been more appropriate. There's one instance of male nudity, but the genitalia belong to a pig. There's one instance of female nudity, but the female portrayed is a statue. There are many reasons to see or not see ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but excessive sexuality shouldn't be among them.<br/><br/>In summary, I think this movie represents a sincere attempt at the cinematic portrayal of a great work of fiction. I think the director didn't succeed in this attempt, but the film isn't a disaster, and it's worth seeing as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece."
"larapu2000","1","6","15","17 June 2007"," I Was Appalled!
","This movie makes huge mistakes with the Darcy character. The two most glaring are his two proposals to Elizabeth. Austen's Darcy would NEVER have accosted her outdoors, in the rain for god's sakes, to make his proposal to her. He would have been the perfect, proper gentleman. After all, it is his perfect, proper gentleman that makes us love him and agonize over the love between he and Elizabth. The second proposal is far, far worse. He accosts Elizabeth in the early morning hours in his pajamas! Arrgghhh. The best example of how Darcy conducts himself is exemplified in the book when he goes for a swim in the lake and comes upon Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle and is outwardly horrified at his misdress in front of guests.<br/><br/>The butchering of Austen's dialogue also made me ill. She writes so beautifully, so cleverly, and so subtly that it needs no improvement. The scene where Charlotte tells Elizabeth that she is engaged to Mr. Collins is one of the worst (and Emma Thompson did the re-write on it!) ever. ""Don't you judge me, Lizzy."" Terrible. Just terrible.<br/><br/>Finally, the last scene between Darcy and Elizabeth that was stolen from Sixteen Candles is an abomination. Gag me with a spoon.<br/><br/>I honestly wouldn't have liked this movie had I not read the book and seen the BBC miniseries with the phenomenal Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. It was turned into a horrid, predictable chick flick by the director and screenwriter."
"JamesHitchcock","8","6","15","27 September 2005"," The New Definitive Elizabeth Bennet
","Although it is probably her best-known novel, and the only one which had previously been filmed, in 1940 with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, ""Pride and Prejudice"" seemed to miss out in the great Jane Austen cycle of the late nineties which saw filmed versions of ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Mansfield Park"", ""Persuasion"" and two of ""Emma"". The reason was doubtless that film-makers feared comparisons with the highly popular British television adaptation from 1995. The makers of this film obviously felt that memories of that series have faded over the last decade, but the comments on this board suggest that that is not so and that Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are still the definitive Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in many people's minds.<br/><br/>The director Joe Wright seems to have had the quite deliberate intention of giving the film a different look to that normally associated with Jane Austen, presumably in order to differentiate it from other cinema and television adaptations of her works. It is set in the 1790s, the decade in which the novel was written, rather than in the 1810s, the decade in which most Austen adaptations are set. (The 1940 version, however, was updated to the 1840s, according to legend because the studio had just made another film with an early Victorian setting and wanted to reuse the sets and costumes). The social divisions between the lovers are emphasised more than usual; Mr Darcy's home Pemberly is represented by Chatsworth House, one of England's grandest stately homes, whereas the Bennets are shown as impoverished country gentry living in a shabby manor house.<br/><br/>Having seen the latest version I can say that, for me at least, there is a new definitive Elizabeth, the lovely Keira Knightley who brings out all the wit, charm, spirit and determination of Austen's heroine. She is also suitably fresh and youthful, which is important. There is evidence from her books that Austen regarded even women in their late twenties (like Anne Elliott in ""Persuasion"" or Charlotte Lucas in ""Pride and Prejudice"" itself) as being past their prime as far as marriage was concerned. She would have been very surprised to learn that in the twentieth century her heroines would be played by actresses in their late thirties; Greer Garson was 36 in 1940, as was Emma Thompson when she made ""Sense and Sensibility"" in 1995.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I cannot say that I was as impressed by Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy. Olivier and Firth both played him as a traditional, impeccably dressed English gentleman. MacFadyen's Darcy, with his long hair, open-necked shirts and farouche manner, is an improbably Byronic figure, more reminiscent of a Heathcliff or Mr Rochester come straight from the windswept moors than of an Austen hero. (Byron had a considerable influence on the younger generation of novelists such as the Brontes, but none at all on his older contemporary Austen, who disapproved of his morals). Colin Firth was able to convey a sense that underneath his calm, unruffled exterior Darcy was a man of strong emotions; MacFadyen has a wilder, more romantic look, but there is no sense of anything going on beneath the surface.<br/><br/>One of the advantages of a television as opposed to a cinematic adaptation of a classic novel is that the former generally has a longer running time and can therefore follow the plot more closely. A two-hour feature film will inevitably involve a greater amount of condensation than will a five-hour series, and one of the effects of this is that characters tend to be less well developed. (Because of the differences between the two media, I will not venture an opinion as to whether this ""Pride and Prejudice"" was better than the BBC's version). In order to concentrate on the Elizabeth/Darcy romance, a number of Austen's other interesting characters are rather downplayed in this film, such as the dashing but caddish seducer Wickham, the teenage wild child Lydia and the second main pair of lovers, Darcy's friend Bingley and Elizabeth's sister Jane.<br/><br/>The film does, however, bring out well the comic elements of the plot- I heard far more laughter in the cinema than is normal when costume dramas are being shown. The humour mostly arises from Austen's social satire at the expense of figures such as the arrogant and imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, well played by Judy Dench as a faded relic of an earlier age, still defiantly wearing in her old age the fashions of her youth, and the pompous and obsequious clergyman Mr Collins (a great performance from Tom Hollander), forever fawning on his patron Lady Catherine. I also liked Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth's eccentric parents, even if Sutherland's unkempt, unshaven Mr Bennet was not quite how I imagined the character in the book.<br/><br/>In all, I felt that this was one of the better Austen adaptations of recent years, on a par with Ang Lee's very different ""Sense and Sensibility"", and certainly better than the rather odd ""Mansfield Park"". 8/10"
"Specialestboy","8","6","15","27 September 2005"," surpasses the 1995 mini series
","Many people seem to have watched this film with the view in mind that the BBC series is the yardstick against which all P&P renditions should be measured. This would be quite wrong. Aside form the obvious flaw of a film not being able to cover as much as a series, there are many flaws in the series which are overcome by this film. The first thing that fans of the series will notice is that the house the bennets live in is far smaller than the BBC's choice. This immediately establishes the social standing and financial position of the family. Secondly the choice of Kira Knightly (isn't she lovely) as Elizabeth Bennet was a far better choice than Jennifer Ehle because Jennifer Ehle was just too darn old! Kira made Elizabeth Bennet seem like the young witty girl who does not think before she humours, where as Jennifer made her seem old enough to know better and rude! But the final usurping moment came from Brenda Blethyn's portrayal of Mrs Bennet. Although it may have been hilarious to laugh at this character in the BBC series, with her flouncing about, getting in a huff about all her girls, and of course screaming 'Oh Mr Bennet!', this extremely unfair to the character, who is quite right! She knows that these girls must all be married or be destitute. They had no inheritance, nowhere to go, and no prospect of sustaining themselves in the late 18th century. Breda Blethyn turns Mrs Bennet from the BBC costume drama clown into a reasonable character. All in all this film far surpasses 'the original' as people see it."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","12","10 October 2008"," Dazzling To Look At And True To The Book But Needed A Stronger Leading Pair
","Wright's adaptation of Austen's novel is quite true to the book and a much better film compared to the other 'recent' adaptation being Gurinder Chaddha's 'Bride and Brejudice'. The visuals are dazzling and the writing is impressive but at times the pace moves a bit too slow. I liked Wright's attention to the time period as he presents the costumes, the actors' body language, the class distinction, the settings and the language very accordingly. The cinematography, especially the long shots at the party sequence, is brilliant and the score is soothing. Keira Knighley performs better than in any of her other films but she's still miscast. She just doesn't seem to have the suitable nuances that are required to play Lizzie Bennet. Matthew Macfadyen is one of the most unconvincing Darcy's ever (another miscast indeed). He gives the film an unnecessary melodramatic touch and goes over the top with his expressions. However, the supporting cast (with the exception of an irritating Jena Malone) that includes Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Rosamund Pike and Tom Hollander perform very well. On the whole, I liked it most for the visuals and the supporting cast and appreciate it for being true to the books but it required a stronger lead pair. My favourite adaptation (albeit a very loose one) remains Sharon Maguire's 'Bridget Jones's Diary' (I haven't seen the BBC series yet)."
"noralee","10","5","12","14 November 2005"," An Exuberant Interpretation Faithful to Austen
","""Pride & Prejudice"" is a ""Gilmore Girls"" take on Jane Austen and it is delightful.<br/><br/>Much as I loved the BBC's mini-series the last decade and didn't think we could possible need another version, adapter Deborah Moggach (with help from Emma Thompson) and director Joe Wright have shot the story through with adrenaline so that everyone is a lot more lively (with a throw down to the 1940 version as being portrayed by too-old folks and this is the first adaptation where all are the right age). This is a classic personified by emotional people not stuffed icons.<br/><br/>While there is too much landscape admiration from the opening dawn on, the crowded Bennet household is immediately captured as filled with five noisy, twittering sisters surrounded by household laundry. This liveliness is particularly noteworthy in the simply danced ball scenes, which are as crowded as a downtown dance club and are brimming with youthful energy and flirtations (this is the first adaptation I've seen that clearly distinguishes between public and private balls in costumes and attitudes). While fully clothed in modest period costumes, the exuberance injects the awareness of bodies as a visual subtext.<br/><br/>This constant buzz serves as a marvelous foil for an extremely dour, almost Eeyore-gloomy ""Mr. Darcy"" and serves to emphasize his social awkwardness in situations where every young non-snob is just having a jolly good time. Surrounded as he is by much more amiable guy friends, just when you think that Matthew MacFadyen's ""disagreeable man"" could not possibly appeal to Keira Knightly's live wire ""Elizabeth Bennet,"" he creates sudden sexual tension in the pouring rain at his first, obnoxiously-worded proposal that builds up to a moment as charged as Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed on the phone in ""It's A Wonderful Life."" He later in the relaxed comfort of his own home splits the screen with a warm smile that suddenly makes the viewer (and ""Lizzie"") aware of his beautiful blue eyes, though we don't get to see his sister's startled response to their pre-Spencer/Hepburn competitive raillery.<br/><br/>The men are portrayed much more sympathetically and rounded than previous versions, for the benefit of the few guys in the audience dragged by the women in their lives. Though dad Donald Sutherland, barely trying to do a British accent but enjoying not being the villain he's been playing recently, prefers solace with his pigs, oddly, to dealing with his family as much as in his library, his paternal affection clearly comes through and he is more bemused, as in the book, than hen-pecked, as in other adaptations. Though we don't get to hear ""Darcy""s charming soldier cousin's speech about how he needs to marry a woman with money to balance ""Lizzie""s best friend's similar practical analysis, we do see, quite amusingly, just how anxious and nervous both ""Darcy"" and ""Bingley"" are in the presence of the objects of their affections. We are all indeed fools in love.<br/><br/>Knightly starts out seeming to be more ""Jo"" from ""Little Women,"" but shines with the fast-paced repartee, especially in scenes where she talks circles around the socially inept ""Darcy,"" let alone his snobby friends and relatives. Her ""gotcha"" scenes of self-realization, however, are less effective than the comparable moments by Emma Thompson in ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Gwyneth Paltrow"" in Emma as the director substitutes extensive close-ups for expressions that would communicate her intelligent thoughts. The frequent shots slowly going out of focus, usually to indicate time passing, are also annoying.<br/><br/>There is great emphasis on the social satire, with humor from chuckles to laugh out loud funny, propelled by the busy music (which despite the complaints of the woman in back of me was of the period), and the crowded matinée I saw it at the opening weekend responded actively. Tom Hollander is a marvelous ""Mr. Collins"" without making the minister too clownish. Brenda Blethyn brings unexpected depth to the exasperating ""Mrs. Bennet,"" even if her riposte to ""Mr. Collins"" that they can still afford a cook and warning to ""Lizzie"" about just wait until you have five daughters aren't in the book. Dame Judi Dench is in no need of tight close-ups to carry off ""Lady Charlotte"", as she could be imperious to the last row of Giants Stadium, despite a hair-do that does seem more 1970's New Jersey than Second Empire. Jena Malone has a ball in what might be her first period work, even as her rambunctious ""Lydia"" falls to temptation as other characters she has played. <br/><br/>Theopulence of ""Darcy""s Pemberley is so staggering that it does make ""Elizabeth"" seem too impressed by his wealth and gives quite a ring of truth to his professed prejudices against her. The opening shot with its lake does tease us about the BBC version as he does not emerge from the lake. It is also a bit obvious to put sensuality forefront to have the mansion filled with voluptuous sculptures rather than the paintings and portrait gallery described in the book.<br/><br/>While the erotic mise en scene of the second proposal is more out of Bronte than Austen (my sister-in-law was shocked to see them perambulating outdoors practically in their nightclothes), ""Darcy""s lengthy, open-shirted stride through the mists of dawn practically elicited swoons from the audience. <br/><br/>A for some reason U.S.-only coda is completely faithful in spirit to the book, which did not end in the double wedding so frequently falsely portrayed in adaptations, even if the dialog itself, oddly, was not, as there is a parallel interchange that could easily have been used.<br/><br/>The great bulk of the dialog throughout the film is directly from Austen, though the writers had to invent romantic dialog where she otherwise dryly says that the couples converse as one would expect those ""violently in love"" to do. And that is the timelessness of this story that this film ebulliently brings to life."

","Joe Wright's 2005 movie representation of Jane Austen's classic ""Pride and Prejudice"" was impeccable – it cannot be criticized negatively. This movie was perfect. I have to say at the outset that I have seen this movie a handful of times, and every time I see it I am totally stress-free and calm. You cannot watch this movie and be stressed out. Rarely does a movie director get it right when trying to present a movie representation of a great literary work. Joe Wright gets it right, no pun intended. The actors chosen for each part were phenomenal. Speaking of characters, I appreciated the fact that the husband does show some affection towards Mrs. Bennett at different points in the movie – an improvement, if that is not too sacrilegious to say, on the way Austen portrays the husbands attitude towards his wife in the book as having chosen poorly and having to live with the consequences – literally. Knightly and MacFadyen do an exquisite job in their leading roles. The dynamics between the Bennetts and the interplay of dialogue, or at some points banter, are quite convincing and just downright fun. This movie is a romance in the most wonderful sense of the word. Sure, normal people do not have amazing soundtracks playing when they are happy, contemplative, or upset, – and it was an amazing soundtrack- and normal life does not always end perfectly; but sometimes there are moments or even days when life with all of its joy and sorrow is a beautiful experience. Wright reminds us of this."

","Watching the oh-so-British-television production from 1995 having just read the book was an exercise in frustrating artistic restraint.

In other words, I didn't like it - though admittedly the leads are good. Well, then I saw this version.<br/><br/>This version is overwrought and underthought. High school students are taught that this story is supposed to be a satire. The filmmakers here, apparently, missed all of that.

It's a long book and honestly it should have been a long movie. Praise of the ""Robert Altman"" quality of the film is foolish - major moments of dialogue are spoken over not only by nearby inconsequential characters but also the shoddy music mix in the final cut.<br/><br/>And the camera work is subpar, at times resembling a TV-movie with it's showy zooms, long takes and lack of interesting angles.

","I saw it yesterday on cable TV, and I am disappointed: this version is not an adaptation of the book, it is something supposed to be P & P.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the music score are great and I enjoyed both immensely. <br/><br/>But I have not liked at all the changes made to the book that were absolutely not necessary, like the scene when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth for the first time : why was it shot under the rain in the outside? And they looked like they were going to kiss... Was that really necessary, or when Elizabeth, with her Uncle and Aunt, visits Pemberley House, they visit a display of Greek statues but in the book all they see are miniatures and quite acollestion of them, she hears the piano and she peeps through the door to watch Georgiana playing, this is unheard of as decent behavior at any time, especially at that time, the same for the famous Lady De Bourg visit at Longbourne : in the middle of the night ? Even the pompous vicious and haughty Lady would not stoop down to such demeanor. <br/><br/>Transforming Longbourne into a farm with animals and fowls, etc, and in general the dreary house, bad furniture, rather dirty place: there is no mention whatsoever of anything of the sort in the novel; or all this linen on the lines, there all the time, never taken down even when it rains, it is strange because it does not belong to the novel and does not add anything so important to the plot it had to be added. <br/><br/>Mr. Bennet was a gentleman and as such had the estate of an esquire, he spent most of his time in his library reading, some time walking his dogs, shooting etc. but not gardening !!!! and certainly not in one bed with his wife, whom he could not stand and made nasty jokes behind her back, even at her face. The shot of Elizabeth on the swing, with muddy bare feet, I do not know why they did this; it is not in the book. Neither this invention of a Mr. Hill. <br/><br/>A PLAY may lend itself to interpretations and some changes, since there are no clear-cut limits imposed by the author. But regarding P&P the author has written in the NOVEL exactly all he or she, she in this example, wants to see and all she needs in order to bring her ideas to the mind of the readers, this is why I tend to be very demanding of the directors to respect the text of the authors : they cannot do what they jolly well please !!! <br/><br/>As for the characters, Elizabeth is OK, so is Darcy, his cousin Fitzwilliam, Jane and Bingley, Georgiana and the other Bennet sisters. However, Mrs. Bennet has not enough fits, Mr. Bennet chuckles much too much, Wickham does not look pervert enough, Lady De Bourg is not vicious enough  Judy Dench is a bit too soft , and Miss De Bourg does not look sick enough, Mr Collins is doing just fine and Charlotte is OK. Overall, it is not bad if you forget it is supposed to be based on Jane Austen superb novel, but if you are like me a dedicated fan, you cannot help yourself and will always compare it with the brilliant BBC series, which is top (only the costumes did no look right to me). <br/><br/>It is a pity this version was mishandled."

","Touching romance. I liked it. Then I went to watch the 1995 mini version. Shocked by the Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) in the mini series. That Mr. Darcy is stunning and unbelievable. Most charming male character ever created in movie history! However, that is also what makes me feel the Lizzy in that version is not a good enough match for Mr. Darcy. To be frank, to attract someone like Mr. Darcy, being very clever is probably not enough. She needs to be stunningly beautiful too.For this reason, I think in this 2005 version Mr. Darcy and Lizzy is a better match.Although, this version is not so faithful to the original novel and the overall performance is not as good, I still think it is a very touching story and well performed. Both Mr. Darcy and Lizzy are attractive.<br/><br/>I think Jane in this movie is better than the Jane in the mini too. Seem reason. It is not possible to attract a handsome and rich young man at once without stunning beauty. This is the fact of life! Apparently this fact was ignored in the mini series. If Jane is not very beautiful, what else does she has to deserve Mr. Binley's immediate love? Good performance skills can't be convincing enough. So, well done, 2005 version.<br/><br/>Not perfect of course,Lizzy smiles too much.Mr. Binley's smile was a bit silly once. And, the original dialogs and settings could be better used....However, I still voted it 9 out of 10, because I feel two better matches in this movie."

This film just fails to convey the charm and ambiance of the novel.<br/><br/>If this does not put off, you will find lots English countryside (some shots reminded me a little of Wuthering Heights 1939), and a love story loosely based on motives found the novel. This might actually be enjoyable to some. But don't call it Pride and Prejudice."
"x-fabby-x","10","4","9","1 June 2006"," Mesmorising & enchanting to watch
","This film was my very first taste of Pride & Prejudice it had a huge effect on me; I was absolutely memorised by it! I loved this film and find that it becomes even more amazing with every viewing, as I discover all the hidden details that make it so rich and enchanting. Of all the films I have seen, this has affected me like no other; I walked out the cinema feeling all warm inside and still get that feeling every time I watch it! Perhaps some fans of the 1995 mini-series will find this movie so different that they won't like it and I agree that it doesn't remain absolutely faithful to every detail of the book, but it is necessary for a film in the year 2005 to keep it fresh. It is also hard to get one book into just over two hours of film. Personally, I had no problem at all with it and didn't fell it was 'rushed' in any way. I suggest people who have read the book or seen the 1995 version watch this film with an open mind to enjoy it as a good two hours of entertainment and not to expect a chapter-by-chapter review! The casting was excellent with lead Keira Knightley providing a very strong and lively Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew MacFadyen perfectly showing Mr Darcy's struggle and vulnerability. Again I find that after buying the DVD and watching it many times that there are so many subtle looks from him that you may miss on first viewing that gives the character a new depth. Other excellent performances come from Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet and Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone and Carey Mulligan as the Bennet daughters who managed to portray an excellent sense of sisterly love! Generally, I thought the casting was flawless and couldn't see many weaknesses at all with it. Perhaps one of the best things about this film is its cinematography and filming. There are epic shots of the English countryside that take your breath away and certain scenes done entirely in one shot, sweeping through the different parts of a home creating a truly unique sense of being really in the film. The script is excellent with some memorable lines and very funny moments throughout the film, mainly in scenes with Mr Collins or Mrs Bennet but surprisingly with scenes featuring Mr Darcy too, when he shows his awkward and vulnerable side that's is so sweet it's funny. The soundtrack to this film by Dario Marianelli is again one more thing that makes this film so brilliant. Just to listen to the music alone is enjoyable but with the film it adds to the atmosphere in a way that is truly amazing. I suggest that all should go and see this film and as for the matter of it being a ""girl's film"", I say to all the men out there to forget any sense of manliness for two hours and go and see it. I know that some men loved this film so it's worth a try! All-in-all, as you can all tell, I adored this film and it has been the start for my love for Jane Austen. It's one of those rare films that I can watch again and again with family or friends and enjoy it more every time. Well done to everyone involved with creating this masterpiece of a film and thank you!"

Elizabeth should be tweaking Darcy in the scene where he's at his desk, but Knightley delivers these zingers like lead balloons! This was how Elizabeth and Darcy courted, movie people!<br/><br/>Then it just dragged on and on! When Darcy makes his big speech, I couldn't stop laughing! Only Judi Dench (bless her!) got that Austen's opus is as much about the class system as it was about two people who'd rather slit their throats than admit their love!

"mbuhler-1","5","4","9","20 May 2006"," Not the best adaptation
","This is not the worst movie I have ever seen but it is not a good adaptation of the Jane Austen classic. The cinematography is beautiful but the pacing of the story is all wrong. They speed through events and we never really care about any of the characters. When adapting a novel of this length, it is vital to spend time on the more important events of the book and either leave out or gloss over minor incidents. However, this movie tries to include everything with no discrimination about which events are more important to the plot. Therefore, the whole story seems to be rushed. The character of Lydia, portrayed by Jenna Malone, is absolutely intolerable. Completely overacted, and frankly, just obnoxious. Otherwise this isn't a horrible movie. If it had been adapted from a lesser known book it would have been quite tolerable. However, as it is, I cannot strongly recommend it."
"mamaslilfro","2","4","9","11 April 2006"," Mind Numbing
","Wow! That is the first word that comes to my head after watching this.... I don't even know. This movie was a HUGE disappointment. It left me in anger and dismay. Being a huge fan of the book, and the Colin Firth version, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Before watching this movie, I was very interested in seeing how they were going to cut an 4 1/2hr. movie (Coilin Firth version) into just over an hour. Well I got my answer. Because they shortened it so much, you did not feel any emotion at all towards the characters. There was no build up. Everything just happened way to fast. Not to mention their speech. To me it was almost like they were racing each other, to see who could say their lines the fastest. Really annoying. Speaking of annoying, Keira Knightley's hair (wig) was so distracting. Where did they get that thing-the trash. I mean It was horrible- not to mention the costume. There was a certain dress worn by a certain somebody ( i don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen it) that was so out of place. I could go on and on, but I won't. I love Keira, and I won't blame her this mistake-I mean we're all entitled to one."
"new_moon","2","4","9","31 March 2006"," Miss Austen's writing deserves an awful lot better than this.
","What can I say? It would be tactless, prejudiced and unjust to claim that Hollywood producers can't do justice classic literature. Sadly, the sentiment sometimes crops up, and this movie does not help to disprove it.<br/><br/>Miss Knightley isn't my thing by a far cry, and MacFadyen's idea of playing Darcy seems to consist in trying to say as little as possible and look dark and brooding - at moments I'm getting the impression that he's looking more disorientated/drugged than anything else, but what the heck.<br/><br/>But what really, really gets me is that while dialog and plot are 95% book based, the producers evidently didn't even try to do justice to the English landed gentry of that time. The mistakes are so glaringly obvious that it hurts, be it that Kiera Knightley is running around with her hair open and unkempt (why?? to show off the fake long hair that has been stapled to her neck? Okay, so that was pretty the top level of hair styles occurring in that movie, but still), without a hat, and either giggling or with her mouth half-open - hair splitting? Yes, by 21st century standards it is. But in the 18th century, all of this was either questionable or down-right scandalous behavior for a girl of Elizabeth Bennet's back-ground - and anybody who read Miss Austens books would know that! Same for Mrs Bennet having rough, reddish hands and skin. Same for pigs running into the Bennet's house. Same for Elizabeth running around out of house in nothing but her sleeping wear and a coat/scarf thrown over it.<br/><br/>Repeat: a gentile girl of the 18th century wouldn't do that any more than a high school girl would go shopping in her undies or go to school without having combed her hair or showered for a week. And you don't have to study history to know that, just read 3 books by Jane Austen or other writers of her time, and you'll know it.<br/><br/>Now, all of that could still be the producers not giving a damn. But what really, really gets me is are the fake pseudo-classic statues with the late 20th-century beauty ideal of slim legs and buttocks pasted onto them. For f***s sake, if you can't deal with the fact that 18th century ideas of female beauty differed from those of today, then why make a movie that plays in that period? This has an unpleasant taste of ""let's not err one step from main stream movie concepts, because the viewer's won't swallow what they aren't familiar with"". I would really, really like to think that US cinema goers aren't as skittish as that. Apart from that, since those scenes have zero meaning for plot or character development and never were even hinted at in the book, I can only assume that their sole purpose was that some men who erred into this movie got to see some naked curves, even if they were marble, not flesh.<br/><br/>As to why I'm making such a fuss about getting the period right (or at least, trying to do so): <br/><br/>(1) the movie is based entirely on the book, and that was written by a woman belonging into this period, to whom the concepts of propriety and style of her time mattered. To milk Jane Austen's work for money and then represent her world in such a shoddy way is bad manners at the least.<br/><br/>(2) there's next to nothing redeeming about the movie: the actors are rattling down their lines as if somebody was standing behind them with a timer and a whip. Jane's most important character traits (grace and goodness of heart) are being stated at best, but apart from that she doesn't come across as anything more than your standard bottle-blond, smiling, pretty face. Mr Collins (like some other actors) seems to be at the point of falling asleep for most of his screen time, and the only two characters who have a bit of charisma to them are the two the audience is expected to dislike: Miss Bingley and Mary Bennet.<br/><br/>All in all? Sporking material at best. If you are after a nice, bland romance and don't mind getting a willfully warped image of English society, have at it. If you're looking for a decent representation of the book, avoid this one at all cost."
"Fiorentina","5","4","9","6 February 2006"," Sorry, I love the novel, but this film is wasting your time...
","I read the novel many times, in different languages: English, Chinese and Dutch. I watched 2 versions of TV series (one is from BBC 1995, another is in 1980s). I have also watched the movie made by Hollywood in 1940s...<br/><br/>I have to say: this version in 2005 is the worst. I am actually quite surprised with the current point it received (7.6). I gave it 5 only because I still love this novel.<br/><br/>My comments: (1) I really dislike most of the actors/actresses in this film: Mr. Darcy looks so dumb, really no charm at all; Mr. Bingley looks like a gay (sorry for the actor, no offence); Mr. Bennet looks too cool, instead of with a little bit humor; Mrs. Bennet talked very nonsense (as novel describes), however, that actress looks too much like a gentle old lady; Lizzy, Keira Knightley is just OK, but she is too ""lively"" for Lizzy. After all, Lizzy is the lady from 17th century, Keira's acting is too modern for this Austen's character; and Jane, why cannot they find a prettier girl for that?...<br/><br/>(2) About the adaption: maybe I'm a little bit too picky, but I do have the feeling that they remove almost all the essential parts, and keep (and create) some stupid scenes. The novel is full of smart and ironic characters and talks, however, the film keeps very little:(.<br/><br/>(3) ... my advice to everybody is: don't watch this film if you have never read the novel. It is destroying Jane Austen's masterpiece. I normally dislike the taste of Hollywood on Britain classics, however, now I have to say even the Hollywood version in 1940s is much better than this one (although I don't like that one either)! If you do want to watch instead of reading novel, watch BBC's 6 episodes, that one won't waste your time!"
"julianne-11","4","4","9","21 January 2006"," Jane Austen must be turning over in her grave!
","While I enjoyed immensely the scenery, settings and costuming, this was not at all true to the spirit of Jane Austen's novel. Pride and Prejudice (the novel, the PBS series and the 1930's movie) is a comedy, full of quick repartee, not long lingering simpering, soulful looks. This newest version is badly in need of editing. While Keira Knightley is beautiful to look at and a fine actress, she doesn't have the proper edge. She is missing the 'pride' in the title. Jane Austen was never melodramatic. The scenes in the chicken yard (over and over again) and the Elisabeth standing on a cliff looking soulful were just too much. I won't even bother with Mr. Darcy. Lawrence Olivier and Colin Firth are hard acts to follow. If you love Jane Austen, you will be disappointed. However, if you've never read Jane Austen, you may enjoy the movie."
"blanchflorr","3","4","9","1 December 2005"," Enjoyable to a Pride & Prejudice novice...
","At the outset I must say that I am a huge fan of the novel and the 1995 BBC mini-series. Having said that I went into the movie determined to keep an open mind and give it a chance. However, despite my efforts, the film left me feeling unsatisfied. While I knew the ending, I found myself not caring whether or not Lizzie and Darcy or Jane and Bingley would end up together. I found Kiera Knightley's portrayal of Lizzy to be more how I would expect Lydia's character to be portrayed and, while Matthew MacFadyen was adequate as Mr. Darcy, he did not seem to quite capture all the nuances of the character as he was written.<br/><br/>While I understand that the story needed to be shortened to fit the 2-hour time frame, I felt that the way this was achieved was clumsy and did not place enough emphasis on the minor characters and story lines, the best example of this being that Wickham is only in 2 or 3 scenes. The film felt rushed and elements of the story that are so enjoyable in the book and other adaptations, such as the development of Lizzie's dislike and then the changes in Lizzie and Darcy at Pemberly, as well as the intricacies of social relationships and interactions, were virtually dismissed. The dialogue in some places seemed awkward, over the top and in some places, simply too modern. Also, while I thought that Donald Sutherland did a good job with the script that he was given, I did not care for the way Mr. Bennett was written - a lot of the humor in his character was lost.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film was not completely awful. I think that Tom Hollander did a good job and offered a fresh interpretation of Mr. Collins. Of course, Dame Judy Dench was wonderful as Lady Catherine. Brenda Blethyn did a good job as Mrs. Bennett. The scenes of the English countryside were beautiful, the set production was well done and the music, while overbearing at times, was well done.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are unfamiliar with the book or the BBC adaptations (either 1980 or 1995) this version will be very enjoyable. Further, if you are a novice, after you see this, watch the 1995 adaptation with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as that adaptation is truly wonderful."
"SibeliusVC","4","4","9","24 November 2005"," OK, but nothing to A&E
","This was fun to watch, but where is the sharp wit and irony so prevalent in the novel? The father especially is a great disappointment. His ironic comments from the book are now uttered in a dull, ogre-like way. This Darcy is nothing to Colin Firth. He lacks intelligence and gorgeousness that makes Elizabeth's love for him understandable. In this he just stands there dumbly for the most part and Elizabeth's sudden love for him seems based purely on her favorably impression of the magnificent Pemberly. Knightly is a dynamic Elizabeth, and aside from the irritatingly dingy fringe of hair at the nape of her neck she is lovely. Again, though, she lacks that tireless wit that Jennifer Ehle displays so believably. Jane is by far the best character in this movie; her beauty and little bit of silliness make her endearing and exactly what a Jane should be."
"NetherStowey","5","4","9","23 November 2005"," Limp biscuit
","A bit of a limp biscuit really with an over-abundance of costume and a lack of drama. I thought if Mr. Wright took me on one more panoramic house tour I would become nauseous. Proves beyond a doubt that Austen if suited at all to the screen is best suited to the small screen where talking heads rather than landscapes dominate. Ms. Knightly is far too cute to be believable as an Austen heroine with her pouty lips, toothy grin and not very convincing performance overall. The actual story is compressed in the extreme with a great deal of the nuance wrung out of it. Hence the level of emotional engagement on the part of the audience is significantly reduced. Donald Sutherland, looking like a reject from a rehab program is quite charming as th much put upon Mr. Bennett though his English accent is atrocious. The tour of Darcy's home and Elizabeth's fondling of the statuary was laughable and felt more like a tour of the Elgin Marbles at the BM than a scene in a film. With virtually no dramatic energy underpinning this scene the whole venture suddenly became lost and adrift on a sea of pretty pictures. Perhaps this is the consequence of Mr. Wright having only recently made the leap to the big screen from television where, ironically, this story should have remained. He seems a little overwhelmed by his new toys. ""Persuasion"" directed by Roger Michel with Amanda Root remains the best film adaptation of an Austen Novel. Both ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Mansfield Park"" are a close second with this film a distant third."
"ncammack","6","4","9","7 November 2005"," Good in parts
","Handicapped by never having read any of Jane Austen's novels, I can't comment on the accuracy of this film adaptation, although I can certainly see that its relatively breakneck pace must have entailed considerable sacrifices in pace and plot development. A very obvious example (to me anyway) was the way in which the actor playing Darcy has to reinvent his character in a most unbelievable way - from arrogant upper-class bastard to shy, misunderstood victim of a dysfunctional upbringing in the space of less than two hours is just too big an ask.<br/><br/>It's a handsome enough production, though, and the frequent presence of farm animals reminds us that the Bennets and others of their ilk had to get their money somehow (preferably by the sweat of someone else's brow) - also the merest of reminders that the late 18th century was by our standards very much on the nose.<br/><br/>In the end, though, I was prevented from entirely surrendering to this movie by a few too many jarring notes. To begin with, Donald Sutherland made a most unsatisfactory Mr Bennet, giving every appearance of being a befuddled and incoherent street person who'd wandered onto the set and been offered the job by mistake. I spent the movie wondering where he kept his stash of rotgut liquor.<br/><br/>Add to this the fact that his wife and two of his younger daughters are so deeply annoying that you want to strangle them at every turn, and it's a wonder that they get invited anywhere (but they do).<br/><br/>I found the scene in which Darcy and Bingley arrive at the ball difficult to credit. Could two apparently untitled aristocrats really have precipitated such an abrupt, extended and total silence, verging on awe? I could believe members of the Royal Family having that effect, or even Darcy and his pal among a crowd of forelock-tugging peasants, but not county society, I would have thought. I'm open to correction on that one, though.<br/><br/>And I agree with the reviewer who wondered how the Bennet girl could fall for that twit Bingley. As played, young Bingley is a complete and utter gormless twerp, and not good-looking either. I'm inclined to think that Jane really was a little gold-digger."

","I viewed this movie with eager anticipation, and while it was wonderful to see Jane Austen's characters come to life on the big screen, I was disappointed. Firstly the movie went for only 2 hours, not nearly long enough to do justice to the development of the characters and story lines in the book. Being a great fan of the book, I was annoyed that some elements had been completely changed or even omitted. Keira Knightley does justice to Elizabeth's character, however Matthew MacFadyen is neither arrogant or proud enough to be a true representation of Mr Darcy. The stately homes and scenery certainly impressed me, but failed to make up for a storyline that was certainly lacking. The love story between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy is enjoyable to watch, but overall, I feel the movie is not an adequate adaptation of the novel."

I had barely seen a preview of Pride & Prejudice, and so when the opportunity came to see a sneak preview, I could not let it pass me by.<br/><br/>Coming into this film, I had admired Keira Knightley's work in Bend It Like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Love Actually, and was interested in seeing her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett. I was not disappointed. It baffles me that this actress is only twenty; and then, when I see that she played a Padme decoy (queen decoy) on Phantom Menace, I said, ""Aha! The lower half of that face does resemble Portman!"" Back to the film...<br/><br/>I wondered how the producers/director/writer would splice the novel into two hours, but they did so earnestly, thoughtfully, and with the chuckle of an inside joke.<br/><br/>The costumes, scenery, and settings seem to echo a portrait more fitting than the mini- series. It felt more authentic to me as the story unfolded. The actors seem to all enjoy playing their parts: it was comical and romantic, never overly dramatic. I liked the change of where certain conversations took place. Sometimes, because of time, the writer had to transition one storyline quickly to another.<br/><br/>A friend said, as she left the theatre, ""This is just what I needed tonight.""

"susannah-16","9","4","9","26 September 2005"," Excellent version with just that little something different
","Keira Knightley's performance was a revelation - Whilst obviously extremely pretty, she was also animated, lively and young enough to bring off the freshness in Lizzies character. I thought Matthew MacFadyen was great in his role - thoughtful enough, and melting gradually throughout the film to the man who declares his love passionately at the end. I always thought that the wet shirt scene in the 1995 version was wildly overrated and very un Jane Austenish, so the passionate looks and buttoned up emotions of this one were much more in keeping with the book. MacFadyen gives a very intelligent performance and there are some great moments such as when his sister says to Lizzie that he had told her she was very good at the piano and he corrects her ""quite good, I said quite good"". The setting was also fresh and realistic - much less uptight than previous versions, with real mud, lots of animals, untidy rooms and a great feel for the period in which it is set - much less picture postcard than it could have been. At just over two hours it could have been longer - Mr Wickham could have been done more justice, as could Darcys letter, Lizzies time at Pemberley and Lizzies growing impatience to get Darcy on his own at the end - in the book she gets increasingly desperate to be able to speak to him, which just adds to the growing tension. The mist scene at the end raised a laugh in the cinema I was in - whilst I have to say that both actors looked great, and once Matthew MacFadyen had started talking I forgot about how contrived it was, it was still a bit hackneyed - more Charlotte Bronte than Jane Austen. Still - made a great poster. I also thought that the end was an anticlimax - a smile or a kiss or Lizzy rushing off to fling her arms around Darcy would have sent us all out smiling broadly. However - check out the US version of the trailer - at the end there is a two or three second clip which certainly didn't appear in the film here - so lets hope it gets reinstated in the DVD version !

","Joe Wright, the director of this new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, is a brave man indeed. Who in their right minds would even attempt to compete with the BBC's 1995 serialisation? How could anyone improve on Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and that screenplay by Andrew Davies?Well, I'm pleased to report that Mr Wright and his assembled cast have dome a pretty fine job of it. He wisely chose to approach the story in a new way, rejecting the rather hackneyed stiff regency attitudes in favour of a more down home, grubby feel which actually lends itself rather well to the story, especially as it gives credence to Darcy's initially reluctant proposal.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent too; even the erstwhile rather dubious Ms Knightley manages a convincing portrayal of the feisty Elizabeth, and Matthew Macfadyen brings an intriguing vulnerability to Mr Darcy.<br/><br/>My one complaint would probably be the dumbing down of Jane Austen's dialogue; an inevitable sacrifice in today's focus group dominated society. Still, courtesy of an interestingly fresh approach, fine performances, especially key supporting roles like Mr Collins (the ever brilliant Tom Hollander) and Mrs Bennett (Brenda Blethin in a far more restrained and sympathetic portrayal than the screeching Alison Steadman we were forced to endure in '95)and some lovely cinematography, I would have to say that this movie will certainly hold up to comparison with the nation's darling mini-series."

","I really feel deeply emotionally engaged in reviewing ""Pride and Prejudice"": I am such a Jane Austen addicted that my review is more a profession of faith than a proper review: let's admit I cannot be an impersonal and objective judge. However, no doubt that Jane Austen's most loved novel is brought to vivid life by Joe Wright's adaptation: a matter of fact, a very considerable and significant one, is that the director didn't fall into the temptation to turn the movie into a romantic hodgepodge, but, on the contrary, respected the intention and the mood of the novelist. Jane Austen's narrative didn't belong to the romantic age, both from a historical and from a conceptual point of view: what she provided was deep psychological insight into her characters, along with careful social analysis. She could be considered a sort of modern psychologist, one of those counsellors of today, who answer questions in today's magazines. The movie, focused on Elizabeth's relation to Darcy, proves total adherence to the novel. The heroine is a self-conscious, intelligent girl, who, despite her young age, knows perfectly the complex, and not only charming nature of love. Love is not only a matter of honeyed words, and languishing eyes: love is a very serious matter demanding trust, honesty, communion of mind and soul and only when unresolved and tricky questions are sorted out, is she able to accept and to give love. What the movie doesn't lack, and which is to be found widely in the novel, too, is that subtle and witty irony, pervading dialogues and situations. Period detail is impeccable, costumes and locations are a pure delight for the eye. The final result is truly enjoyable, funny, thoughtful and extraordinarily able to attract a modern audience, both of women and men: I was able to persuade my father, who is an old-fashioned man fond of western and action movies and really allergic to costume-movies, to see and even appreciate it. I admit I was once able to see it twice: I just never get bored, it seems I can never get enough. I truly loved and still love this movie!"

"katesagers","10","3","6","11 August 2007"," My Favorite Adaption
","This was an absolutely amazing film! I loved it! The acting was superb, the cinematography and directing were excellent. The costumes and setting were great.<br/><br/>On the acting: I don't get it. Most people are being prejudice themselves. Having an actor do a character first does not make them better. I don't understand the criticism of the acting; I thought all the actors were brilliant, especially Ms. Knightley, Mr. MacFayden, and Mr. Sutherland (but when is Donald Sutherland not brilliant?) I actually thought acting better than the 1995 version. They really captured the characters and made them more human and less stiff, especially the two leads.<br/><br/>I have seen all of the other versions, and while I liked them, especially the acclaimed 1995 mini series, there was always something subtle that was in the dynamics of book, but in none the films. This film has it. It is hard to explain, but most can feel it.<br/><br/>All in all: Acting, cinematography, directing, costumes, all great. There is nothing to not love about this film. It has truly captured the wit, the subtle passion and sexiness, the romantic air, and the clever flirting that made Jane Austen's book such an instant classic back in 1813."
"ithinkurpriddy","10","3","6","6 August 2007"," Pride and Prejudice is absolutely amazing!!
","When I first saw Pride and Prejudice, I wanted to keep seeing it over and over and I fell in love with it!!! Now, almost two years after it came out, I'm so mad that it didn't get more attention in theaters that it deserved! After seeing the movie, and reading some of the comments on the book, I decided to read it! The book is breathtaking, and I had no idea that it could be so much better than the movie, even though the movie was wonderful! Jane Austin is fantastic!! I think everyone should read this book! and of course see this movie! Keira Knightley is amazing, and I think she was a very good Elizabeth Bennet. Talulah Riley, who played Mary, I felt kind of bad for her because she wasn't shown as much as the rest of the sisters, even though Mary isn't talked about much in the book either. Kitty and Lydia were always annoying with their laughs and things, but that's who Jane Austin wanted them to be. Mr. Darcy, was great! Played by Matthew Macfadyen, Mr. Darcy would show his acting through his eyes and his face. All the actors were very good. Mr. Collins played by Tom Hollander I thought was hilarious! It really disappoints me that so many people didn't like this movie, for me, it did take me a couple of times to get everything I needed to get, but to pack the whole book into a two hour movie, was very challenging! But they did it tremendously! Anyone who loves Romance, Drama, and a little laugh, should see this Pride and Prejudice by Joe Wright."
"mdargen1","9","3","6","23 July 2007"," Great performances by great actors
","I literally felt uneducated because I had not seen the first version and had heard so many good things about it from my family. I enjoyed this version so much I have watched it many times now. If you can be educated by a movie, I learned not to judge people to harshly until you know them well enough to stand in their shoes. If you watch movies strictly for entertainment value, this fills that bill also. Donald Sutherland was excellent as the father. He seems more like a father of those times than a lot of portrayals I have seen in other time period movies. Kierra Knightly was superb as a woman who is smart and able to speak her mind no matter the consequences. One of the attributes of a good film is the casting. All the actors came across exactly as the story was trying to be told. Judith Dench can do anything I am convinced. Her make up person deserves an award. Great movie."
"bakoea","10","3","6","13 June 2007"," In my opinion......
","In my opinion, I think this movie is perfect! It really sticks to the original novel. The music and casts are great! They gave me a elegant reflection ...how to say ...great feelings.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen let the characters come alive! They are great actors! Keira Knightley is just like Elizabeth's reflection: wisdom, beautiful and strong minded! If you put Matthew Macfadyen and the 'real' Mr. Darcy in the same room, I think I won't be able to distinguish the differences between them. <br/><br/>The reasons why I like this movie are: it's exciting but not like riding a roller coaster (which makes people felt like heart attack ); it's romantic but not nauseating; it's elegant but not overdoes and it's classic but not ancient (most of the students in my age always think that classic novels or movies which based on them are ancient, such as: 'Le Comte De Monte-Cristo', 'Moby-Dick', 'Les Miserables' ). <br/><br/>To those who think that the original novel is difficult to read and the translated version is not so great (like me), this movie is music to ears!<br/><br/>(If my spelling or grammar is a mess, please forgive me, cause I'm not good at English, I've done my best!)"
"Matador07","9","3","6","27 April 2007"," Very Nicely Done
","This was a rich, passionate take on a very old story, and Keira Knightley is a revelation as one of literature's first romantic heroines. Frankly, before this performance, I was not really sure whether she could act or not. It is hard to tell when an actress is starring across from a giant CGI octopus. But her range and subtlety as Lizzy in this movie bodes very well for her post-pirate chick future. There is still a bit of an anachronistic tomboy element to her performance, but it never reaches anything approaching the silliness of her characters in the various Bruckheimer blockbusters she has appeared in, and instead adds a flavor all her own to this Lizzy. And her liveliness and the arch nature of the character are nicely set off here by her ability to project a certain sweet vulnerability that helps her claim the movie and make you very much root for this well known character all over again.<br/><br/>I fully understand the contingent complaining that this was not a ""pure"" adaptation of Jane Austin's P&P -- I in fact would agree with that. But the question would be does that fact somehow make this a bad movie, or even a bad adaptation? And the answer is emphatically no. Characters and story lines have to be abbreviated to make it into a feature film, but save perhaps one more scene that they really could have used to delve further into the Wickham character, the trimming does not hurt the core romance of the story, but rather focuses attention upon it. Nice supporting turns add humanity and humor to characters such as Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins, and upon a re-viewing, even Donald Sutherland did well with a lot of subtleties I missed in the first viewing. (I could, however, have done without the excessive squealing and bouncing around of the younger sisters). Most importantly the two leads, after a slow start, develop a palpable chemistry as the film picks up pace.<br/><br/>And pick up pace it does -- this is P & P infused with dark romantic imagery, great period music, and some wonderful cinematography. Rather than a series of stage appearances, we get a passionate and highly entertaining labor of love, where the writer/director wisely decide to take their time and spend their precious minutes conveying emotion and energy rather than forcing in one more line or one more character which could leave little impact. It may not have the social nuance, and only sporadically achieves the comic flair, of Austen's book, but Jane's story never looked so good or felt so powerful before."
"fbconger","10","3","6","25 March 2007"," beautiful movie... makes this Jane Austen fan happy....
","Every once in a while, a movie is produced that you enjoy so much that you watch it over and over again and never tire of it. This is one of those movies. Jane Austen's book comes to life on the screen with the characters portrayed exceptionally well. This lively and well-conceived version easily places the viewer inside the lives of the Bennet family. The cinematography is exquisite. It has a happy ending. It's thoroughly enjoyable and well-casted, with inspired performances and logical film editing. My only disappointment was that this movie didn't receive better critical reviews... because that usually means fewer people will see it. In my own humble opinion, it's one of the best movies released in the recent past. It's well worth a couple of hours of your time! You might even want to watch it over and over again. Hmmmm."

","I absolutely adore this film. I came out of the cinema feeling really strange and a film has never got to me like that before. It made me want to be a Bennet, it made me want to live in a country house, go to balls and dressing in period attire.<br/><br/>I decided afterwards that I would watch the previous version made by the BBC and after 10 minutes as I found it dull and boring. I much much much prefer all of the new actors and actresses opposed to those of the BBC series who I found dull and boring. Macfadyen was cast superbly for this role he portrayed the character of Mr Darcy so well it was a joy to watch, a great step into his film career, the chemistry between him and Knightley is electric. This stunning performance was shown throughout the entire cast as all were well suited to their roles: the giggling sisters, shy Jane, and proud Lizzie, they all bought the film together and made it such a success.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is a joy to watch then acting, the actors, actresses, the directing, the music, the locations. I love this film I could watch it again and again, a great adaptation!!"
"jafco-1","10","3","6","10 March 2007"," Superb
","I have read every IMDb review of this movie. The Brits come down hard on it, splitting 50/50 between ZERO stars and about 9 stars. One has to respect that, since it is their literature and because the BBC did a legendary multi-part series not that long ago that was superb.<br/><br/>I viewed that miniseries. It is the sole reason that I undertook P&P, 2005. I found it a truly interesting story of its time. One gets a flavor how the laws of England regarding inheritance so profoundly affected the society (as well as the rise of the urban society over the rural society) so that ""a man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife"". My reintroduction to the story through this movie has caused me to start reading Jane Austen to better understand the socio-political setting (I suspect that another JA lives today in China or India, and will record their female-unfriendly situations for posterity, and in such a felicitous way).<br/><br/>As to the actual movie: Superb. Most of the themes in JA's book are either 'exactly' run out in the movie, or else are presented in brief or at worst, implied. This movie suffers because it is only two hours long.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley is not the most beautiful actress. She was fun and steadfast in ""Pirates"". In this movie, however, she shows a range of emotion that is breathtaking, and I fall in love with her. Watch the scene in Mr. Darcy's house where they are inspecting the marble statuary. Then watch - what the heck, watch the whole movie. She deserved her nominations for Best Actress Oscar and other awards.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy grows on one. He is prejudiced and stiff and overbearing, and he becomes human and handsome as this saucy, intriguing young woman steals his heart.<br/><br/>Kudos to the rest of the ensemble. Rosamund Pike is so pretty in those first scenes as to overshadow - physically - Lizzy; but we come to see how Eliza is the pride of her father, and the equal of Darcy. Other portrayals make me turn to the books to better understand what's going on (the movie is only suggestive as to the deficiencies in some of the characters).<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is a historical treat and a red-meat love story - not a ""chick-flick"". Either boy or girl are ones you would have wanted to woo in your wooing days.<br/><br/>Heh."
"Doegred","5","3","6","22 February 2007"," They killed the wit
","I could put up with the hurried storyline - it's an adaptation, it requires changes, alright. I could put up with the rather poor acting. (Giggling Elizabeth, dull-witted Bingley or Darcy for that matter, etc. although there were a few exceptions.) But where is the wit gone ? Joe Wright seems to have tried to make a romantic love-story, and I suppose it is as good a goal as any, but then I do not think Pride&Prejudice was good material. Its plot is, after all, quite predictable. What makes the book so delightful is, I think, Austen's wit, which is completely lacking here. Without it, the too-perfect heroine became quite irritating, and the film utterly boring. (Having said that, I hope that not many think as I do; I doubt I would have really tried and read Austen's books had I seen this film before reading any of them.)"

"stephaniewuk","4","3","6","2 June 2006"," Only the Small Screen Can Do It Real Justice
","Though it is better than the previous film adaptation of the novel made in the 1950s, I think it is something of a challenge to do Austen well on the big screen. The only truly successful adaptation of an Austen novel was Emma Thompson's beautiful, faithful and very, very well done Sense and Sensibilty a decade ago. Still, considering Austen's novels were long and wordy we can't all expect such great adaptations.<br/><br/>Knightley is sprightly enough as Elizabeth Bennett but not as arch, charismatic or pretty as Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be. Matthew MacFadyen also lacks the charm that was so crucial to Mr. Darcy's character. A lot of important things such as Elizabther's close relationship with her father Mr. Bennet, the love she had for her sister Jane and of course the potential love affair between herself and Mr. Wickham were not gone into in enough depth. Without the emphasis on the other relationships existing between the characters that Austen wrote so well her stories can get boring. Better explored in depth and dealt with on the television.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn was perfectly cast as the nervous Mrs. Bennett but - and this is the major but - why were the family so rural? It is true that they were not a wealthy or noble family but they were gentry, wealthier than the average middle-class family is today and they were represented as peasants. Even Mr. Darcy would not have married a peasant; they simply would not have had the occasion to meet.<br/><br/>At least it was better than the big screen version of Emma."
"ruby_fff","8","3","6","23 May 2006"," So glad I saw this 2005 version - director Wright with Moggach's screenplay, pairing of Knightley and MacFadyen as Lizzie and Darcy, is charming and endearing
","A&E's 1995 mini series with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth will still be my favorite version of Austen's beloved novel, with adaptation by the prolific writer Andrew Davies and direction by Simon Langton. But this feature debut from director Joe Wright, with Deborah Moggach's screenplay of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is very much appealing and enjoyable in its own right. The production is superb. The cinematography by Roman Oshin certainly enchants - such facility with the use of natural lighting and optimizing the sun as an 'accomplice' to the visual beauty delivered. We are truly transported, particularly at the beginning and ending 'sun burst' scenes.<br/><br/>The flowing music by Dario Marianelli, with just the right tempo and piano notes, provides the accompanying rhythm to the story progression. As we see people gathered for dancing at the assembly hall, we'd want to join in and dance along as well. The settings have such a down to earth tone and inviting warmth, especially being at the dining table or in the drawing room of the Bennet's. Brenda Blethyn is ever so lively and blithely as the matron of the family with five daughters. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet underplayed is aptly low-key in just the right way. The scenes between him and Knightley were so well matched - the fatherly love for his favorite daughter glows as he sits quietly in that decision-making library. When we're outside, nature is in touch and there's constant birds chirping that we can hear.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley, since first saw her in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" with her opposite Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp, is here with Matthew MacFadyen (who doesn't look 11 years senior to Knightley at all), and what a romantic pair they are. Rosamund Pike is sisterly Jane the eldest; talented Jena Malone is Lydia, the eloping one. Tom Hollander's portrayal of Mr. Collins is rather marvelously delivered - he gave it more of a human touch and comes across not at all 'odious'. Of course, Dame Judi Dench flawlessly delivered Lady Catherine De Bourg. The whole production is quite bubbly and ever effervescent with giggles and laughter. Every scene was thoughtfully choreographed, well demonstrated by the romantic arguing rainy scene of Lizzie and Darcy. (How cool is that.) <br/><br/>I can see this version multiple times. It's a perfectly endearing film. Perhaps the fact that I haven't seen MacFadyen in any other film before helps. (Now I can catch up and see him in ""Spooks"" / ""MI-5"" British TV series.)"

"asalem182","6","3","6","13 May 2006"," Beauty and Boredom
","Pride and Prejudice isn't a bad film by any means. The thing is, I don't think it deserves all the praise it's been getting since its release in November.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's most famous novel, and is mainly about the love/hate relationship between poor girl Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and rich man Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden). The story is set in Georgian England. As far as I'm concerned, this is at least the 4th of 5th film based on the novel. There was even a Bollywood musical adaptation released in 2004. So, was director Joe Wright and co. able to bring something new to the table? <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say yes. First things first, the film is extremely beautiful to look at. Whether it's the fields, the small houses, or the large ballrooms, they all look amazing. Wright shined in the ball scenes. Despite the huge number of people, he handled it very well. His camera (or scanner, I must say) moved smoothly from one character to another, and he rarely cut. And not to mention, the dances were well choreographed. I also really liked the score; it was very heartwarming and very fitting.<br/><br/>The acting was very good too. Knightley gave a great performance, and her Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Just look at her eyes during Mr. Darcy's first proposal. You could really feel her pain and vulnerability. Macfayden was good, and Judi Dench was great as Catherine de Bourg, although I felt she was criminally underused (2 scenes in the whole film).<br/><br/>And unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. The film makers had to fit a 4-hour story into a 2-hour film, so a lot of stuff had to be chopped. As a result, all the secondary characters almost had no screen time. For example, Mr. Wickham gets only 2 scenes, and Mary Bennett gets about 10 lines. So, whenever Elizabeth and/or Darcy were not on screen, I was bored to death, because frankly, I couldn't care less about the other characters in the film. They were as bland as it gets.<br/><br/>Another thing I hated was all the ""stalking"" scenes. In several scenes of the film, we see Darcy in the background, quietly staring at Elizabeth. Yeah, I know his pride and shyness prevented him from talking to her, but for some reason, I felt these scenes belong to a horror movie or something. One scene in particular had me laughing (unintentionally of course); When Elizabeth bumps into someone (we couldn't see who he is), and then the camera moves up to show us Darcy's face, looking down on her, I thought he was going to grab a knife and cut her throat or something. That scene was during the ""hate"" part of their relationship, so it would have made sense, heh.<br/><br/>So, I'd recommend watching Pride and Prejudice, but I'd suggest lowering your expectations. Or even better, I'd suggest seeing other Working Title films like Love Actually, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and I think you'll have a better time. I know I did."
"painted-out","4","3","6","11 May 2006"," A nice film out of context
","I didn't have a problem with this film simply because I'm a Jane Austen purist, I swear. It doesn't bother me that some plot points are missing due to the new time frame, nor does it matter to me that Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are not playing their famous roles. I do dislike this film a great deal, though, because I disagree with it's interpretation of the material. If you are going to adapt a book or play to film, you can do whatever you want with the storyline, but I believe it is essential to keep the message or ""spirit"" of the work intact. That is something I believe this version of Pride and Prejudice failed to do. Granted, it's no outrageous disgrace like ""Ella Enchanted"" (I think I actually cried after seeing that abomination of an adaptation), but it still loses a lot of Austen's sharp wit and especially gets rid of the whole ""satire"" part. Instead of watching an enlivening piece that sweetly pokes fun at the mating games and marital ploys of the 19th century, I watched two hours of melodrama. All of the masks and innuendos were gone, replaced by blatant statements. I have to preface this by saying that I think Keira Knightley is a good actress, but I did not like her at all as Elizabeth Bennet. Admittedly, I didn't think she was right for the part in the first place, but I ended up disagreeing with her interpretations in a completely unbiased way. I don't think Jennifer Ehle or anyone else have ever done a ""perfect"" Eliza Bennet, but I definitely disliked Knightley's choice to make Elizabeth laugh all the time, or to make her comment's sassy comments cruel and not playful. I suppose I say that from a directorial or actor's point of view, but I don't think it was a valid interpretation of the literary character. Also, I didn't really feel like a lot of the interactions were true to the period. Finally, my biggest problem was all the beautiful backdrops. Yes, they were dazzling to look at, but why were they there? What purpose did they serve? To distract me from the scene actually playing out? Truthfully, I saw no reason to place almost any of the scenes in expansive areas of nature like that, and I hate seeing things done pointlessly. However, when I don't think about the fact that this movie is based off a Jane Austen novel (as opposed to a Harlequin romance), this film is cute and enjoyable. :)"
"mcatherinemcf","4","3","6","27 April 2006"," Beautifully filmed but...
","This was a beautifully filmed movie. There were a couple of shots that wouldn't have looked out of place on a canvas in a gallery. There were also some scenes that were worthy of an art film, particularly the end of the dance at the ball at Netherfield. . . . But it would have been nice if the writers had used Jane Austen's characters. Most of the personalities were completely changed; the others were emphasized to the point of caricature. Only Caroline Bingley seemed to meet expectations and I will say that her and Elizabeth's parting comments after Jane's illness were delightfully catty. Interviews with the actors and director on the DVD seem to indicate that they believe their portrayals are accurate to the actual book; a fact that gave me the excuse to re-read the book to be sure they were wrong. . . The change of character personalities are the most unforgivable aspect of the film. The second insult to the book was the ignoring of the period's manners and dress. Some behavior and dress was too sloppy for even a setting in a pioneering western. Certainly the first ball looked more like a square dance than a ball to me. . . There are, of course, the changes that are necessitated by turning a book-length piece of literature into a 2 hour movie; unfortunate but understandable. . . Overall, I'd say that if you haven't read the book, you'll probably enjoy the movie. Even if you have, you could still enjoy the movie by just accepting that changes have been made and watch it as a slightly inaccurate historical film."
"awhitley4","10","3","6","27 April 2006"," I absolutely loved it!
","Because I have trouble understanding every word of a movie when the actors have an accent other than mine and my t.v. does not do too well with sound, I watched this movie over and over with and without the subtitles on. I never like to miss anything going on in a movie at all and with this picture I didn't mind watching it so much. It touched my heart so. The two main characters won my heart and I would love to watch them in more movies. It was such a beautiful love story and I now want to read the book. I always enjoy watching movies set in the past that way and in a country other than my own. I believe all the characters added so much to the story and made it a delight to watch."
"t6lem","4","3","6","23 March 2006"," A Bit Off
","I found the Elizabeth Bennett portrayed by Keira Knightly to be a bit off. A lot of the dialogue made the characters seem superficial. When Elizabeth says something along the lines of ""That's a shame for I dearly love to laugh,"" it just didn't fit. All the scenes seemed so rushed and condensed. Mr. Bingley was portrayed as a witless idiot instead of a nice guy with a happy disposition. Mr. Wickham was strangely absent almost the entire movie and none of his deceitfulness was shown, and Mr. Hurst and Bingley's other sister were gone as well. Matthew M. gave no depth to Mr. Darcy. Where was the struggle to come to grips with his feelings for Elizabeth? His lines were delivered quickly rather than with any real emotion. Mr. Bennett being played by Donald Sutherland was a little creepy. His breathing was heavy and his hair was wild. And it seemed as though his partiality for Lizzy and a little for Jane was totally absent. He seemed to disapprove of all of his girls at one point and then to think highly of them all at others. Mrs. Bennett was semi-accurate, but had her moments of clarity and sense which isn't quite consistent with the book. And why in the world was there a scene of Elizabeth and Darcy in the rain or a scene with them half dressed and out in the misty morning? It seemed a bit disjointed and jumpy as well. Elizabeth is just suddenly visiting her aunt and uncle and Lydia just gets invited to go to Brighton without anyone even really knowing who invited her. Maybe if I had never seen the 1995 Simon Langton version or read the book I might have found this to be an all right love story, but as an adaptation of P&P I found it seriously lacking. Noble effort to try and make a 2 hour movie out of a story like Pride and Prejudice, but they should have left well enough alone."

Even Jane Austen wouldn't agree with that.

Not inside a farm!! <br/><br/>2) Clothing and general look: Of course family's general look and appearance was also fit for a farmer's family (save for Rosamund Pike), which was extremely contrasting with Darcy and Bingley's entourage's look and appearances. In today's terms this would be like trying to match a cleaning professional with an investment banker (it does happen in movies like Maid in Manhattan, but Jane Austen didn't write a Cinderella story)<br/><br/>3) Keira Knightly: It was a huge disappointment to see Keira whom would physically very much look like an Elizabeth in our imagination, be anything but Elizabeth in this movie. Elizabeth's character is the most crucial foundation of this book and when defining it for a movie, it shouldn't be taken lightly as it was in this case. Where is Jane Austen's lively but digne, daring but not ill-mannered, and extremely sensible Elizabeth, where is this common girl with her vulgar shouting and screaming, misplaced laughing and smiles and her lack of any sensible manners that we witnessed in Keira's Elizabeth. <br/><br/>4) All the other odd bits and pieces: like Lady de Bourg arriving to Elizabeth's home in the middle of the night, Mr Bingley leaving the room without any word and so on<br/><br/>Amongst all this, I found that Darcy was a well defined character by Matthew Macfadyen and so was Jane by Rosamund Pike. If it wasn't for them, I would probably rate the movie 2. <br/><br/>Pity!!"
"joeshields","5","3","6","13 December 2005"," tried to like it but wound up rolling on the floor laughing out loud...
","...and probably ruined it for others in the theatre. I'm very fond of Jane Austen's books and was looking forward to the film. OK... in the opening scene where the ""ball"" was more of a barn dance with shabbily dressed and uncombed ""townies"" I shuddered and chuckled to my wife, ""I guess this was before the comb was invented"". I soon realized that some jackass set director (or whomever) decided to mix in a little Dickens to the Austen's Pride & Prejudice. All right, I tried to adjust my mental image of the Bennetts to be more like the Bob Cratchit family (minus Tiny Tim)... maybe it will work. No... I was too embarrassed for Elizabeth in her threadbare dress at Pemberly... and then finally with proud, rich Mr. Darcy sitting outside the Bennett house (amid the mud and the pigs) the camera panned to the Bennett sisters peering out the window at him ...THAT WINDOW!!!! Never was there a window in more need of paint. I leaned to my wife and tried to whisper, ""they have a cook and a butler, surely the Bennetts can afford a bucket of paint""... but I never got the word PAINT out. I lost it. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I needed a good laugh. Sorry to all those in the theatre that night (although the laughter seemed to be contagious). I think those who made the film must share in the blame. Too bad, the script and acting was very good."
"suessis","7","3","6","10 December 2005"," A rush job
","I have been a fan of Jane Austin since seeing the BBC version of this film that was produced in 1980. Since then I have read all of her books and seen any film version of them that has been done. I'm afraid that my benchmark for any filmed version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" will always be the 1995 BBC production and this one suffers by comparison.<br/><br/>For those who have never read the book or seen the other productions you may not understand this but trying to fit it into 2 hours simply doesn't work. I feel as though I'm being rushed through the story and being allowed to see only the highlights. In some places, the missing pieces of the story make it is hard to understand characters' motivations.<br/><br/>The style of this film helps make the rush job more interesting. It is similar to the '95 Roger Michel version of ""Persuasion"" in that the England that we see on the screen is down to earth and very real. You can almost see the paint moldering in the elderly and somewhat decaying Longbourne. At times though, Wright does throw a little romance and mysticism into it with his use of color and light. The English landscape seems much more lush and green than one would have thought, and the glow of candles is warm and comforting.<br/><br/>Another interesting element is the intimate way in which we are invited into the lives of the Bennets through the use of camera work. In fact, it's almost a little too intimate for the fans of Austin and in some ways for the period as well. Some of the characters appear rumpled and disheveled and a good bit of the action takes place at convenient times for the girls to be found in their nightclothes. There is also a more relaxed attitude in relationships than it was usually acceptable to have at that time.<br/><br/>As for the performances, while most tend to be good, the majority of the performers bring nothing new to characters of the book. Tom Hollander is an exception to this in that his characterization of Collins puts a somewhat different spin on a character usually portrayed as bumbling and comically condescending. Hollander's Collins comes across as bland, arrogant, and practical to a fault. He sees the value of currying favor with the wealthy and believes that others of his class should follow his example.<br/><br/>On the flip side, Matthew MacFadyen's performance of Darcy left a little something to be desired. He lacks the classical brooding handsomeness that one associates with Darcy and his performance is sometimes awkward. Some of his problem might be the script in that it is sometimes hard to understand how he forms some of his opinions when you are not seeing everything that you should in the story.<br/><br/>All in all, this is not a bad film. It simply does not meet the standard that has been set for it."
"kristen-frederickson","9","3","6","28 November 2005"," can't stop thinking about Mr. Darcy
","I confess to not having seen another version of this story, nor having read the book until after I saw it, but I must say that I am completely obsessed with Matthew McFadyen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy. I think that, comparing his portrayal to the novel's drawing of the character, McFadyen has brought out a level of vulnerability, loneliness and a sense of a rather tragic past (his sister's treatment by Wickham) that was missing in the book. Granted we're talking about psychological issues (like the very notion of a ""relationship"", a point whose anachronicity was brought up by another commenter, totally agree there) that have evolved an awful lot over 200 years, but still, I thought McFadyen's portrayal reached a depth of appeal that is necessary in order for the audience to care whether he's made deliriously happy or not. I thought Keira Knightley was far too lightweight, both literally and figuratively, to warrant his being bewitched by her. Anyone have ideas on who would have been a better Elizabeth? Forget making Kristin Scott Thomas 25 again, my first wish.<br/><br/>But that all said, Matthew McFadyen is simply unbelievably sexy and I am desperate for an archive on material about him in the UK. Any suggestions on where to find write-ups of his work? I'm moving from New York to London in a month and can look things up there if need be."
"pceglio7","10","3","6","26 November 2005"," Unexpectedly Powerful
","I was compelled to see this movie twice within as many days. I found myself moved beyond what I'd thought possible considering the genre and relative predictability of the ending. The acting, screenplay, casting, cinematography, music, set and costume design was in its totality simply ""incandescent."" This is exactly the feeling that I hope for at the conclusion of every movie that I see and book that I read. (Having said this, I should mention that I've just bought the book for a sentimental rereading with context, and intend to buy the DVD and soundtrack - What's become of me?) A hardy,heartfelt ""bravo"" to all involved in the movie's production."
"smartypants782","10","3","6","26 November 2005"," If you have read Pride and Prejudice, then you should know.
","I thought Pride and Prejudice was an overall excellent film and the best movie that I have seen this fall season. It was certainly better than Harry Potter which I had seen the week before. I didn't think that any adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved book would surpass that of the 5-hour version with Colin Firth but this one has certainly done that. Keira Knightley truly embodied the character of Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew MacFadyen played Mr. Darcy with the perfect touch of sensuality and awkwardness. I also couldn't imagine how Austen's lengthy love story could fit into a mere two hour length but it was done superbly. The actors were all well-chosen, but I do have to comment on the rather goofing nature of Mr. Bingley in this film. I did not imagine him to be the way he was but nevertheless, he only contributed positively to the quality of this movie."
"so_simpli_sweet3","9","3","6","24 November 2005"," A romantic movie you cannot miss!
","In my opinion, this is the best romantic movie I have seen since The Notebook. I have read the book, and found it very confusing, luckily by the time I finished the movie had come out. I ventured out to watch it and was amazed! While it was still difficult to understand in some parts, I loved every minute. I found myself crying at the end...although I do not know how I found it sad! The movie was a little long, but it obviously needed to be in order to fit every beautifully crafted moment into it. If I could change one thing, I wish it would have had more sensuality in it. I believe if a movie would be so romantic, it must have some physical contact to convince us. I suppose because of the rating PG this could not be done. I would convince all of you to see this movie, and then perhaps read the book. I was not disappointed at all and neither will you!"
"charlesacosta","10","3","6","23 November 2005"," A ""must see"" for hopeless romantics
","The depiction of the period was done quite well, although it never really takes you ""there"". The focus is clearly on the story, which is well done and to be admired by hopeless romantics like myself. I never read Austen's book, but the dialogue both external and internal obviously comes from brilliant writing.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly is absolutely striking, even in her 'dressed down' role. Her mannerism didn't stray to far from her endearing ways in ""Love Actually"", but fit the character of Lizzy well. Her confidence and articulation held true to the well written dialogue. Matthew MacFadyen caught me by surprise. He did a magnificent job portraying a man that appears arrogant, but is very different beneath the surface. Supporting characters were all well cast from Sutherland, Dench and Blethyn as well as the siblings (Blethtn was quite colorful, younger sisters a bit silly). In fact, Sutherland really touched me in his father-daughter scene.<br/><br/>The romance falls into place neatly (almost too neatly) and sniffles could be heard throughout the theater during the final scenes (including mine). Definitely worth the $X to see on the big screen for those that still believe in romance."
"christine-cutting","10","3","6","8 November 2005"," The film
","Matthew Macfadyen plays very well his role. I can say that because I've read the book. Of course, it's not as developed as the book but they had only two hours so I think they did a really good job. Matthew Macfadyen is always watching at Elisabeth which is really important. Moreover the story does not change from the book. Elisabeth shows well that she's proud but i think not enough. But in two hours it's difficult to hate somebody and love him after. Mr Wickham is not enough here (even if i hate this man). In the film, we don't really understand why Mr Darcy loves so quickly Miss Elisabeth. It's just because there are some moments that miss. In the book, they see each other a lot more. But the film is really really good we can feel what they feel I recommend it to everybody."
"jenniferl1993","10","3","6","6 November 2005"," Unforgettable!
","I thought the movie might be light on substance, and I certainly wasn't convinced with the movie posters. Mr Darcy looked moody in every poster I saw (one dimensional). Instead I find Mr Darcy looking enchanting oft' in the movie (especially when he proposes and the times they meet after he has declared his feelings for her). When he smiles (once!) in the scene with his sister and Elizabeth he becomes very human and believable. I liked this screenplay very much and the movie won me over with its continuity. Miss Elizabeth with her hair extensions was very obvious (why?) and why so often is her short hair shown at the back? Also I've forgotten how wonderful the clothes from that era are - well done to the wardrobe people on this movie."
"marie-wandel","5","3","6","12 October 2005"," Mixed emotions
","I have mixed emotions about Pride and Prejudice, Let me begin with a positive note. Mr. Darcy? Great performance! The actor didn't say a lot, but - wow - did he work with his eyes and face. It really impressed me. A big applause also for Donald Sutherland! I'm still a fan of this actor! Beautiful settings furthermore! The story was filmed in a very particular and lively way, you didn't get bored easily. What I didn't like about the movie: the actor that played Mr. Bingly (looked like a wet fish), Keira in her role as Elizabeth (as long as she kept her mouth shut she was beautiful on screen. When not, ugh. To many stupid giggles and to modern for the part!!). That spoiled the movie a bit for me. It proves how important casting is!"
"shipp_ahoy","4","6","16","16 November 2005"," Jane Austen would hate it.
","This is not a good film. It has good parts, but, in the end, it simply is not a good film. It is especially bad if you have actually read the book. For one thing, there is an unnerving juxtaposition of charging action (leaving the story so rushed it appears that the events that should have unfolded in the course of many months seems to occur in a few weeks) and lengthy, artistic, and dawdling, though admittedly beautifully, shots that, however beautiful, inspire the audience to wonder whether the story could have been fleshed out maybe just a little bit more if we left out at least three of the five minute scenes where absolutely nothing happens. I understand that it is difficult to fit that much story into a relatively short amount of time and still have room to be artistic, but, I feel I must ask, if it cannot be done well, should it even be attempted? Squashing it into a two-hour slot does not do the story justice.<br/><br/>Also, I must admit to having giggled my way through this movie, not because of Jane Austen's incredible wit (though there were a few lines, even new ones, that were genuinely amusing), but because the film is so terribly clichÃ© and melodramatic that it is, sadly, too laughable. Entire scenes were changed in order to cater to the ""chick-flick"" market, the members of which apparently want movies comprised of nothing but recycled cheese. I won't even discuss the extra scene at the end of the movie added on to our American edition. Jane Austen, I think, might have felt a bit insulted.<br/><br/>To give credit where credit is due, the actors did seem to give their all to the parts they were given. It certainly is not Matthew MacFadyen's fault that he's no Colin Firth (a disappointment only intensified by Mr. Firth's appearance in a trailer for his forthcoming film - an amusing little coincidence I look back on with a sort of subdued delight), nor is it his fault that his lines drip with cheese (and not expensive French cheese, but the liquor-store, aerosol-can cheese). Keira Knightley reinvents Elizabeth Bennet, and while I can't say I completely agree with the interpretation, I must admit she does it well. Jane is beautiful. Bingley is lovable. Miss Caroline Bingley was, I think, my biggest surprise. Kelly Reilly is wonderfully cold and civil, not even deigning to lower herself to a level which would permit her to snipe with Elizabeth. The interaction between Miss Bingley and Elizabeth was, I think, my favorite out of all the relationships portrayed in the movie. It was just so perfectly played. Judi Dench was, of course, fantastic - perfectly haughty - and Donald Sutherland added a vulnerability to the part of Mr. Bennet that I found rather refreshing. Sadly, one of my favorite characters, Colonel Fitzwilliam, is not only underused and practically ignored, but also terribly unattractive (My apologies to Mr. Booth for my frankness). <br/><br/>I won't even begin to expound on my dislike of how the character of Mr. Darcy was chewed up and spat out. Were Darcy an actual person, a living, breathing being, he would be absolutely horrified by some of the things he does in this movie. He... no, I won't elaborate. I wouldn't want to spoil it.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is cute in parts, but hardly worth the $10.00. Please believe me, if you adore Jane Austen's beautiful work, do not see this movie. It resembles more the terrible sequels you can find at any online bookstore than the original classic on which it is based. However, if you are anything like me at all, you probably won't be satisfied until you do see it. I understand. However, may I just point out, in closing, that while the ticket may cost you $10.00, a can of EasyCheese cannot possibly cost more than $5.00, and that is what this movie is - processed cheese."
"faithfulredhead78","3","5","13","30 November 2007"," Jane Austen Would Be Appalled
","I gave this movie a 3 because if it were just another romance movie, it would be alright. It, however, is not just another romance movie. It is supposed to be a screen adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"", one of the greatest novels ever written.<br/><br/>As a faithful screen adaptation, this film fails miserably. At least half the novel was chopped out and tossed aside. Then what was left was mashed together, reformed, and thrown onto the screen as a woefully inept representation of what Jane Austen was really writing about.<br/><br/>There are many times in this movie that a character speaks lines originally spoken by someone entirely different, and often of the opposite sex, for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Not to mention the fact that Elizabeth was found by Darcy at first to be not at all pretty, but he was then later entranced by her eyes and her spirit. Putting someone like Keira Knightly on the screen is just completely against the character description in the novel.<br/><br/>Please, do yourself a favor; read the book and then watch the A&E Pride & Prejudice. Colin Firth is excellent as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle perfectly capture's Elizabeth's playful, insouciant spirit."
"polishpickles","1","5","13","30 June 2007"," Didn't follow the plot of P & P - couldn't get past Elizabeth played badly!
","I just couldn't get into this movie. The plot started veering from the book in the first 10 minutes. Elizabeth, played by Kiera Knightly, was so incredibly off the real Elizabeth character and I believe this was the reason why I just couldn't get into this version. This Elizabeth bears absolutely no resemblance to the real Elizabeth that I have grown to love. The reason why the book Pride and Prejudice is so beloved by so many is...the story and the characters. This movie massacres both! <br/><br/>If you like this movie even a little - you will love the real thing. Look at the mini series of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth (1995). It is a great movie - the BEST version of the book. INCREDIBLE! Jennifer Ehle brought a liveliness to Elizabeth - but at the same time stayed true to the original character. It also didn't hurt that Colin Firth played Darcy. In my opinion Firth is the best Darcy - ever.<br/><br/>I was so looking forward to this one. What an incredible disappointment. Keira Knightley, please, for the love of God, close your mouth! (She poses with her mouth ever-so-slightly open in all of her movies - it also drove me nuts in Pirates.)"
"merrymommyme","4","5","13","4 November 2006"," Beautifully photographed, awfully acted, storyline lacking
","I found the movie to be lacking in major components of the story. For example, we are never given into seeing the relationship between Wickham and Elizabeth develop and deteriorate. We don't see the wildness of behavior from Lydia. We don't see the strength of character of Elizabeth. Mr Collins is lacking the absurdity of his character. Keira Knightley's acting is just going through the words. She doesn't have the conviction of the character. She's somewhat flat and uninviting.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the movie was BEAUTIFULLY photographed and set. The scene in the dance hall was wonderfully arranged.<br/><br/>If you want a beautiful and intelligent adaptation of the tale, see the BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth."
"bending_spoons2000","2","4","10","12 August 2009"," Shoot the scriptwriter!
","When making a Jane Austen film there is one golden rule that must be followed by any scriptwriter brave enough to take it on. DO NOT MESS WITH AUSTEN'S LANGUAGE! The language used in Jane Austen's books is the reason for it's longevity and popularity today. It is a beautiful subtle tapestry of wit, propriety, satire and irony; written in such a way that the words roll off the tongue like poetry. It is a dance, a play between people in which one must cut between the social politeness of the time to see what is really going on.<br/><br/>What this film did was to take Austen's language, douse it in petrol, set fire to it and then feed it to a rabid dog. The scriptwriter should be shot. When Elizabeth ran up the stairs screaming ""for once in your lives leave me alone"" something inside me died.<br/><br/>This film completely lacked the subtle interplay that comes from Austen's language, it lacked any of the social satire so famed in Austen's works and it completely lacked the delicate tension between Darcy and Elizabeth so carefully mounted in Austen's script.<br/><br/>The scriptwriter CLEARY had no knowledge of how to write in the English regency style LET ALONE attempt Austen! Some of the lines felt very Americanised, far too modern and far too much use of slang to be considered a part of Austen's world.<br/><br/>What gets me is if you are going to do a Jane Austen novel in period, then you must use Jane Austen's words. You cannot put a modern twist on a period drama as this director and writer seem to have done. If you want to make a modern version then make a modern version don't opt for something in between, because the only thing you'll achieve is a great pile of nothingness and a bunch of very angry Austen fans! Somebody really should have contacted Emma Thompson for some script writing assistance! Austen's words speak for themselves! <br/><br/>There were some incredibly dodgy costume choices for the period in question too and for a man to enter the bed chamber of a woman...well if the scriptwriter wants shooting then so do the researchers! And could somebody please tell me why all of the cast members looked as if they had been in contact with a blind sheep shearer? I have never seen such awful haircuts!<br/><br/>The real beauty of some scenes were missed or completely ignored, for example. In the film Elizabeth is seen receiving Jane's news of Lydia's elopement and then seconds later is sobbing so much she can't deliver the news to her uncle, aunt and Darcy. In the book, Lizzy receives the news alone and is just digesting it when Darcy comes to call. He sees that something is immediately wrong, sits Lizzy down and is desperately worried for her and her situation. In this scene it is made so abundantly clear how much Darcy cares for Elizabeth, yet how constricted he is by the social rituals he must adhere to as a man of his stature. Lizzy is not a hysterical wreck and the subtle interplay between them both in this scene melts my heart. The film completely destroyed this scene! The writer and director NEVER made use of any scene to it's best advantage!<br/><br/>The actors themselves were also short of their mark's, with the one exception of Judy Dench who can do this sort of stuff in her sleep.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly's Elizabeth was far too headstrong and dare I say obnoxious for the character of Lizzy. Yes Lizzy was headstrong, playful with her words and not afraid to speak her mind. But she was also a woman in possession of good social conduct and always toed the line with regards to society. That is why her father considers her to be the only sensible daughter he spawned! The Elizabeth played by Knightly did not have any of the subtleties or the quiet sense of strength for which Elizabeth is known. Knightly's Elizabeth was almost as hysterical as Lydia in some scenes and she did not possess the grace or demeanour to effectively pass off Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland's Mr Bennett...I don't even know where to start...he lacked all the delicate irony and understanding Austen gifted him with in the book.<br/><br/>Mr Darcy...well he had a hard act to follow...and follow it he could not. He lacked Darcy's pride, but the material with which he was given was shocking. ""I love you""...Austen did such a good job of conveying the love and passion between Darcy and Elizabeth that there was never any need to affirm it in such a cheap hollywoodistic way! I could go on and on about the pitfalls of this film for ever. It really is an abomination of Austen's most cherished work. <br/><br/>Get the BBC mini series on DVD and fall in love with the real magic of Austen's words! ** Only for the cinematography."

The fact that this movie was celebrated is absolutely appalling, I understand it was probably made for women, but still I cannot help but wonder why something so boring has been made and re-made so many times, you'd think once, even twice would be enough. Keira Knightly has reached a new point of annoying in this film. I will give it some props, it does have some wonderful scenery, and Donald Sutherland is a very fine actor, the mother pimping her daughters was just awful too. I give this movie 12 thumbs down."

","Reviews of this film have ranged from very good to very poor. Many of the fans of the novel or the 1995 BBC version have obvious issues with this film. Of course it doesn't include every Austen detail (I would know,I have read the book about 6 six and I own the BBC version) and of course it takes liberties with the true text. This is a main stream movie. Somehow all the beauty of the novel had to be crammed into a two hour movie. I think it is beautifully done. I hope it brings about new Austen crazed fans. <br/><br/>If anything, I think of this film as my P&P quick fix. In two hours I get all my favorite scenes and all the romance I need to hold me over until I see it again. It doesn't hurt that the lead characters aren't too hard on the eyes either. This film beautifully illustrates lust and passion without actually showing the act of sex (there is only on brief kiss in the end). This is something that Hollywood crazed Americans rarely get a chance to appreciate. Who knew the touch of a hand could hold so much feeling? The whole film is just superb. Brava to Joe Wright!"
"tesoro007","9","4","10","16 October 2005"," Liked the film's interpretation
","I'm afraid I don't agree with Joejoesan - having seen both, I think the series had its merits and the film is great as a standalone. My friend and I are both big fans of the series although we both agree that Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth were miscast - the first because she wasn't feisty enough and the second because, as all his other roles, he was rather wooden. However, the series as a whole was enjoyable. <br/><br/>The film had more impact as we both felt Keira brought the feisty Elizabeth Bennett more to life and Matthew MacFadyen was much more believable as Mr Darcy as you actually saw emotion on his face and heard it in his voice. Of course, he looked like he was suffering from a cold but that could just be wandering around the grassy meadows in the cold, English climate doing that :-)<br/><br/>Nothing beats the book of course as you can populate the characters with your own interpretations. I'd like to see the the series re-done with Keira and Matthew in the leading roles (but no wet shirt scene please!). As for kisses - the series only had one itself at the very end and if you watch the DVD/Video you can see how very ... err... unromantic it was and should have been edited out. I think the film didn't need it and, based on viewing the trailer, it probably was there but cut out before the film was released.<br/><br/>All in all, I give it 9 out of 10 and would be happy to watch this film again.<br/><br/>Tesoro"

","When I first saw that Kiera Knightly was slated to play Elizabeth, I was already unimpressed. I'm not saying I completely dislike this young actress, but she is not the right girl to play a very strong female character.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the movie flows fairly well--as well as it could with awfully stilted acting.<br/><br/>The colors seem a little odd as though the film is trying to display the same lighting techniques used in paintings of the period. This gives it a soft and very romantic feel, but ultimately help to mute the real impact ""Pride and Prejudice,"" as Jane Austen wrote it, gives.<br/><br/>People who tell you this is like the book have clearly never read it. If you want to see a more accurate rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" watch the BBC version with Colin Firth (awesome mini series!).<br/><br/>I must say the music is wonderful. If you like to watch movies for lovely colors and great music then I guess this is it! Really though it was a pretty terrible attempt at making a Jane Austen novel into a movie. Historically inaccurate, frumpy hair styles rather than the Grecian styles of the period, very stilted if not outright bad acting, untrue to the classic novel.<br/><br/>If you're just looking for a good looking guy to come walking romantically through a field in the early morning light...well this does deliver on that.

"vanhunks-1","4","5","14","31 July 2009"," Ten years later, a poor shadow of the 1995 version
","I just watched this 2005 version of P & P, ten years and very, very many views later of the 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle. I can't say that I'm happy with this Keira Knightly version. The pacing caused the events to present as blurry moments, fragments taken from the book and patched together that had me grabbing my head. It is natural to use one's previous viewings of other adaptations as benchmark and unfortunately, this film falls quite short of my appreciation of the Colin Firth/Ehle version.<br/><br/>It's a poor Hollywoodized film with a laboured, thin adapted screenplay that is nowhere near as strong as the adaptation Emma Thompson did of ""Sense and Sensibility"" where, uncannily, one had the impression of all the events in the book, though of necessity shortened for the film, seamlessly put together. Not so here. This quality is absent from Pride and Prejudice of 2005. What I didn't like was the too frivolous younger Bennet Girls whom I couldn't distinguish one from the other. Lydia? This character didn't emerge as the selfish, militia hugging teenager, much stronger than Kitty, therefore should have nailed it with her individuality. This didn't happen so Lydia's elopement doesn't come across seriously enough as the social no-no that it indeed was early 19th century.<br/><br/>I've seen a few Darcys. Laurence Olivier [1940], David Rintoul [1980] and Colin Firth [1995], and to me Colin Firth is the standout turn in this role. I have a high regard for Dame Judy Dench, but as Lady Catherine de Burgh she was forced.<br/><br/>Not a film I liked as much as I loved the 1995 adaptation."
"tvspace","2","5","14","23 April 2009"," Soapy modernism
","While this film is in many ways technically well crafted, it is completely spoiled by the anachronistic attitudes of the characters. Throughout, the important characters behave as if they were modern Americans (and in Donald Sutherland's case, speaks like one), rather than citizens of the early 19th century, where the movie is set. <br/><br/>While I'm actually a big fan of some of the movies that re-imagine novels like Pride & Prejudice in a modern setting (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary, etc.), when the director decides to make a period picture that presumes to represent Jane Austen's novel as written, there has to be some minimal standard for adhering to the historical nature of the book. This movie fails (badly) to meet that minimal standard. In fact, the way the folks in this movie behave more like characters who wandered out of Beverly Hills 90210 strikes an offensive note. It suggests self-absorption: the modern audience isn't really interested in what it might have been like to live in Austen's day, but rather wants to be reassured that it was a simple mirror image of their own melodramatic, ""emo"" existence. <br/><br/>It rubs one the wrong way to think that people who will never read the Austen book will sit through the movie, and come away thinking they've in any way digested what Austen had to offer. It isn't merely a matter of style differences (though the style of speech and interaction often feels far more modern than historic). It's that the very relationships between the characters as written by Austen are strongly affected by their class standings and differences. It's impossible to read the book and not understand that Austen's primary task in the writing of it was to criticize and satirize the class underpinnings of her society. To turn such a book into a simple soap opera is sham. <br/><br/>The ironic thing is that Austen's book is much funnier and livelier than this movie. Pride and Prejudice as written has more in common with Monty Python dressing up as middle-class British ladies in order to make fun of (20th century) British society than it does with this maudlin romance."

","I lost interest in this production of Pride and Prejudice very quickly and could not bring myself to watch more than about twenty minutes. Within the first few moments I encountered bad camera work and especially poor sound design. Do the people responsible for the sound not understand that amplification for musical instruments had yet to be invented in the period in which this story is set? The dialogue is difficult to understand over the anachronistically over-loud music in the tedious ball scene. I switched off.<br/><br/>In remaking a classic the new version is bound to be compared with earlier works. The 1995 TV mini series version stands head and shoulders over this one."
"johnbridger","1","3","7","14 October 2015"," Awful
","Another reviewer has compared this unfavourably against Bride and Prejudice and I have to agree. The 1980 version is better and of course comparison with the 1995 one makes this appear like a bad amateur stage production. I confess I have yet to see the 1940 version but Lawrence Olivier is doubtless a superb Darcy.<br/><br/>The casting/acting is dire, I did not find a single character who appeared anything like those in the book (apart from the housekeeper at Pemberly and the incomparable Dame Judi as Lady Catherine). Darcy has become an effeminate wimp, Lizzy is little more than a girl, Mr. Bennet is now an old, American tramp, Mrs. Bennet looks like she should be living on benefits, Miss Darcy sounds and looks as though she is about 12 years old, Jane has clearly spent time at the hairdresser as her eyebrows do not match her blond hair, and so on and so on. I can only assume they looked at the 1995 TV series and tried to cast completely opposite in a vain effort to appear different.<br/><br/>The script is sadly far removed from the sharp, witty writing of Jane Austen. Worse still it is delivered in melodramatic fashion making it quite awful to listen to, without an ounce of wit or humour.<br/><br/>The film jumps from scene to scene so that the story does not so much flow as jerk along. <br/><br/>Do not waste your time on this poor (the highest praise I can offer) excuse for an adaptation. There are much better versions available."
"Sspeicher","1","3","7","6 July 2013"," Unbelievably awful
","I saw an execrable stage performance of an ""up-to-date"" version of P&P in which, when Mrs. Bennet insisted that Lizzy listen to Mr. Collins's proposal, she actually dragged her, kicking and screaming, offstage. So I figured nothing could possibly be worse. I was wrong. From Keira Knightly's smirking and mugging, to the younger sisters' incessant screeching, to the lack of decorum in dancing and visiting (Bingley in Jane's bedroom?) and the historical inaccuracies in houses, clothing, and social conventions, this movie was unwatchable. The first time I tried to watch it, I quit when Elizabeth ran outside to take some rags off the clothesline. This time, I got as far as the pig's hindquarters wandering through Longbourne. The Bennets are landed gentry although not fabulously wealthy; Elizabeth tells Lady Catherine, ""I am a gentleman's daughter."" No one in the family works: Mr. Bennet spends his days in the library, the girls do needlework, visit, and write letters and they keep at least three servants that are mentioned in the book: a housekeeper, a cook, and a groom. This could have been translated into a modern version (think a rich young attorney versus Prince William)--but it wasn't. It was laughable, but also tragic that so many people who ""loved"" it have no concept of a world that existed before they were born, and one that existed far longer than our modern one. From Juliet to Eliza Bennet to me in the 1950s, no girl would have dared to show such disrespect to her parents-- she (and I) would have been thrown out of the house. And since she couldn't earn her own living, she followed the golden rule --whoever has the gold makes the rules. This movie is the antithesis of Austen's intentions. Watch Elizabeth Garvey in the earlier version and see how a strong will can coexist with graciousness and manners."
"Henry_Ireton","3","3","7","8 January 2011"," Shameful execution of a classic masterpiece
","Pride & Prejudice Pride & Prejudice is one of English Literatures all time classic novels, one which has over the years been adapted into television drama, stage play and film. This 2005 re-working directed by Joe Wright sadly misses the mark.<br/><br/>For me, the film falls down tremendously in so many areas beginning with the director and cinematography, or lack of. One might argue that good bread doesn't need butter and likewise such a wonderful novel needs no directorial spin, but given the locations in which P&P is set, and that it was an age when the British were becoming aware of nature and the concept of appreciating natural wonders, I felt that there is such scope for beautifully shot scenes of English countryside with dew covered cobwebs in hedgerows and misty morning sunrises. With the exception of one sweeping landscape filmed in Yorkshire there is nothing in the way of cinematography. Scenes were shot often from a few limited camera angles and whilst I'm not suggesting the film needed CGI and gimmicks I did feel it lacked any real sense of the director input and in that way failed to stand out from any of the previous adaptations.<br/><br/>Another failing for me was the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett and Matthew Macfadyn As Darcy. It must be said that in 1995 Colin Firth claimed the role his own and even twenty years later it must be a fairly daunting task to take it on given the standard set. Which begs the question why cast Macfadyn, a Welshman with a Welsh accent? As distracting as this may be it pales in comparison to his expressionless face. A more dull and tedious portrayal of Darcy I am yet to see, and hope I never do for ?Macfadyn I believe would have been far better cast as the Intolerable Mr Collins as he lacked any of the charisma one associates with the character of Darcy. Donald Sutherland was also poorly cast I felt. Has had a wide an illustrious career, but Sutherland's portrayal of characters is often limited in their depth and he is not an actor who immediately springs to mine when thinking of Mr Bennett. Given the immense depths of British character, film, TV and stage actors far more capable of playing the role, and without the monotonous Canadian accent of Sutherland, the viewer is left to believe that he was cast purely as a 'household' name to put large US buttocks onto US cinema seats, perhaps the money behind the film felt Keira Knightly herself and the title of Pride & Prejudice alone was not enough.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Keira Knightly. From the moment we are introduced to Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett I could not see how this adaptation could redeem itself. There is nothing eighteenth century about Knightly, not her frame, features, mannerisms and she never looks anything other than a 21st century girl dressed by wardrobe. You only have to go back 100 years to see that any woman over 5' was considered tall, 5'2"" was a veritable giant. I'm not suggesting the cast should all have been short, but a tall talentless actress in a Georgian frock does not an Elizabeth Bennett make. Yet it gets worse, Keira must have convinced herself that the little nose wrinkling snigger and Cheshire cat grin would somehow be endearing when in fact it was irritating and off putting.<br/><br/>It was then, a disastrous adaptation, one not befitting of the weighty name it carries and a shameful disappointment. Those wishing to see this classic novel in celluloid form would be better off finding the 1995 BBC dramatisation with Colin Firth.<br/><br/>3/10"
"karalovesscience","10","3","7","16 April 2009"," I really enjoyed this movie...
","I think the movie ""pride and Prejudice"" was a great movie. I could tell that the actors and actresses were carefully selected to match each character, and I think they each did a good job to fulfill their role. My favorite actress in this movie would have to be Keira Knightley, she really brought the whole movie together, in my opinion. Another thing that I really think turned out very well is the setting of the story. It looked very authentic, and the story takes place in a lot of different places. For example her house is almost exactly how I would have a pictured a house in the eighteen hundreds as well as with the outside scenery. My favorite parts of the movie , what I thought made this movie completely unique, was how it was filmed. When I watched the part where Mr.Darcey purposed to Elizabeth, it was raining and thundering and the weather was very intense just like their argument was. So I thought that was a really good way to grab everyone's attention. I thought that the dialog for the story was good however, some things they were saying it was a little hard for me to understand- either what the words meant or what they were saying. The music during the movie was wonderful too, and I really enjoyed it especially the scene where Elizabeth is sitting on the swing spinning. It is raining outside, and the music is playing that really made me feel for Elizabeth. The movie got really intense this point. In this story there is a lot of misunderstandings and problems between the characters which got me hooked into the story. The part when Lidia runs away and marries Mr.Whitcomb, and Mr.Darcey ends up paying for the wedding so Lidia and her family didn't look bad really shocked me. That he would do that and especially not wanting anyone to know.I knew at by that point in the movie he wasn't as a bad as a guy as Elizabeth thought he was. As for the movie ""Pride and Prejudice"" I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who is looking for a romance. Jane Austen is a terrific author and this is one of her most well known novels of all time. Her story aided by Joe Wright's directing."

","Whilst no film can ever really replace a book from which it has beenadapted, this film, whilst nowhere as good or as accurate as the BBC TVseries does come very close to the original story. For a two hour filmit is excellent. The setting is very good and the acting is superb asone might imagine with such a superb cast. This is a highly recommendedpiece of cinema. It is quite possible that the setting for this film is more accurate than the BBC TV programme although this is the only point on which it outscores this version.

","As soon as I saw Matthew Macfadyen's name as Mr. Darcy, I knew this was going to be good. It is brilliant. A classic story with some great actors.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Donald Sutherland's performance was, in places, very poor. There was one important scene where his words were quite important to the story, and he simply mumbled them all - completely unintelligible. It really was bad, but fortunately he doesn't have a lot to say in other scenes.<br/><br/>I don't know why the director didn't ask him to say his lines again - perhaps Sutherland was playing the ""I'm a famous actor"" role and the director was too scared to insist on another take.<br/><br/>His elocution was put to shame by just about every one of the rest of the cast. Macfadyen, of course, speaks absolutely perfectly as does Kiera Knightley, so Sutherland's performance next to theirs was made to look even worse.<br/><br/>I wonder if there is something wrong with his top teeth - too large or badly fitting dentures? I also noticed that in scenes where he has to laugh, he often covers his mouth as if he is ashamed of his top set of teeth. Very strange.<br/><br/>Anyway, try not to think about Sutherland's elocution or top teeth when you're watching this film - it really is brilliant."
"DAHLRUSSELL","4","3","7","20 February 2008"," Buy the CD... unfortunate deconstruction of the marvelous book
","There are real problems with this adaptation of P&P, and they have to do mainly with the Director's dislike of ""bonnet films"" and the choice of leading lady. The Director says he set out to make a film that did not have women in bonnets. The problem with this is that this IS what women wore, this even a recurring theme in the language and dialogue of the book, so essentially he set out to make a film that was NOT the book... so it is especially wrong to call this ""Jane Austen's"" P&P.<br/><br/>This is a deconstructionist retelling of the story, and, as such it has it's own modern charm. The mumbling leading model/actress and everyone with greasy hair and rumpled clothing undeniably appeals to a ""WB"" teen show generation, just... not true to the book. (Rosamund Pike... such a marvelous choice of Jane... talented, beautiful... lost in this production as second fiddle to such a poor leading lady.) One lovely by product of NOT following the book is a completely different interpretation of Lizzie's parents as loving and fond - a simply marvelous and fun relationship created by Sutherland and Blethen here.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent and reminiscent of French paintings of country life like ""The Reapers."" (If it needs to be mentioned, this art direction choice is EXACTLY what is wrong about the whole Directoral choice.... Brits in Austen's age would have cringed to be portrayed similar to the French peasants.) <br/><br/>By far and away what lifts this whole film up far and above is the magnificent romantic, lilting, emotional piano score by Dario Marinelli. (The piano sheet music has been selling like hotcakes.) The film will become a dated oddity. Buy the CD of the score."
"xlil_kittyx","1","3","7","3 January 2008"," OK, but a waste of time remaking when compared to the BBC version
","Whilst the film was quite good in itself, they completely misrepresented Jane Austen. They made the Bennet family look very poor, with chickens walking about, which only farm yokels would do. Ladies also always wore their hair up, unlike the film, and Keira Knightley who is very pretty looked like a beggar in her tatty clothes and wispy hair. Miss Bingley would also never wear a strappy dress, such clothing is considered undergarments. The plot is very quick moving, as is to be expected from a 2 hour adaption, and generally the character casting is reasonable, but Mr Darcy lacks prowess and handsomeness, and Brenda Bleythn has nothing on Alison Steadman. A pleasant romance worth a watch if you enjoy romantic films, but the BBC adaption is far better with not only the major characters played excellently (Hello, Colin Firth anyone?) but the minor characters all contribute to a much superior version."

"dougalboo","8","3","7","17 December 2006"," Not the greatest adaption ever made..
","""Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with is the one person you can't be without"" <br/><br/>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a blockbuster film of large budget must be in want of some dumbing down. As is witnessed in this tremendously altered version of Pride and Prejudice. The transformed novel has (I imagine) been changed to suit a wider audience than a few hundred single women, this time the target audience has been the MTV generation. The ill advised changes have been focused mainly on the language; Mr Darcy's character I am certain, would never have allowed him on an invitation to dance to reply 'Not if I can help it'. This is truly not the proud character we all know and love.<br/><br/>Along with Lizzie's Pride and Darcy's Prejudice, I cannot imagine a better suited couple to cast than Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen. Their on-screen chemistry made the film irresistible to watch. Another successful choice of cast was that of Jane Bennet (Rosamund Pike). Her radiant beauty rightfully outshone that of her sister Lizzie, whose beauty was 'tolerable'. Unfortunately the choice of Mr Bennet was unfathomable. Donald Sutherland's delivery of the role was lacking any of the subtle British humour which permeates all of Austen's work. As we have come to expect Dame Judi Dench was rolled out for another matriarchal performance as Lady Catherine De Bourgh. On this occasion she failed to steal any of the scenes from the more youthful cast.<br/><br/>If any character was likely to steal the show from Miss Knightly and co. it could well have been the great British countryside. Never has Derbyshire looked more enticingly romantic. Meanwhile the rustic Bennet farmhouse provided startling contrast to Mr Darcy's majestic Pemberly. Something that has been wanting in previous productions. Perhaps my favourite scene, that in which Darcy finally professes his love, benefited from dramatic use of a good old British rainstorm.<br/><br/>All of this rounds up to a film greater than the sum of its parts. While the film is flawed the Jane Austen tale bears the retelling. Joe Wright has just about pulled off his first feature film; we wait to see what lessons he has learnt with his next film 'Atonement', another adaptation this time of a more modern classic."
"undomiel152003","8","3","7","1 December 2006"," You Can't Please Everyone
","I think that we all should agree that this was a approx. 2hrs. If it had been a true adaptation it would have been a ten hour miniseries. My personal view is that it is a good adaptation of a book I have read. Knightly does not give a perfect performance, but she is extremely young and has a whole lifetime ahead of her. Judi Dench as always steals the movie. Tom Hollander does an amazingly funny job as Mr. Collins, and for some reason a Mr Collins I do not despise. Mathew Macfadyen did a great job, and you could see the change of countenance in his eyes. Overall the cast was a great cast that made it work beautifully. <br/><br/>Yes the movie may have certain moments where you ask ""And what of/How/ When?"", but what modern day movie does not. Even the great films have had certain questionable scenes. Yes I do understand that certain mores of that time did not permit someone to leave their ""underdressed"", but it worked for the film. I especially found the last scene to be a bit strange, though funny... where Lizzie states ""You can call me Goddess Devign"", that may have been a little too much... since this was not the 20th century England."
"Scorpiosue1102","9","3","7","1 August 2006"," A very good adaptation
","Where to start??? Well, probably the best way is to compare the 1995 mini series and the movie. I loved both, BUT it was refreshing to see that the movie has the actors closer in age than the book (Keira Knightley's 19 to Lizzie's 20 an Matthew MacFadyen's 29 to Mr. Darcy's 28). After just watching the mini series, you notice how much older the characters are in the mini series. Jane's is supposed to be around 21 and the actress was 30. Just my humble opinion. Also, the plot had to be condensed for the movie otherwise we'd have a four hour movie. That said, all the good bits and pieces are there.<br/><br/>Who could have been better cast: Mr. Bennet and Lydia. I think at times Donald Sutherland is too Canadian and Jena Malone is just too irritating. Lydia should be irritating, but not so much.<br/><br/>Who I loved: Keira Knightley's portrayal of Lizzie is so good. She still has that carefree attitude, but you can see that inner turmoil. Her turmoil at reading Jane's letter about Lydia bolting and her face in the coach. Priceless. She now knows she loves Darcy, but may never be able to be with him because Lydia has ruined the girls.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen has gotten some bad reviews, but he has done the character well. Again, the movie has to be a condensed version so we do not see as much of Darcy as we should (at least for eye candy alone). MM's eyes show us his longing of Lizzie, HIS turmoil. He also shows us Darcy's light side when he is at Pemberley. Is he Colin Firth? No, but he brings a different quiet brooding and manliness to the role.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn shows the reality of her having to marry off her daughters. Being destitute is a reality. She's over the top, but also a realist. Bravo.<br/><br/>Joe Wright (director): I love those wonderful close-ups, the sneaky looks of Mr. Darcy, and the shot of Lizzie by the cliff. Spectacular. Even Mr. Wright has said the world of CGI has made him able to do things he normally could not have. It is not easy taking on a much loved classic, but he did it well.<br/><br/>It's definitely a different vision of Pride and Prejudice, but the romantic in me loves the last scene. I know that we would never see a kiss between them in public after a ""*wink, wink* we know what you just you two just did"", but it is a wonderful scene. You get to see how much Elizabeth and Darcy really love each other.<br/><br/>A good romantic movie. Enjoy!"
"marspeach","10","3","7","6 July 2006"," Such a beautiful movie
","This is by far my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (and I've seen all the available versions except the Mormon one- 1940, 1980, 1995, and Bride and Prejudice). This movie is very realistic in that it portrays how unclean times were back then (no, it's not dirty or gross or anything, don't worry). Perhaps the filmmakers went a little too far in the case of the Bennet house, but that was done to contrast their situation to those of Darcy and Bingley.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. I was hesitant about Keira Knightley at first (I'd only seen a couple of her other movies and liked her in Bend it Like Beckham), but her Lizzy blew me away. She portrayed the arch, outspoken side of Lizzy as well as her sweet, unoffensive nature. She also really showed the character's youth. Matthew McFayden's Darcy was totally different from any interpretation I've seen (shy, puppydog) but I couldn't call it inaccurate. He and Lizzy really have chemistry together. Brenda Blethyn was an amazing Mrs. Bennet- she is annoying and embarrassing but believable not over-the-top. Rosamunde Pike is the beautiful Jane I have been waiting for. None of the other Janes I've seen are even as pretty as Lizzy. Some of the changes people might not like (but that I love)- Bingley is more of a goof, Caroline is a little meaner, Mary is prettier, and Mr. Bennet a more caring father (this one did bother me a little).<br/><br/>On top of the great cast, the cinematography is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, it uses a lot of Austen's own dialogue (but changes some of it slightly), and it's also hilarious. This was perhaps my favorite movie of 2005."

"heather6851","9","3","7","7 June 2006"," Prejudice Makes Love
","Personal favorite this year so far. Not just because I was a big fan of Jane Austin, but the delicacy and vividness within the film. A female tone with sensitivity to express the relationships among family, friends, acquaintances, and man-to-woman.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable shots was the one when Lizzy sitting on the wheel(or tire), just wondering what's wrong that happening to her so far. Family welfare never occurred to her as an important issue, since she was a independent and mind-free woman. Somehow when she was circling and watching the world around her, her world was falling down. The well-established philosophy of her own was corrupting. Her best friend, Charlotte, came toward her as a intruder of her very mind. The bomb exploded, but still cannot help her free herself from her own stubbornness.<br/><br/>The second shock was when Darcy told her about all the feelings for her. The scene was raining and she was in a deserted house. Darcy found her, and she was shocked by all his truths of her state. Never been so offended by such a pride man. Angry filled with her mind. She fought back with a sudden pose and meanest words to him. After his leaving, Elizabeth sighed and found herself lonelier than ever.<br/><br/>The highlight was arranged in the end of the film. When Betsy was questioned by Lady Catherine in the middle of the night, her sleepless made her walking in the field. Different from the original story, her frankness toward Darcy occurred on the most romantic moment--dawn with glimmering and radiance of the sun. When he asked her again, she just kissed his hand, and said ""your hands are cold."" A final relief for the audience, we could see the happy ending in the end of the film. Elizabeth Bannet's prejudice made herself complete in life."
"Kieran_Kenney","9","3","7","6 June 2006"," an example to it's genre
","One can feel daunted by the task of taking in a two hour chamber dramedy of manners, where the focus of excitement tends to fall not on a character's chance of heart but on their next chance of wardrobe. It's common enough to see such a project with lots of entrances and exits with bowing and curtsying, giggling girls and stiff men with overgrown sideburns, a lead actress who's obviously too old, and a night interior which the light coming from the fireplace illuminates the room a little too evenly.<br/><br/>With that in mind I was consistently surprised by this version of the Jane Austen novel. The dialog-reliant tale of romantic misunderstanding and class relations has been made into a film that is faithful at least in spirit, but is refreshing in it's presentation.<br/><br/>Casting is key. The Bennett family, at the center of the story, is a wonderful example in itself of ensemble acting when it works. A mix of seasoned professionals and new faces (though mostly the former), there is wonderful chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly's portrayal of Lizzie, the central character, is marvelous. Knightly, a talented and achingly gorgeous creature, has everything it takes to place herself in both the character and the time period, while remaining a real, identifiable point of reference for the character. Some of her mannerisms seem a bit modern and unusual for this type of film. When she meets a handsome male character for the first time, she sneaks a peak at his bottom. It may not sound very significant, but moments such as that, and there are many, give her character the truth, the timelessness, it needs. This skill extends to many of her fellow performers. True to the time, accessible to modern eyes, timeless. Many scenes have the breeze and honestly of a superior teen comedy.<br/><br/>The camera-work, by Roman Osin, is equally exemplary. The camera moves quite frequently, more than one would expect. The colors register beautifully, particularly in outdoor scenes. And perhaps the most inventive scene of all would be the one with the swing at the gate. (If you want to see what I mean, you'll just have to go and see it. I can't do it justice with a description)<br/><br/>Don't forget, of course, that this is still a period film, and it does still feature many of the hallmarks (some might say pitfalls) of the genre. Personally I enjoy such films even if they do consist mostly of medium shots of Emma Thompson in a corset, suffering by the window. There is the presence of Dame Judi. Nothing against her, she is a predictable presence, though a welcome enough one. The men in the film are also stock character types, but this may be something to accept. After all, it's women's film.<br/><br/>I would not suggest this film to a casual viewer, but I do advise seeing the film to anyone with a decent attention span and an open mind. In some small but enchanting ways, it's a fresh take on a classic story and a genre known for being predictable. Hopefully we will be seeing more from it's director, Joe Wright, very soon."

","Excellent adaptation. This version surpasses the BBC mini-series in many respects, especially due to it's well condensed format.<br/><br/>Where to start? Would it be the riveting soundtrack, that keeps one interested throughout the whole film? Or would it be the scenery in the movie, which takes the viewer on a memorable journey through rural England the likes of paradise? A garden of Eden that one just does not interact with so commonly in the urban scapes of today? Or the costumes, that literally plunge you into the Victorian era they are so well designed? Or the stellar acting? <br/><br/>Mr. Sutherland Sr puts on one of the best performances I have seen in a long time, the two older Bennets also being worth praise. Lizzie (Keira Knightley) does not look so pretty after her lip surgery, but who cares? She does a great job too, and the movie is so good one is forced to overlook such trivialities. Jane (Rosamund Pike) truly shines in subtle tones I did not believe her capable of, after that James Bond affair.<br/><br/>At the centre of the success of this new remake of the Jane Austen novel is the powerful grip this piece gets on the viewer. Let us not forget the character of the story - idyllic, no doubt, but isn't that what we all wish our own life was like?<br/><br/>Donald will make you laugh, as will the ongoing sarcasm between Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen is clearly the star of the show, putting Colin Firth's more subdued interpretation in a drawer. A true achievement from his part, portraying the generally misunderstood good - if brutally frontal - man to perfection!) and Lizzie among other little details. <br/><br/>For most of the movie I found myself at least smiling or else wishing events would not happen the way they do..in short, the movie makes you feel good, and truly enraptures you.<br/><br/>A fine piece! 8/10"

","Keira! You were made for action movies! Not one person could have been less suitable for Eliza Bennet. Don't they know that good looks and a British accent aren't enough to convey the strong spirit of Jane Austen's most favourite heroine? Being a huge fan of the book, and the original (mini series) starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I was extremely disappointed by this rushed, awkward, emotionless adaptation. I am not a choosy person, I enjoy any kind of film, but I was put off by Keira's whineyness. I had previously heard from friends and family very mixed reviews, but I was determined to give it a try anyways. After, I felt almost..Unclean. it may be because I've seen the original about 600 times, or because I am no fan of Keira, but I will say here and now that unless you are at a friends house and they've happened to rent the movie, don't spend your money on it! Instead, rent the 1995 mini-series, it is much more detailed, Mr.Darcy is actually cute, and I find that because Jennifer and Colin aren't exactly huge stars like Keira, it is easier to forget they are actors and become truly engrossed in the story. Not to mention, on IMDb, this movie gets an average of 7.7 whilst the 1995 version gets 9.4. Go with the major opinion!"

","I should imagine Austen would be spinning in her grave after viewing this travesty. What a terrible waste of a very talented cast. Not only was much of the dialogue unintelligible(I wonder if the director was trying to include as much as possible in two hours and told the cast to speak quickly), but neither Darcy nor Elizabeth stirred one's emotions as they should. There was a surfeit of grimacing and posing, but not much passion, in evidence. The Bennet household was portrayed as in chaos, practically showing animals in the house, which is absurd. The intended tense relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet was nowhere to be found; this is a critical piece of drama that affects the whole text and was very much missed. And poor Donald Sutherland! What was with the hand-to-the-face giggling when Elizabeth told him about her love for Darcy? Judi Dench, as Lady Catherine, does have a few minutes of glory--a welcome relief. That said, the photography was splendid. Still, all in all, a very unbelievable portrayal. As much as I love P&P, I could barely finish it."

","I balled my eyes out with joy over this movie. The romance of Pride and Prejudice was enthralling as it unfolded through its curiosities with intent and deliberation. MacFadyen and Knightley were beautiful to watch as well as everyone. This was such a gorgeous film that I watched it twice back to back. I could watch it again for the story and sub plots within regarding class and status were fascinating. Austen's classic story was given justice by this film. I fell in love with everything. Well done. A love story that broke me down as it pointed to the illusions within relationships. Intelligent, engaging, honest. I can't say enough how I enjoyed this movie."
"Saturn131313","9","3","7","6 May 2006"," Much, much better than I expected.
","Okay, I admit this up front--when I first heard a remake of P & P was being filmed I thought, ""Jeez, not another one?!?"" After all redoing something isn't necessarily an improvement. (Think of how many times Jane Eyre (by Bronte,I know,I know) has been produced and badly too!) However being a Jane Austen fan I needed to check this version out. I am certainly glad I did. It gives audiences a different view and interpretation of the story.<br/><br/>I like the way the director decided to present a gentler version of all the characters--Mrs. Bennett is silly and displays at times some improper behaviors as do the younger daughters but they are not portrayed as ridiculously appalling. Mr. Darcy seems remote and dismissive but also appears (even to Lizzy at the beginning, miserable) a little depressed, repressed, even sad. Still he responds to Lizzy's sparkling personality even though he probably doesn't want to acknowledge this to anyone, including himself,when they first meet.<br/><br/>The humor also is charming and well placed in the movie. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is Darcy sitting on an old chair outside the Bennett home, the dog sitting next to him and the chickens pecking on the ground while he waits to receive consent from Mr. Bennett--a clever way of showing Mr. Darcys' true attachment to Lizzy.( Much of what needs to be communicated from the story has to be done not through dialog but in other ways) Another is Lydias' thing with her handkerchief and the marching regiment.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the earthier view of things: the animals about, dust, wind, rain, the regular clothing of the Bennet family contrasted with others of greater wealth. The less than perfectly groomed hair and also the vigorous dancing at the Mereton Assembly are wonderful additions.<br/><br/>Casting actors of appropriate ages for the parts of Lizzy and Darcy (I think they were only a year or two different in actual ages from the characters in the book) is a refreshing change. All fans of the 1995 version please forgive me, but I thought both Firth and Ehle looked too old for their respective parts. Jennifer Ehle is just too beautiful for the role of Lizzy anyway. Please do not misunderstand me: I love the 1995 version, I own it and have watched it probably 50 times at least. I just mean I liked and appreciated the fact the producers could find and cast talented actors of roughly the same age as the actual characters of the book. Matthew McFadyen in particular looked the right age especially in close ups and his blue eyes made him look more vulnerable. Being American, I had never heard his name before but he is certainly an actor whose future work I will follow with interest.<br/><br/>The only real criticism I can offer is I wish there had been more screen time for the development of the secondary characters who do make important contributions to the story. And like many others, I wish it had been longer!<br/><br/>I have never seen the 1940 version and I am not sure I want to but take a look at the 1980 version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul if you haven't seen it. It is much like the book and is produced like a play for television. This Mr. Darcy is handsome enough to die for and it is true to the book as well."

","n this ""Pride & Prejudice,"" we can understand at a glance how much, or how little, money means to any given character: We can read anxiety or confidence in the cut of an overcoat, in the type of knickknacks that decorate a room, even in the set of a character's shoulders. In this ""Pride & Prejudice,"" realism isn't a punishment, but a kind of music, a sound that cuts from Austen's day to ours with the clarity of a strong radio signal. There isn't a frame in the picture that doesn't feel alive and immediate, instead of merely faithful.<br/><br/>Austen's novel, written in 1797 but not published until 1813, is one of the most fiercely beloved books in the English language, and those of us who love it are ferociously protective of the characters at the center of it: Twenty-year-old Elizabeth Bennet (here played by Keira Knightley), whose intelligence is her greatest gift and whose cleverness is her greatest burden, and Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), a young man of privilege and breeding who unconsciously hides his sensitive, fine-grained character behind a scrim of snobbery. The casting here is more perfect than in any ""Pride & Prejudice"" adaptation I've seen (I confess I'm not a fan of the popular 1995 British miniseries, which I found so slow, proper and reverent that it seemed a direct inversion of the spirit of the book), and Wright is fearless in his handling of the characters, refusing to bow to their iconic stature. It's as if he's unraveled every golden thread we've spun around Elizabeth and Darcy over the years to reveal living, breathing people underneath. He's saved them from the mummification of our love.<br/><br/>""Pride & Prejudice"" opens with a shot of the English countryside, but even then, it's not the generic assemblage of Kelly-green rolling hills we usually get, scenery for scenery's sake. This landscape is a misty blue-green, and it hasn't quite woken up yet, although the birds twittering on the soundtrack are beginning to nudge it toward consciousness -- an early promise that Wright is more interested in action than in tasteful, period lethargy. Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy to her family) is of a piece with this landscape. While Knightley has the kind of face that's universally considered beautiful, her beauty feels muted here -- it's deferential to her expressiveness. The alertness in her eyes, the way her smile seems to crack out of nowhere like a sliver of sunlight on a cloudy day: Everything about her speaks of serene, as opposed to brash, self-confidence and intellectual mischievousness."

You may have loved the 5 hour version well good for you a mini series can do that but a movie cant, so don't be mad about that but the idea that Matt days a poor job as Darcy regardless of how boring you may find him or how the mini series was more of what you pictured in your head you have to remember that unlike a book a movie is a representation of what someone else saw in there head while reading this novel if you didn't see the same thing it doesn't make it bad its just different and you need to realize that and respect this movie for Joe Writes pure cinematic genius in his first feature film and Mathew McFadden's ability to play a Darcy that any man can respect. The way he portrays Darcy is beautiful and moving and if you spend the whole time going hey this isn't Darcy well then quite frankly you are wrong because this is Darcy as Macfadyen sees him and not u if you don't like it make your own movie! If you stop comparing this to other Jane Austen attempts maybe you will realize this movie is brilliant, beautiful and moving and the musical background is well picked combined with cinematically stunning concepts to make you really feel the love between these two characters and not some giddy fake or foolish love that you see in society today but a love that seems real, with its problems and its perfection in how chaotic it is that brings anyone male or female to a point at which they long for something so true in there life love or not but something.<br/><br/>This is one of the most beautiful love stories ever written and having read the book I consider this a fantastic ADAPTATION! Of a great novel so if you have two hours in your day I beg you to please watch this movie regardless of what the others on this site say about it because you may find yourself filled with a strange yet pleasant emotion at the end of this film that you have never felt before and that's what a movie is suppose to do, combine wonder story with, music that portrays the mood and cinematography that emphasizes emotion in a way that no other medium can.<br/><br/>oh and one last thing, they don't kiss on the bridge SO WHAT! a kiss would have been cheese and Joe Wright avoids a kiss intentionally if you listen to the commentary you would know this, you would also know the reason they don't wear bonnets despite the fact that they are mentioned often in the book is because Wright did not feel bonnets would work as well cinimaticaly so stop complaining before u hear his explanations the man is a perfectionist and was not completely satisfied with any scene in the movie and because of that mad something quite nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Brian"

","This movie is, perhaps, perfect. I saw it four times in four weeks, always on the same day, and that way I knew that I had this treat waiting for me on Tuesday. I teach Jane Austen at a University in the UC system, so I am familiar with her work as well as with the film and television adaptations. This movie is better than what most people know as 'the Colin Firth mini-series'while it understandably cannot follow the facts of the book as accurately as the much longer mini-series, it has much more life in it than the mini-series, life that seems translated directly from the book, but also a life of it. The movie delights in a sort of beauty which is rich with colour and water and lightright now I am imagining the deep water-fed grass and the trees that seem a little prehistoric or fantastic; Keira's dresses, her eyes, the take through the ball which, after turning a corner, rests finally on Keira's sad face in a blue shadow. An abridged version of all that might be just to say that Pride and Prejudice is graceful. It is filled to the brim with grace. The even deeper, governing genius of the movie is in its presentiment of something sacred; we get closer, we get further away, and at acute focal points we are pulled almost right to the centre of that something sacred. See this movie."

","As this has been one of my favourite books since I was 12 and the BBC version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle - perfectly casted and wonderful - I put off seeing the 'Hollywoodesque' version until yesterday. I promised that I would give it a fair chance in light of how it had already been done to perfection by the BBC. I knew I wasn't going to like it the minute Matthew McFayden walked on set. Respect to him for taking a part that Colin Firth immortalised and he is a good actor but he sounded like he was reading the script out loud to himself. There was no emotion or interaction - he was utterly lifeless. No No No! I don't normally like Knightley but found her to do the part justice and I thought the actress playing Lydia to be unwatchable and generally horrendous. Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland were marvellous as always but I felt utterly betrayed. I tried to give it a chance but the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice is the only version of this truly wonderful book that should ever be made. No wooden TV actor or bone protruding teeth baring wimpette will ever replace Ehle and Firth as Darcy and Elizabeth. Not recommended at all."
"annemaart","6","3","7","5 March 2006"," Watchable, but nothing compared to the 1995 mini series
","Not that bad of a movie, but compared to the BBC mini series made in 1995, the movie falls short. The characters just aren't as nicely worked out. Mr. Darcy is far too nice throughout the whole thing and Mrs. Bennet isn't wacky enough. I also thought some plot twists were left out and oversimplified. <br/><br/>Also, the whole movie seemed rather slow to me. And I know that's not due to the story. I think the slowness is partly due to the many arty farty camera shots. Lots of scenery. A shot of Lizzie sitting on a swing, spinning around (which i didn't really understand the point of). <br/><br/>Last but not least, the ending made no sense at all to me. It was a very weird way to end the movie, in my opinion. <br/><br/>The whole movie was a bit too Hollywoodian for my tastes. The story is still brilliant, and the scenery was nice, so 6 out of 10 for that. It's worth a look if you haven't read the book and want a nicely polished up, modern version of the story. But if you want to see good actors, in a good film that's true to the story and the time the book was written in: go and watch the mini series. It's much nicer."
"Vash2001","6","3","7","6 February 2006"," Beautiful yet disappointing in a way
","Jane Austen's most popular novel has appeared on the screen many times successfully. I was almost afraid that it would be boring, but this wonderful story will never grow old.<br/><br/>First the positives.<br/><br/>The camera captures the beauty of the English countryside and makes this a worthwhile movie going experience. Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland are excellent as Mr. & Mrs. Bennett. Judy Dench is good as always in the small role of Lady Catherine de Berg. Keira Knightley looks stunningly beautiful, and overshadows the elder sister Jane who is supposed to be the beauty in the family. Matthew McFayden's Mr.Darcy is handsome and sensitive, but needs more pride to be like the character in the book. Mr.Charles Bingley was amiable but just a little too sweet. Lyida the youngest sister and Mr.Wickham were played well in limited roles. The humor which is present throughout the novel is just as effective in the movie. One scene that is effective in the movie is when Elizabeth tours Pemberley and walks around the museum. She sees the statue of Mr.Darcy (I think in the book it was a painting, but can't be sure) and her expressions soften. We can see that her opinion of him is changing and perhaps she is regretting what she missed.<br/><br/>Now the negatives.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley's Elizabeth looks too modern in her posture, walking style, and even hairstyle. She is brilliant in some scenes (esp. when she tells Mr.Darcy that he would be the last person in the world she would marry). In some other scenes though all she seems to do is narrow her eyes or smile. The fault may lie in the script, which is not completely honest with Austen's novel. In the book Mr.Darcy proposes to Elizabeth at the Collins's house, and second time at the Bennett house (outdoor, IIRC). The movie took liberties with the locations. Darcy and Elizabeth somehow meet in the rain when he proposes to her the first time. What was she doing all alone there? This was supposed to be 18th century England. In the second proposal scene, which is even worse, They both wander outside early morning and run into each other (""I could not sleep""; ""Neither could I""). The dialog sounds too modern, and so is the scene. The screen writers would have been better off using Jane Austen's writings which were much more effective.<br/><br/>The movie is more effective when it is following the book closely, particularly the dialogs and locations. I was disappointed in the way some things had been changed from the original version and it did not improve the movie. It did the opposite. It would have been good to show at the end how Mrs. Bennett was thrilled to see 3 of her daughters married, and shots of the two couples -The Darcys and The Bingleys- would have been more appropriate than the romantic last scene between Darcy & Elizabeth. I wish the screenplay had been written better.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is worth seeing, in spite of the flaws, because of the beautiful cinematography, and good acting by the cast."

","Adapting a novel to film is always tricky. Especially one that has already been given such comprehensive treatment as Pride & Prejudice has already received in the previous BBC and A&E versions.<br/><br/>However, there were so many things that could have been done better even with the restricted time constraints.<br/><br/>The dialog: The actual lines adapted from the novel jarred harshly with those that were supplied by the script writer. Phrases were used that were obviously at odds with the time period portrayed. The actors appeared to be speaking at break neck speed most of the time.<br/><br/>The setting: While the Bennets were not well off, they were not peasantry. Furthermore, even if they were as poor as portrayed, poverty is not an excuse for mess, filth and general untidiness.<br/><br/>Character Development Most of the comedy that is a hallmark of Jane Austen's side characters was stripped. Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine could not be viewed as funny despite their repellent personalities.<br/><br/>Most of the Characters behaved with mannerisms that were distinctly wrong for both their time periods and who they were supposed to be as people.<br/><br/>Miss Knightly's Elizabeth was far to aggressive in many of her behaviors. People didn't so easily invade one another's body space as she does in the scene where she rejects Darcy's proposal. Elizabeth's mannerisms should have been in contrast to that of her younger sisters. And (this is the fault of the script) she would not have said anything actually cruel to her mother.<br/><br/>Mr. McFadden's Darcy looked like an advertisement of someone in serious need of antidepressants rather than an attitude adjustment.<br/><br/>Charlotte Lucas was written as desperate rather than practical.<br/><br/>A few positives that keep it from being a total bomb. The music and scenery were lovely.<br/><br/>A few scenes worked very well. For example, when Lizzie and Darcy meet at his home. The awkwardness felt very genuine yet sweet.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Bennets relationship was more kindly portrayed than in previous adaptations."

","I've read the book at least 20 times and I've watched the BBC version many times. I will also confess to fast forwarding (gasp!) through the BBC version once or twice when I craved the joy and beauty of the series, but lacked the time. The movie is obviously missing some of the quirks and characters that I love about Jane Austen's book. However, I am certainly familiar enough with the material to ""fill in the blanks"" that the movie has created. I know Wickhams full story and therefore am not disturbed by the absence of detail in this new version. I enjoyed this movie and found it to be a pleasant and romantic escape from the daily grind. I managed to sneak to the theatre twice to see it and would gladly go again if the opportunity arose. I left the movie smiling with that warm fuzzy feeling, and that was good enough for me.

","I went to this movie (presently in limited release here in Los Angeles) with what I hope was an open mind, even though I'm a big fan of the 1995 BBC production. I did enjoy it on the whole, but I do have some reservations. For instance, I can understand why many things had to be compressed because of the shorter length of the movie, but why did they decide to set it in an earlier period than Austen intended? I love the elegance of the BBC production--elegant homes, elegant clothing, elegant dancing. This production featured a lot of noise and a lot of bouncing around (intentional because of the period, I understand). <br/><br/>I thought Keira Knightley made an excellent Lizzie, though. She has that rare luminescent quality that makes the screen hers alone whenever she's in a scene. But I didn't care for Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy. He seemed mostly sad, rather than mysterious and brooding, and wasn't in my opinion handsome enough for Darcy (although he does have beautiful eyes). <br/><br/>Oh, for Colin Firth and that impromptu dive into the lake!"
"stillselling","5","3","7","12 November 2005"," Landscape was only beautiful part of the movie
","The landscapes and architecture are the best part of the movie. Too many moments wasted with nothing being said. Too many looks at Elizabeth. Too much spinning around with her in the swing. They clearly tried to make this a one-person perspective movie - watch it through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet. The problem: the book was not written in first person. So many of the characters were never properly introduced or given their time to shine (which couple exactly were her Aunt and Uncle Gardner that play such an important role in th book??) The mother was too mellow and therefore could not be laughed at properly. The father was cast as overly negative rather than sensible.<br/><br/>This movie was for P&P Fans only. Someone who has never read the book or seen the previous screen adaptations would be lost and have 100 questions afterward (What was it Lydia did? What is up with Wickam? What happened to Jane & Bingley?) But when Netherfield is first shown, it took my breath away. It's just too bad they didn't use that extra time they spent seeing bright spots on the screen as you're viewing the sunrise through Elizabeth's closed eyes on the breathtaking grounds of Pemberley.<br/><br/>I was all ticketed up to see this several times but excepting a friend who has no one else to go with, I won't be returning. I'll spend my money on a second copy of the A&E version to replace the one I've just about burned out."
"mcadle","8","3","7","20 October 2005"," A different take and just as valid. Knightley comes of age as a great actress
","My wife and I are longtime Austen fans. She owns the 1940 film (Greer Garson as Elizabeth), 1980 BBC (Susan Garvie) and 1995 version.<br/><br/>I like other reviewers found this to be a refreshing version with a different take on 'Pride and Prejudice'. It is tightly edited which leads to a fast-pace, sometimes frenetic, necessary to fit the book in a relatively short film. You have to keep up, but the information is there - sometimes not spoken. The film focuses much more on Elizabeth - she is in almost every scene or nearby and it is very much shot from her perspective and on the basis of her interactions. You don't know instant to instant what is happening to others not present, but only know as much as she does.<br/><br/>What is there to say except all the versions stand on their own, even the modest earlier BBC version obviously shot on Betacam with limited budget - seek it out for a charming characterisation of Lizzie and a haughty but warmly human Mr Darcy.<br/><br/>It is fair to say Keira's Lizzie is not the Lizzie of Jennifer Ehle which worked for TV, but an equally valid alternate-universe film version which is more enigmatic and darker. Her characteristic smile actually becomes Lizzie. Keira's does not detract from Jennifer's.<br/><br/>There is a rustic earthiness to late 18th c. Longbourn (SP?) probably more accurate than the Regency feel of the surrounds and manners of the 1995 version. Sutherland is and always has been a genius and brings a fecklessness and late middle-aged resignation to Bennet while retaining his intelligence, and Blethyn brings some human believability to the character of Mrs Bennet rather than being a two-dimensional cartoon. That is not a criticism of Alison Steadman - she played the character on TV she was given believably and well.<br/><br/>That is what film characterisation is about to me. Again, different to the earlier film and TV versions but no less valid. Chatsworth was Austen's inspiration for Pemberley and is no less magnificent in film than in person. The settings are also sparse but speak volumes about the social separations of the De Bourghs, Darcys, Collins and Bennets.<br/><br/>I found the changes to the story and character omissions worked to tidy the film, not necessary as they are in the book which needs them for colour. So much is shown in small vignettes, the movements and juxtaposition of the actors as well as their acting conveys a lot of meaning without bludgeoning you with verbosity. The glances and small touches are unsettling as when Darcy assists Elizabeth into the carriage at Netherfield. The abbreviated dialogue and some absent, barely missed characters are more than compensated for with the sharp script, tight editing and clever wordplay.<br/><br/>In fact, having revisited the BBC series regularly, most recently the week before seeing the film, part of the enjoyment was seeing how the director and cast handled each of the setpiece scenes. Standouts are Elizabeth's first putdown of Darcy at the Assemmbly ball with a clever twist of dialogue. The dance scene with characters carrying on snippets of separate conversations as they move in and out of each others' orbits is entrancing.<br/><br/>There are near-kisses which caused a palpable rise in Oestrogen level in the cinema and an almost audible sigh of frustration from female audience members when they fail to connect.(!) Tip to the director: it will enhance sales of the DVD if you put the second one back, although it will not make the film better. The anticipation is better then the consummation! <br/><br/>There is a wealth of emotion in the eyes of the lead characters - the tumultuous scene where Lizzie first rejects Darcy's proposal displays internal conflict where the body language and eye contact between the actors contrasts in an unsettling way with their angry language. Knightley has honed her talents and it shows. She is also almost supernaturally beautiful whether smiling, crying, shouting, laughing or downcast. This film is her vehicle, but she doesn't carry it alone.<br/><br/>MacFayden smoulders in a different way to Firth - again, not better but a valid alternative. Knightley is almost exotically beautiful as a brunette flashing dark eyes. I agree that judging from art the British gentry seemed to enjoy rather more voluptuous ladies, and the conventionally-beautiful blonde Rosamund Pike with the 'amiable' manner would have been the obvious instant standout at a superficial level.<br/><br/>It is entirely believable that the inexperienced younger Bingley (believably upper-class dorkish but still intelligent and likable) should fall for her, where the more contemplative and introspective Darcy falls for Elizabeth; whose strength of character and incisive mind make her as much his equal as her attractiveness and social standing, and worthy of his time.<br/><br/>I had not been knowlingly familiar with Joe Wright's work. But I will seek him out from now on."

","Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful! Jane Austen would be turning in her grave if she ever saw this movie. Ppl should never try to put on screen things they just don't understand. A Hollywood adaptation of one of the most inspired regency novels will simply never work because it requires an in-depth knowledge of that period in English history. There are so many inaccuracies i could never manage to list them all. The most unforgivable thought, and the reason i cannot rate this movie any more than this, is the overall impression of dirt and poverty. The movie depicts the Bennets as a much lower class family then they are, their house and clothes are unkempt and... well, dirty! How horrid... There is a lack of propriety during the meetings between Elizabeth and Darcy that is just impossible to overlook and it is clear that miss Knightley simply didn't bother to read Austen's novel and had no idea what Elizabeth Bennet and the whole story depicted in the book are all about. While someone not familiar with the English history and literature of the period might find the movie tolerable or even mildly entertaining (i have friends that have found it to be thus), a true Austen fan should never attempt to see this movie, it will be a disillusionment not easily to be gotten over. The 1994 BBC short series is in my opinion the closest to perfection any adaptation of this novel will ever have the chance of reaching."

","This is overall a pretty good film. Keira Knightly, the hot young thing she is, and all the other actors and actresses do well. The script is good and everything. But it doesn't even compare to the absolute masterpiece of the book. The other Pride and Prejudice movies are longer for a reason. There was so much explaining and events that that omitted. I know in this day in age, having a long film easily bores people, but I actually think it would've helped the movie. If you haven't read the book, you might think it's an absolutely amazing movie. If you read the book before hand, you will probably be disappointed."

","Having just been to see the film...i am totally surprised by it! As a very big fan of the bbc version i thought i would not enjoy this film so much, especially without colin firth!<br/><br/>However, i actually enjoyed this film so so much! Matthew Mcfadyen had been criticized for his role as Darcy but i thought he played it extremely well! A sweeter Darcy the colin firths...maybe even more real..i was charmed! and Kiera was excellent but i though she would be! Chemitry between them worked and was totally believable.<br/><br/>The ending ruined it for me! As a it of a romantic, and come on...this film is the ultimate love story, i thought having no wedding and/or no kiss was terrible! My friend hardly dare look at my face! Even the more 'proper' bbc version had a kiss, if be it a very awkward one! However i hear the Americans got there kiss! so i can only hope its on the DVD!<br/><br/>A very good film...hugely recommend even for die hard bbc fans like myself...the film will surprise you and may even equal the 'original'!"
"janaki_raghunath","1","2","4","16 November 2014"," Most awful adaptation!
","I am a big Austenite and have read nearly all of Jane Austen's novels more than once, but Pride and Prjeudice is and will always remain my favorite. I have read the book five teams and seen several adaptations of the novel. For me, watching this movie was not meant to compare it to previous adaptations. I feel it is highly unfair to compare one adaptation to another, because each producer has a different interpretation of the novel and that's completely fine, but the most important factor is to be faithful to the BOOK. I understand that it's difficult to condense a 300+ page book into 2 hours, so taking out a few scenes/characters is not a big deal, but the main essence of the book must be caught and Wright completely failed to do that. This P&P seemed like a typical chick flick that focused only on the romance aspect of P&P. Even the romance was very modernized. It did not seem like regency era romance at all. Lizzie meeting Darcy in her nightgown, and Darcy not being properly dressed as he went to propose to her a second time was a MAJOR let down for me. Elizabeth was a spirited young woman in the book, but she was also supposed to be prim and proper. She followed society's dictations on how a young woman should behave in that time period. It is why she was so disapproving of Lydia and Kity. In Wright's P&P, Elizabeth acts like how Lydia behaved in the book. She is COMPLETELY out of character, so even if Keira Knightley is a good actress, I could not appreciate her at all because of how inconsistent Elizabeth was to the book. Her character was completely butchered. As for McFayden, he was completely flat throughout the book. I did not get the feel of Darcy from him at all. I don't know where Wright found this guy, he was a complete misfit.<br/><br/>I was also shocked at how poor the Bennets were portrayed! My God, they were portrayed like peasants! Their house had farm animals running through it. I could not watch any scene that took place at Longbourn because they were atrocious. Let me make one thing clear to those who think this movie's depiction of the Bennets was accurate. The Bennets were NOT poor. Their estate was entailed because Mr. Bennet did not have any sons, but they were NOT poor. They supposed to be middle- class and they also belonged to the landed gentry. In social status, they were higher than the Bingleys even if the Bingleys were richer. Longbourn was supposed to be a decent estate that would make more profit if Mr. Bennet took better care of his tenants, but the condition of the estate was not poor. It was a handsome house and their property was also supposed to be well cared for. This movie's depiction of Longbourn is absolutely atrocious. Mrs. Bennet looked like a maid, whereas in the book, she had servants to do the work for her. She was a gentleman's wife after all.<br/><br/>The hairstyles of the Bennet daughters were also ridiculous. Jane was by far the most decent looking out of them. The rest of the sisters, including Elizabeth, were poorly dressed and had messy hair. I don't get why Wright made them look downright poor. It's completely inaccurate! The Meryton Assembly was another shocker. It looked like an uncouth barn dance, not an assembly of the gentry! There was class and style in the Regency Era, even in the country. Balls and assemblies were attended by the higher classes who behaved with far more decorum than the Meryton folk of this movie did. It was way too congested and uncouth for a country dance of the gentry.<br/><br/>Bingley going into Jane's bedchamber was a major letdown. Men NEVER EVER went into a woman's bedchamber who was not his wife or sister. It was considered completely inappropriate and would have ruined Jane's reputation had it happened in the book. She would have been considered compromised. <br/><br/>The way men and women interacted, the butchered dialogues....it was all too modern and alien to me. It did not seem like Regency at all, so I do not know what research anyone did. The script seemed to be written by someone who never opened the book. An adaptation does not have to be a 3-hour long mini-series to be faithful to the book. Even a movie can do it well if the correct director does it. The essence of the book must be retained, even if major scenes and characters are taken out. <br/><br/>BBC's ""Death Comes to Pemberley"" which is even more recent than this movie, did a far better job in capturing the Regency Era than this movie did. Even though this movie was not about P&P but based on a novel sequence written by modern day author P.D. James, the characters were still consistent and the overall mannerisms of the characters was like the Regency Era. I did not like the actress chosen to play Elizabeth, but she SEEMED like Elizabeth in acting and character so I still enjoyed her role in the film. The guy chosen to play Darcy was great. He brought to mind Colin Firth's unforgettable \Darcy, and I enjoyed every one of his scenes. He was the Master of Pemberley unquestionably. <br/><br/>I wish someone makes a P&P movie with the actors from Death Comes to Pemberley. They all are obviously a bit too old (since it takes place 6 years after P&P), but their acting is great and they are consistent with the book. I can overlook the age and beauty factor of people if their acting is consistent. For me, consistency and accuracy are far more important than beauty and age.<br/><br/>Overall, this P&P was a major letdown. As an Austenite, I feel it was an insult to Jane Austen's most beloved book."

","Never in my life have I watches a movies that dishonors the book more. Feared as I have, this movie does not come to do justice to the beautiful novel, Pride and Prejudice is. I was thrown off from just the first 10 minutes of the play. The Bennet family is part of a higher society, yet the girls are found giggling most of the times, the house appearance brings shame to any good lady of that time. All the characters personality are emphasized to the point they become ridicules. And for the ball, what in the name of all that is beautiful is that? I might start by agonizing over the dance type, which was one of the common people. What a shame brought to the beautiful dances that were popular in that time. And I must say, a room so crowded, how can that be? And children at the dance? My eyes are hurting. I couldn't stand watching no more. This is not a movie i finished, nor do I have the wish to."
"rachelykpop07","3","2","4","16 April 2014"," The Pitiful Production of Pride and Prejudice
","Have you ever read a novel/book and a few years later you hear that there is a movie being made of the book you read? And so you are finally in the movie theaters excited to watch the movie to your favorite novel and a few hours later you walk out and it's the most terrible movie adaptation of a novel you have ever seen. That is exactly how I felt when I watched the 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyan. I got eager to watch a modern take on a classic novel and instead got very disappointed by the movie. Overall, I did not like anything about this movie adaptation of one of Jane Austen's famous novel. <br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is about a family of five daughters that are in search of suitable husbands. But most of the attention is on the rich, prideful Mr. Darcy and also the prideful, yet cunning Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest of the daughters. Both overcome their pride and prejudice and fall in love with each other. First off, I don't think the selection of the cast was chosen very well. Matthew Macfadyan was too gentle and kind looking for such a major character as Mr. Darcy. Because of this cast selection it felt like some kind of aspect from the novel was missing entirely from the movie, which completely changed the whole attitude of the movie. And so I did not like that feeling of emptiness throughout the entire movie. Another bothersome piece of the movie was that the director and staff overdramatized most parts of the movie. The scene in where Darcy confesses his love and hand in marriage to Elizabeth, it was just too clichÃ©. Both of them were standing outside and all of a sudden it downpours. There was no mention of rain in the novel and in fact this all took place indoors. This was such an important part of the novel and dramatizing it did not help out with the movie, it only made it worse. With mentioning scene changes, there were too many differences of scenes and lines in the movie. The movie was written as if the staff were just putting words into the actors'/actresses' mouths. And with all these modifications come my final point in that the movie was not at all accurate to the novel. While I was watching the movie, I became confused as to where this and that came from. Things were so different I don't see how the director could call this Pride and Prejudice. This movie did not meet any of my expectations for adaptations to novels.<br/><br/>The 2005 movie of Pride and Prejudice disappointed me a great deal and is one of the worst movie adaptations of a novel I have seen. The entire movie varied so much that I could not find myself relating to the novel at all. And so if you've procrastinated on having to read Pride and Prejudice for a class I recommend do not watch this movie because it will not help you pass that test or help you write that essay. Just take the F or, even better, just read the book."
"eric262003","5","2","4","19 November 2012"," Nothing But Low Expectations In This Adaptation
","Seven years ago when I went to see this 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel ""Pride and Prejudice"", I was having my doubts that it would not measure up the five hour A&E version. But for the record I went to go see it anyway knowing that most of the cast are high prolific actors and actresses I was hoping they would make the most of their performances. Sad to say, though not at fault to the performances, this adaptation failed in many certain levels that others (especially the 1995 adaptation which was the best) have succeeded.<br/><br/>So where did this movie go wrong? It was mainly due to the characters in this adaptation. For starters the Bennet family came upon as untidy and destitute From Austen's novel, the Bennet family gave me the impression that they were not meant to appear like the way they did in this adaptation. Sure maybe they didn't were not meant to look noble, but Bennet's appearance tends to look just bit better than the orphan boys from ""Oliver Twist"".<br/><br/>Mr. Bennet is badly portrayed as a cantankerous geriatric. One of the primary reasons that ""Pride and Prejudice is excellent was that Miss Austen utilized plenty of good humour and most of the funny lines came from Mr. Bennet. In this version all that subliminal humour never materialized and had really and there was really no reason for that. Granted he did start to lighten up at the end and had a hilarious line regarding any beaus that may call for Kitty and Mary. Pure classic! At the early stages of the movie, Lizzy struck me for a stuck up and had no real reason for detesting Mr. Darcy for the first time she ever laid eyes on her. That really didn't sit very well with me. She continually released utter disdain for him even before he lashed out his critical low opinion of her. She truly turned me off from her negative attitude and it became difficult for me to sit through the whole movie. Call me biased, but I really don't like people who have negative energy they carry within them.<br/><br/>Mr. Bingley came upon me as a foolish bumbler instead of a modest but lovable individual And to me the the actress who played Jane (Rosamund Pike) should have played Elizabeth rather than the overrated Keira Knightley. Jane was a more up it to character in terms of wit and better delivery and focus to her character than Elizabeth. Kitty and Lydia and even Lizzy herself had the awful tendency to giggle with no apparent reason. Aside from that I found them annoying and unlikable just the same. It was also shameful that they changed the character of Georgiana Darcy. The book gives the impression that she's quite introverted as to appear aloof but that's not the case here. Georgiana was anything but an introvert.<br/><br/>As the sun settles I kind of like the turnout in the end, but it still never shined on me and I would not recommend it to anyone Would I have appreciated it better had I not read the book? I think it would have been better if the story would have shaped up the romantic subplot between Elizabeth and Darcy and added more depth to the other characters.<br/><br/>I'm prepared to get condemned for my overall rant of this adaptation since other reviewers negatively, but in all honesty, I just found it quite difficult to like this movie. The A&E version is much better. But that's my opinion, if others wish to contradict me, please do. Just don't be too harsh."
"MartinHafer","8","2","4","27 October 2012"," There's a lot to like but the film has one distinct disadvantage.
","Back in 1995, the definitive version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" was brought out--and everyone I know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best. Much of it is the acting (having Colin Firth as Darcy isn't bad) but the biggest reason to adore the made for TV version is that it's long--very, very long. This allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed. Unfortunately, every movie version I've seen is just too rushed--and it's hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot. So, no matter how good the 2005 movie is (and it's quite good), it cannot hope to equal the mini-series. It's a shame, actually, as there's so much to like about this Keira Knightly version. The music is great, the locations top-notch and the Bennett girls actually look their proper ages! For example, in the 1940 MGM version, the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40! And, the Bennetts are supposed to be teenagers (there about)! <br/><br/>My advice is go ahead and watch this 2005 film--it's really very lovely. But then do yourself a favor--find the 1995 version. You'll be thankful, believe me."

","I was in search of a good romance movie and god what a milestone it is to have watched pride and prejudice. I happened to read this book 2 years before and as a rowdy teenager I could not make too much from it then. Now I know clearly what a beautiful masterpiece it was.<br/><br/>I was so unsure of Keira Knightley since her horror show in pirates of Caribbean series (which I happened to watch before pride and prejudice) but she was flawless. Her acting skills are being excellent and I could not take my eyes off her eye catching looks. The other impressive feature of this film is the background scenes, they were breathtaking. I thing the dialogs stole the show must. The screenplay have been well adapted. Since the novel itself was spectacular it would make less sense that I would talk about the story and the plot.<br/><br/>I think this will go down in history as one of the best adaptations of novel ever made. Overall it is a must watch movie for romance lovers and I think it's a complete cinematic experience and a must watch."
"phd_travel","9","2","4","12 February 2012"," Best version out there fresh and lively
","This adaptation was energetic beautifully filmed and captured the romance and passion of the novel with just the right balance. Compared to the BBC version with Colin Firth this is much better. The actress in the BBC version was too plain for a romantic lead. <br/><br/>When I first heard Keira was going to play the role I thought she might be a little contemporary looking but I was wrong. She is quite lovely and does a very good job. Matthew McFayden as Darcy at first seemed a bit non leading man but he is quite a good actor and suits the role. The interesting mix of international (non British) cast members like Donald Sutherland and Jenna Malone is good.<br/><br/>Liked the photography and settings. Darcy's house which is filmed at Chatsworth in England is a bit too grand for a Mr Darcy but it is lovely. <br/><br/>Overall this was a very good adaptation and should be a standard for other adaptations of literary classics."
"thomvic","5","2","4","30 December 2010"," Jane Austen would surely be disappointed....
","Jane Austen set her stories in a time in which certain rules and conventions were in place during 19th Century England. This is why stories such as Pride and Prejudice are so interesting because you get to see how much time has changed, how societal values and expectations have altered and how we can also compare these values with those of Austen's time.<br/><br/>What this version of Pride and Prejudice does is pretty much aim this to a new generation, neglect a lot of the customs of Austen's time and change things to suit a new audience. Something like this cannot be done when the story is also a study of the times of that period.<br/><br/>For starters, there were several things that annoyed me.<br/><br/>1. When Lizzy is talking to Mr Wickham by herself, she isn't meant to be by herself! The whole town would be talking of that and it was not appropriate for ladies to be seen along with a man, and also she wasn't wearing a hat or anything which was customary.<br/><br/>2. When Mr Darcy's sister meets Elizabeth, she was acting more like a thirteen silly teenager modern girl than someone who was meant to be shy and obviously brought up with the right manners of that time. There is no way, I was thinking that Georgiana Darcy would ever act like that in front of a stranger.<br/><br/>3. A lot of the plot line felt it was going fast forward. I felt that they didn't really capture the essence of the plot, and were in a rush to get as much out of the way in order to get all the plot elements into it in the running time. This is the problem with adapting a novel such as P & P into a movie, because the little details count just as much as the big ones.<br/><br/>********Ending Spoilter*********** 4. The ending was extremely unsatisfying, considering they could have at least put a wedding in it, instead of Elizabeth going to her father and getting his approval. I mean, OK I get that the story isn't about the wedding, and is about Darcy and Elizabeth learning about each other and first impressions etc, but at least give the audience what they would want if you are going to neglect a lot of other things in the movie! I felt that the actors were all going through the motions, simply spitting out their lines with no real feeling. It no way captures the essence that the BBC series managed to do so well, but I will give credit to the filmmakers of this version considering they had less time and a lot to squash in.<br/><br/>Lydia's character was so overdone you just wanted to slap her on the face and tell her to shut up. Yes I know she is young and wild, but it was almost like she was on some sort of drug, and you just can't stand her presence.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, there are good points. The production design was quite good, the costumes, scenery and look of the film fits the time of the story. Keira Knightley is good but doesn't hold a candle to Jennifer Ehle. There was a certain lack of sophistication in her performance and because she looks so young, and I know the character is only about 22, there was just something off about it. I guess I am being biased since I love the BBC version, but if you compare this to Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, you see how you can make a really great adaptation of a classic novel.<br/><br/>Give this a miss. For those wanting the true essence of P & P and how Austen would have liked it, then I highly highly recommend the BBC version. Characters are much more developed, they stick true to the novel and they don't try to modernise it."
"badajoz-1","4","2","4","7 July 2010"," Too rushed and tried to hard to be different
","It is difficult to put 'Pride and Prejudice' on screen in two hours when a lot of people have seen it very successfully adapted for TV over several hours! As a result there is a terrible feeling of galloping to get the plot set up for Lizzie and Darcy - witness the ridiculous treatment of the villain, Wickham, who really only appears twice. The historical inaccuracies that are very obvious really reflect the director's wish to be different from the 1995 BBC version, so no Empire lines and a generally tenant farmer feel to the Bennets. But why spend so much time building up this ambiance for it to disappear completely in the second half of the film!? The worst scene for this is Lizzie arriving at Pemberley (Chatsworth) looking like a ragamuffin and laughing at the irony of the fact that she could have been the chatelaine! Silly and ridiculously modern for a cheap effect! The direction is boisterous - Merry England (more 'Tom Jones' than Austen!) as the country fought for its' life against Napoleon! Or is that a modern parallel of Boozy English as the terrorists stalk the land!! The acting is ordinary - not enough time and dialogue to work with - occasionally the stars look good, but overall a third rate, messy, unwanted version of a much loved book and TV classic, that once again relies on you knowing the story and characters from other media, and then confronting your expectations... poorly."

","This is a beautiful movie. And I don't just mean in the ""touching"" or ""moving"" sort of way. It was actually very beautiful VISUALLY. The cinematography is breathtaking, showing the English countryside in such an artistic way - you would think it was a painting. It is accompanied by music that captures the story: both light and fun, but deeply emotional and beautiful. It was a joy to watch and to listen - visually stunning.<br/><br/>The story itself is a classic and was fantastically told by Joe Wright. The acting is believable and gripping. Knightly, who is actually not my favorite, was laudable as Elizabeth Bennett. Jane is too adorable for words, and the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins, and Darcy are played so well, you'd think they jumped right out of the novel and onto the screen.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book, so believe me, I watched it with a skeptical eye. And I was not disappointed - Wright's Pride and Prejudice is fantastic!"
"rudd_ariel","9","2","4","28 April 2009"," I thought the movie was pretty good
","The movie Pride & Prejudice is about a family that lives in a small town in England. The mother Miss Bennett wants her girls to marry a rich handsome man that will take care of them, treat them well and won't harm them. The setting of the movie takes place outside in the English countryside. The birds were singing, sun was shining. In Pride& Prejudice the clothes they wore were ugly, long, dirty, but that was the style back then for a middle class lady. I saw some cool action sequences, when Liz was sitting on the swing, the background change from hot& sticky, to cold& rainy. The part I like the most was when they were at the ball dancing around and around and also at the end of the movie Liz and Mr. Darcy was sitting in the grass by the water talking to each other. I just thought it was sweet & romantic. I don't like when Mr. Bennett told the younger sister she had to stop playing her music at the ball. Another character I don't like is the mother, because she tells people Jane is the prettier one then the rest of her sisters. She tells people Liz is under Jane. I don't like Mr. Collins, because first he tries to marry Liz, but Liz turned him down. Liz thinks he is a dork and not her type. So Mr. Collins goes and asks Liz's best friend to marry him, and she says yes. They get married and moved away together."

","I liked this movie a lot, granted I have not seen the A&E version, but I did indeed like it better than the novel, which I have only read twice. I enjoyed the novel and saw the movie first. I rarely ever like movies more than books even when I see the movie first, I am an avid reader and have to agree with what someone said, this is a movie based off a book it is not the book turned into a move. Jane Austins book was indeed good, I did enjoy it. Maybe it's because of the fact that I am a romantic, but I have yet to feel the way I do about this movie than any other movie. I have watched it several times and still love it the same, well actually I tend to like it even more, but if you compare this movie to another movie it doesn't do it justice, especially a TV made movie that is 4 hours long, you can do a lot more in 4 hours than in 2 with a book. You may all hate the movie, but I don't feel you gave it a chance by comparing it to another made by someone completely different. If you like the book more then I doubt you will like this movie, it is not completely and utterly closet to the book, but at the same time it truly does give you a hint of what it must have been like. When mere touching was seen as something that was not to be done in public. I much prefer that to the way people act now a days, groping each other and all in public, but anyway think what you like, but comparing a movie to another movie does not do justice to the movie, also A&E is very historically accurate and well a movie isn't always, I enjoy romances and this one by far is my favorite."

I have rarely seen a movie with as much beauty created by the shots and by the scenery.<br/><br/>The final thing that deserves to have won an academy award for original soundtrack is THE SOUNDTRACK.

"cwx","7","2","4","6 June 2006"," Not just a cash-in, but marred by the star
","Overall, I quite enjoyed this rendition. What it lacks in thoroughness and in acting (compared to the BBC), it makes up for with production values, which are thankfully not put to use. The cinematography is quite beautiful, especially when regarding the English countryside where some key tableaux occur, and the dinginess of the Bennett home is keenly brought into view in a clearer fashion than I've seen in most Austen interpretations. Finally, Joe Wright has a strong style, with some signature, abrupt reaction shots and other little flourishes I'm not knowledgeable enough to name, and ultimately, this helps the film be a worthwhile contribution rather than a half-assed cash-in type of remake. Kiera Knightley, however, did bug me, especially in the opening part of the film, which made me feel that, despite her age, she might have been better cast as Lydia, someone she probably resembles more closely. Every time she crinkled her nose laughing, she seemed to convey a lack of depth that didn't fit her character. I imagine marketability was, to put it lightly, the main reason for her inclusion."

Darcy was all wrong,too.he's sorta good-looking but in a very modern kinda way. it was all totally manic and rushed.i know they only had 2 hours but honestly...it just doesn't work! Charlotte was brilliant and her speech,after accepting Mr Collins was so moving and my favorite part of the movie!it was written by Emma Thomson,by the way. it was fun to watch but ONLY if you've read the book and watched the 1995 BBC version with Colin firth and Jennifer ehle!!BRILLIANT!!!"
"eastbergholt2002","8","2","4","14 April 2006"," Good Version of a Classic Story
","I enjoyed this movie, Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice is a masterpiece with a plot and dialog that will live forever. The director, Joe Wright, used the camera imaginatively and most of the outdoor scenes made excellent use of the beautiful English countryside. The film moves with pace and the way the characters interact seems very modern, they just happen to be dressed in period costume. Deborah Moggach's script incorporates most of the dramatic set pieces and the memorable one-liners from the book. It's a bit like a greatest hits compilation. <br/><br/>Keira Knightly's Elizabeth is beautiful, charismatic and full of life, making Darcy's attraction easy to understand. Matthew MacFadyen's Darcy is a shy man unwilling to let his emotions show. He seems drawn to Lizzie's confidence, vitality and sense of fun. He initially appears haughty and arrogant but his later good deeds, humility and wealth play a part in winning Lizzie over. Darcy is a difficult part to play but MacFadyen does a good job. <br/><br/>Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Bennet like a stoner with a sense of humor. Rosamund Pike is a very pretty Jane. Brenda Blethyn's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet is perhaps too sympathetic. Tom Hollander is excellent as the awful Mr. Collins. Judi Dench was a little disappointing as the battle-axe Lady Catherine de Bourg. Mr. Wickham hardly makes an appearance in this version - probably not enough time.<br/><br/>On balance, I preferred the 1995 five-hour BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. It had more time to let the characters develop and it focused on the marvelous dialog. This shorter compressed version is first-rate and has a strong visual style but if you came to this fresh without knowing the story you might wonder what all the fuss was about."
"bee-44","10","2","4","14 April 2006"," One of the most emotional movies out there.
","I won't try to review this movie. I will just write about the impression it left in me. Simply put, I felt deeply affected. It's something about the atmosphere. Something about the way the beautiful country scenery is combined with awesome music that almost makes you fly. And in the perfect harmony with this artistic environment are the actors who create the effect only the end of the 19th century could produce with all its pride and prejudice. If I were to compare it to other movie, I would certainly choose Forrest Gump. Though the setting and plot is completely different, there is the same gentle humor and feeling in both of them that fills one with delight. So if you are not afraid of an emotional tide this motion picture brings then there's no excuse for not seeing it."
"spooly_montana","9","2","4","11 April 2006"," No stuffy BBC period piece!
","Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice has been voted the most romantic book of all time. This latest film adaptation of the literary classic features Keira Knightley in her Oscar nominated role as Elizabeth Bennet, the strong willed heroine who would not settle for anything less than love in a time when women had to marry to attain for themselves and their family financial security. Love was considered a luxury. She is put off by the seemingly proud, wealthy and obstinate Mr. Darcy, who constantly surprises her as the story unfolds. Donald Sutherland plays the doting father wonderfully and Keira radiates from the screen in this fresh, hip, charming romantic film that is in no way a stuffy BBC period piece! The Oscar nominated score sets a graceful tone to this film that will impress and surprise you with it's visual and emotional moments. Rated PG, good clean fun."

","I adored this show. It was sooo good. I love this Pride and Prejudice film as much and I love the 1995 version of Pride and Prjudice. I love Keira Knightley even though she isn't exactly moral. I didn't think this version was as bright and cheery as the 1995 version. The dresses weren't white and blue and bright, they were more kind-of brown all the time and I found that kind-of annoying, and the house's wallpaper was more or less brown coloured. They made them actually poor in this film. I think they only had one servant, whereas in the 1995 one they had more than 3. I loved Jane in this show. I thought they actually made her prettier then Lizzie as she was supposed to be in the book. If you watched the 1995 version you'll be able to recognize several lines that are exactly the same. Which everyone I watched it with thought was amusing.<br/><br/>I loved in this version the rainy scenes, I love being out in the rain and thought this was perfect. Their lines were so cute in these scenes and I was really happy at where they set them. To watch this show you must have 4 things: at least three Girlfriends, food, happiness, and big screen TV. Have a blast"
"Arcardie","6","2","4","25 March 2006"," Discard the film; read the book
","I have to admit that I have not seen the BBC famous 'Colin Firth/Mr Darcy wet shirt scene' that everyone seems to rave on about, so in this respect, I went into the cinema with fresh eyes and perspective. I have, however, read the novel. Twice. And loved it. So in my eyes the film had a lot to live up to. Insome respects, Pride and Prejudice was excellent: a truly 'feel-good'film. I loved the realism and the beauty which has been captured is breathtaking- notably the opening scenes and where Elizabeth was stood on the cliff, with her cape billowing around her. In the cinema, I became immersed in the story (as opposed to l'ennui of 'Mansfield Park', another Austen adaptation) and for the most part, Wright did an excellent job of translating the book to the big screen. After all, who can argue that the ball scene between Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy(where as they intertwine, the others disappear) isn't wonderfully done? Some of the cast did full justice to the characters- such as Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins and Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet. The latter's performance was so good that it has inspired me to re-read the novel for the third time and she really made the role her own. Such performances really did make the film.<br/><br/>However, if only I could give such a glowing account for the two leads. Keira Knightley. What a mistake. She misinterpreted the wit, the sharp sarcastic edge of Elizabeth Bennet. The character was more 'giggly' than feisty; it was impossible to believe in her; we were not seeing Elizabeth Bennet, but Keira Knightley PLAYING Elizabeth Bennet. You could not get beyond the actress. Knightley was simply too interested in pouting her lips and 'looking pretty', thus delivering a somewhat wooden performance. She lacked the subtlety, the finer nuances which convince us, the audience, to empathise (which appears to be a problem in her other films, such as 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' or 'Bend it Like Beckham'). Matthew MacFadyen? A disappointment. I had seen him in 'The Way We Live Now' and frankly, I prefer him as the cad Felix Carbury. I believe MacFadyen (from other performances such as 'Maybe Baby') to be a promising actor, and certainly much more versatile than Knightley, but here the character was again misinterpreted and a construct, rather than a believable being. I couldn't engage with him in the same way that I could with Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet, who to be fair, out shadowed him (!) Coupled with this was the irregularity of the plot and a villain who was more insipid than villainous. Key events were glossed over and condensed so that the audience gradually felt 'hang on, why's this going on here'? Perhaps less time should have been devoted to artistic beauty and more energy consecrated in plot and character development. Or Wright could have taken a leaf from Peter Jackson's book and done both (!)<br/><br/>Ultimately,the film's shortcomings were due to a lack of chemistry between the leads and miscasting of Knightley and MacFadyen. Furthermore, the overly slushy, sugar coated interpretation did not do justice to Austen's original. It lacked the grit, the substance, the challenging nature of the novel. Doesn't it say it all that until I chanced upon this page I had forgotten that I had even seen it? A 'nice' (and how I loathe that word- but it suits this vehicle perfectly), feel-good film in it's own right, but lacks the impact of the book. 6/10."
"bardlover","10","2","4","20 March 2006"," 10/10
","This is a great movie. It's the third version of Jane Austen's timeless classic I've seen (I've also seen the 1995 Colin Firth one and the 1940 Laurence Olivier one) and is by far the best. It is truer to the book in its two and a half hours than the 1995 in its four hour spectacle. The Darcy--Matthew McFayden--in this movie isn't as easy on the eyes as Colin Firth, but he grows on you. By the first proposal scene, I thought he was smoking hot! In the rain...wow, talk about ubber sexy.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly so deserved the Oscar nomination. I wish she had won, but we can't have our way all of the time. She captured Elizabeth's spunk to a t. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was wonderful, especially when he talks to Elizabeth after Darcy has asked for her hand. The tears...""I never thought anyone would be good enough for you."" Aww... And Jane and Bingley together were excellent. Bingley was so cute...I just want to give him a hug.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful movie of a wonderful book."
"dmskfish","5","2","4","10 March 2006"," Pleasant but...
","This is a pleasant enough version of the book. For those who have read the book more than once (or for whom, like me, it is a favorite), one gets the barest sense of the book, too much is explained that Miss Austin left unexplained, and the tacked-on ending is completely unnecessary. I had high hopes and was very disappointed, because it felt disjointed. The cast was very good, and the fellow who played Mr. Collins had a nice take on the character. Mr. Wickham's character was minimized to such a degree that was in complete contrast to his importance in the book. Keira was fine as Elizabeth Bennett, and she conveyed the character's wit and insights well. I just find her mannerisms somewhat annoying. So, all in all, a pleasant, but not great film."
"mama-sylvia","6","2","4","7 March 2006"," Charming, but not the best version
","First, I should probably make it clear I compare any P&P not only with the original Jane Austen book, but with the glorious and faithful 1995 Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version. This version has lots of plusses, but has major problems both on its own and in comparison. My main objection is the rushed feeling and the unnecessary deviations from the book. Even the six-hour miniseries had to cut some of Austen's dialogue, so it's not surprising that a two-hour movie had to cut much more dialogue and even some characters -- the Hursts have disappeared, as have Mariah Lucas, the Gardners' children, and others. Other than lack of faithfulness to the book, the missing characters are not a great loss, but the rush through one story element and to the next is unpleasant for the viewer. Why on earth did the director waste screen time on long shots of woods and parks that could have been used to add a little more story? The artiness of the dawn shots doesn't add anything to the movie. The clothes and hairstyles were also poorly done: gowns not very attractive or accurate for the period, hairstyles sloppy and falling-down. It could be that the production was trying for a grittier feeling, as the Gardners were both quite coarse and the exterior shots showed more of the underside of pleasant upper-class living, but I found it quite distracting. Even more distracting were the changes that served no discernible purpose. Why was the first sort-of love scene between Elizabeth and Darcy set in a rainy wood? Why the scene in the ribbon shop? What is gained by changing the scene at Pemberley from the grounds to the music room, or the scene between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth to the middle of the night, or the denouement to early morning in the fields? Many of the actors compounded the production's problems. Matthew Macfadyen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy makes him simpering rather than stately. (To be fair, one of the minor flaws of the 1995 version was that Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy was SO reserved that the viewer saw very little of his struggle against his interest in Elizabeth.) The able Donald Sutherland is horribly miscast as Mr. Bennet, and fails to present his humor or his weakness. As usual, Jane (Rosamund Pike) is not the stunning beauty that Austen describes, but I have yet to see an adaptation that uses a lovelier actress for Jane than the star, Elizabeth. Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins was pompous rather than silly. Judi Dench, of course, manifested stateliness as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Claudie Blakley was suitably unimpressive as Charlotte Lucas. I've liked Keira Knightly since 'Bend It Like Beckham' (qv), and she is luminous as Elizabeth.<br/><br/>The biggest reason to see this version is, actually, its shortness. Many members of our MTV generation won't sit through a six-hour show, no matter how faithful or well-done. Anyone who has not read the book or watched the 1995 version will probably miss the defects and simply enjoy Austen's story. If it piques the viewer's curiosity enough to look for the book or a better version, everyone wins."
"kcla","6","2","4","25 February 2006"," you'll love it...if you haven't read the book or seen the bbc version
","i really wanted to like this film...and it is good but not quite satisfying. rosamund pike is radiant as jane bennett. while most of the casts gives a slightly more human take on the characters. Mr. darcy in this version isn't really proud but shy. and tom hollander's Mr. collins is perfect, we may mock him but not without a bit of sympathy. the cinematography is stunning, the director takes a very modern, realistic approach to the camera movements and the stunning photography of the British landscape elevates the film. yet at the same time, wright also resorts to contrived mtv-inspired shots. these are meant to create tension and to let us see more deeply into the characters minds, but just came off as cheesy. this was forgivable, what's not is keira knightley's performance. i've never seen her act but have obviously heard of her and read articles praising her talent. but she has a tomboyish quality that just doesn't translate to the requisite grace required for the role. her performance deprives the movie of what it needed most, a heart. this pride and prejudice is very lovely to look at but it doesn't steal your heart."
"blowersa","4","2","4","4 March 2006"," a ghastly remake
","I was appalled when watching this version of P&P. First of all, the obliteration of the Hursts I thought awful, for though they play but a small part in the story they support Caroline Bingley's character well. I also have complaint against the changing of many a scene's location and/or alteration of the turn of events. The biggest being where Lizzy learns of her younger sister's discrepancy. It was important to the plot that her Aunt and Uncle didn't know that Mr. Darcy knew what Wickham was and that he only made light of his connection after finding them. I will grant that Kiera Knightly gave an interesting portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, and had the screenplay been written better I would probably have enjoyed this version almost as much as the A&E version. However, as it is, I have to chalk it up to being on par with the version of Mansfield Park that was also in the theaters."
"bk-canela","6","2","4","2 March 2006"," a good try but better versions have been made
","I absolutely love the 1995 miniseries version with Colin Firth. I may have been biased by watching this version before the new version came out, but I think that the characters in this version were a bit too overacted. I think Lizzy in this movie (Kiera Knightly) needs a little bit more studying of the character, and the actor who played Darcy, could not even compare to the acting skills of Colin Firth. Overall, if you have not seen previous versions of this movie, you would probably love it, but if you want a great version of this movie, I whole heartedly recommend the 1995 miniseries version. Hope this helps you decide whether or not you will like the movie."

The 1995 A&E version sets a high standard for anyone trying to play the characters Lizzie, Darcy, Jane and Bingley.Donald Sutherland seemed to be drunk the whole time.Like Darcy, I never saw love between Bingley and Jane. Mrs. Bennet didn't seem to want propriety as much she is supposed to. We didn't learn enough about Lydia's elopement with Wickham, nor did we see how much Lizzy admired him.

","I saw the film this evening, and liked it really very much. Kneightley is great right from the beginning, it's exactly the kind of Elizabeth I always imagined without knowing it. Darcy needs a little time to spread real fascination, but when he does, he does it properly. Great cast, great setting, wonderful dresses, a good balance between open-sky scenes and inner locations. Everything in the film is lively and seems to happen in the most natural way. The initial dancing scenes, for example, give the idea the folks are having real fun - which is quite unusual for a dancing scene playing in upper class England of the end of 18th century (usually they are much more boring). I walked out of the cinema feeling really good. (sorry if my English is not perfect. hope the message was clear)"
"DesbUK","8","2","4","18 February 2006"," A Regency Rom Com.
","PRIDE AND PREJUCIE is a lovely English movie that is immaculately written,shot and acted. It takes Jane Austen's 18th century novel and turns it into a Regency Rom Com for a 21st Century audience. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around the Bennett household in the late 18th century English countryside. Women had no role in that society then other than as wives and mothers. So the Bennet girls need husbands -particularly the headstrong and independent Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly). The story charts her relationship with Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFaddyen), who seems initially humourless and unapproachable - but also very rich. <br/><br/>The film opens on sunrise and twittering blackbirds in the English countryside and from then on the English countryside has never been this beautiful since FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD (It was shot entirely on location at various stately homes and houses in Kent, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, with no studio work)<br/><br/>The other standout are the performances, which are uniformly good. Even the small roles - check out the way Tom Hollander makes the most of every moment as Reverend Collins. But at the centre is Kiera Knightly, who illuminates the screen like no other actress since Gwyneth Paltrow first appeared in EMMA, a decade ago.<br/><br/>The cinematography, art direction and costumes are exquisite. Best of all, Joe Wright's direction feels confidently cinematic (look at the use of a Steadcam shot capturing moments at the ball). The film is lighter and more cinematic than Ang Lee's soporific 1995 SENSE AND SENSIBILITY (which got by on good acting and a charming script)."
"jonchopwood","8","2","4","9 February 2006"," Very Pleasantly Surprised; a star is born in Keira Knightley
","The 1940 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" has always been one of my favorite movies, despite the M.G.M. hokum, due to the great performances of Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. However, I don't generally like English-themed costume dramas of the Masterpiece Theatre mode -- the last one I can think I liked, aside from Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" (decidely not a M.P.T. production) was Ang Lee's 1995 ""Sense and Sensibility,"" due primarily to the acting. I didn't expect much from this (it was the only movie playing when I was visiting Peterborough, New Hampshire), but I was very pleasantly surprised by the film.<br/><br/>What struck me, aside from Keira Knightley's performance, was that for once, the actresses playing the roles of the Bennett sisters/Austen heroines were age-appropriate. The sisters even looked like sisters in this production. I found the acting to be good (if not as satisfying as that of Thompson, Alan Rickman, Tom Wilkinson and Kate Winslet in the '95 S&S, though Donald Sutherland gave a pleasing performance that should have won him an Oscar nomination) and the interchanges between the characters (and the ensemble acting) to be very well-directed. The detailing of the period seemed to be spot on also. The presentation of the story, though highly familiar, never lagged but propelled forward in a fine, natural rhythm. It was a very good movie-going experience.<br/><br/>What I wasn't counting on was the star power of Keira Knightley. At this stage in her career, she is a good though unspectacular actress (though it certainly would surprise me if she didn't develop into a very fine thespian in the near future as she gains more experience), but most importantly, she has a real STAR presence. She DOMINATED the movie. They say that a good actor must have good eyes, that the ability to express oneself on screen comes from the eyes. Knightley certainly does have good eyes. In fact, she has spectacular eyes, warm and luminous eyes that are incredibly expressive.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley has a beautiful face (though an immature, that is, undeveloped body, but it helps in this film as it bolsters her youthfulness), but beyond her physical beauty, she projects a true inner beauty. (Some actresses can be technically beautiful, but lack an inner warmth that is the root of true beauty. Some women not so pretty have that warmth that makes them beautiful.) Knightly displays a warmth that animates her face and that radiates on screen. What a remarkable gift, and it was most pleasant to experience.<br/><br/>I believe that this woman is going to be a major star soon and that her star will shine for generations. She reminds me of a young Julie Christie in the uniqueness of her presence and gift. Keira's acting will improve (as gains more control over her instrument), but her starpower -- something that cannot be learned, but simply is -- is in full-flower right now. Go see PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and you'll agree with me!"
"hnapel","9","2","4","4 February 2006"," This great rendering of a classical story is an enjoyable treat.
","This movie is a treat from start to end. To have genuine feelings of embarrassment induced by this mere movie made me realize how well the whole charade is actually portrayed. Naturally based on the strong story of the ridiculous attempts to desperately find suitable husbands for a flock of 18th century maidens in a poverty stricken household, it gradually evolves into a tear-jerking tale of indeed pride, prejudice and finally prevailing love and romance. Great hails of praise are to be sounded for Keira Knightley who with the most subtle of gestures conveys her secret feelings to the knowing audience that is sucked into this masterpiece by excellent screenplay and fine outdoor shots that together with the chirping sound of birds makes it gradually become immersed in this long gone world with its feudal tendencies. Since this story had been told so many different times, the outcome to most will not be a surprise, so it is the way in which it is told that must make a difference and indeed this rendering stands out markedly. There's a superb balance between the serious, humorous, grave and light aspects of the story that is never dull with a steady pace. The eloquence of Elizabeth finds a wonderful match in Keira who sets new standards in smart mouthedness compared to previous flicks in which we had seen her. The cast is strong altogether, very well in place, all of them, behold of the fearsome appearance of Judi Dench and the mockery of Donald Sutherland are just examples. Would we like mr. Darcy at a glance with his stiff-upper lip behavior or vouch for the trustworthiness of mr. Bingley with his silly grin? It's all concocted for us to enjoy!"

","I was actually unhappy with this version of Pride and Prejudice. I am a huge fan of the British TV series that was done in the 90's. The reason for my unhappiness with this version is due to many things but mainly one aspect in particular. This is the theme that the father can ""let things be and they will be fine in the end"". Which in my opinion is false. It creates a very laid back position which gets the family into trouble. this was represented in the TV version I mentioned above but that version also includes the father asking for forgiveness (which is not in this version). He also declares to not let his daughters run wild to prevent disgrace (which is not in this version as well).<br/><br/>This movie has a very artistic theme throughout it which I found pleasant. I love most of the camera angles, although there are some scenes where your eyes are presented with such a busy scene you don't know where to look.<br/><br/>The acting was better than I thought it would be. I was almost board in some scenes. The shot of Elizabeth spinning on the swing was nice for the first 15 seconds but cut into more of the movie than I thought was necessary. The story suffered from the way the time was spent in other scenes. The cast was good except for Kiera who I thought was way too modern for the part of Elizabeth (not that her acting was bad because it wasn't)."
"kmw3011","10","2","4","13 December 2005"," Terrific new version
","Although I loved the BBC version, mainly because of Colin Firth's performance, I think this one is even better. The earthy Bennett household with its anxious, flowsy mother, the crush of people, the indolent, long-suffering father, and the narrowness of life in this cash-strapped provincial backwater are wonderfully well caught. We can totally understand why Lydia is so desperate for adventure and escape, and why the girls are all so obsessed with the search for a husband and some romance. The absolute imperative of making a good marriage is communicated with unsparing sharpness of focus; Charlotte Lucas, in announcing her engagement to Lizzie, has a wonderful cameo scene in which she tartly corrects Lizzie's romantic notions with a heavy dose of practicality and realism, and then goes on to touch our hearts with her warm-hearted pleasure, once married, in having her own room in which to receive her friend. The two dance scenes - the Assembly and the Ball - are spectacular, bursting with the energy, vitality, and - dare I say it - good nature that thrives under the class-ridden surface of English life, and which is so often obscured by too great a focus on the surface gentility of the period. A corner of Chatsworth House in the Peak District becomes Pemberley - too grand, perhaps, even for Darcy, but a breathtakingly beautiful setting, and Keira Knightley's moment on top of a rock on the moors wonderfully symbolizes Lizzie's yearning for a larger and freer life. Plenty of other viewers have commented on the casting and camera work: I must add my vote to those who - despite still mourning the loss of Colin Firth - find the new Darcy an appealing replacement. His is a performance that grows on the viewer: I saw the movie twice, and found myself noticing a myriad of subtleties in his realization of the role the second time around that I had missed the first time. The ending - although absolutely not Jane Austen - is tender and moving, and is a wonderfully effective conclusion to a great new adaptation."
"SteveLKay","10","2","4","13 December 2005"," Great Movie
","Stories like this just don't happen any more in a time where there's so much fuss about body attributes and looks in contrast to inner values and character. From their first meeting, and driven by the course of events, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy each outgrow their disposition - Elizabeth rises from playful, superficial adolescence to a profound, impressive young woman while Darcy descends from haughtiness to noble decency. This prototype of romance is rather triggered by fresh dialogs than mutual desire. Darcy is initially attracted and confused by Elizabeth's spontaneity, by her ability to dumbfound him who considers his views so concluded that he is rather bored by the social activities around him. Till the end they never kiss, they almost never touch each other except for dancing or helping her on a coach. And still, the air between them is more and more filled with romance.<br/><br/>The movie paints a picture of an 18th-century family in a society where the only adequate aim for a young woman was to marry advantageously, Elizabeth being kind of a heroine because of her free, open mind so unbending to authority. The original novel by Jane Austen is rather truthfully adopted with some restrictions due to the inevitable bit of director's / scriptwriter's dramatic freedom; e.g. the book has no such scene where Darcy approaches her through morning fogs - well that's just good old Hollywood, a little dip of romance here and there, but (imo) tolerable as it rather decorates the original plot instead of altering it.<br/><br/>Conclusion: if you're a romantic who likes such settings, this one is for you. Jane Austen fanatics might take exception to a few details left out or filled in, though."

The ball scenes make me wish that todays culture was the same, dances would be far more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only thing I have to say against the movie is that Wickham was still too likable even after the viewer discovers the truth. Though the rest of the characters were very well casted.<br/><br/>I encourage everyone to see this movie, it is just as good as the older version with Collin Firth.

"swheeler","9","2","4","6 December 2005"," A great date movie for both sexes!
","No ordinary reading of _Pride and Prejudice_ or previous enjoyment of the actors involved could have prepared me for this movie. From the first sequence of Keira Knightley's walk through the yard (reading a book), you are introduced to an England that is lush and fecund. It cannot be denied that here is a movie about growth and passion.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright's first full-length movie shows a fresh eye on the world. He paints with the camera...lush landscapes, the bustle of life in a busy, lower-end genteel home, the cool grandeur of a regal manor estate contrasted with the warmth of a small family room in that manor. Keira Knightley is his muse in this piece and she lives and breathes Elizabeth Bennet. Wright constantly finds new angles to capture Lizzie's emotions. This Lizzie is not proud and cold. She is proud, yes, but full of fire and uncompromising in her choices and passions. Knightley rises above her other performances to give us a Lizzie that hardly dares to dream of finding love in a world that so often pushes us in another direction. One scene, after Lizzie has turned down Darcy's proposal, will haunt the viewer far after the movie is over.<br/><br/>This movie is all about passion. The story has been pared down to the essential message of the growth of Darcy's and Elizabeth's love. We see Mr. Darcy's glances and yearning far before he (horribly) expresses his growing emotions to Lizzie. The cast are sublime and passionate - from Brenda Blethyn's gently histrionic Mrs. Bennet to Judy Dench's turn as Darcy's aunt, the esteemed Lady Catherine de Bourg. Strong performances from Americans Donald Sutherland and Jena Malone fit into the English accents swirling around them. I particularly enjoyed Claudie Blakley's performance as the decisive Charlotte, a character that strongly contrasted with her last film role as the defeated Mabel Nesbitt in _Gosford Park_.<br/><br/>The movie shows us much about living a shabbily genteel country life as it truly was at the turn of the 19th century. There is no stiff formality in the Bennet family's life; we see geese, pigs and cows living cheek-by-jowl with the humans, raked manure in the yard, careworn walls and doorways. The ballroom sequences involve real elbow-to-elbow dancing, complete with squeals of delight from young girls and the crowded, gossiping audience packed around the dancers on the floor level of the ballroom. The critters are in the yard, the roads are overgrown paths by today's standards, and the castles are magnificent.<br/><br/>See this movie if you've ever been in love, wanted to be in love, or wondered what love is all about. See it if you want to see England at her lush, glorious best. This Jane Austen presentation is for all of us, men and women alike; it is not a ""chick flick"". Everyone in the theater was totally enthralled, from the men who were encouraging Mr. Darcy, all the way down to my neighbor's 12-year-old daughter who had just finished reading the book.<br/><br/>This may have been the most truly satisfying movie I've seen all year."

","My daughter (age 19) and I loved this movie when we saw it the first time, and we loved it even more when we saw it again, the very next day! And, we can't wait to see it again as soon as she comes home from college for Christmas break.<br/><br/>This is a delightful, joyful movie, not ponderous as some period movies can be. Even the costumes and hairstyles were not overdone. Most of the actors did an excellent job.* However, to me, the movie belongs to Keira Knightley who was captivating and wonderfully conveyed Elizabeth's intelligence, spirit, and humor. In the book, Darcy's admiration of Elizabeth's ""fine"" eyes was often mentioned. He referred to their expression, color and shape. Keira's eyes are so beautiful and expressive that it's hard to take your own eyes off of her when she's on the screen.<br/><br/>At first, I thought Matthew MacFadyen was too stiff as Darcy, to the point that he seemed to have no personality; but my opinion improved as the movie progressed, and especially during our second viewing of the movie. Note: To catch a glimpse of Darcy's rare and gorgeous smile, be sure to watch the scene when Darcy is introducing Elizabeth to his sister.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>* (one exception was Carey Mulligan who played Kitty Bennet; I thought she overdid the gigglingwhich may have been faulty direction, rather than faulty acting)."

","I went to this film on a date and since she is a really nice and interesting person, I didn't want to disappoint. This is the classic Jane Austin ""Chick Flick"" but I have some good news for you. There are a few things to enjoy if you are a hetero-sexual male and not really into this type of historical knight-in-shining-armor story.<br/><br/>First, Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Bennett) is unbelievably hot. I mean like out of control I just stared at her in every scene. She was a babe in ""Love Actually"" but here it's just right over the top. It was hard to actually keep track of the dialogue when she is on screen because I'm so focused on her. Second, Tom Hollander who plays the bumbling Mr. Collins is a genius. The guy reminds me of a sort of Victorian Adam Sandler trying to pick up women. And when Keira Knightly isn't on screen he steals the show and gets you through some slow parts. Third, there are some great outdoors scenes in England's Peak District where hills in the north of England really make me want to do some serious hiking. And my girl even agreed to do some camping with me since I was being so sensitive as to take her to Victorian romance. Fourth, did I mention how hot Keira Knightly is? So suck it up, buy some popcorn and Raisinettes and take your girl to the movies. She'll appreciate your sensitivity and the evening won't be a total loss."

","As a real fan of the novel and of the BBC TV series, I went into the theater totally expecting to be disappointed by this movie. But I came away thinking that this movie is just as good, in it's own way. The shorter format made it accessible to a wider audience. Loved the period change (earlier, right?). Loved Knightly as Elizabeth.<br/><br/>The only complaint is that they made Mr. Darcy a bit of a lovesick puppy. Where are his struggles? Oh, and what's with the marble statue scene?

","OK, I've seen and read just about everything there is done from or by Jane Austen and I just have to say that this movie makes me ...happy. I know that it doesn't quite compare with the 1995 - Colin Firth - version, but for a 2.5 hour version it comes close. I was really weary of any remake of something that didn't really need fixing, but never-the-less, this version still had me rooting for it at the end. The music and scenery in this movie come together to give it the right ""feel"" of the romantic story and that is saying something because I am rarely ever happy with the music of a movie. Even if you go into this movie expecting not to like it you will come out of it with at least a respect for it if not a love for it."
"clutz629","6","2","4","1 December 2005"," A giggling Elizabeth?
","This movie was a fairly good interpretation of Jane Austen's novel. HOWEVER. Elizabeth played by K. Knightley was a terrible mistake. While I think she is a terrific actress, she did not represent the intelligent, bright, and thoughtful Elizabeth Bennet we have all come to admire in Pride and PRejudice. She was just like all the sisters, giggling, smiling too much, licking her fingers (in a Jane Austen movie?) and displayed a harshness and a mean disposition against her mother and the captain. It is completely against her character in the novel, where Elizabeth is practical, genuine, and very different than all the other women consumed by the need for a wealthy husband, which is precisely why Darcy falls in love with her. Darcy was perfect, Jane was perfect, Mr. Bennet, however was nothing of a gentleman... If you liked the book, and the movie version with Colin Firth you will be disappointed in this version, if not, you will enjoy this romantic and fairy tale like story."

","I have watched a lot of movies and would consider myself (opinion only) an expert on good movies and acting. This movie was brilliantly directed, cast, and acted by all parties involved. Thinking back on this film I cannot recall one flaw. A literal perfect rendition of an amazing book. K. Knightley is well on her way to being the next big thing in Hollywood. She shows off her acting chops here in what should earn her at minimum a Best Actress nod. Donald Sutherland lights up the screen with his rendition of the always classic Mr. Bennett and should also receive a nod from the Academy. And if the film is not down for Best Picture, I will never watch the Oscars again."

I wouldn't be surprised if she was nominated for her work for the Academy Awards. Another person that impressed me was the man the played Mr. Darcy. He definitely did the character justice. I saw the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice and always thought that Colin Firth was the best Mr. Darcy, until now. This new guy was so good. I sat there at the end of the movie and couldn't believe what a great movie I saw. The chemistry between the two of them was mesmerizing. I can't even explain how good this movie was.

"fanofmozarts2","6","2","4","27 November 2005"," Pride and Prejudice 2005
","I was so anxious to see this movie. First, I must say that I enjoyed how they re-enacted the period. The style, grit, earthiness was interesting and the scenic shots were breath taking, but...the acting left much to be desired. On the way home we decided that Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Bennet) was impersonating Winona Rider as Jo in Little Women. She lacked the elegance of the Elizabeth we are accustomed to in the A&E version of P & P and she was much too silly. Elizabeth and Jane were almost as giddy as Lydia and Kitty, which did not give the contrast that Jane Austen must have intended in her beloved novel. To the untrained eye it was a fun movie and Keira Knightly is energetic and beautiful to watch. To the pure Jane Austen fan this version lacks the true dialogue and the tweaking of the story was ridiculous. For example having Elizabeth blurt out to Mr.Darcy that dancing would not be fun even if he had a partner that could tempt him. Paaaleeeze. AND they cut out some of the best lines! ""If you had behaved in a more gentleman-like manner!"" The Mr.Collins character was rather believable and Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine worked well and I would have liked to see her in more scenes. They took poetic license a bit too far by having Bingley come into Jane's room while she was sick to check on her. That would not be done in Austen's book! They had Elizabeth walking outside in her nightgown because she could not sleep and Darcy meeting her at sunrise as he was walking. NEVER. Let alone the ending with the silly kissing scene at Pemberly. I did have fun seeing this with a friend who knows the story and the A&E version inside and out. We chuckled and annoyed all those around us. My husband commented that it was like watching The Lord of the Rings Trilogy cut down to a two-hour movie It felt like it was in fast forward. Recently I read many reviews declaring this version was Brontëfied with sweeping landscapes and lacking the incredible dialogue. I am amiss to why they bothered to film this movie when the A&E version is so utterly superior and true to the book. I just hope that anyone who has seen this production will be interested in reading the book and/or watching the A&E version to be completely caught up with the true story and the fascinating dialogue that Jane Austen is famous for."
"kimberlybdavis","8","2","4","26 November 2005"," My Own Humble Opinion/Review
","So, I just saw this movie tonight. I must confess I have been waiting for it ever since I heard it was being made. I have come to truly admire Keira Knightly as an actress and was keenly interested in seeing what she would bring to the role of Lizzy Bennett. Also I was much concerned to see who could dare to step into the shoes Colin Firth so romantically filled 10 years ago. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>After holding my breath for the first few minutes, terrified that Knightly's Lizzy might be a bit too ""giggly,"" I soon relaxed and settled in to a refreshing interpretation of the classic story. Knightly provided the anticipated spark needed to truly bring Lizzy to life, while Matthew MacFadyen's brooding stares by no means fell short in affecting his own version of Mr. Darcy. A well-assembled supporting cast, including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, certainly aided the two in bringing the story to life.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, there are some things that are just a bit out of line, but nothing more serious than: some dialog switches (some characters saying what others said in the book), the complete absence of Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, some changes of scenery for some scenes (instead of the parlor, Mr. Darcy first proposes in the rain, for instance). Other than that, it stuck VERY close to the book. I was actually quite surprised.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the movie lies with the portrayals of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Collins, and mildly so with Charlotte Lucas. The character of Charlotte is not nearly as pragmatic as Austen wrote her to be, and this I found lacking.<br/><br/>Mr. Collins is not nearly as simpering with regards to the great Catherine de Bourg as I would have hoped, nor is he nearly as ridiculous in character as to warrant Lizzy's reaction when he proposes marriage.<br/><br/>I was most disappointed in the projection of Mr. Bennett. While I would by no means call him the ""comic relief"" of the novel, his general lack of gravity in the situations Mrs. Bennett gets so worked up over is a large part of what makes the family interaction so likable. Here, though, he is entirely too serious; even his attempts at sarcasm come across as worry. This, I feel, detracts from his relationship with Lizzy and deprives audiences who are new to the story of a vital element of lightheartedness.<br/><br/>The storyline itself was quite abridged, but then that's only to be expected. The BBC had the advantage of making a TV miniseries and could, therefore, put much more page-by-page material into the 1995 version. This one, however, had to fit Hollywood's 2.5 hours or less mantra, so it did run a little fast, but an audience member who had never been exposed to anything remotely ""Pride and Prejudice"" before could not get lost in the story despite the editing.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel it's definitely worth checking out. Keeping in mind that this review comes on the heels of having not only just re-read the book in anticipation of the movie, but also on having just seen the 1995 BBC version just yesterday.<br/><br/>KBD"

","Yes, a 10. In the grand tradition of Merchant-Ivory, this movie measures up. What a treat! Brilliant+ cinematography, acting, sound, costumes and music. I was captivated by the breathtaking landscapes and the convoluted relationships, and not in that order. Seeing, hearing and feeling that era's range of emotion, intellect, risk, reward and wealth, creates for all the senses a modern-day cornucopia. Sometimes I was almost sure I could smell the food at table. If you saw the film, this minute can you see that large bowl of parsley potatoes? Amazing lensmanship. All those birds and livestock! Perhaps the food and animals stand out because I saw the film the day after Thanksgiving, which was perfect timing for such a film. It was indeed a film about giving thanks. Already I have recommended the film to seven or so friends, and 24 hours have not passed. I'll see in again on the big screen, and I'll purchase the DVD. As I'm writing, I'm seeing the film roll in my mind's screening room. Bravo!"

","(I'm not sure if what I say will actually spoil anything, but better safe than sorry.) <br/><br/>I walked into this movie with a tremendous bias towards the A&E miniseries, expecting this version to be a cuter, more bubble-gum popular adaptation. Well, imagine my surprise.<br/><br/>I found this film, though dipping to tendencies to ""move right along,"" to be quite excellent indeed. I had always had hope in Keira Knightley to become a better actress, ever since i read in IMDb that she expressed a desire to do so. I wasn't wowed in King Arthur, and her performance in Domino was good, but not enough to blow my skirt up. This floored me. Whereas Jennifer Ehle worked with much more subtle variances of emotion in the A&E miniseries, Keira Knightley made it KNOWN that she was angry, sad, happy, hungry, whatever. She managed to express the plainness of Elizabeth's character by action instead of looks.<br/><br/>Matthew McFayden...is no Colin Firth. That's not said to downplay Matthew McFayden, but rather to further ""up-play"" Colin Firth. McFayden manages to capture the character of Mr. Darcy satisfactorily, but he had quite an act to follow, so I wasn't expecting him to knock my socks off. He had the ability to be cold, while also the ability to be warm. He wasn't wonderful, however, at showing a transition between the two. Nonetheless, he did a very good job (and he has the stage presence of Clive Owen, or so I believe.)<br/><br/>Jena Malone was ridiculous, and therefore, perfect for the role of Lydia. Donald Sutherland did a pretty good job, but I would have rather seen Michael Caine or Anthony Hopkins fill the shoes of Mr. Bennet. Rosamund Pike definitely fulfilled the characteristics of Jane: optimistic, shy, and prettier than all the other sisters. Tom Hollander, Kelly Reilly, Brenda Blethyn, Simon Woods, and especially Judi Dench were wonderful in their supportive roles as well. So, casting was better than i thought it would be.<br/><br/>The cinematography, along with the music...is unparalleled. To compare, I now see that the A&E version was, in scope, a television show. This was a movie. There were unique changes in camera angles, long takes, subtle zooms to show tension, fast zooms to show panic, and many wonderful uses of lighting. It, along with the beautiful piano compositions to accompany it, did a much better job at capturing the mood than I saw even in my imagination when reading the book.<br/><br/>This movie...was amazing. I'll understand if you do not agree with me, but...if you're squeamish because of a fear it won't be as good as past versions, just give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>A. Solid A."

","I just finished watching the movie about 20 minutes ago and already i want to see it again! It was a fantastic representation of the book, very true to the book as well (for all you Austen fans). Knightly and Macfayden have really great chemistry and both acted really well. Malone was also a scene stealer as the bubbly yet sometimes annoying Lydia Bennet. But all in all the movie was very romantic and witty, with some very amusing parts. Macfayden was a very good Mr.Darcy (it's hard filling Colin Firth's shoes!), with the same broody and proud attitude there should be. I really do recommend this movie to anyway who likes a romantic and happy ending, or if you enjoy Austen's novels, because there were very few differences from the novel."

","I came to the movie theater with much anticipation, having not remembered earlier versions with the same title, not because I didn't see them, but just because they weren't, in my opinion, very memorable. Prior to watching the movie, I was also upset that one leading critic did not like the movie, while his partner, of reputably greater notoriety and accomplishment,(in my opinion)liked the movie and especially Keira Knightley's performance as Liz. I am happy to say, I recommend the movie on all fronts.<br/><br/>I do not take issue with aspects of the film, which were purposely staged(to me). Among those issues were the writers pension to make the film a coming out for Knightley by giving her a plethora of one-liners, an untimely proposal, and Liz's double drubbing of Lady Catherine, perfectly played by Dame Dench, which decorum would have hardly stood for in that day (the book was a bit more delicate, appropriate to the times). Why do I excuse these annoyances (as I would call them)? Simply because the actors and actresses make this move a memorable one, one fitting to the story told by Austen.<br/><br/>Staged or not, Knightley delivers an exciting, mesmerizing performance, which certainly sold me on true emotions. I must say there is one disappointment near the end of the film, which, in my opinion, keeps the film from being even better.<br/><br/>Kudos to McFayden (who provides one GREAT entrance), Sutherland for a flawless scene with Knightley, and Rosamund Pike, who plays Liz's sister Jane, for delivering a refreshing version of a worn-out, antiquated line, in addition to playing ""up"" to her role in the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, there is much pride with little prejudice, as this viewer sees it. That makes two wrongs in a row for one half of the critic's film making version of the dynamic duo."

This is officially my FAVORITE MOVIE. I did find some errors in wardrobe, but they can be easily overlooked. I was skeptical about the new Darcy, before viewing. After seeing the movie, i can only say Bravo. He gave the character his bit of mystery, and withdrawn personality.

"morrowka","10","2","4","22 November 2005"," Best Pride and Prejudice Yet
","To those of you who thought the movie strayedYes, it did. But, I must say that in this case, it wasn't a bad thing. When a director is able to capture the essence of a book, when he is able to lift the emotions from the page and allow them to speak on their own, something magical happens.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Jane Austen and her work, and am currently reading P&P for the 18th time. But, I must say that there is a big difference between a book and a movie. There has to be.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the BBC production extremely boring. True, it was faithful to the book, but so much so that it was painful at times. Honestly, Colin Firth is not my idea of what a Mr. Darcy should be. Lizzie and his character were too old in that movie, too unattached, lacking everything between them that was there from the beginning. In essence, there was nothing cinematic about that series. I would rather read the book than sit through that for five hours. Imagination can create a better scene than can ever be replaced by direction from another. That is why, I am never satisfied with movies that are based on books. In the case of the BBC series, it failed to offer something that the book didn't. For this reason, and the fact that Colin Firth ruined Mr. Darcy for me, I disliked this adaptation greatly.<br/><br/>Now, in the case of P&P now playing in theaters, the producers and director gave us something to watch and ponder over. It did not remain as faithful to the book as many would have liked, but that is precisely why it is worth watching. The emotion, the wit, the essential elements from the book, it's all there. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I see it as a movie first, an adaptation of Austen's work second. It is so beautifully filmed, the scenery alone is enough to make one emotional. The music, which is arguably one of the most important components of any movie, is masterfully composed and carefully weaved into the film. The acting is magnificent.<br/><br/>Matthew captures and reflects a Mr. Darcy that differs from his description in the book but works. He is able to add layers to the character, making us wonder whether he is possible of loving. He silences and odd behaviors, are both charming and captivating. Watch the clip on the website of him and Lizzie arguing. His facial features in the latter part of the scene express what he cannot. The pain, the love, the sexual tension, he is able to capture this all in one moment. And the scene in the field, oh my, okay I will stop here before I give too much away.<br/><br/>The movie works. For 2+ hours it recreates the love story of Austen's most cherished novel in a new and refreshing light. It offers something different. A must see. Again, don't go see it or criticize it for its inability to remain 100% faithful to the book. This is both impossible in 2 hours and undesirable. Books are made for reading, movies must be cinematic."
"seaview1","8","2","4","15 November 2005"," Literary Classic Shines in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
","Author Jane Austen has been a popular source of material for recent films and television miniseries. Her free spirited, individual women who search for happiness amid ignorance and old fashioned conduct are refreshing even by today's standards. What's pleasantly surprising is that Austen's stories about manners, loyalty, honor, love, and betrayal have a universal appeal and a timeless quality amid a vivid period setting. A good example is Pride and Prejudice, which features thoughtful direction, a strong cast, and an impressive turn by its star, Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>In 18th century England, the Bennet family consists of a mother, (Brenda Blethyn), father (Donald Sutherland), and their many daughters including eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike) and the most independent-minded, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). Desperate to marry her daughters to wealthy bachelors, mom will manipulate an event like the upcoming ball to play matchmaker. Enter the mysterious Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) and his friend, Mr. Bingley, who are well-to-do and seeking a female date for the latter. Jane and Bingley seem to hit it off and another ball ensues at the Bingley estate. Meanwhile, the seemingly indifferent Darcy takes note of the free spirited Elizabeth. Gossip and rumors abound. When a soldier, Mr. Wickham, appears to woo Elizabeth and relays a tale of betrayal at the hands of Darcy, Elizabeth begins to despise Darcy. There later appears a cousin, Mr. Collins, who is heir to the Bennet fortunes and is searching for a bride to be. The problem is that Collins is hopelessly unappealing especially to the object of his affection, Elizabeth, much to the annoyance of Mrs. Bennet. Elizabeth finds herself still seemingly attracted again to Mr. Darcy when their paths cross by accident. Add to the complications the intentions of wealthy Lady Catherine de Bourg (Judi Dench), who has designs on Darcy for her younger girl, and you have a dramatic interweaving of a complex study of romance in which lovers fall from grace and reconnect.<br/><br/>Numerous versions of Austen's novel have been filmed including the Laurence Olivier version from 1940 and a British television series with Colin Firth (ironically cast as a similarly named and etched character, Mark Darcy, from Bridget Jones's Diary). TV veterans, director Joe Wright and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, do an impressive job of adapting the novel with good clarity of drama and moments of humor. It doesn't feel like a book but rather an organic, filmic event, no small feat. This is not a 'dumbed' down version but a contemporary translation done with the right balance of reverence to the source material while making it accessible to modern day audiences.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is the kind of heroine who can think for herself at a time when women were not accorded many freedoms. She is cool as a proverbial cucumber as she makes a first impression on Darcy, and you feel an interest in how these two souls will come together despite some formidable obstacles along the way. It's a delightful premise, and part of the fun is how this storyline and several other threads will develop. It is refreshing in any film to see how major characters will challenge an audience by evolving over the course of the story instead of remaining static.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean) at 20 is displaying the beginnings of a long, versatile career as a dependable actress who can tackle such prestigious material as this. In fact, her performance is not unlike the impressive turn of young Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility. MacFadyen is effective as Darcy, an aloof, cold fish when we first meet him. Blethyn (Secrets and Lies) is always good, and here she romps as the scheming mother. Sutherland, as the oblivious father, seems to fit period pieces quite well (Start the Revolution Without Me). Dench is always in command whenever she is on screen although it is a minor role. Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day) shows she can do more than action films.<br/><br/>Sure, there are minor plot holes and some inconsistencies in the characters, but the main themes work. The dialogue is proper, old English, and it takes a little time to get up to speed in deciphering the accents. The pace drags slightly toward the end, but it finishes with a nice flourish of resolution and optimism. Its dreamy ending will set hearts swooning and minds wandering to an elegant, romantic era.<br/><br/>The film has a natural, vivid sense of time and place. People bow and curtsey displaying all the proper mannerisms of the time. The cinematography is beautiful amid the English countryside and mansions. The extras are a realistic mixture of handsome faces and plain ones. Likewise, the interiors of the homes look worn and lived in. The balls are realistically choreographed in a manner reminiscent of TV's Hill Street Blues where people come and go out of frame and others move throughout a fluid camera shot. Transitions that show a passage of time are cleverly done.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is a worthy companion to 1995's Sense and Sensibility. Don't expect a boring film but rather a well paced drama with dashes of humor and heartfelt relationships. It not only proves that older, literary material can be brought to life cinematically without being stuffy, but that Knightley has emerged as a force to be reckoned with."

It isn't the first time we see an adaptation of the Jane Austen title, but it is one of the times when we feel rewarded and very satisfied with its design.<br/><br/>It is hard to fail when the supporting cast an imposing Judy Dench, giving us another one of her powerhouse and scene stealing performances. What makes this film a joy to watch is the casting behind the heroine of the film, Ms. Knightley, who at 18 years old, can hold her own against one of the most formidable figures of British cinema. She does a very capable job in her handling of Austen's precise vocabulary, and she projects both a fiery spirit combined with lovely intelligence, and shades of alluring sensuality. There are powerful, quiet scenes in this film where all hangs around what the camera is able to capture, and it is when the chemistry between both leading actors flows that we know the film works best.<br/><br/>In addition, we have faithful portrayals of the rest of characters in this tale of social classes. There are marked differences between the wealthy class and a family that barely hangs on to middle class. The fine characterization of all the female archetype is something to behold. We are treated to range and variety, and consistency in the great performances all around.<br/><br/>There is much to admire in the love story (or is it stories). It has depth, feeling, intelligence, respect for its audience, and some of the most enchanting cinematography in a year where there is a wealth of riches for cinematographers. The detail in the camera work leaves you breathless in a few key scenes, and it's consistent throughout the film, where very nothing is left to chance. It is lovely work. The costumes and the art directions are also quite special and will probably be honored later this year.<br/><br/>Here is proof we can still go to the movies and let true talent shine through. I do admire celebrities and their tours to promote films. What I do treasure is seeing that the hype is based on solid qualities and not just the result of desperate attempts at creating make believe. Knightley made quite a splash in both ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". She is only 19, and so far it looks like the best is yet to come. Austen would be proud of her performance, and we should be glad we have stars like her in our cinema heaven."

","I saw Pride and Prejudice in a packed theater and I observed no disappointed viewers as indicated by the applause the film received at the end. Many things impressed me immediately. Firstly, the camera work is exceptional. The scenes and colors are breathtaking. The costumes are spot on. The people who populate the screen are not characters pulled from a idealized scene of the early 19th century, but people who appear as those people were often unshaven and their clothes not just pressed and washed. So many of the older films made costumes, makeup and hair so perfectly presented, that the actors seemed plastic and unapproachable. The language of the film is so well brought from the book that I want to see it again just to listen. The characterizations were superb. Each character had depth and substance. Sutherland was wonderful as the father and the mother gave a dimension to her that gave the woman's nervousness and inappropriateness a pitiable side. Judy Dench was brilliant as the royal to the bone marrow aunt who looks down her nose on every other character who comes within her purview. The leads were well played and interesting to watch even when the viewer is well versed in the story."

Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, Mary Bennet, and even Lady Catherine are more fully realized than in previous versions. Jane Bennet is reserved just we would hope, and Georgiana was a wonderful 15.

I found it utterly charming and just beautiful to watch. I loved how it took a different approach with many scenes from the 1995 version. Joe Wright has directed it beautifully - the opening scenes where it meanders through the Bennet house and the ball at Netherfield are a delight. I thought Keira Knightley made Lizzie her own and Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy is brilliant. I wasn't sure about him at first but he really grew on me at the film progressed. He has very expressive eyes! The rest of the cast are also a delight especially Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet. I have to admit that I have now seen the movie twice and I enjoyed it even more the second time. Can't wait for the DVD!"

","It is extremely hard to see this film without immediately comparing it to the 1995 version with Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. However, once you have adjusted to the changes and settle down to watch it, it is very enjoyable. Keira Knightley surprised me as i did not have very high expectations for her performance as Elizabeth Bennet. She was good but not great as she spent the first half of the film giggling rather annoyingly. Again without making comparisons, i thought the rest of the family were also good, particularly Jane. Mr Darcy took time to get used to as well, but by the end i decided that I liked his performance the best, though i had met the actor before from the TV series 'spooks'. <br/><br/>The script ran well throughout most of the film. However there were some slips, when somebody said that something would be 'great' and when Jane commented that she was 'so over him'. Overall i enjoyed the film and i walked out of the cinema feeling satisfied instead of feeling that it had betrayed the previous version."

"aleks-wells","1","0","0","27 June 2020"," Historically inaccurate, rushed, and just completely missing the point
","I've seen pretty much every Jane Austen adaptation out there and have read many, many books on the history of the writer and the era in which her books are placed.<br/><br/>The 2005 adaptation with Kiera Knightley is so ridden with inaccuracies that it's simply impossible to watch with any degree of serious attention.<br/><br/>It seems that the director was hell bend on making his film as different from the faithful, calm, and witty BBC 1995 adaptation rather than actually filming Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>The second main reason for me why the movie just doesn't work - and by that I mean nothing works, the dialogue, the editing, the costumes, the characterisation; it's all poor, poor, poor - is that there doesn't seem to be much by way of a plot.<br/><br/>If I wasn't familiar with the story, I'd struggle to follow. Mr Wickham appears and disappears, key events and people are reduced to mere sketches, or eliminated, lines are rushed, and I just couldn't settle into the story.<br/><br/>The characters are treated with the robustness that is not period accurate or even attractive or interesting. The dialogue, so witty, clever, and character appropriate in the book, here has been reduced to rough and unrecognisable expositions of the plot and character's feelings.<br/><br/>Charlotte's speech to Elizabeth: ""Don't you dare judge me!"" is an example of telling rather than showing disguised as showing. It tells us how we should feel without taking the trouble as to why that would be inappropriate and why it would hurt Elizabeth so much.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is not coherent. It seems cobbled from fragments of various other movies, and stories, but it completely misses the point of Pride and Prejudice, the book.<br/><br/>Key characters that expose Elizabeth to her own feelings, and her journey to maturity and true understanding is just not here. In which case, what is the point of the story. A washed down, weak love story.<br/><br/>The social rules of conduct that guided the behaviour of the people and which showed them up to other characters in the book and to us as readers, are ignored.<br/><br/>The book is shrewdly written social subtle satire full of totally on point observations on human nature.<br/><br/>There are some pretty scenes, dinners with candles.<br/><br/>No lady would walk in the rain as Elizabeth seems to after the church conversation and during which Mr Darcy proposes.<br/><br/>Mr Darcy: ""Are you laughing at me?"" - No, but I am at this pathetic adaption of one of the best stories in the history of literature.<br/><br/>This adaptation is just badly made and by ignoring the very point of the story - the journey of Elizabeth and Darcy to each other in the environment fraught with challenges, both internal and external - it rendered itself pointless."

","Anyone who says they like this variation of Pride and Prejudice has never read the Austen classic. The casting is abysmal, the change of setting from Regency to Georgian head-scratching, and the deviations from the action of the novel outrageous.
Keira Knightley as an anorexic Elizabeth, Matthew Macfadyen supposedly as a wimpy Mr. Darcy who could barely be expected to manage a McDonald's let alone the vast estate of Pemberley, and why is so much time wasted with Elizabeth twisting on a swing that could have been devoted to furthering the plot?
I cannot emphasize enough: Avoid this film!
Read the novel, watch the 1995 BBC production, but do not confuse this atrocity with anything resembling Austen."
"nanoulaki","4","0","0","19 May 2020"," truly awful!
","Saw it again, just to be sure, but this movie is awful. Rushing through the story, inaccurate, Elizabeth with plain frocks, messy hair, Mr. Bingley as the village idiot, NO subtlety, caricatures of most characters, Darcy boring, Knightley complacent as a modernized Elisabeth. The movie is beautiful to look at but misses the point in every level: the balls, the dresses, the behaviours, the wit, the tension. The setup and look of the film sometimes, as others have pointed out, would rather be fit for a novel like Bronte's, not for the proper, rational, balanced and wise style of Austen. I mean, Elizabeth meeting the Bigleys and Darcy with all her hair down, tangled, meetings in the rain, or at odd hours or improprely dressed? things like that make for another style of story. anyway, maybe i would not mind all these if the spirit of the story was right but i saw no depth, no real fire, just flat feelings trying to seem intense by rain or messy attire. Having seen all possible adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, I'm still waiting for a cinematic one that will live up to the 1995 tv version."

"aseev_dimon","6","0","0","8 January 2020"," Review of the film ""Pride and Prejudice.""
","Hello, I want to express my opinion about the film ""Pride and Prejudice"". The main characters: Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennett), Matthew MacFadyen (Mr. Darcy) and supporting actors: Talula Riley (Mary Bennet), Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet), Jena Malone (Lydia Bennett), Carey Mulligan (Kitty Bennett), Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennett), Brenda Bletin (Mrs. Bennett), Claudie Blackley (Charlotte Lucas), Tom Hollander (Mr. William Collins), Judy Dench (Lady Catherine de Beer), Rosamund Stephen (Anna de Beer), Simon Woods (G- Mr. Charles Bingley), Kelly Reilly (Caroline Bingley), Rupert Friend (Mr. George Wickham), Tamzin Merchant (Georgiana Yes rsi), Cornelius Boo (Colonel Gardiner), Peter White (Mr. Gardiner).
The genre of the film is drama. I do not like this genre, and the plot of the film did not interest me. There are five unmarried girls in the family of the little nobleman Mr. Bennett - Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia. Mrs. Bennett, worried that the Longborne inheritance was inherited from the male side, at one of the balls of the Bennett sisters are met Mr. Bingley, a wealthy bachelor who recently settled in Netherfield, and his friend, Mr. Darcy. Bingley is fascinated by the eldest Miss Bennet. Later, a distant relative, Mr. Collins, arrives at Bennetes, a busy young man serving as the parish priest of Lady Catherine de Boer. Soon, he makes an offer to Lizzy, but receives a refusal. A little later, Colonel Fitzwilliam, a friend of Mr. Darcy, tells Elizabeth that it was Darcy who convinced Bingley to leave Jane because he believed that her feelings for Bingley were not serious. She insisted that Elizabeth give up claims to marry Darcy, as he was supposedly planning to marry Anna, the daughter of Lady Catherine. Lizzy rigidly cuts off her monologue and asks to leave, she can not continue this conversation. Walking at dawn, she meets Darcy. He again declares his love for her, and Elizabeth agrees to marry him. When I watched the movie for myself, I found that the only plus is the play of Charles Bingley and Jane Bennett. I didn't really like the movie, but if you like the drama genre, then I think you will like it."
"DmitryNickWilliams","9","0","0","8 January 2020"," A Great Romantic Story About Finding Happiness
","To say honestly, I would have never watched a love-drama movie, neither read book stories but this one which I watched with the class was pretty. I enjoy reading classic novels, so Pride&Prejudice was something that I have already heard about. And after a couple of lessons that we spent on this movie were fabulous. Let's take a more detailed view on film:<br/><br/>First of all it's a plot. It all just takes from classic novel where there are aristocrats and fandangos, and ladies meet gentlemans... So this very atmosphere is unique. The plot is about a typical English family of those times. There are five daughters in the family, all young, so no wonder that they are ready to get married. Once upon a time all the girls meet mister Bingley, rich and lonely man, and mister Darcy which is very cold in communicating. Elizabeth, the main hero of the movie, is trying to find a happiness and a true love in society full of maners and forbiddens and to understand mister Darcy act which changes through the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting was very well. By this I mean that all the actors were into their roles and all the characters felt really live. Characters talk, dance and act with each other as like as it's truly a couple of centuries ago.<br/><br/>I want to say in addition that those movies much more better and give us a look on old times, their culture, art, traditions and on the other hand it's about searching happiness, love and your own destiny. I wish movies like this would be a more frequient phenomenon than another superhero movie withoust any sense."

","Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland were excellent in this movie I will set acting early England. You like a love through you like this movie"
"Cherry-sama","7","0","0","11 December 2019"," A Chicken Soup Kind of Movie
","The best way I can describe this movie is that it's like chicken soup: it's warm and cozy on a cold day, but it doesn't really have that much lasting substance on it's own. Don't get me wrong--I love Jane Austin as much as the next person, and by all means, this -is- a good movie. I just don't like it very much. And after viewing it three times, I think I can finally explain why.<br/><br/>Before I begin, Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austin's most famous work, and for good reason. It's witty, it's analytical, it's thoughtful... I could go on. So it was inevitable for Hollywood to make an adaptation like this. Make no mistake; my review is solely based on this -particular- adaptation, and not Pride and Prejudice itself.<br/><br/>Now, I think what rubs me the wrong way the most about this movie, is that it's too pretty. Yes, that may seem a bit odd, for a movie that has Lizzie tromping through a field with her dress stained with mud, but I stand by what I said. My problem isn't what's on the screen, but how it's shot. It keeps trying to be most beautiful, profound movie ever, when really...it's not. It comes across as hollow at times, and borderline pretentious. It just screams ""give me an Oscar, give me an Oscar!"" which it did go on to win. But I feel like it won those Oscars for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints is Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. She does a good job, but I just can't get behind this casting choice. Keira Knightly is not the right actress for Elizabeth. She just has the wrong temperament.<br/><br/>The best way I can describe it is like this... The character of Elizabeth Bennett is like a goose. Sure, she may be more elegant than nattering ducks like her mother and two sisters, but she's still kind of awkward, pushy, and not afraid to speak her mind. Her defining feature is -not- charm and poise, but rather her quick wit and sharp tongue. That's the reason Mr. Darcy falls in love with her to begin with--because she's the only woman he's ever met, who doesn't suck up to him.<br/><br/>By contrast, Keira Knightly is like a swan. She glides from scene to scene, looking elegant and graceful with every word she says. She does a great job as an actress, but her temperament is all wrong. She's just too beautiful, too calm, and too poised to play the part of loud-mouthed, pushy Elizabeth Bennett.<br/><br/>And while I'm at it, Matthew Macfadyen isn't the right fit for Mr. Darcy either, and for the same reason. He feels like he walked out of a boy band instead of being bred and manicured for high aristocracy. Just sayin'.<br/><br/>I could go on to talk about how the cinematography in this film is trying waaaayyy too hard to be artsy and meaningful, but I won't bother. Because at the end of the day, the fundamental problem with this movie isn't that Keira Knightly played Elizabeth, or the overuse of experimental cinematography, no. The REAL problem with this movie is that it isn't trying to be Pride and Prejudice, so much as it's trying to be Sense and Sensibility 2. This movie wasn't made by someone who loved Pride and Prejudice. This movie was made because some Hollywood executive saw how successful Sense and Sensibility was in 1995, and they wanted to make another one. THAT'S the problem with this movie. Simply put, it just lacks passion. REAL passion. It tries to imitate passion by being grand and sweeping, but the heart isn't there.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm sure a lot of people worked really hard on this film, and they have nothing to apologize for. It also has captured the heart of my dad, and I did watch it three times. It -is- a good movie. It's just not a -great- movie. If you like it, you like it; if you don't then you don't. Watch it if you're a fan of Austin, or if you're sick and just want to curl up on the couch for a couple hours. That's what I did."

Conversely, her elder sister, Jane, was very shy. Also, she had noisy younger sisters and their mother was a bit imprudent.<br/><br/>Even if Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy liked each other, it was hard to see something in the close perspective. Maybe I have been bound by the pride and prejudice without knowing, too. It's hard to discard them. They're something to only protect myself, not to gain anything. If those would disturb me, I should discard absolutely. Then, I can see everything in new perspective."

The settings always amaze me and the director has done a sublime job at really engrossing you into the scenes.<br/><br/>For a film with such a steady pace, Pride and Prejudice never feels boring. Never too slow or monotonous. It feels as if you're part of this dreamy world, gliding through with the characters, who all contribute to the general feel in their own unique ways. Knightley is just great, it is wonderful to see her character's relationship grow and flower with Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>The score is also just impeccable.

","It was strange watching this version of Pride and Prejudice because I'd missed it at the theater and actually saw BECOMING JANE and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES before giving this version of the ""actual"" classic a try.<br/><br/>Nothing against Keira Knightly, who is radiant in every frame and does amazing work as Elizabeth Bennett. Watch how she holds Darcy with her eyes, so that a flat and commonplace remark becomes barbed with wit and subtle criticism.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright does a good job with some small things -- the dancing at the assembly really has enormous energy, much more than the identical scenes in BECOMING JANE. But the larger story doesn't really hold up. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett is really wrong -- Charles Dance was so much better in the zombie version. Mr. Bennett has to be witty and funny, not sullen and depressed. Also the guy who plays Mr. Bingley is too goofy looking. And the actress who plays his sister is too beautiful, too glamorous, and too charismatic -- you start wondering why Darcy doesn't just marry her instead of Elizabeth! The actress who plays Charlotte is great, capturing the balance between pathetic and courageous, while the guy who plays Mr. Collins is actually pretty subdued. His opposite number in the zombie version was running into furniture and falling through windows!<br/><br/>Altogether this is a good movie, but in some ways BECOMING JANE was more poignant and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES actually had a better supporting cast!<br/><br/>PS I'm not saying the cast here lack talent. Kitty and Lydia are played by Cary Mulligan and Jena Malone, two of the most brilliant actresses ever! It's just that Joe Wright doesn't really know what to do with them. He's better at directing big crowd scenes than actual one on one drama."

","I studied this story in the class of Professor Yoshino. This is the story of love between Elizabeth and Darcy. The gentry-class women don't have the right to choose a job, so marriage is the only way for women to live stably. Then, women acquire culture and be attractive to be invited for dance by rich men in a ball, but Elizabeth thinks it is wrong and doesn't hope for quick marriage. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth who is different from other women. However, they misunderstand each other because of pride and prejudice. When they first meet, Darcy is too proud and impolite and Elizabeth has prejudice against him. This makes them apart emotionally. I lose my patience because they remains neither too close nor too distant. This film is the story of 18th century, but I can replace the present love in my mind. Misunderstanding is sad in all ages.

This type of continuous shot seams to happen in other scenes as well throughout the whole film. The mood is also wonderful, it capture the British countryside in a very similar sensitive way that Jane Austin does in her books, but Joe Wright, rather than just reproducing it, he reinterprets it in his own style and imagination, the serene foggy mood on the mornings, the atmosphere of the end of a party, the rainy weather contrasting with the silence of the characters in despair."

I removed one star for minor faults, like abrupt ending and Donald Sutherland's painfully white teeth, but otherwise this is one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly enjoy the BBC version from 1995 because the acting was rigid and insipid, and conversation style unnatural - truer to the book, for sure, but that greatly reduced my enjoyment. This movie softens it all a bit to a version that feels more human and that enabled the actors to do a better job.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is very good in portraying Elizabeth as a lively, fun-loving, no-nonsense young woman. In the book, Elizabeth says for herself that she's often at the edge of socially acceptable (even if in a smart rather than stupid ways like her younger sisters) and Knightly does it better than Ehle in 1995 series, who just keeps a vague smile almost all the time and barely changes her expression.<br/><br/>MacFadyen sacrifices a bit of Darcy's cold aloofness in favor of showing more of his warm side, and that was fine with me. He does excellent job of expressing strong emotions in subtle, non-verbal ways.<br/><br/>The scenery, music and photography were excellent. There is a little detail that I only noticed when watching the movie the second time: when Elizabeth is walking through the statues in Darcy's home, there is a bust of Darcy in the background which almost seems to follow her with its eyes. Nicely done.<br/><br/>The scene in which Charlotte explains her decision to marry Collins is touching and really brings forward the restricted, cruel position of women in the past, which otherwise is taken for granted in the book and most video versions.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a warm and enjoyable movie full of life."

","Surely, it took me a while to finally see this, but it's rather very good. I've always liked Keira knightley, if never been totally impressed by her. Here, she's just exquisite, really bringing a lot of charm and depth to her role and fitting into the period time like a glove (not all the actors are as successful). The supporting cast is also great, great seeing Blethyn, and also great seeing both Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike in roles before they got big and started giving acclaimed performances. Both are great here, as is Jena Malone. The whole film is great, it's definitely more of your typical period romance over something like Atonement, which its themes were very different."

","Pride and Prejudice. Counted as one of the literary classics of British literature, and for good reason. A story built on the premises of social class, pride and love this movie follows the paths of Elizabeth and Jane Bennett on their journey to find what they're looking for. Along the way the two are befallen by their faults, resulting in sadness and a sense of uncertainty in one's chances of ever deserving what they want. But in this tale of love and woe, certain wrongs are righted and rash words are forgiven. Fore what can compare to the love these girls deserve and the love that they have to offer. It is as true a story as one can watch with an ending that could be compared to the greatest love stories of history."

","I prefer the 1996 version, especially as I found Jennifer Ehle a perfect Lizzy.<br/><br/>Also this version was a little too Hollywood for me and a few historical details do not ring true to me. For one, I do not believe Lizzy would ever have run around with her hair down, since she was twenty or twenty-one. It was pretty standard for the hair to go up once they were ""out"". Also the dress worn by Carolyn Bimgham at the first ball seems wrong. I cannot find a single gown from the period that was completely sleeveless in that way. Even if she were meant to more fashionable than the Bennett girls, that did not seem accurate.<br/><br/>It is also difficult to believe that Keira Knightley would be anyone's idea of second place in looks. Although she tend to thrust out her chin in an odd way, in all of her roles.<br/><br/>Darcy's hair always looks unwashed, lol.<br/><br/>It is also surprising that Carrie Mulligan became such a star off of her role as Kitty. Her next role was a starring one in Bleak House, in which she was wonderful and lovely, but I hardly saw anything from her role in P&P that would lead me to believe she would be given such a chance.<br/><br/>Also, being a feature film, it skimmed over the story instead of letting it unfold as the mini series in the nineties did. Everything seemed to happen as a breakneck pace.<br/><br/>This was the only version where the part of Jane was played by an actress who could be believably as beautiful as Jane was meant to be. <br/><br/>Obviously the film is beautifully done with an expensive cast and sets and locations."

","Some will ask ""how many versions of Jane Austen's read-to-the-point-of-fraying 'Pride and Prejudice' do we need?"" The current film archives show no fewer than ten versions and growing. But for this viewer the current P & P du jour is as satisfying as any, edited and distilled to its main story lines without diminishing the main message from the author. Deborah Moggach can be thanked for the screenplay (with some subtle revisions by Emma Thompson) and Joe Wright for his sensitive and forward momentum directing approach.<br/><br/>So what make this version different and successful? First, the placement of the Bennet family in the pig and mud friendly country home that sets the scene properly for the driver of the film - finding proper husbands for the five daughters whose well placed marriages will assure the lower class Bennet family a future stability. Yes, it is a bit untidy, this household, but that makes it a family more dependent on the land and more prone to dreams of 'marrying up' in a country ruled by class system. Second, the casting of the Bennnet family with five truly young actresses (Keira Knightly, Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone, Carey Mulligan) instead of older types trying to appear like teenagers; a mother (Brenda Blethyn) who indeed shows her desperation of class; and a father (Donald Sutherland) who epitomizes Austen's father figure mold. Add to the Bennets the credible men characters of Simon Woods, Matthew Macfadyen, Tom Hollander, and Cornelius Booth and top it all off with a pivotal Lady Catherine de Bourg of Judi Dench and all players are in place for a fine cast. The dialogue is crisp and sharp and the usual diversions into lineage names and sidebars are eliminated, bringing this long story down to just over two hours.<br/><br/>The scenery and costumes are superb as is the cinematography by Roman Oshin and the musical score by Dario Marianelli with a lot of help from Henry Purcell. Is it one of the best movies of the year? Perhaps, perhaps not, depending on taste. But it is nice to see Keira Knightly shine in a role more challenging than any she has had to date. She inhabits Elizabeth Bennet luminously. Grady Harp"

","Ah, ""Pride & Prejudice."" Jane Austen's timeless tale of courtship and marriage during the time bridging the late 18th and early 19th century has just found another film version for itself. Keira Knightley is Elizabeth, the second of the five Bennet sisters, and a girl possessed with sharp wit. Her mother, Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethlyn), is determined to see that she and her sisters - eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike); reclusive Mary (Talulah Riley); and the two youngest daughters who are too naive and frivolous for their own right, Catherine (Carey Mulligan) and Lydia (Jena Malone) - are married to wealthy gents. That's because there's not a son to become heir of the Bennet family's estate, so Mr. Bennet's (Donald Sutherland) cousin Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander), a clergyman, will inherit it upon the former's death.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the bachelor Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) taking shelter in a house near the Bennets, and Mrs. Bennet is convinced that one of her daughters must be his wife. With him is the snobbish Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), whom Elizabeth hasn't a good first impression with. Then Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) arrives, believing that as the heir to their property, he must wed one of the Bennet girls.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright proves with this endearing film that it's hard to resist one of the most famous novels of Jane Austen, and probably one of the greatest novels of all time. He has the fine touch for translating the story freely and believably, making the events as real and as natural despite it being set more than a hundred years ago. It's humored-nature is filled with warm and poignant scenes that are handled with such sensibility, and the theme of marriage is presented with such finesse that reflects that of the novelist herself.<br/><br/>Knightley has proved her versatility as an actress but has never been better than she is here as Elizabeth. With her captivating British looks and personality, she is charming, and she fits her character's personality well. There's a genuine truth about her that makes her likable and even the most cynical members of the audience should easily connect to her. In fact, I am not surprised with her nomination for an Oscar for her performance here, although with this year's competition I don't think she's going to win it (I'm guessing Reese Witherspoon will).<br/><br/>As Mr. Darcy, MacFayden gets to develop his character during the progression of the film and and does it nicely. The supporting cast turns in noteworthy performances too, particularly Pike, Sutherland, Blethlyn, Hollander, Woods, and Malone. I must also mention Judi Dench, who is also nominated this year by the Academy for Best Actress for her performance in ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" but that's another film and I haven't watched it yet. She convincingly brings the pride and domineering side to Lady Catherine De Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>""Pride & Prejudice"" is a delightful movie that should satisfy fans of the novel. Not only does it contain a great performance by Knightley, it's a well-crafted reincarnation of a piece of literature through the eyes of its director."

Also, the movie delineated a great deal from the book, by like A LOT. The BBC version was better. Longer, but better. But if you haven't seen the BBC version, and you can't compare it to the book, this movie is a perfect romantic comedy. Kiera Knightley is good, as well as Donald Sutherland. They both did a good job of absorbing themselves into the script. Brenda Blethlyn, Mrs. Bennet, was one character who seemed to be just reading the script, not adding her own to the character."

","The movie Pride and Prejudice was exceptional. The love portrayed between Elizabeth Bennet (Kira Knightley) and Mr.Darcy ( Matthew MacFadyen) was at its best. The level of romance between the characters in situations such as, the scene where Mr. Darcy assisted Ms. Bennet into the carriage, the confrontation at proposal and the final scenes all were romantic at amazingly precise level for the time the film took place. It brings back a legitimate and perfect love to a world overzealous with sexuality. It was decent and romantic and I applaud Joe for giving such a sweet vision into love without pride or prejudice.<br/><br/>Then again, in other areas the movie lacked. In comparison to the novel and the BBC television series the part of Elizabeth Bennet was weak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong woman figure and Kightley did not play a satisfying part. Kira was not bold enough to be called a Elizabeth Bennet perhaps she lacks experience in acting but she needed a bit more maturity and presence to fulfill the role. Mr. Darcy in this movie in comparison to a Colin Firth's acting in the BBC edition was good. Although Firth had a better grasp of the characters pride MacFadyen like Firth had a commanding presence and was awfully romantic. I believe both Firth and Macfadyen played Darcy very well. What really upset me, although minor, was the appearance of the Bennet family and the country people. They looked dirty and Elizabeth's Bennet hair was always a mess. The Bennets status was not so low and in the past at there appropriate status woman always fixed themselves up exceptionally well it was disappointing to see Kira look so when she had such a high potential to look good. Not every thing is appearance but you don't have to be so terrible put together. Mr.Bingley in the movie was fantastic, I really enjoyed his acting. Thus, the movie was great but there it was flawed. Overall, when I left the theater I wasn't so satisfied."

","Basically everything and everyone in the film met or exceeded my expectations, making the overall experience much more entertaining, involving and interesting than I expected going in. I enjoyed this film very much. I was drawn in to the period feel and the social milieu except for one thing. For me, there was a black hole in the center of this film - and its name is Keira Knightley. (And I have never had a problem with her before - playing modern characters in modern settings.) Whenever the camera was focused on her, all I could think was that here was a kind of supermodel with a wry seen-it-all smile on her face - someone who lives between limousine and club and must have filmed this movie between parties. She looked drunk, drugged or both. Near the end there was a scene with a long look into her eyes close up as time passed in the room she was in. I had a very distinct feeling of ""are you OK miss? can I call anyone for you?"" Even her spiteful scenes of rebellion against D'Arcy (remarkably well acted by MacFayden, whom I don't recall seeing before, except he is somewhat reminiscent of the lead singer of Blur) or Lady Catherine (fully absorbingly played by Judi Densch) come across as red-faced spoiled teen-age celebrity misbehavior. There were no inner struggles evident, nothing other than impulses as far as I could see."

However, in this instance I believe the casting to have been horribly misconceived.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland was not Mr. Bennett, neither was Brenda Blethyn Mrs. Bennett, Matthew Macfadyen was a bad choice for Darcy and Keira Knightley certainly did not impress me as Lizzie! While I realise this was a two hour film and not a mini-series and therefore had to be trimmed of fat to fit the time, I do believe it was done in a rather haphazard manner with what appeared to be huge chunks of necessary material being removed and others just thrown back in randomly.<br/><br/>It would also have been far more effective to have left the imagery of Darcy seen at Pemberley by Lizzie's uncle and aunt as the portrait rather than a marble statue amidst similar, though nude reclining statues.<br/><br/>This addition seemed uniquely ridiculous in the extreme and very typically 'Hollywood'!"

The costumes were terrible, the people chosen were terrible! Not only that, but we were bored out of our minds during the whole film! It was the biggest waste of 10 bucks, not to mention the two hours of my life that I will never ever get back! Jane Austen would consider this a slap in the face.

","From time to time in small pieces, I managed to finish the 2005 Pride and Prejudice. I am no expert of Jane Austen, nor of the English Regency period, but still I can be quite disappointed by this adaption.<br/><br/>Compared to the very impressive Liz by Jennifer Ehle, whom I already deem as an idol, Keira Knightley is far lack of beauty and charm. I cannot stand her grimaces and grins, which frequently happened, and made such an exhibition of Liz. Mr. Darcy is very unconvincing, and many other characters, such Mr. Bennet, Mr. Colins, are also very strangely depicted. The only merit might be the color and the scene, but that can hardly help. I still prefer simpler and lighter colors for such an movie. After all, if Liz is failed, the movie is failed.<br/><br/>I cannot help singing praises again for the 1995 BBC version. Not only Liz and Darcy, every other character were so vividly presented. Especially I would mention Mr. Colins, because his every scene amused or disgusted me so much that I started a very harsh criticism on greasy man of his kind to my friend for half an hour. Then I realised what an art it is for the actor to achieve such an effect. In comparison, the 2005 Mr. Colins is unfortunately very dull and empty, and cannot be understood or connected to any real character in life.<br/><br/>I have been very cruel, but I cannot be milder after the 1995 P&P, which really brought the novel to life!"

For a real representation of Austen's novel, try the wonderful version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. This most recent film doesn't even come close, and appears to be a poor attempt at such a beautiful story and characters.<br/><br/>The film radiates ""modern,"" from its strange pseudo-period, pseudo-modern costumes and hairstyles (Young women wearing their hair down in public?), to its leading lady, Keira Knightly. Knightly gives a very shallow and contemporary performance as Lizzie, and is not helped much by the generally poor supporting cast. Although Matthew Macfayden is quite good as Mr. Darcy (no Colin Firth, though!), he is not good enough to save the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I would never recommend this to any Au.ten fan -- for truly quality performance, go for ""Pride and Prejudice"" with the incomparable Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."

","In some of its secondary features, it had some advantage over the A&E version which is, to me, excellent. The everyday life was more gritty and real in this latest version. Charlotte Lucas's character I found appealing and very real --as a woman of no great beauty whose prospects for marriage were limited. And it must be said that it more difficult to tell this story in two hours as it is in 6, like the A&E series.<br/><br/>but in some of the ESSENTIALS the writer inexplicably ELIMINATED and CHANGED the excellent dialogue of Austen. (Why?) <br/><br/>The most egregious examples of this are:<br/><br/>(1) A central theme of the book is PRIDE, most notably Darcy's, who possesses it both in its good and bad forms. And one of the great movements of the story is Darcy's coming to see a prideful and self-centered side of himself, which is manifest in his initial proposal to Elizabeth. <br/><br/>Through her rejection of this proposal and the reasons given, Darcy is stung, and eventually sees his fault. He then works to overcome this. You would never know this from watching this movie. Firstly, the Darcy of this film does not seem very proud, just shy and taciturn. And so there is no movement.<br/><br/>Toward the end of the book, Darcy, after having ascertained that Elizabeth's feelings have changed toward him, proceeds to explain to her this movement in himself and how it was she who brought it about. (It is a good 2-3 pages of explanation in the book). In this movie, after he ascertains that her feelings have changed toward him, they kiss and are married. <br/><br/>So they leave out A MAJOR THEME OF THE BOOK. It reminded me of your basic Hollywood love story. boy and girl are attracted to each other and that is all that counts, and it ends happy if their desires match.<br/><br/>But, Austens story is more than that. She emphasized the character of each that went beyond their outward appearances. It was hard, in this film, to see that Elizabeth was any more or less sensible than any of the other sisters, or that Darcy changed in the least from the start to the last.<br/><br/>Other unfortunate changes<br/><br/>(2) the great repartee between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth when the former wants to prevent the potential engagement between D and E----THIS CLASSIC SCENE WAS CUT IN HALF --and as well, happened in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, instead of early morning in the book.<br/><br/>(3) and --the funniest line in the book is the one where, upon Mrs Bennet insisting that Elizabeth marry Mr Collins, Mr Bennet makes his quip about how Lizzy ""must become a stranger to one of her parents"",-- ...Southerlands Mr. Bennet delivered these lines in a serious manne:--no deadpan, no sparkle in the eye, no tongue in cheek like the book has.<br/><br/>It was not a bad movie in and of itself, but I think it was made to appeal to the mass of young movie-goers, at the expense of true-ness to the book. I do not think the writer/Director trusted the audience with the wit and intelligence of original work."

The movie itself was badly directed and didn't show the characters to their full extent. E.g. the actor playing Darcy did not portray any air of arrogance; the guy playing Mr. Collins was not loathsome enough! I am disappointed. Disappointed!!! The 1995 version was 100% better, 10 stars!

","What a beautiful film. The costumes, production design and cinematography keep the production values very high. That goes along way when you have to mask probably the weakest interpretation of Elizabeth Bennett ever. Keira Knightley seems to mumble her way through the movie, and throws away practically every line with her lower jaw thrust forward in juvenile muggery. All the beauty of the film serves to put lipstick on a pig. There seems to be nothing going on internally to the character of Elizabeth. Ms. Knightley would have been far better suited to play Lydia running after redcoats as flighty as she is. She completely lacks any kind of probity, which is essential in a work much about judgment, character and prejudice. If I could mix and match the various elements of the three adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, I would have had Elizabeth Garvie from the original BBC series play the heroine, and this movie would have been just perfect. It's unfortunate that Hollywood seems to latch onto whatever 'hot young model', and who better in their mind to cast in the role than the anorexic ass kicker from Domino. It's really a shame that they could not have spread the casting net a bit wider and hired someone who could have brought some levels and depth to the character.

","A bit like a more intelligent Lost in Translation, the best of both films consisting of the photogenic qualities of its female stars. Once Keira Knightley stopped crinkling her nose and impersonating a Yorkshire terrier, her attractiveness almost carried the film. Unlike Lost in Translation, whose only other redeeming feature was the Tokyo background, Pride and Prejudice failed to make anything of the glorious Derbyshire landscapes on offer, apart from one shot of Miss Knightley apparently auditioning for Wuthering Heights, superfluous, but at least it was pretty. Unless I watched a flawed print, the overall dullness of the movie seemed deliberately perverse. All I could think was that the £20M budget meant they couldn't afford to hang around for a spot of sunshine - particularly criminal during the brief scenes shot at Chatsworth, which barely hinted at what a stunning location this is. Scorn Hollywood as much as you like, but no director of a second rate TV movie would have wasted such an opportunity.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending. I haven't seen the US version, but it could hardly compete with the UK release for banal anti-climax. Much as I love Donald Sutherland, to end with him, and not the lovers (I use the term reluctantly, because any chemistry built up in the first hour, was dissipated in the rush towards the 'climax') was a patronising and failed attempt to genuflect to the novel and its millions of fans."

The atmosphere of the time is meticulously portrayed in various settings, pointing up differences in wealth and social status through many great touches (such as a mature male pig being herded through a house).<br/><br/>My only quibble was the sound of a modern grand piano, standing in for older instruments used on camera - I thought the sound editor should have used more authentic-sounding instruments to match the beautiful visual settings.<br/><br/>If you like period drama that keeps its sense of humour and remains true to its roots, go and see this movie.

It was as if we were watching a kind of 'P&P the early years', as if the characters were portrayed at an even younger age. They are not as mature as we expect them to be. But probably this is because the film had to do a six hour job in just two hours and had to settle for zest instead of irony, for sexiness instead of passion. I thought that Sutherland was much too lovable and kind to be a believable Mr Bennet, but I found his performance heartwarming. The same can be said for Ms Blethyn's Mrs Bennet: she's much too down to earth and careworn for us to really be able to laugh at her, but her performance is topnotch. Normally in P&P the fun comes from Mr Collins, but this time we are sorry for him and pained at his shortcomings. Here, the fun comes from Bingley, a fresh faced, wide eyed, red haired bumbling idiot. The character seems to have traded bonhomie for plain idiocy. However, even though the luminous Jane loves him and for the life of me I couldn't figure out why, even though this passion seems to be born out of absolutely nothing but proximity for a couple of hours, I warmed to Bingley. Lydia and Wickham and the whole militia caboodle could have been dispensed with, as there's not even half the time to start caring about them.<br/><br/>As I said, I was prepared to be severely displeased (as Lady Catherine would say, a stately but ineffectual Judi Dench in Lady Bracknell-mode), but I wasn't. This great book has come to life again, albeit in a surprising new way."

","As a true Austen lover, having read the book and seen the amazing 1995 series, the only positive thing I have to say about this absolute horrid failure of a film is that the music was quite nice. Every possible thing was wrong with this film, the script, the language, the setting and most of all...the actors, my god, is that Matthew McFadyen supposed to be at all handsome and powerful? He look like a bloody wimp! And Keira....love her in all her movies, but she....she should have stayed away from this. It takes a real woman to play Elisabeth Bennet! I don't understand why they made a remake of it, when the 1995 series is absolutely perfect? It is completely ludicrous!"
"callikokat","1","5","17","4 August 2006"," Absolutely terrible
","Everything about this movie is horribly wrong. The characters, who in both the book and the 1995 version of the movie starring Colin Firth are lively, entertaining and delightfully written, are destroyed in this version of the film. They lack depth, purpose, and are entirely devoid of spirit. I cannot see how anyone who hasn't either read the book or seen the 1995 film could possibly understand any of the motives behind the characters or purpose of the story. The movie tells the story in fast-forward, (though with plenty of pointless artistic shots in lieu of important story information) while leaving out necessary development and giving an incredibly false feeling behind all of the relationships. The movie is chopped up, entirely watered down, and a terrible disappointment."

","This is a HORRIBLE version of Pride and Prejudice. It portrays the characters nothing like the 1995 version or the book for that matter.<br/><br/>The film makes Lizzie out to be a silly, non-clever, dumb girl. Who only enjoys laughing and reading books. The end of the movie is what killed it for me. The ""Godess Devine"" scene is ridiculous and if Jane Austen was alive I'm sure she would be disgusted by it. It changes the WHOLE tone of the movie and you go away from the movie missing something.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on the movie.

","I has a lot of high hopes and expectations before watching this. At the end I was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>I cannot understand why it had won so many awards and nominations. I have read the book and seen the TV serials by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth many many times and fell in love with them. Maybe I expected too much.<br/><br/>To me, in order to fully appreciate 'Pride and Prejudice', it must be thoroughly read and watched. It cannot and should not be simplified into a movie. This is none other than a remake of the 1940 movie by Greer Garson and Lawrance Olivier. Simplicfication and deletion of some of the actual scenes and events simply did not work.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley acted well but she was no match with the lovely and attractive Jennifer Ehle."
"wolverinegracey","9","4","13","1 October 2005"," pride and prejudice film
","I did see both the versions of Pride and Prejudice and I must say that they were both good. I saw a comment on here that was very bad on Matthew MacFadyen. I must say that he's a better cast than Hugh Grant as proposed. I think that Matthew didn't get a chance to show the true Mr Darcy as he had to try it in 2 hours while Colin Firth had almost 6 hours. I also think that the film can't be compared to the series. the film is a bit more modern when it comes to the setting and the costumes. I think that they did a great casting in this film. It is always hard to make a remake of something that was a big hit but in my opinion the film makers did a good job with this film. Keira Knightley showed she can carry a film. I loved the small parts from Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench. She is the right person to play Lady Catherine. That Lizzy and Darcy don't kiss at the end didn't bother me at all. I thought it was a lovely romantic version of the novel."
"gordon-247","4","5","18","14 August 2006"," Awful
","My God, this is bad.<br/><br/>Matthew MacFadyen manages to be both drippy and wooden and, no mean feat this, makes Colin Firth look like Brando. Not the Darcy that strides from the pages of the novel, more a Darcy that limps from the pages of a particularly flaccid Mills and Boon. Long lingering looks into the camera as mists roll over England's green and pleasant land remind one of a particularly awful advert for Clover butter that is currently polluting the small screen.<br/><br/>As for Keira ... Christ. A (very) pretty face she undoubtedly has, but her talent seems to extend little further than that. Those of you that have read the book will recognise in her portrayal nothing of the less attractive pride or prejudice inherent in Lizzie's character, nor the more attractive steel and sensibility. Elizabeth Bennett as a giggling and frankly tedious little girl is a reappraisal that I for one could happily have done without.<br/><br/>It gets 3/10 for the cinematography, Judy Dench and, to a less extent, Donald Sutherland. Other than that, quite awful."

","Sorry, but I much prefer Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, as well all the other actors in the television series, which I thankfully recorded.<br/><br/>Nobody in the film version was anywhere as good as the A&E version, with the notable exception of Dame Judy Dench. Her part was beautiful, of course, And this is grousing about acting styles, but NOBODY could be better as Darcy than Colin Firth, and McFadyen was a poor second. And the mother in the television version was simply marvelous, as was the embarrassing Kitty. And Wickham was perfectly cast as a deceiving but charming scoundrel.<br/><br/>Plus the character of Jane in the television version was perfectly portrayed. And of course, Jennifer portrayed Elizabeth wonderfully.<br/><br/>And I can't forget to mention Crispin Bonham-Carter, from the renowned family of great actors! And many other 'supporting' roles. All beautifully portrayed.<br/><br/>I almost put Robert Hardy in this mix, but then remembered he was in Sense and Sensibility. He has such a long and distiguished acting career that it's easy to imagine him in any notable role. But not in this series! Golly, I'll have to get the tape out and watch tomorrow!"
"gjp-8","6","3","9","12 September 2006"," It was pretty good.
","The production details, like Longbourne's decor for example, were outstandingly good. In the scenes with the Bennet family at home, brilliant technical work produced a sense of actually being there, chasing the sisters around the house. I was reminded of Taylor and Burton's 'Taming of the Shrew', because of the decor and the actors' vivacity. A couple of weaknesses let the side down a bit for me though: the clichéd shots of people in the rain, with heavy-handed symbolism, and some pretty modern lapses of vernacular speech, especially Lizzies' interrogative ""What are you doing here?"", demanded of none other than Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy. This had me thinking that the script-writers may have been hijacked, by cute actresses, into giving the dialogues a more 'modern' feel. Miss Knightly did a very good job, although she injected a large dose of self-indulgence, albeit unconsciously, into Lizzies manner. The actor playing Mr Bingly, outrageous hair aside, was every bit the doting companion, whilst Mathew McFayden presented rather a washed out Darcy, who seemed in need of a strong coffee most of the time.<br/><br/>Darcy, then, was disappointing. Instead of smouldering, he appeared to merely smoke: the dark turbulent depths to his character simply didn't expose themselves. Where was the arrogance?<br/><br/>Finally, Britain's sharp class divide failed to register against a background of frivolity and teen romance. This divide is what Pride and Prejudice is all about, after all, and so the resulting recipe lacked the piquancy of a genuinely 19th century dish. The girls' hopes for the two men are thus merely teen loves, not the despairing passions, impossible to be requited, that Jane Austin penned.<br/><br/>All the same, a pretty good film."

Coming from someone who had to be sat down kicking and screaming to watch the BBC version because she ""hates romances"", please believe me when I suggest that before you run out and buy this one thinking it's a fantastic love story and you need to watch it over and over and over again - stop.

And this film, to me, was no different. She ruined this film for me. I should say that she was ONE of the things that ruined this movie for me...but the main thing, nonetheless. What the hell is that thing that she does with her mouth? Is that a pout? Did someone tell her that she had a sexy pout and that she should pout throughout the whole film, and indeed, throughout all of her films? It made me want to stab puppies. And the fact that they feel the need to pan in for a close up every time she smiles is nauseating. Now, for Darcy. or rather, Matthew McFadyen's failed attempt as Darcy. As big of an ass as Darcy is, there is something appealing about him. Something that makes you WANT Lizzie to have him. But McFadyen's Darcy is such that I wanted him to go away. I was not at all attracted to him. Two thumbs way down for this movie."

Matthew MacFadyen is handsome but not fearful nor proud as Mr. Darcy that too was perfected by Colin Firth. Talulah Riley did a very good job as Mary. Also, Jane and Lizzy were not that close, the writer completely missed the connection these two sister have in the book because it was totally missed in the movie. Mr. Bennet skipped out on Lizzy when she needed him the most and this is his favorite daughter. For a more deserving, better movie and one that follows the book more closely - see the 1995 mini-movie from the A&E/BBC.

Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine and the others are never even mildly amusing. The 2005 film has turned P & P into a bodice ripper, with smoldering looks in abundance. Yecch! The 1940 P & P, even with all its faults (costumes not in the right period, etc.) was vastly superior and is STILL worth watching if only for the beautifully acted confrontation scene between Elizabeth Bennett and Lady Catherine, towards the end of the film. The 1996 British mini-series P & P although lengthy, at about 6 hours total, is the one that does the book justice, in my view."

I thought this version was a very good attempt and don't understand why so many people are criticising it!!!!! I admit its not as good as the BBC drama starring Colin Firth (oooooooooo jumping into the lake!!) and Jennifer Ehle, but it is still good. The characters are well played (Judi Dench was good as the monstrous Catherine De Bough) and Keira Knightley wasn't that bad. I also thought Mary Bennet was better in this version. I thought the ""glossy"" British countryside settings gave the film that extra ""sparkle"". My favourite scene was when Elizabeth Bennet visits Pemberely.

","Comparing this 2005 'attempt' to the 1995 version will fail every time, simply because the 1995 version took several hours to develop the characters for the viewers. They were far too complex to cram in to two hours. It just can't be done. The problem I see with this version is that it doesn't stand on its own. You'd have had to read the book or watched the 1995 version (or others) to have any clue as to what's happening. It's obvious that Keira Knightly or the director have seen the 1995 version due to some of the misplaced subtleties they tried to include (expressions in certain scenes). And it's painfully obvious that the director hasn't read the book. The idea of trying to create a movie based on a book without ever having read the book is just silly. It's embarrassing. And to claim that Jane Austen would be proud of such a rendition is also dim witted. You can't prove such a thing and you can't even speculate without sounding rather dense. I have yet to run into an author who was happy about having their work shredded into unrecognizable parts. And anyone who claims that Keira Knightly is more than just eye candy is obviously not very discerning. The acting stunk. It only proves that Keira remains about as talented as a Bratz doll. *cue mindless, outward appearance-based fans to rush to her rescue*"

","This movie is guilty of murdering Jane Austen's wit and charm, not to mention historic accuracy and cleanliness. It is more reminiscent of the misery and filth depicted in Dickens or Hardy (Victorian era) rather that Austen (Regency Period). I could almost smell the pig stench off of their greasy hair and dirty clothes. This has nothing do with Austen's world of pomp and circumstance. It is so very obvious that no one involved with this movie has even read Austen. I adore Dame Judy, but she should have walked off this set. The characters mumble and spit out their dialogue like modern-day teens at the burger king takeout window. The witty and clever vixen, Miss Eliza Bennet, has been turned into an unkempt, angry and out of control mess; the house is dilapidated and run down, more in keeping with Fanny Price's ramshackle hovel from Mansfield Park, not Longbourn. But perhaps the biggest travesty of all is the way this movie has crushed and humiliated one of the cleverest and most sardonic of characters in literature by portraying Mr. Bennet as a sniveling, downtrodden, Hen-pecked half- wit. Even the one scene that could have had any redeeming qualities, namely, Mr. Darcy cutting a handsome figure walking half-dressed through the misty field in slow motion, was a blatant and shameless rip-off from no other than Colin Firth's epic wet shirt moment in the fabulous and exquisite 1995 version (a must see). So, the only reason this movie should even exist is to expose a whole generation who would never read any of Austen's books to an imbecile's attempt at a cliffs note version of a magnificent masterpiece."

","Deborah Moggach has succeeded in taking a literary classic which has engaged and delighted readers for two centuries, and transforming it into a third-rate Regency romance. In this she has been aided and abetted by Keira Knightley (spoilt and petulant rather than sparkling, and displaying none of the wit and intelligence of Austen's heroine), Matthew Macfadyen (wooden) and, of the supporting cast, most notably Donald Sutherland, who can't even be bothered to adopt a plausible British accent.<br/><br/>The only half-decent acting in this film is from Rosamund Pike and Tom Hollander. Something must be seriously wrong when the viewer is cheering for Mr Collins and shouting at the screen that he's too good for Elizabeth.<br/><br/>It is hard to know where to start on the question of historical inaccuracy. One example out of many is that Elizabeth runs about barefoot in a dress made of dark fabric. A family that was reasonably well-to-do - and certainly one that sought to mix in circles above its own station - would have taken great care to dress their daughters in pale fabrics, which indicated that they could afford a maid to wash their clothes daily, and indeed that they could afford to replace their clothes when they wore out from too much washing. The frustrating thing is that nothing whatsoever is gained, artistically or dramatically, from the countless historical inaccuracies - it is simply laziness on the part of the screenwriter, producer, designers, and everyone else involved.<br/><br/>This film is a triumph of media hype over quality. Mercifully, in ten years it will have been superseded by another interpretation - which can only be better. In the meantime, whilst Moggach may have butchered Austen's storyline and Knightley has mangled her heroine, we can still go back to the book if we want something really worthwhile."

The film is certainly handsome looking, with some truly beautiful locations and costumes, with a nice script and some excellent performances from Keira Knightly as Lizzie and in particular Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. Donald Sutherland (yeah, you saw right) was quite charming as Mr Bennett if you put his awkward accent aside. I liked Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy, with his handsome looks and all that, but I will say I do prefer Colin Firth's interpretation from the sublime 1995 mini-series, Firth seemed to adopt a more likable and sympathetic approach to the character. I liked the way the film dealt with the period look and the social differences, and while there was a lot of the pride I would have liked to have seen a little more of the prejudice. If anything, the film could have done with being twenty minutes longer, as I felt there wasn't quite enough content from the book. Then again, it's been a long time since I read it, so I could be wrong. Overall, a beautiful film, not quite as good as the 1995 film Sense and Sensibility with Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson, but worth watching for the detail that obviously took a lot of effort to get right. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox."

I thought it might be a great romance film starring Keira Knightley (one of my favorite actresses), and as I said before I love a good romance movie.<br/><br/>The story starts (like in the original novel) when a wealthy bachelor named Mr. Bingley takes up residence in a nearby mansion, and the Bennet family were abuzz. Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of London friends and the influx of young militia officers, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. Eldest daughter Jane, serene and beautiful, seems poised to win Mr. Bingley's heart. For her part, Lizzie meet with the handsome and – it would seem – snobbish Mr. Darcy, and the battle of the sexes is joined Their encounters are frequent and spirited yet far from encouraging. Lizzie finds herself even less inclined to accept a marriage proposal from a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, and – supported by her father – stuns her mother and Mr. Collins by declining. When the heretofore good-natured Mr. Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr. Darcy culpable. I won't get you folks anymore details, you'll have to see the film for yourself.<br/><br/>Admittedly speaking, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the whole film from beginning to end.

"jmelvin1-1","10","2","5","14 January 2009"," Men, be not afraid.
","Every so often, a wife guilts her husband, or a girlfriend her guilts her boy into their choice for a film. If so, men, be not afraid. This film works for us. Here's how.<br/><br/>The first scary area is this world of is the author Jane Austin. Or, I mean her followers. They are as over the top in their unending devotion as J.R.R. Tolkien fans. ""But she one of the great authors of the English language."" Maybe, but her fans are true to that word. Fanatics. Hence, the much acclaimed 6 hour miniseries of 1995. But this movie is not that. It is a sensible 2 hours.<br/><br/>The first half hour can be painful, including the obligatory 'girls laughing in their corsets' scene before a ball. Uhggg. But things quickly change when Mr. Collins visits. <br/><br/>The first bit of good news is the wonderful direction of Joe Wright. Second is the great scoring of Dario Marianelli. The next is the casting. <br/><br/>For Collins is the fantastic character actor Tom Hollander. As an unwelcome guest, he brings to life Donald Sutherland and Keira Knightley. These are our family, the Bennetts. Knightley is Elizabeth Bennett, the main character, who shares a special bond with her father, Sutherland. Part of the bond is making fun of this guest. Check out the pointed direction.<br/><br/>Next comes a dance with Elizabeth and the legendary Mr. Darcy, played by MI6 man Matthew McFayden. His effectiveness in this role may be debated by the ladies, but men, relax. We can deal with him. Partially because at any moment we hope he will pull out a gun. Of course, that doesn't happen. But it could. Like when the Zombies come to eat the guests at the dance. OK, that doesn't happen. But I could just imagine it.<br/><br/>Scene after scene, what is PG material seems steaming and naughty. This is from Wright's take....Elizabeth Bennett is not the wise cracker of the book or miniseries, but intelligently outspoken and emotional. Her crisis seems to be her coming to terms with being at the crossroads of youth and a sexually mature woman. Needless to say, Knightley pulls this off stunningly.<br/><br/>Scenes of passion with McFayden seem more so. The scene of confrontation with Judi Dench and Knightley comes across like Dench is holding a gun on her. Maybe this isn't as true to Austin as the miniseries, but why would a man care? It is engaging. And enjoyable. And at times seems downright dirty. And we can imagine Knightley throwing Dench out of the house to be eaten by Zombies. Whoops! Sorry.<br/><br/>Also of great note is Bond girl Rosamund Pike. The novel deals with two couples. One is Elizabeth and Darcy. The other is her sister Jane and Charles Bingley. At several points of the movie, Jane's story goes front and center, and Pike has the ability to come from the background and take charge of a scene, while Knightley steps into the background. Pike and Knightley work well together. Especially when cornered in the house be the Zombies, and they have to bring out Mr. Bennett's arsonal to kill them off. Oh, sorry again.<br/><br/>In the end, you may actually enjoy this. A man can respect McFayden. A man will be engaged by Knightley. And this is one of few period pieces that can reach across that barrier that some schmucks call ""Mars and Venus""."

","Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a truly solid bit of film-making. I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not, being I have not read the novel nor seen the other film treatments, however, as a piece of work in its own right, it succeeds on all accounts. Gorgeous to look at, this debut shows all the signs of the greatness he was to achieve with this year's Atonement. From multiple long takes, sweeping through the scenery, choreographed to perfection in order to allow the characters to flow in and out of frame, to wonderfully shot dance sequences at the two balls, the craft is unreal. I don't want to knock the story, though, as it is quite good. Never having really taken the time to acquaint myself with the Jane Austen canon, I am pleasantly surprised with how good the tale of love and premature judgments of character is. Firing on all cylinders, I accept all the praise that was lauded on it upon its release fully.<br/><br/>Wright seems to have the period drama down to perfection and it will be interesting to see what he does with his new film The Soloist, very much a departure from his two previous works. What we can expect, however, is a precise attention to detail and composition. Throughout this film we are given frames resembling works of art, (not to mention the actual artworks depictedI absolutely loved the marble statue of the veiled woman, breathtaking), with light and atmosphere filling every available space. The little things, like when Elizabeth Bennet is in search of her soldier friend at the ball and we see Mr. Darcy look at her from behind as she continues to walk away, add so much depth with no dialogue necessary. He knows what he wants to show at all times and is never afraid to allow what's on screen do the talking for him through emotions and actions. For a director to trust the craft and the medium at such an early stage of his career, so unabashedly, is a rare trait. Most would rely on his actors to pull out greatness, but instead he relies on no one but himself, and the vision he wanted to put to celluloid.<br/><br/>If I were to fault Wright and the film at all, it would be with the handling of some performances, although I'm not sure how much I can really blame. The Bennet family is supposed to come across as loud and obnoxious, a family ill-suited to the status for which they are trying to marry into. They do this in spades, but I may have wanted it to be toned down just a tad. Jena Malone's role as the youngest sister is just plain annoying, but her crassness and lack of subtlety do help in a dinner scene later in the film in order to give her reason to slip and tell her sister a secret. Brenda Blethyn, as the Bennet matriarch, is also very over-the-top. The performance could be a bit grating at times, but thankfully we are given lengthy reprieves without her to allow us to handle those moments when she is in full force.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is absolutely fantastic. Keira Knightley, as she did in Atonement, really surprised me again with her starring role as Elizabeth. She is an actress that finally has deemed herself to deserve the accolades she receives in my mind. I understood people's fascinations with her looks (although maybe not in total agreement), but never the skill at her craft. Now, though, I am on the bandwagon. Mr. Darcy, our second lead, is brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen as well. His transformation from stuffy aristocrat to enraptured slave to love is believable at every turn. Despite his burgeoning love, he was still trying to be true to himself and his friends when he gave advice on matters such as marriage. It takes the events between he and Elizabeth for both to realize their own fallibilities and stubborn pride. Only when they finally open up to each other and tell of what the other doesn't really know do they see that what they thought were good intentions were in actuality poor judgments. A good supporting cast bolsters these two stars too, with acknowledgements going to Rosamund Pike, Donald Sutherland (a wonderful final scene), Simon Woods, and the always-great Tom Hollander.<br/><br/>For all those that decide to pass by Pride and Prejudice because it is a romantic fluff piece, I only have to say give it a chance. As far as drama goes, the story is well told, and as far as cinematic excellence, it delivers at every moment. I won't go on record and say that it must be the best version of the classic taleI'm always told the Colin Firth piece is betterbut I will say that this is one heck of a film. See it for the grandeur and the spectacle, but also become engrossed in the tale and the journey that love takes these two very different people on showing them and us how very much the same they are."
"marshwiggles_unite","8","2","5","27 December 2006"," Improves upon review
","I first saw this movie in my Literature class and, after being spoiled by the absolutely superb Firth/Ehle BBC edition, I was to say the least disappointed. Granted, we were watching it from the standpoint of its faithfulness to the novel; if even the 5 hour BBC opus could not capture all aspects of Austen's novel, how could a much shorter (2 hour) version hope to compare? However, upon subsequent viewings I have found this version to have its own merits. Keira Knightley is (as always) a stunning actress. Many would say that Colin Firth is a better Darcy, but I think that Matthew Macfadyen instead focuses on a different side of Darcy, Darcy as a young man confronted and thrown off by the new sensation of love, and thus his interpretation is just as valid. The awkwardness between the two main characters in this version feels more genuine than the continuous banter of the BBC miniseries, though continuous banter is of course much truer to Austen's style. My only disappointment in this movie that persists is the lack of ridiculous characters; Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine were portrayed by first-rate actresses, yet I feel they missed the point of their characters entirely. Lady Catherine especially was meant to be over-the-top and absurd, yet was here portrayed as a very straight, imposing character. Oh! and the American ending was a little too outside-of-canon for my taste. I also sometimes found it a wee bit confusing (it being ""historically accurate"" meant much more background noise and thus made it hard to hear some key dialogue), so I'm not sure how well people who have not read the novel follow the story. However, many of my friends who have not read the book absolutely love this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is quite good, especially if you aren't looking for it to be absolutely true to the novel; it is most certainly an interpretation rather than adaptation."

I really cannot say enough good about it.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen is the absolute PERFECT Darcy; sorry Colin Firth fans. For the record, I also like the BBC's version, but prefer this one.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. I would not change a single character; the casting really was 'right on.' Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennett), Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennett), and Tom Hollander (Mr. Collins) were all excellent choices. Judi Dench's Lady Catherine is superb as is to be expected. I loved her late-night visit!<br/><br/>The cinematography is incredible! I've never seen a more beautiful scene than the one when Darcy declares that Elizabeth has ""bewitched him body and soul"" (sigh!). The sun is just rising behind them. The settings and costumes were gorgeous.<br/><br/>The script is a loving interpretation of Austen's text. I disagree wholeheartedly with other reviews who think Austen would be ""spinning in her grave."" I love Austen's books and feel this movie is a compliment to her genius."

","I thought it was a great movie, hands down. It's been criticized for not being as good as the 1995 series (which I didn't see so this might not be a completely reliable review) but I think the recent movie holds its own. The cinematography is amazing, really drawing on your emotions and making you feel the intense passion and scenery of the book and the setting. The cast was amazing, yes they didn't portray Mr. Darcy the same way as he's portrayed in the book, but it was still done beautifully and I think along the same thread as the book. I read the book a few years before watching this movie, and it successfully brought back all the wishful thinking and romanticism that the book conjures. If you're not a purist and you don't mind a little condensing of the story for movie purposes, then you'll love this movie."
"RScarlettJH","10","2","5","10 June 2006"," One of the best stories of all time.
","This film is one that will be timeless. I had to read the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin in high school and I hated it. I thought that it was horrible to read. It was hard for me at the age of like 14 or 15 to really grasp the beauty of the story. Now that I have grown older I decided that I would give the story another shot by watching the film. Mostly because Keira Knightly is one of my favorite actors. It was such a good display of the story that it changed my mind. I think that the tag line for this film (I don't know it word for word) that says sometimes the one you hate is the one you can't live without, is a great one line summary of the story. You feel for the young Liz as she wonders through life trying to find that great love. Not realizing that the man she and you have grown to hate is her destiny."

I thought that it would be long and boring, but when I finally did watch it (becuase I wanted something to fall asleep too) I found myself thoroughly engaged. I ended up not falling asleep until after I watched every moment of it and at the end I was very impressed. I've seen all of Knightley's movies and I'm convinced her performance in this was one of the best she may ever do. She really gave it everything she had and I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they may like it. You may be surprised at how easy it is to watch and get involved with."
"galensaysyes","3","2","5","4 May 2006"," Prejudice .150, Pride .000
","Shortly before seeing this I'd reread the book and reseen the BBC serial, which took pains to convey the book's events and meanings faithfully. This movie doesn't do that so much, and in the publicity material on the DVD producer, director, and writer all agree on the text's being about the family's great love for each other; the writer even argues that Mrs. Bennet is a heroic character because of her great love for her daughters. This seems to me a flagrant misreading of the text; fortunately it isn't apparent in the movie, but the deficiency of humor it suggests is: the book is funny very often, the movie very seldom. The director imbues it with much vigor of an unsuitable type, which at times threatens to turn it into Wuthering Heights, at other times into Sharpe's Rifles. But even that would have been tolerable if the two leads had been more wisely cast. Matthew Macfayden as Darcy is none of the things the character is said to be, except dark; most of the time he just looks dopey and dour, like Jim Nabors trying to do Soames Forsyte. I assume he can appear more attractive than he's photographed here; the camera doesn't do very charitably by anyone, except the star, for whom the movie seems designed primarily as a modeling showcase. Keira Knightley does give intelligent readings of her lines--rather as if she'd just been listening to an audiobook of the novel--but they're always being nullified by her face, which rotates the same three or four expressions throughout, one of them an unnervingly vulpine baring of her upper teeth, none of them especially suitable to Elizabeth Bennet or to anything she might feel. Knightley comes to life once, in her big scene with Judi Dench, which suggests she might become an actress some day, if she would ever stop doing things so she could actually do something."
"kristen3970","3","2","5","30 April 2006"," Not at all accurate!
","I was interested to see this film after having seen the BBC's 1995 adaptation. I was disappointed not only in the casting, several of the characters did not fit the roles given them, and the film's makers didn't seem to have a real grasp for the historical period. Of course some creative interpretation is required as Austen wrote a book not a screenplay, but this film seems to miss a big chunk of what Pride and Prejudice represents at a specific historical point. Although an entertaining ""love"" story, anyone who has read and appreciated the book will be undoubtedly disappointed by this adaptation especially if they've seen the BBC one previously. This film feels rushed and some of the events that would have been quite socially significant in the early 19th century are glossed over in an attempt to make this movie fit into 2 or so hours."

"jessopfam","3","2","5","9 April 2006"," Jane Austin's most appealing book does not fare well in this limited adaptation
","I was quite disappointed with the latest adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. First of all, Jane Austin was not Henry Fielding, and making the film sets so Fieldingesque--country bumpkin, burly squire, pigs and chicken--did not suit the delicate story Jane Austin wove of the ""marriage mart,"" and the plot was not very well developed. Time--two hours--is a factor here, and the principals, Elizabeth and Darcy, did very little to make us believe the ""love dual"" between them. Keira Knightley was sprightly but Matthew McFayden's emotional range was on a scale of 1 to 2. Mr. Bingley was rather a cypher, though Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) had merit, it was rather lost in the all over plot.<br/><br/>Considering there are plenty of models, illustrations and such, of what the dress of the early 1800's to be easily found to give ideas for the costumes, I was disappointed at the drab costumes used in the film, especially those of Elizabeth. Half the time, she appeared to be in a man's overcoat, and it wasn't flattering. And the dull dark dresses she wore were also not very becoming. I understand she had cut her hair for another role, but just the same, all I was aware of was scragged back untidy frontal hair with unbecoming rolls at the back; better wigs could have been found.<br/><br/>Even the ball scene, where Elizabeth wore the most becoming of all her outfits, I was surprised to see Caroline Bingley in that anachronistic spaghetti strap dress--not Regency! She would have been more authentic had she been wearing a wetted down gauze dress clinging to her person if the idea was that Caroline was in a higher style than the Bennetts. And where was Mrs. Bennett's cap? No lady of her age would have been bareheaded; she would not have danced country dances with five daughters to put forward, and for the ball she would have had at least some kind of lacy or feathery concoction, and all the ladies and gentlemen would have worn glove.<br/><br/>The acting of the older members of the cast was good, better than that of the younger ones, but in such a shortened version, let's face it, Judy Dench was wasted as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.<br/><br/>The shots of real scenery were lovely, and the golden sun motif was striking, but the ending of the film was pure Harlequin Romance. I am sure Jane Austin would have had a laugh."
"mostwanted123","5","2","5","19 March 2006"," Terrible
","This movie is terrible. I was so bored I literally checked the DVD player every 5 minutes to see how much time was left until it was over. I always try to watch remakes without the original in mind, but this movie was so bad I couldn't stop thinking about it. I don't even know why I gave it 5. Sure, I guess it looked nice, but it was very uninteresting and choppy compared to the previous versions of Pride & Prejudice. First off, what's with the casting? Nobody fitted in their roles at all. And this isn't to say Lizzie was supposed to be ugly, but she certainly was not supposed to be the most beautiful--but I think Kiera looked the best out of all her sisters. Even so, she was NOT Lizzie. None of the girls looked right for the role. None of them had that classic look. They looked very much like modern girls to me stuck in the past. The scene where Lizzie and one of her sisters (can't remember which one) are under the bedcovers, it literally seemed like a movie set in the present because I couldn't see what they were wearing or what their hairstyle was. That's how unconvincing they were. Secondly, the acting was NOT good. Kiera Knightly did NOT deserve the Oscar nomination! I think she is a wonderful actress, but I don't think she was good in this movie at all. Her acting was blunt, boring, and dead. She did not breathe life into Lizzie's character at all and she was completely unconvincing. She did not capture Lizzie's personality whatsoever. And the scene where she was yelling, Lizzie would never do that. She is supposed to be witty and composed. Thirdly, it was so choppy I didn't know what the hell was going on. They should not have crammed the story into such a short period of time. It just doesn't work. Having seen the other two versions, this was by far the worst."

The music throughout the movie awakens all of your senses, you can feel every emotion or thought in the scene.<br/><br/>Mr. Darcy, portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen, in the beginning, is prejudiced, proud, and ""sort of unpleasant fellow"" in Mr. Bennett's words. Beauty of his personality grows through the movie, as Elizabeth Bennett's love and respect grow for him. Wonderful scene in the rain where he opens up and lets his emotions run, Lizzy rejects him but feels terrible about it...Then, she learns more of his qualities, and she realizes that she loves him and has been falling in love with him this whole time.<br/><br/>Wonderful story beautifully told by amazing Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen.

"Charmed7202","10","2","5","9 March 2006"," A spirited new version of a classic British tale
","Gritty, realistic and brilliantly acted  these are just some of the ways I would describe the new version of Jane Austen's classic 18th century tale.<br/><br/>Pride & Prejudice tells the story of a young woman who is stuck in the craziness of her family, culture and era. She is there to see her oldest sister get ditched by the ""perfect"" man. She is there when her younger sister runs away and elopes with the scoundrel of the story. She sees her mother desperately trying to marry off her 5 daughters to wealthy men. She is stuck in a world where people marry for economic and family reasons and the one thing in the world she wants is to marry for love.<br/><br/>When the BBC released its mini-series of Pride & Prejudice in 1995, it became the standard from which all classic British stories would have to be filmed. It was plush and beautiful and all the characters looked well-groomed and pretty all the time. That was not England in the 18th century, however.<br/><br/>This recent film, starring the young Keira Knightley, will be known for its realistic portrayal of country life in the 1700's. Knightley plays the lead character, Elizabeth Bennet. She comes from a fairly well-off family in the English countryside. She is opinionated, well-read and isn't afraid to speak her mind  in other words, everything a woman should not be in that century. Knightley plays the part brilliantly and you can see both her strength and her vulnerability at the same time. She reaped an Oscar nod for her portrayal and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen, as Mr. Darcy, is brooding and silent for a lot of the film. Therefore, when he actually proclaims his love for Ms. Bennet, in the rain on the British moors, he not only shocks and bewilders her, but he causes the viewer to wonder how she can resist him  stubbornness and all.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland as the supportive father is wonderful, and although her part is a small, but pivotal one, Dame Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine de Bourg perfectly.<br/><br/>The rainy British weather, the animals in the front yard of the Bennet house, the dirt on the floors and the sisters having to share a bed  all add to the atmosphere of the movie. The clothes aren't always clean, the balls are crowded and uncomfortable and the people aren't always smiling and happy.<br/><br/>This movie is realistic and wonderful. It takes you to another place and time. A time when Jane Austen wrote some of the most beloved books about strong female protagonists and the hardships of life and love. Even if Keira Knightley doesn't win the Oscar this year, rest assured, Ms. Austen would have been proud."
"hollywoodgirl-1","10","2","5","7 March 2006"," Wondrous Adaptation
","I first heard that this movie was being made about a year ago, when it was first being reported that Keira Knightley had been cast. I had little interest, being only fourteen at the time. The next summer came around and I turned fifteen and still had very little interest, although it was a little more piqued since Pride and Prejudice would be one of the books that I would be reading in my British Literature English course once classes started up in August. After plodding through Jane Eyre (not really to my liking), we reached Pride and Prejudice, and almost from the moment I started the book my interest in the upcoming movie reached a boiling point. I loved the book from start to finish and couldn't wait the arrival of the movie (luckily I only had to wait about four weeks from the time I started the book to the time when the movie came out). In my class we watched the 1965 version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which I thought was very good. In the weeks leading up to the movie's release I greedily watched and re-watched every clip I could find and also rented the Colin Firth version and Bride and Prejudice. I was expecting so much from this movie. November 11 rolled around and I was ecstatic. Well, the movie didn't meet my expectations at all. It more than exceeded them. Pride and Prejudice became my favorite movie of the year and it is definitely in the top ten. I absolutely loved it. I thought Keira Knightley did an excellent job, even if she was a bit too giggly at times. I thought that Matthew Macfadyen was amazing as Mr. Darcy. I liked him better than Colin Firth. The acting was superb and the story was amazing for being condensed by so much. The costumes and cinematography were amazingly done as well. I love the soundtrack, it was so beautifully done. In short, I loved everything about this movie, and it is one that I will watch a million times over."

","I'm very surprised at the negative comments re this picture. I have read the original novel several times and have to admit that it was lovely watching the brilliant ""condensed"" version on screen without the windy, tedious and often boring conversations and letters which the characters in Jane Austen's book carried on and wrote. This was ""romance in a nutshell"", the acting was very good (would have loved to have seen much more of Dame Judi Dench), the soundtrack was magnificent. I have the CD and play it very often---Dario Marianelli was robbed at the Oscars! My daughters and I will cherish this film always. We bought it the day it come out on DVD, but I am so glad we saw it on the big screen, too.<br/><br/>As for the thought that younger people will not be interested in the original novels once they are brought to the screen, my daughters are so enchanted by this movie, they all intend to read the novel, as well, and they will.<br/><br/>How sad that this lovely piece of film-making wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.

This movie though did something the novel and mini series didn't....it filled me with joy. Just thinking back to watching the movie for the first time makes me happy, and I think any movie that does that can't be all bad. Yes the script may not have kept every line just the same, and some phrases maybe wouldn't have been said in public. But in their house, the Bennets are just like any other family, they have drama and fights and there is jealousy, but they love each other. I enjoyed that aspect of the movie very much. Also, the casing was superb. Keira Knightly made a perfect Elizabeth Bennet and Mathew Macfayden was a wonderfully new fresh face for Mr. Darcy. Even though they left out some of the scenes I loved in the book and the BBC series, I truly believe anyone will enjoy this movie. Everyone should at least watch the movie, even if you haven't read the book. But I guarantee that after you watch the movie you will want to read it."

","Although some of the imagery and a part of the interpretation was OK. The movie as a whole was horrible. Some of the scenes reminded more of Wuthering Heights than Pride and Prejudice. The 1995 adaptation by the BBC was and is incontestable. The new version is not in any way making right for the subtleness of Jane Austens writing. All the intrigues in the movie are thrown to the viewer without any thought of showing a deeper understanding of the novel.

","Well I guess in the UK we all know Colin Firth as Darcy and unfortunately Macfadyen is simply not good enough - I guess that's the theme of this movie - simply not good enough. There were a few things that really annoyed me, including the 21st century look to the Bennet sisters and the fact that Keira Knightley, looked to me as if she had the benefit of a professional make-up artist, which I don't believe ladies of the 19th century would have had. Having said this there were some nice scenes, I liked the dance scene and the wild scene on the edge of the peak district outcrop, but having been spoilt by such masters of the art as Peter Greenaway and Roman Polanski I became frustrated by the poor use of lighting, especially indoors and the failure to capture the real feeling of 19th century England that comes from Austen's book.<br/><br/>I guess the reality is that I was expecting a lavish cinematic experience, and what I got was nothing more than a classy ""chick-flik"""
"BrentCarleton","2","2","5","18 February 2006"," Woefully miscast
","Another example of the contemporary inability to render a classic in anything like its original intent, sense or form. Here we have a parade of third millennium anachronisms almost as preposterous as those on display in the equally absurd current rendering of ""Tristan and Isolde."" Thus, our heroine Kiera Knightley sails through the whole film with a saucy, feminist tinged, ""cat that swallowed the canary,"" facial expression and vocal delivery, that suggest that she has been watching a great deal of Katie Couric and Elizabeth Vargas, and is dying to drop the word ""empowerment,"" somewhere into her dialogue.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""incomparable,"" Judi Dench--(as the publicity breathlessly assures us). For some incomprehensible reason, contemporary casting directors' are under the lamentable delusion that Miss Dench, (like Maggie Smith) is somehow suited to grande dame roles--when nothing could be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Having seen Miss Dench on stage in a five hour production of ""Cymbeline,"" at Stratford on Avon, I can personally attest to her range and power as an actress. However, whatever her qualifications for Shakespeare, there is nothing in her appearance or deportment that is remotely aristocratic in the 18th/19th century sense of the term.<br/><br/>Indeed, if anything, her persona is pronouncedly proletariat.<br/><br/>Add to that her coarse and rubicund complexion, (un-pancaked in the current naturalistic mode) and her Lady Catherine appears more like a refugee from a Hogarthian gin palace than the daunting and imperious creature Miss Austen intended.<br/><br/>Martita Hunt where are you now that we need you? <br/><br/>There is little to say about Donald Sutherland in the role of Mr. Bennet, inasmuch as he has built a successful career out of being miscast--a feat he continues with this role. And his wife in the picture, (far from the lavender, rose silk and cream Mary Boland of yore) looks like a blowsy, overage bawd from the cast of a backwoods dinner theater production of ""Moll Flanders,"" who has somehow wandered onto the wrong movie set.<br/><br/>But mercifully we at length arrive at the priceless (and now requisite) final clinch, where Miss Knightley and Mr. Macfadyen are depicted in the lotus position on a lake in front of their château, where they proceed to launch into a demonstration of mutual affection that looks like a TV promo for ""The Bachelor,"" and makes one wonder if Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are standing just outside of camera range whispering instructions.<br/><br/>For now if you absolutely require a filmed alternative to the novel itself--stick with the 1940 Greer Garson or unfairly ignored 1979 British TV version."
"granvilleey","5","2","5","13 February 2006"," They tried their best!
","It would have been impossible to condense P&P into 2 hrs adequately so the unfair comparisons between this film and the 1995 version, are just that, unfair. I was however, disappointed by the liberties the scriptwriters and director took with the manners and customs of the time which are so clearly observed in the novel(e.g. Darcy would never have entered Elizabeth's bedroom to deliver a letter - even if this was a symbolic visit it was confusing) The costumes were interesting on the whole even if a little scruffy and it was valid to set the piece at a slightly earlier date than the novel's publication since there are references in the book which suggests this as a possibility. Judy Dench however, as Lady Catherine was sporting a bright orange sun tan worthy of a daytime TV presenter, which would not have been the antithesis of the custom of the day and this for me was a distraction. I was also disappointed by the pace of the dialogue, particularly the scene with Elizabeth and Lady Catherine - It was run at the pace of and express train without pause. The whole point of Austen and why it works as both novel and drama, is that it is of its time - the stories, unlike Shakespeare's, are not about universal themes they are particular to that period of time and that small world. Muck about with these fundamentals, and the whole piece degenerates into a ""chick flick"" and Pride and Prejudice should be much more than that. The actors did their best with what they were given.I found Kiera Knightly although unquestionably beautiful, was unconvincing as Elizabeth - she only seemed to have three expressions one of those was an all too wide grin which seemed to serve her for all manner of emotions and yes, I now know she has wonderfully white teeth. Brenda Blethyn was superb and a much better Mrs Bennet than in other versions I have seen, but Donald Sutherland appeared to have come to Hertfordshire via New Hampshire - his English accent was unsteady which was a contrast to the younger American actresses who had beautiful accents. Too little was made of Matthew McFadyen's Darcy who had the most difficult job of all (Making it his own in competition with Colin Firth's three outings in the role). His acting was far more subtle and superior to Ms Knightly's. And the least said about the US alternative ending, the better! In the end the weakness of this film was the script(a mix of pure Jane Austen and contemporary slush) and the direction. The moral of the tale is next time you want to do a perfect film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, get Emma Thompson to write the script and Ang Lee to direct it - Sense and Sensibility knocked spots off this one."

","The colors were awesome and Matthewy Macfadyen (Mr. Darcy) were fabulous. Keira Knightly was fairly good but spoke much too quickly and that mouth puckering/jaw thing she does was extremely annoying (she does this in all movies but I'll never get used to it). A&E 1995 Version versus 2005 version.....CLEARLY 1995 wins. But if you want to see a very edited version (2 hours instead of 5 hours) with dialog the author never wrote, then watch the 2005. It's fairly good but the only treasures were Judi Dench (Lady Catherine de Bourg) and Macfadyen (Darcy).haha though if he and Colin Firth (1995 Pride and Prejudice) were in competition Firth would win, hands down. On a side note, Jennifer Ehle was a MUCH better Lizzy. Oh and what was up with the singing maid? No need to focus on her at all. Also the meeting between Elizabeth and Darcy at Pemberley was very poorly done, Lizzy should have been uncomfortable but not rude, never rude. Darcy should have also stumbled on his words more and such. The 1995 version also shows him coming into Pemberley unexpectedly in a very fabulous manner. Bottom line, see it because you're a fan and you HAVE to see everything ""Pride and Prejudice"" but if you're a TRUE fan embrace the 5 hours masterpiece by A&E."
"barryslisk-1","4","2","5","13 January 2006"," I'm quite put out!!!
","It's probably impossible to rate this version without comparing it to the 1995 BBC version, which is longer(you get to know the characters), better casted(way better) and more fun.<br/><br/>This version is so short that when you are used to the BBC version it just feels rushed and characters and balls have been completely cut out. Lydia is back home almost before she has run away (or so it feels).<br/><br/>The casting is not very good. The only one who matches the 1995 version is Mr. Collins. He is really good (although not as fun) in this one. He is very annoying which is his job :) Many of the lines are delivered in a very flat manor. For example ""Are the shades of Pemberly....blah blah"". She does not sound REALLY disgusted by the very thought. It's like the line is just read without any feeling behind it.<br/><br/>Miss Caroline Bingley is noway as sophisticated as when portrayed by Anna Chancellor. Mr. Bingley is almost too goofy but I have not read the novel, so I don't know if he is supposed to be so goofy.<br/><br/>Another thing is the music by Carl Davis which I really missed. In the 1995 version every important character had it's own tune which underlined the character and really helped with the flow of the movie(well episodes).<br/><br/>This new version is not wholly bad (hehe). Actually compared to many of the other BBC series like Middlemarch, Wives and daughters it is good. But compared to a masterpiece it fails utterly and completely.<br/><br/>4 stars!"

","Warning: If you're someone who enjoys Jane Austen in a literary way -- someone who knows about the manners and language of the time and who knows the specific language of Austen's books as well as you know the Beatitudes or the Lord's Prayer -- you will heartily dislike this adaptation. (What's with Mr. Bingley coming into the room where Jane is lying in bed? A gentleman like Mr. Bingley wouldn't be paying calls on a woman who was in bed.) If you're going to change the style, manners, and language of a story that much, you make ""West Side Story,"" not ""Romeo and Juliet Badly Done."" <br/><br/>The dresses were unflattering to Ms. Knightley -- she looked about the way Mary is usually depicted, with a washboard chest called attention to by an unflattering neckline. A Wonderbra would have done, well, wonders. And Mr. Bennet hardly even looked like a gentleman, much less a gentleman with a subtle sense of humor. Does he not have a man to shave him before he goes to the ball? <br/><br/>There were some good aspects, of course, most particularly the way everything wasn't all nicey-nice. Places that are often depicted rather too beautifully in other productions were depicted more realistically: crowded, not-quite-clean assemblies, women without makeup looking about the way a woman without makeup looks when she's been dancing strenuously for half an hour in a hot room. I thought the Bennets' home was a little too ""Martha Stewart Does Distressed Surfaces,"" though, and that one shade of blue on walls and woodwork kept screaming ""Look! The designer researched the typical home colors of the day and almost got it right."" <br/><br/>If, however, you're the kind of Austen fan who merely likes Austen-ish movies and you don't know her work as literature, well, go for it. It could be worse."

","Okay, I recognize that what follows is not so much a critique of this movie as it is a critique of this genre, and that as period costume dramas about the trials and tribulations of people who sit on windowsills staring pensively into the distance go, this one is decidedly above-average. Good costumes, some fine acting (especially from Donald Sutherland as the weary-eyed father), nice set design etc., etc.<br/><br/>But, what I can't help wondering is this: What, exactly, is the appeal of movies like this? Why are we supposed to care about the outcome? What are the stakes?<br/><br/>In all of Pride & Prejudice, we do not see a single person doing actual work, except perhaps for the men in white wigs whose job it is to pull out and push in the chairs so that the various noble diners do not have to be troubled with such annoyances. The parents of Elizabeth, Austen's purportedly feminist heroine, are the ""poor folks"" in the story, desperate to marry off their five daughters so that they are not left to a life of--what? Sitting around staring pensively out of small windows, rather than large ones?<br/><br/>At its core, Pride & Prejudice is supposedly the story of a headstrong young woman who refuses to bow to the demands and pressures of anyone, who speaks her mind despite societal pressures that insist she be silent and subservient. But in the end, what does Elizabeth do? (I suppose I should issue a spoiler warning here for anyone who hasn't read the book and/or seen one of the eleven-thousand film and television adaptations) She marries the man we all knew she was going to marry from the start, presumably to go off and live in his big house to sit on his big windowsill and--well, you can probably guess the rest. Here's a hint: it'll involve staring and being pensive.<br/><br/>I realize that as a young male I am not the target demographic of this movie and others like it. Yet I consider myself reasonably open-minded, both cinematically and otherwise. My idea of a good movie does not necessarily involve explosions and copious nudity, those these things never hurt.<br/><br/>No, what I can't abide by is a story about stiff people who speak stiffly, do very little and end up virtually where they started, with the only real question being what gown and corset combination they'll put on next. Much more effective, I think, would be a story about the working class during the era in which Austen focused her novels--the blacksmiths and the shoemakers and the farmers, those people who knew what it meant to get dirty and sweaty and bloody and speak their minds, and who were too busy living to stare pensively off into the distance."

","I recently 12-4 went to view this movie after a long anticipation. I was unfortunately let down a bit. I am a true Jane ""Austenite"" and love getting lost in the poetic language and turns of the phrase she is so famous for. Imagine my disappointment when I witnessed extreme rushing through the dialogue of most of the characters, particularly Kiera Knightly. If anyone reading this remembers the Television mini-series version starring Colin Firth (Darcy) Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle) Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) to name a few well trained British Actors, by comparison the feature length film version was far below adequate. This was of course Jane Austen's longest novel, which the TV world obviously knew would be best served in a miniseries. I am not sorry, however, that I purchased a ticket, but was a bit let down by the rushed manner that this movie used. If I had a choice, I would have waited for it to come on cable, and would purchase the DVD for my collection obsession only, but would probably not watch it endlessly as I do the Miniseries version and other Jane Austen Flicks. Emma remains my favorite, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion in that order. Pride and Prejudice is simply in a class by itself. ( the TV version of course)"
"sshoger","4","2","5","2 December 2005"," Rushed Cliff Notes
","On the whole I wasn't overly impressed. I will say that the soundtrack is fantastic and about a bagillion times better than my beloved A&E's soundtrack. Hands down. I like the ending much better (than A&E's); I liked their portrayal of Merriton much better; I think that Jane was actually prettier than Elizabeth in this one (sorry; I didn't particularly care for Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett); I liked the added dimension of Darcy & Bingley's friendship; Darcy's little sister, Georgiana, is actually a very good pianist in this one. But, bottom line, I felt like I was watching a rushed Cliff Notes. I felt like they assumed a lot. Plus there was barely time for character development. Jane & Lizzy are each other's confidants and best friends, but in this movie they barely tell each other things. Mrs. Bennett is written as an obnoxious character, always fussing about her ""poor nerves"", but the few mentions of her nerves in the movie seem pushed and unnatural. And I really didn't care for Keira Knightly as Lizzy, especially after her amazon-like role in King Arthur. I could go on and on, but I won't. I know that some people have loved the movie, not more than A&E, but thought that they truly did quite a good job, and I'm glad that they enjoyed it. But I'll stick with Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth."

","I am a big fan of the Colin Firth version of Pride & Prejudice. The shorter versions have been pretty disappointing, with exception of Bride & Prejudice (which was a charming musical version)and finally this newest film which has proved to be a wonderful rendition of the tale.<br/><br/>The story allowed for chemistry, an overall underlying sensuality, and a side of Darcy that was far more vulnerable than previously demonstrated. The way the various scenes were condensed together was done amazingly well. The cinematography was gorgeous.<br/><br/>The character of Lizzy was played very well. One of the changes that I was extremely happy about was that her character was more protective of Darcy in the end, rather than allowing her family to speak ill of him.<br/><br/>The final scenes were very romantic and packed with emotion and tenderness. It is truly a rare thing these days to have a good love story with a PG rating. About time.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that I can't wait to be released on DVD.

"alazose","7","2","5","16 November 2005"," A great movie, but rushed for time
","The problem is, we were spoiled by the excellent BBC version which in five hours time was able to follow the book rather closely. Thus, the dialogue in this new movie version feels very rushed and condensed, as though the script had been written for the Readers Digest. It just seems that in their hurry to get their lines in, the actors' elocution in many scenes is clipped, and thus difficult to understand. Aside from the two older sisters, the three younger sisters have little opportunity to distinguish themselves or to develop their characters. There simply isn't time. I kept waiting in vain for my favorite conversations and confrontations to take place. Most were there, but shortened almost beyond recognition.<br/><br/>Two other problems: The propensity of the Bennet family members to eavesdrop together on private conversations was extremely annoying. Also, the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was a bit misguided. He seemed, at 70, more like their grandfather than their father.<br/><br/>However, one of the many redeeming features of this movie (the beautiful locales being one of them) is the casting of Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. She was superb and radiant throughout. Her scene with Mr. Darcy at the end of the movie, where they meet by chance at dawn outside her home, has to rank as one of the most romantic scenes in cinematic history."

","As an avid Jane Austen fan, I was both excited and apprehensive at the thought of seeing this most recent film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. I was pleasantly surprised, however, at the accuracy with which much of the story was presented. The costumes, scenery and story were very well done and kept as close to the original as is possible in a film adaptation. My only disappointment was the way the ball at Netherfield was conducted. It seemed too loud and boisterous for such a civilized age and the dancing seemed far too simplistic. The intricacies of dance in that time period served to separate the aristocracy from the rest of society because they were the only ones able to spend time learning intricate dances. I believe that the dances shown were simple enough for anyone to learn, therefore I must question historical accuracy in this case. Overall the movie was a good representation of Jane Austen's work and was very enjoyable."
"Movieguy_blogs_com","8","2","5","15 November 2005"," Does your heart care what social class you are in?
","'Pride & Prejudice' is based on the famous novel by Jane Austen. Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet, one of five sisters living in Georgian England who are all trying to find a husband. It is difficult for the Bennet sisters, not being of noble birth, they find it hard to acquire suitable husbands. In fact, Elizabeth really is not looking at all. She is more concerned with finding happiness for herself and her sisters. But when true love comes to her doorstep, not only must she contend with her own feelings but also with a class struggle. Does your heart care what social class you are in? <br/><br/>This is a very good and humorous tale. Not only was the acting by the entire cast impressive but the use of language throughout the movie was very precise. Set in the late 1700s, everyone had to talk in manner appropriate for that period. Which was done very well and which impressed me the most."
"n-audenaert","8","2","5","15 November 2005"," Realistic
","Once I read in a comment: ""Nobody does Victorian like the Brits"" and I generally agree both in writing and movie-making. Here I was agreeably surprised though by the way they handled Jane Austin's book. I was especially struck by the realism of the costumes, make-up, surroundings and scenery. Most of the time you get the impression that everyone in these movies goes to bed with make-up on and freshly done perms. And what's worse, they get up the same way. Here you get a freshness that we are not used to in Victorian movies. <br/><br/>This may have a downside off course. Pride and Prejudice being a love story, everything being clean and beautiful adds to the beauty of that feeling. Fortunately here they managed to maintain the magic of the love story nonetheless. Both main characters Elisabeth and Darcy help us getting in this romantic mood. Whereas the music is the finishing tough as to this mood setting. <br/><br/>By making a novel into a movie one always looses aspects off course. The book being filled with information, you'll often get the feeling ""Hey, here they forgot something"". This movie was off course not able to be as complete as for example the 1995 mini series. All energy was put in the main characters Elisabeth and Darcy, whereas other characters are less present. All this does influence the explanation of 'Pride and Prejudice'. <br/><br/>But there's only one aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate: the way the Bingly character was portrayed. Bingly is supposed to be a good hearted, well educated, elegant young man worth of the love of the equally elegant and beautiful Jane. Here I get the feeling that Bingly is more of a simpleton then a good hearted guy.<br/><br/>Nonetheless this doesn't in any way ruin the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is very likely to get into my DVD-collection."

Keira K. and Matthew M. were both great as Lizzie Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The other characters were brilliant also, especially Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins! They really brought the humour to this film.

","Wow! I saw this film twice on the second day it was out! I though It was Extrordinary, as I am betting, did the rest of the theater ( which was full for the first and last show of the day) Being brought up on Jane Austen, and losing respect for corporations who make cheap films of her magnificent work, I was a little afraid that this would be the case. The movie definitely has been condensed, but what with a 6 hour mini series, you can understand why. It hit all the main points, and the casting, I must say, was beyond spectacular. The one item that made me question when I heard it was the fact that some of the characters say lines from the novel that don't belong to them. (For example, In the movie, Mary says,""What are men to rocks and mountains?"", when in the novel, Lizzy says that). Other than this, It was splendid. The music is also fabulous, and I encourage anyone to go and see it- Why, at the evening show I saw 6 teenage boys have a thoroughly entertaining experience, and they came on their own to the movie! Amazing! Jane Austen transforms the cynical unromantic and immature boy into a culturally aware man that will know how to treat their dating partner and eventually, wife. I can think of no greater service to mankind! <br/><br/>Have a great day, and go see Pride and Prejudice! It is worth every second one fears of wasting."

The Cinematography Makes me want to go to the UK. who ever did the scouting for the locations is a genius.

","I'm a huge fan of the mini-series since it aired on A&E 10 years ago. I had doubts about the movie version, first, how can any man redo Colin Firth's celebrated performance? And secondly, would Keira Knightly do justice to Eliza Bennet? And most importantly, how can you enjoy the film without comparing it to the mini-series!? Answer to the first question, is Matthew McFayden did a fantastic job, he's a great and passionate actor. Keira Knightly fit perfectly as Eliza Bennet (and believe me I had doubts), but her performance was outstanding. And lastly: the mini-series. For the first 20 minutes of the film, all I could do was compare every actor, every movement to the mini-series. But then I became so wrapped up with the sensuality of the film, something the A&E/BBC miniseries lacked. Granted, the A&E version is more true to the novel, it also has more room for intelligent banter and novel preservation because it's 5 hours long. Although what the mini-series did lack, was the PASSION! Which this movie exceeds. It is not just a great novel, but it's a love story which the film portrays beautifully. The passion in Eliza's heart and love for Mr. Darcy after realizing his goodness is something that is quite reserved in the mini-series.<br/><br/>The film made a great approach in making miniseries fans satisfied by being able to see the passionate and sensual side of Jane Austen and the story.<br/><br/>The director's choices were fantastic. We got to almost feel Eliza's character the part where we see the sunlight Eliza sees with her eyes closed. It was a great choice in trying to connect the audience almost anatomically with our protagonist.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of the mini-series, don't be stubborn - you will be pleasantly surprised to see a new side to our favorite Jane Austen couple.<br/><br/>FILM: 10/10 DIRECTING: 10/10 PERFORMANCES: 10/10 (although I wasn't really happy with the casting of the Binglys) WRITING: 9/10 ADVERTISING: 0/10 (Consider this movie poorly advertised, especially 2 months before Oscar announcements; shame shame shame)"
"leilapostgrad","8","2","5","12 November 2005"," Austin Movie Show review - the definitive love story
","Jane Austen's immortal love story is the template for every romantic comedy ever made. If Pride & Prejudice hadn't been written two hundred years ago, there would've been no Bridget Jones's Diary, no Love Actually, no My Big Fat Greek Wedding, certainly no Bridge & Prejudice, and maybe even no Wedding Crashers. Yes, it's the old story of boy meets girl, boy insults girl, girl hates boy, so boy falls madly in love with girl, and somehow girl's furious rage toward boy turns into passionate and everlasting love. But the only reason ""the old story"" even exists is because Jane Austen wrote it. Let's face it  neither Hugh Grant nor Colin Firth would have a career today if it weren't for this 19th century writer.<br/><br/>You know that the book's great, but you're reading this because you want to know how the Keira Knightly film version is. This Pride & Prejudice is fantastic! It may take place a couple centuries ago, but this movie is at its best when we see our chaotic and pathetic love lives reflected back to us. Mr. Darcy (played by the brooding but dreamy Matthew MacFadyen) is pompous, arrogant, and cruel when Lizzy Bennet (Knightly) first meets him at the ball. But as he gets to know her and falls in love with her, Mr. Darcy becomes more and more awkward, fumbling, and ridiculous towards Lizzy as the film progresses. And it's adorable! ""We are all fools in love."" The English countryside is breath taking, and the shots are stunning. Visually, the most impressive scene in entire movie is the ballroom scene that remains one continuous shot as it moves around the house, going from one character to the next, and one room to the next, but it's never broken. It's brilliant. Ultimately, if you love romantic comedies (and I do), then you will love Pride & Prejudice, as it is the definitive romantic comedy of them all."

The film was shot so beautifully, taking in all the scenery and architecture of the houses. Without needing to include kissing or sex Joe Wright has created such romance and atmosphere that I have never experienced in any other film before. I have read the book and it does explain about the troubles for women back then and also captures the love growing between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth. It creates the story from the book, but maybe not in as much detail, leaving lots of it out, but keeping the most important pieces focusing on the romance and marriage. It has been beautifully filmed and has a pure feeling about it.

And as I am not a huge keira knightley fan I went into the cinema expecting to be disappointed. however I wasn't. the girl did well. she played Lizzie brilliantly maybe not to the exact same effect as Jennifer but enough to be pleasing for general audiences. McFadden did alright. no one is going to top Mr firth but for a relatively unknown actor to step into such a role he did good. I felt he actually wanted Lizzie. Something that was slightly lacking in the 1995 edit. this film contained passion. During his confessional scene in the rain no less, there was a second where it looked like he might actually kiss her. all-round i felt they did there best with what little time they had.the supporting characters particularly Donald Sutherland were excellent. My biggest flaw with the whole film was the camera work. It felt like a TV movie. during the scene where Lizzie asks for her fathers permission the camera continued to zoom in and out on keira. it felt like a home movie. I would have also like to have seen a scene of Mr Darcy and Lizzie as the last scene in the film even if it as just through the window over Donald Sutherland shoulder. just to let us see them together. over i enjoyed it.

","This was one of the worst versions ever made, as it wasn't true to the book or times. In the book, Elizabeth was never a tomboy nor did she giggle excessively with Jane as if they were young schoolgirls. In truth, she was a refined, witty young lady who was out in society, with a good sense of decorum. Jane was a proper young lady also, who may not have had Elizabeth's wit, but was all goodness, with never a mean thing to say about anyone. <br/><br/>The worst part of the film is the depiction of their family home and father. Donald Sutherland is miscast as the father; he portrays the father as an addled country bumpkin, when the father is actually a witty gentleman who loves his family, but distances himself from them via his witty remarks.<br/><br/>The Bennets are not poor, slovenly people with pigs practically running around inside their home, as depicted in the movie; they have a position in society and, although not wealthy by any means, live in a comfortable, livestock-free home. <br/><br/>If this movie wasn't based on a famous book, I might have been able to enjoy it.

"spuna","2","3","10","14 May 2006"," The most infuriating film of my existence.
","If you watch this make sure there is nothing valuable near you, because you will have picked it up and thrown it before the half-hour marker. No exaggeration. For anyone who has ever even skim-read Pride and Prejudice this film will bedevil you like nothing else. For those who haven't, and were spurred to watch it by more than Knightley's pout or the piercing stare of Matthew Macfadyen, this film will confuse and deeply disappoint you. Especially considering it's baffling BAFTA nominations/awards.<br/><br/>I'll be constructive and start with its few redeeming features, which prevent me from giving it a resounding 1 out of 10. Judy Dench turns in an excellent performance as Lady Dalrymple, cold, reserved and ugly in a temper. Rosamund Pike is also good as the sweet, gentle Jane. The cinematography, though unnecessary and melodramatic, is stunning. For anyone who's read Jane Austen the sweeping landscapes will evoke her lines on the beauty of nature. Again if you haven't it's just pretty awesome. Despite an overall rather wooden performance Macfadyen does give Darcy moments of real tenderness and passion. Also Donald Sutherland's interpretation of Mr. Bennet was interesting, if different from my personal one.<br/><br/>Where to start with the bad...Knightley replaces all the archness and sweetness of Lizzy, the main character, with sarcasm and sultry looks. So much of the film is spent on close ups of Lizzy/Knightley thinking and crying that we never see the energy and liveliness of mind that Darcy is supposed to fall in love with. I give them kudos for the real on-screen chemistry but seeing as they never actually kiss and you don't even see them get married you finish the movie unsatisfied. It's a shame because it was a real chance for Knightley to show she could do more than 2D characters.<br/><br/>I could criticise the rest of the cast but the fact of the matter is that none of them have been given enough screen-time or the right lines to develop their characters in depth. Conversations are cut and rushed through. Pivotal characters such as Bingley, Wickham and Jane are pushed aside for less significant ones (Mr. Collins, Charlotte, Mary). There was not one single on-screen relationship, friendship or family-bond that was convincing or warm.<br/><br/>The plot is raced through, jumbled up and changed to make room for over-dramatic closeups on Knightley and a couple of fancy camera tricks. It must be incomprehensible for someone who's not familiar with the storyline.<br/><br/>It's impossible to watch it without comparing it to the BBC adaptation. No comparison. Even the costume and design is bland. I cannot believe the director won a Bafta. This was the most infuriating film of my existence. I want my 127 minutes back, please."

"boscastle-1","1","5","21","17 September 2006"," A total disappointment, nothing remotely resembling Jane Austen
","I had thought about writing a criticism detailing why this film of Jane Austen's delightful, satirical and penetrating observation of early English 19th cent. society was so disappointing and a total disaster but I find the job has been more than adequately done by seraph sister (UK) who wrote the first comment. I endorse EVERYTHING she wrote, including her strong recommendation to get, or see, the 10-year BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth which is a revelation of the art of dramatising a classic novel. One laments the fact that the dumbing down of the BBC these days has meant such intelligent adaptations are now virtually a thing of the past."
"anadessma","5","3","11","6 April 2007"," Ease and Fluency with Austenian English Greatly Compromised
","I did not see the 1995 miniseries, so I cannot compare Wright's version to it. It does, however, compare unfavorably with Robert Z. Leonard's 1940 ""Pride and Prejudice."" The problem is increasing unfamiliarity, even among British actors, with classic English prose. Throughout, Miss Knightley gives every unpleasant indication that she is struggling to enunciate properly. Given that she has eye-catching lips to begin with, the exaggerations of her mouth as she speaks, especially in the scene with D'Arcy in the rain, were quite alarming and kept distracting me with the image of an animated chimp mimicking a person talking. Knightley and occasionally Macfayden seem to be talking solely with the mouth and not first with heart and head. Compare this scene, which I believe is wholly invented as to setting, with the delightful and comfortable and elegant back and forth between Olivier and Garson in the parallel scene from 1940. The character in this movie who delivers her lines with fluency and confidence is Judi Dench, an actress of an older, pre""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" generation of British actressesa watershed work in British cinema, in my opinion. Even so, her performance is far too menacing. I much prefer Edna May Oliver's Lady Catherine (and she was an American!).<br/><br/>Which brings me to a related irritation. The satirical element, always the heart and soul of Austen's best work, is very nearly absent here (sarcasm and bitterness are not satire). This movie is an onerously serious love story; and that is not at all how I remember the novel. In the 1940 version, Mary Boland as Mrs. Bennett, Frieda Insescourt as Caroline Bingley, Ann Rutherford (a Canadian) as Lydia, Bruce Lester as Charles Bingley, and especially Melville Cooper as Mr. Collins each rendered his character more felicitously than their counterparts hereand in half the time too."

","Mathew McFadyen, ex spook, kept reminding me that this might be an MI5 production.<br/><br/>All the important elements were there. Acting was superb. Much thought has gone into the flawless script. The cinematography is dragged into the 21st century. Keira Knightly blooms as an English rose .. and 'Jane' is prettier ..<br/><br/>The settings are beautiful and rustic. One can see the nearness that poverty has to Bennet lives. The five daughters and no governess almost explaining the thoughtless self absorption of the mother.<br/><br/>For me, the only thing that jars is the feeling that a gang of Spooks may be on hand to drag Wickham away ..<br/><br/>The cinematic aspects that are modernised are the fades and visual segways. On occasion a character might be introduced with the sun behind them .. maintaining ambiguity for a short time. Some of the fades make the scenes appear like old photo images .. and the countryside is achingly beautiful.<br/><br/>Knightly's hair looks dirty. The strength of this version lies in inflating the female interplay beyond A&E's, yet maintaining balance. One can see that the long suffering father loves the mother, although he endures her pettiness. His quips are not threats. The mother's pettiness is softened by his love and the forgiveness of Elizabeth who accepts her mother and respects her despite the shortcomings."

He was more likable than the other Darcy from the start. The pace was a lot faster than the miniseries for obvious reasons. Some aspects of it I absolutely loved. I liked that the difference between the poor and rich was played up so much. I loved the new Mr Bingley Character. I loved the fathers character. Yes it was very different but it was good for most part of it. If you go to see it then expect that this is another interpretation of the film. Keira is good but can be a little irritating at times (her spiteful and happy expression is the same) but if I had never ever seen the ABC miniseries. I would now have the ultimate favourite movie. I intend to see it again."

"mad_cur","1","2","6","7 April 2017"," Since I saw the BBC adaptation of pride & prejudice I tried to watch the movie with an open mind. However the movie failed miserably.
","To make a movie out of the well known book of Jane Austen would always be difficult. The adaptation of the book (the script) was badly done. Scenes had been altered which were highly improbable in those circles. For example: Mrs the Bourgh would never enter a home during the middle of the night to demand an explanation. Hollywood has lost their senses if they think they can alter the way people behaved in those circles in those times. The reason Jane Austen books are so famous is her detailed description of the behaviour of her characters in England during those times. To change all those things is (in my eyes) very wrong. The first scene of the ball looked like an American Saloon scene. I was horrified. <br/><br/>The director hired some very well known actors and actresses, but most of the acting was done terribly. I got a stomach ache when I saw the scene of Elizabeth with Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) looked like a dwarf and Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) like a giant. What the reason was for the film maker to shoot this scene this way I will never understand. <br/><br/>Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden) was like a cartoon character. Matthew Macfayden played his role very badly and was never convincing. The only time he played well was during the rain scene when he got in a screaming match with Elizabeth. This scene was also a script adaptation I wasn't very keen on. I know Matthew Macfayden can act. In Ripper Street he did a great job. Here he was misplaced or maybe he felt the pain of the mishandling of the book by the script writer. He looked like he was bored during all his scenes. I can write the same lines about Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet). Donald either didn't believe the script or was very ill or drunk. His acting was abominable.<br/><br/>That this movie got an Oscar nomination is beyond me. If I could have given this movie zero stars or better negative stars I would have done so. I would advise all the people who found this movie so great to watch the BBC adaptation of the book (1995) and then I want to know if they still think this movie was great."
"tirkkanen","7","2","6","2 January 2009"," A rushed effort on the Jane Austen classic
","I write this review after I just finished watching the film. I must say that I compared this film constantly to the miniseries from 1995. It is clear that one cannot get the depth into the characters in such a short time of only two hours. So it's a bit hard to say anything really about the film that is fair in comparison to the miniseries. What I can say is this. <br/><br/>I love Keira Knightley, she is pure joy to watch, such vivid and lively young woman. Her performance grew on me as the film moved on and in the end she did a good job. The other actors had so little time on screen that I won't criticize them for they weren't given the chance to shine. Only Mr. Darcy's performance left me a little disappointed, as he is the other leading actor. The overall feeling of the film was that it was rushed. An attempt was made to pace the film to make time to digest the characters and the plot. Although the scenery was breathtaking at times, those short attempts to let the viewer ponder on the film in peace did not accomplish their purpose. The film did improve a little towards the end but it could have been a lot better. <br/><br/>As I've read the book and seen the 6 part miniseries, which by the way is highly recommended and includes Oscar worthy performances by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, this film is a mere top of the pyramid. A million little nuances and witty dialog and subtle emotions are lost with the haste of the limitation of the two hours runtime. It is a good film yes, but not as good as it could have been."

","Since I am not a member of the gentler sex nor do I particularly care for Ms. Knightley I wasn't exactly psyched to watch this film. So, imagine my surprise when I ended up enjoying it in spite of myself.<br/><br/>The cast is of high caliber with special mention going to Donald Sutherland and, especially, Judi Dench. Keira Knightley was never better (not that I thought that she was ever worth watching before). I hate to single out individuals, though, because there is not a single actor/actress who seemed out of place.<br/><br/>Visually the film is quite attractive. The director doesn't often get creative but when he does it is always interesting and never detracts from the story & characters. I also admire the use of music throughout (both in the score and when played by various characters).<br/><br/>I have not read the novel upon which the film is based so I cannot comment on the accuracy of the adaptation. The storyline as presented here is compelling, though. No doubt females will be the most appreciative audience but those males with a touch of the inner romanticist may be similarly swayed."
"hannah8700-1","10","2","6","22 January 2008"," A Timeless Classic
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Jane Austen's renowned romance she penned centuries ago comes to life in this modern day film of ""Pride and Prejudice."" Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are two of the most complex, yet beloved characters of our time. Director Joe Wright did an outstanding job capturing each romantic moment shared between them, from the very beginning when Darcy first notices Elizabeth in the crowd and every moment after. Even the smallest display of affection was captured beautifully, like the part where Darcy first touches Elizabeth and helps her into the carriage. Although it was only for a moment you could tell how they were both changed from that moment on. Matthew McFadyen is truly amazing and is exactly what Austen's ""Mr. Darcy"" should be- tall, rugged, and handsome and a shyness about him that draws you to his character. My favorite part of the entire movie is near the last scene where Darcy is walking toward Elizabeth. There's just something about him in that scene and so many others that tugs on your heartstrings because you can see how much he loves her, and at the same time how afraid he is that she won't love him in return. I can't even explain it really. It gives me goose bumps every time! Keira Knightly's performance was outstanding as well. She has a simple yet elegant sense of beauty and a confidence that makes her great in every role she takes on. The role of Elizabeth Bennet is no easy task. She is strong-willed and prideful, yet gentle and compassionate all at the same time. Keira Kngihtly was the perfect ""Elizabeth."" If you have not gotten the chance to see this new version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I highly recommend that you do. It is the best yet! I will always love this movie!"
"dead47548","10","2","6","8 January 2008"," Easily one of my all time favorites.
","Unarguably the finest love story of all time. The themes and characters in the film are all beautiful and timeless. Joe Wright manages to capture every flawless element of the novel, while making it massively entertaining and creating the best cinematography I've seen in a long while. The gorgeous landscapes mixed with the pouring rain and the entrancing score create an utterly joyous experience throughout. A seamless blend of side-splitting humor, gut-wrenching drama and the most passionate and beautiful romance ever brought to screen. Performance wise the film is just as flawless as the storytelling. Knightley more than deserved her Oscar-nomination, and a win in my books, but the phenomenal work in the acting field doesn't stop there. Everyone from Rosamund Pike to Donald Sutherland and back to Matthew Macfadyen deliver nothing but praise-worthy brilliance. The finale is one of the most joyous, wonderful and simply pleasing experiences of my lifetime. An utter joy to watch, and very high among the best of the decade so far. The best of it's year, undoubtedly."
"Sarah-Smith74","8","2","6","1 September 2007"," interesting interpretation of Austen Classic
","This is a rather good adaptation of the classic regency novel, with a beautiful soundtrack, stunning scenery and wonderful costumes. Keira Knighley is surprisingly good as Lizzy Bennet, ( I found her unbelievably irritating in the Pirates of the Caribbean films), much more suited in looks, age and manner to the character than Jennifer Ehle in the BBC version. The actor playing Darcy brings the right amount of reserve, arrogance and sexiness to the role, while Tom Hollander is wonderful as Mr Collins. I also enjoyed the rustic and natural appearance of the Bennet home and gardens. Some aspects of the book have been changed but mostly it is a very faithful adaptation. My only criticism is the representation of Goergiana Darcy, very shy and reserved in the book and scarred after her experience with Wicham, in this she is too bouncy and giggly, like another younger Bennett sister. Also, avoid watching the American ending, which is a special feature on the UK DVD version. So glad its only an extra and not our ending, I pity US viewers."
"edwagreen","5","2","6","20 January 2007"," Pride and Prejudice-Pardon My Bias **
","Jane Austen's novel continues to be a bore when it's transferred to the screen. Despite the great 1940 cast of Greer Garson and Edna Mae Oliver, the film didn't exactly catch fire and the same is true for this 2005 remake.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is a highly intelligent girl. Her parents are played well by Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn. The latter should be used if ever they make the life-story of Sara Allgood. She is in fine form as the doting mother who wants to see her daughters married off into wealth and happiness. Allgood? She ought to be the Irish answer to the Jewish mother.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is beautiful and gives a restrained Oscar nominated performance as the eldest daughter. She meets up with Mr. Darcy, a brooding character, who is both angry and frustrated with life in general. His nature is to almost cause misery for the family until things are straightened out by explanation and he emerges as not such a bad Joe after all.<br/><br/>In her brief role as Darcy'd aunt, Dame Judi Dench nearly steals the picture with her vicious performance as a wealthy dowager, who looks down on the family and tries to prevent Elizabeth marrying Darcy. Dench has made quite a success in brief screen performances as she did in her supporting Oscar win for ""Shakespeare in Love.""<br/><br/>The cinematography and set decorations are elegant and quite in order for the period of history they represent.<br/><br/>The problem here is with the writing. We can't see all at once why Darcy is such a brooding character. His emergence as a person is also not adequately explained."
"MUSICMANIA007","10","2","6","19 December 2006"," I love Keira Knightly from this movie. I loved her before but now I love her even more. Read this for my summary of the movie.
","If your a sucker for love stories which I tend to be, this is the movie to see! If you like Keira Knightly this is also the movie to see! Her character, Elizabeth, is strong willed, smart, stubborn, cool, fun(she loves to laugh as do the rest of her family) and what I like best, witty. At one point she asks this guy Mr. Darcy, if he likes to dance and he immediately says no. She gets put off by that and later when having a conversation with Mr. Darcy about the fact that poetry is what destroys love he asks her what she considers to help if poetry doesn't and she replies ""Dancing, only if one's partner is barely tolerable!"". That is what I call witty. But you have to see the movie to get the full picture. Keira Knightly does so well with this role. She is part of the Bennet family which include 4 sisters, one who is older, Jane(beautiful and sort of modest) and three others, Lydia(wild and flirty), Kitty (who follows Lydia), Mary (not as out there as the rest) who are just in their teens but are out in society as much as her and Jane. Then of course there's the head of the house Mr. Bennet and his wife Mrs. Bennet who is always trying get her daughters married off and taken care of because in those days women don't have there own jobs so they have to have a husband to care for them. <br/><br/>So lucky for the Bennets, in comes the wealthy Mr. Bingley to town. He comes along with his sister and more wealthy friend Mr. Darcy. Everything unfolds from the time Jane and all meet Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy you could describe as proud and stubborn. At one point, Elizabeth over hears Mr. Darcy tell Mr. Bingley, who likes Jane and might also consider Elizabeth, that Elizabeth is not pretty at all and that Jane is the most beautiful around. Of course Elizabeth gets hurt by that comment but Mr. Darcy had other reasons for saying such things I would say. And so you find out why he said it. You'll find out that love can come from where you least expect it. You may be afraid to admit you love someone but you find it is amazing just as I would say this movie is. It's now one of my favorites and I've seen it at least 5 times and I would gladly see it again. It'a great English movie and you'll love it from beginning to end. The actors do a great job. It's also has great piano playing I would say and it makes me want to buy the soundtrack."
"Bigbang","8","2","6","13 December 2006"," The Keira Knightley Show
","Keira Knightley carries this movie with an outstanding performance as Elizabeth Bennet. A great accomplishment considering her very young age and the historical weight of this role; she doesn't flinch. She shows range and maturity way beyond her years and has a great future as I consider her one of the best actresses working today. Hopefully she doesn't get involved with the Hollywood partying nonsense (Lindsay Lohan etc.) and continues to take challenging roles.<br/><br/>It took me at least 20 minutes or so to get used to this movie, there was a lot of giggling going on by the girls in the beginning that was a little off putting and it was hard to follow what was going on as I had no exposure to Pride and Prejudice in any form beforehand. So much of Austen's novel was crammed into 2 hours that for noobs like me it may be hard to decipher the nuances of who's marrying who and why. Actually, when I watched this a second time I enjoyed it a lot more.<br/><br/>After seeing this I watched some of the 6 hour miniseries but I like this version better. The acting and dialogue here was more natural and the cinematography was superior. Not to say the mini isn't good, it's just very different. I prefer this version.<br/><br/>All the other actors involved are excellent, including Rosamund Pike as Jane Bennet, Donald Sutherland as the father, and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, although his performance while very good may have been a tad bit understated.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright should be commended for generating considerable tension from what is really a simple story, **spoilers ahead** even though you know that Elizabeth and Darcy are going to eventually get together. And when they do, it such a relief! <br/><br/>In closing I have to mention again how great Keira Knightley is in this movie, and I can't believe others would call her performance ""awful"". That's just silly come on. She steals every scene she's in, and she's in every scene!"
"driveshaft1fan","7","2","6","6 July 2006"," Breathtaking
","When I rented Pride and Prejudice, I was a bit prejudice myself. I was never big on Jane Austen, but a respectable fan of Knightley, and the movie was simply beautiful. It was like diving into a picture book about a straitlaced culture with balls, social rules, pressures and peaks. This movie really highlights the demeaning role women played, burdens until marriage, and how cutthroat the race was to find the perfect man. Keira nails Elizabeth Bennet, the headstrong defiant girl who is not about to take the first man who asks (and there is a cute scene of her turning down a very awkward proposal), and the twist of how she, and not Darcy, is the proud, prejudice one.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more soundtrack in it, and at many parts of the movie is was virtually impossible to hear the dialog (scenes on the downtown streets), so I'd recommend subtitles, especially for those of us not well acquainted with the English accents. But, the movie was artistically done, shots of elegant houses and quaint gardens, sittings out in the pretty yards or walks through bustling streets. And I love the dancing scenes--couldn't't stop laughing every time Elizabeth and Darcy attempted to talk to each other while dancing (foxtrotting?) across the room. It's a magnificent movie, and even though the plot is very simple, it is definitely a film to rent and enjoy."
"kitty757_1","10","2","6","14 April 2006"," Watch this movie with friends--- if you like it, let it be one of your forever favourites. If you don't, laugh about it with your friends, and move on to better things.
","Pride and Prejudice... I started to read the book in the 7th grade (2 years ago) but never got to finish it (the school year ended, so unfortunately I couldn't read it, and I'm not close enough to a library to sign it out). So I admit, I did miss some of it although I finished three quarters of the wonderful story. As for the TV series, I saw part of one, but actually decided to change the channel because it was at the end of the whole series and I wanted to watch it at the start instead.<br/><br/>If you never read the book, and you never saw the series, you'll love this movie because it is a touching tale of love, and... of course, misunderstanding. Its a sweet tale, really.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was great. Because I haven't read the entire book, and because it has been so long admittedly since I read it, I found the story wonderful and at times heart wrenching. Those who faithfully read the book, and remember it well, may very well disagree with me, and the reviews that are a little less... kind... should show you that. However, the tale itself is great, and if you are someone who doesn't enjoy reading long books, and likes more modern movies, that aren't five hours long, and you love love stories, then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>The people who worked on this entire production firstly had to cram a fair sized book into 2 hours, a little over. It had to try and keep up the old fashioned setting, get actors that seemed compatible or not compatible, and direct it. A lot of you blame the actors in the movie, but a movie is only as good as its director, as good as its screenwriter. Actors alone can't pull anything off and personally I think given the script these actors had, it was done excellent. True, Mr Darcy didn't seem quite as proud, just more stubborn and... a tad... awkward, a lone-wolf type. And granted, Elizabeth seemed to like him at least a little from the start. Forgetting entirely what this movie was based on, you must love it, and I think its well worth watching at least once. It pulls off the old-fashioned setting, perhaps not exactly historically accurate, but lets face facts, few people watching this movie will notice that. This movie is not meant for adults alone--- otherwise, it would have been R-rated, but it was not. And that means it can't just tend to the likings of adults.<br/><br/>Give the movie a chance--- watch it with friends, and if you like it, let it be one of your favourites. If you don't like it, forget about it, make sure to have a funny movie with you and just enjoy that. Its fine to have an opinion--- its only when it gets dragged on, endlessly, that it becomes a little bit silly. Not everyone has the same opinion, some people such as myself loved the movie, others disliked it greatly--- but we're all bound to have different opinions and need to respect that fact."

","Having long been a fan of the 1995 BBC version...and Colin Firth in particular, I was determined to view this movie on its own merits rather than spend my time comparing. It is useless to compare a mini-series with a movie, just as it is futile to compare a movie to a book. This version brought a different emphasis, it focused on the relationship between Lizzie and Darcy, the other relationships being secondary. The realism was terrific, showing by the state of the Bennet's home the financial difficulties Mr Bennet laboured under (which was shown as a scene in the BBC version but to my eyes was belied by the cleanliness and apparent prosperity of the BBC Bennet household). As one other writer commented, the scene with the pig was fabulous! Much criticism has been leveled at Matthew MacFadyen's portrayal of Darcy...I liked his Darcy better than Colin Firth's (I know, boo hiss!). I felt MacFadyen's Darcy was a man you could relate to on some level, especially towards the end of the movie. No kiss, someone cried...not coyness but rather credibility for the time. We have become so used to unbridled passion being played out on the screen that we find it hard to believe that people could fall in love and agree to marry without ever having kissed, let alone jumped into bed together. But it did happen then and, strange as it may seem, still happens today. Love and attraction were portrayed very circumspectly for decades on the screen, and we accepted that. Perhaps we just need to use our imaginations more! Besides, I don't think I'd be averse from seeing the man I love walking out from the mist to find me. Yes, Keira Knightly is too beautiful to play Lizzie, but then Greer Garson was not even the right hair colour but that did not detract from the joy of that version (of which I have a copy and which has been watched many times over). Jane Austen wrote her stories in the years before films and TV were even thought of. She wrote to caricature the social foibles of her day. Film and TV are just another medium for allowing us to enjoy her insights into human nature. As long as people love her stories there will be re-tellings of them...and probably at least one more version of this beloved story in my lifetime (at least hope so!)"

","""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" Everyone knows this notorious line as the beginning sentence for Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The beloved novel about Elizabeth Bennet falling in love with the man she had sworn to hate, has captivated readers for over 200 years through its classic themes of love, humor, and early 19th century English culture. Many have tried to capture the story's magnificence through film. From 1938 to 1996, there has been over ten movies and television shows based on the novel. There has even been parodies of the story such as ""Bride and Prejudice"" and ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" Nevertheless, the 2005 movie, featuring Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfardin, is by far the best film version of the novel that perfectly transports from paper to television the wit and emotions of the characters and the beauty of the setting. <br/><br/>Jane Austen has written many novels about women, love, and domestic life in England during the turn of the 19th century. Pride and Prejudice is particularly one of her best works. The story follows the ladies of Longbourn estate, namely the second oldest of the five daughters, Elizabeth Bennet. She learns the wrongness of hasty judgment when she meets the incredibly wealthy and seemingly ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. Jane Austen is able to depict the fawning and flattering of a neighborhood full of young eligible women when a man from an affluent society comes to town during the British regency. Such an iconic novel has left Hollywood trying copy the story's delight. Only Joe Wright, director of 2005 Pride and Prejudice, was able to bring the novel justice.<br/><br/>One reason the the film is so superb is the characters. The movie was cast to such perfection that I thought characters jumped right out of the book and onto the big screen. The stubbornness, poise, gracefulness, intelligence, and beauty of Elizabeth Bennet is flawlessly personified in leading actress Kiera Knightly. The arrogance, egotism, and kindness of Mr. Darcy is wholly seen in leading actor Matthew Macfardin. The silliness, chaos, and affection of the Bennet family- Rosamund Pink as Jane, Cary Mulligan as Kitty, Talulah Riley as Mary, Jena Malone and Lydia, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, and Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet- is achieved to such perfection that the movie scenes that take place in Longbourn Estate, the Bennet's house property, will make you cry and laugh out loud. Even the performance of Tom Hollander makes you want to cringe as his character Mr. Collins, the awkward and silly cousin of the Bennets, proposes to Elizabeth. Without such a cast, the movie would be just another Hollywood producer t<br/><br/>In addition to the cast, the music perfectly sets the peaceful and calm mood of early 19th century English countryside, and it embellishes the ever-changing emotions of the characters. The soundtrack is an arrangement of classical piano and orchestra music, composed by Dario Marianelli. The movie starts off with Elizabeth Bennet walking and reading in an empty field while a piano piece by Andrew Lapp, titled ""Dawn,"" plays in the background. This opening scene immediately captivates the audience. Due to the music, the watcher is immediately set in the beauty and serenity of the English countryside and in the peaceful thoughts of the protagonist, Ms. Elizabeth Bennet. The music has also enhanced other powerful scenes in the movie, including Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth's dance and field scene, in which the two admit their feelings for one another. Marianelli's work for the film has even gotten him an Oscar nomination for ""Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures"" and two World Soundtrack Academy nominations for the film. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the filming is by far the best part of the movie. When reading a novel, the author is able to explain and clarify the thoughts and feelings of the characters. However, on film the director does not have the luxury of doing so. Despite this, Wright flawlessly rendered Austen's writing. His vision and creativity has made it both clear and mysterious to the audience the thoughts and emotion of the characters at moments where others have made it ambiguous. For instance, during the scene in which Darcy and Elizabeth dance together at the second ball, the scene suddenly changed from the two dancing together in a crowd of people to the two dancing together in an empty ballroom, showing how they are focused only on each other despite the multitude of people around them. I am particularly fond of the way Wright showed the passage of time: Elizabeth spinning on a swing watching the seasons go by. Such originality and artistry has made this film the best version of Pride and Prejudice. <br/><br/>Even though you can choose to watch many different film versions of the novel Pride and Prejudice, I recommend the StudioCanal 2005 film featuring Kiera Knightly. Unlike the others, it has been nominated for 34 awards, and has won six: Boston Society of Film Critics for 'Best New Filmmaker', British Academy Film Awards for 'Most promising Newcomer', Empire Awards for 'Best British Film' and Best Newcomer', London Film Critics' Circle for 'British Director of the Year' and ""British supporting actor of the year"". Many say the book is better than the movie. However after watching this magnificent version of Pride and Prejudice, one would argue the movie is better than the book."
"charleswoods-80397","7","1","2","25 September 2017"," Greatly Entertaining, but diverges from book and time period.
","This is one of my favorite movies ever. I may be biased because I'm a sucker for romance and have not yet read the book, but this movie was done well. The soundtrack fits what is going on in the film and you can definitely tell what songs go with what characters. The sound track also helps connect the parallels throughout it's entirety. They really give some interesting perspective. I have watched this movie many times and each time I notice something new. For instance all of the little scenes between Darcy and Elizabeth that hint that they are attracted to each other without being super blatant. I love the portrayal of love and hate between the two as well. There is also something that goes unsaid in the movie that I noticed. The scene where Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle are visiting Darcy's house and Elizabeth stares at this marble statue that is veiled women, I believe that she really relates to it and is captivated. Then she sees Darcy's marble bust and realizes that he is kept to the impossible standards that she is. There are many scenes like this in the movie that I just adore. The director really used the full range of movie making tools for this movie. There is a scene where the lighting is just excellently used. Elisabeth has just had this big fight with Darcy and denied his proposal and she is staring at a mirror and the light changes through the scene implying a time change but also a lot of thought and reflection. Then Darcy comes in and leaves her a letter and there is a voice over of him reading the letter. The lighting really showed her thinking about it and her opinion changing of him. I know that this movie greatly diverges from the book, but the movie aspects of it were done right. It might not have been historically accurate or exactly like the book in every which way, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. It's a well done film, just different from the source material, like all other film adaptations of books."

"mlgayler69","6","1","2","8 August 2017"," Enjoyable but needed better direction
","The performances are good, although tamer than the BBC version, and I was pleasantly surprised by Keira Knightley, who managed not to leave her mouth hanging open too often. Matthew Macfadyen is a good combination of reserved hauteur and feeling, and Donald Sutherland does his best with poor direction - Mr Bennett should not spend his days roaming the farm and chasing round the garden after his family! Either the director did not understand the character or just ignored it, which is a shame. Mrs Bennett is a much more believable age and silly rather than monstrous.<br/><br/>The direction in places is so random you wonder whether the director actually had any real plan before he started! Several scenes start off in one direction then change tack half way. When Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle visit Pemberley the scene begins with them being taken round by the housekeeper - then Elizabeth wanders off so the focus can change to her spying on Darcy and his sister; aunt, uncle and housekeeper are forgotten and presumably have forgotten her.The director was obviously determined to get in a reminder that she loves walking, so off she goes back to the inn - are we seriously supposed to believe the housekeeper forgot about a visitor and her aunt and uncle abandoned her to make her own way back? <br/><br/>Other changes in the film jar - Mr Collins interrupts breakfast to ask for a meeting with Elizabeth; not only highly unlikely, but unnecessary - the book says he finds them alone 'soon after breakfast'; Elizabeth would never be out in public with her hair falling over her shoulders as though she has just got up, Caroline Bingley wears a sleeveless 1799 style dress to the ball when every other character is dressed c 1805- 10. These are disappointing because they suggest a lack of interest in the details of the society the film is trying to portray. Other changes undermine the characters' development: Elizabeth's vital line 'had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner' is left out completely, and the letter scene which is a crucial turning point for Elizabeth is so rushed the significance is lost. Lady Catherine turns up during the night for no good reason, which makes her line 'I see you have a small kind of garden' completely random and meaningless - the next scene has to be done inside instead of the shrubbery! <br/><br/>It was nice to see scenes and characters that were left out of the BBC version, but again too often time is wasted on lingering shots of unimportant details while important characters and events are skated over, giving the impression the director didn't really have a grip on the overall arc of the story and hoped that long shots of characters staring into the distance would give meaning.<br/><br/>Criticisms aside, this is enjoyable to watch and the script is true enough to the book to convey the characters well. I was just left feeling that with a bit more care and forethought this could have been brilliant."
"jlohman20","10","1","2","6 June 2017"," Fantastic
","this is the first time I've written a review on here, and this is one of the few movies that made it impossible to resist. The only reason this isn't a ten in my book is because I don't believe in perfect movies and thus 10/10 is reserved for my favorite movies only. <br/><br/>I wrote this because I can agree with those that say that this had one of the greatest endings of all time. I'm not going to lie, I did not like Darcy a lot at the beginning. Though I liked him better than Collins and Wickham, he still seemed too cold. Gotta say, he has some of the best development I've seen in a character on the big screen. When all he did is revealed to the audience, I truly thought he hit rock bottom after Lizzie leaves him in the rain and that there was no way back for him in my eyes. <br/><br/>The last 30-45 minutes or so were absolutely amazing. Darcy literally does everything for Lizzie. The last ten minutes, I was actually cheering and jumping around in my room. Such a good movie and Mr. Darcy has to be one of my favorite characters I've seen in a movie."

Romantic costume dramas are what we would call a gift film for that significant other who drove an hour to the theater with you to see the limited run of the new Godzilla film. So imagine my pleasant surprise when the picture itself was not just bearable but one of the best films I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I saw Pride and Prejudice and Zombies before this flick so I was able to follow along with the story. The costumes, sets, cinematography, and acting are all simply spot on. There is no reason to make any more versions of Pride and Prejudice they have hit perfection. <br/><br/>Really not much more to say. I teared up a bit at the end when the poor girl with only a few servants marries the rich man with dozens of servants saving her from a life of living in a house with only one parlor for fainting. <br/><br/>Anywho.

There are at least a half dozen scenes that should be taught at every film school as they are nothing short of magic. Keira Knightly, Rosamund Pike, Matthew Macfadyen, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, Judy Dench and many others are all perfectly cast.

"cwg2005a","10","1","2","14 November 2016"," An Exquisite Delight
","This is the rare 18th -19th century English romance which does not pervert the story to the slow, unendurable long shots of empty countryside. Indeed, every shot in this film serves the narrative and furthers either story or character. <br/><br/>As others have noted, the acting is flawless; nobody here ""over- acts"" the drama to impale the viewer on the twists, turns, and meanings. Donald Sutherland especially is a subtle delight as the father of five unmarried woman and the husband of one coarse driven wife. The role of Darcy has not been, I believe, so well nuanced and delivered -- one will see him in a fresh light after this film.<br/><br/>I need to comment on the photography and camera-work: especially in the final shot of the ballroom, there is a VERY long single take (apparently intended as a master shot to be used for establishing and group takes) which is really nicely done - through doorways, over and around dancers and partiers. But I mention that just to state that the camera angles and movements never intrude, this is not B Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge;"" they simply are meticulously planned and executed.<br/><br/>I have one rankle: the color timing (at least on my recent DVD) is very oddly set. Colors are very bright, looking a bit like a ""paint by numbers"" set. It is reminiscent of Turner Televisions's coloring of old black-and-white movies (I believe Turner has dropped that odious idea).<br/><br/>Yes, I cried with huge smiles at the end. So will you, don't pretend you won't !<br/><br/>Upshot: Wonderful film rendition of a well-loved book."
"Artless_Dodger","9","1","2","19 September 2016"," Keira Knightley lights up the screen.
","Keira Knightley lights up the screen in a beautiful adaptation of Jane Austen's much loved novel. It's a film full of wonderful scenes, many of which live in the memory due to Knightley's peerless radiance. She has never looked more perfect, and Joe Wright focuses his lens with great aplomb on his heroine, allowing her to take centre stage.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen plays Darcy, in a role perhaps slightly underwritten, and as the film progresses, he shows us something of Darcy's awkwardness. However, this retelling is more interested in Elizabeth Bennet (Knightley) than it is in Darcy, and Macfayden has to make the most of the lines given to him. <br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn impresses as Mrs Bennet, as does Donald Sutherland as her spouse. Both are superb. Simon Woods (Mr Bingley) does well too, and his romance with Jane (a lovely Rosamund Pike) is beautifully portrayed. Judi Dench is suitably imperious as Lady Catherine de Bourg. Tom Hollander, as the ridiculous Collins, gives a wonderfully sycophantic performance. <br/><br/>Beautiful scene follows beautiful scene - the rumbustious public ball, Lizzie realising that Darcy has helped her onto a carriage, the sophisticated private ball with Darcy and Lizzie's dance, the single camera shot taking in so many guests and happenings, Collins' proposal to the unsuspecting heroine, Lizzie on a swing watching the seasons pass, Darcy's proposal (beautifully catching the conflicting emotions), Lizzie receiving Darcy's letter, the sunlight playing on Lizzie's face as she journey's north, Lizzie atop a rocky outcrop, Lizzie seeing Pemberley for the first time, Lizzie walking among the statues, then peering around a door frame to see Darcy and his sister, Lizzie explaining a letter she's just received, the Bennet family panicking when Bingley and Darcy pay an unexpected visit, Lizzie admitting a little of her feelings to Jane, Bingley's proposal, and Darcy and Lizzie finding each other as the sun rises. Almost every moment is beautifully constructed and photographed, and at the centre of it all is Keira Knightley giving what, to date, is her career defining performance as the luminous, intelligent, and witty heroine.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful film. Almost perfect."
"heidimarievdv","6","1","2","19 July 2015"," Worth a watch
","This version of the classic novel was quickly panned by avid fans of Jane Austen, who seem to have forgotten that producers had two hours to accomplish what others had full miniseries to do, and that Hollywood needs to appeal to a much broader audience. To that end, I think the necessary liberties taken with the plot are appropriately managed. We do lose some of the more fun points of the novel, such as Elizabeth's relationship with her father, her relationship with Charlotte (who is admirably cast) and Elizabeth's embarrassment at her musical abilities (or lack thereof), in contrast with Mary's. <br/><br/>The tone of this movie is what stands out, with peaceful classical piano music playing throughout. Beautiful period costumes enhance the color scheme of the excellent landscape and cinematography. The cast was overall well selected and their character interpretations, if unconventional in some cases, are allowable- with the exception of Darcy, but we'll get to him in a minute. <br/><br/>What is less forgivable is the complete absence of contemporary etiquette, which is so prominent in Austin's novels and intended to play a central role in the plot of this one. The setting of the movie would be more believable as colonial America rather than regency England, with the first assembly where the girls meet Mr. Bingley closely resembling a country barn dance. With the exception of Jane, the Bennet females run around the entire movie with their hair flying all over the place. Mrs. Bennet and Elizabeth at least attempt conventional buns, which are consistently furnished with 1997-esque fly aways. Kitty and Lydia wear their hair down and completely undressed for the entire movie- totally inappropriate for young women who are out in society and attending sophisticated functions. Throughout the movie, the Bennet sisters can be seen sitting on the floor, leaving the house haphazardly bonneted, intermittently jumping, giggling, spinning, and being completely inattentive to anything resembling posture or poise. No wonder the Bingleys were horrified by them. That the Bennets have a farm is established by Austen. ""'The horses cannot be spared, they are wanted on the farm, are they not Mr Bennett?' 'They are wanted more often than I can get them.'"" So the Bennets have a farm; what is not clear in the movie is why they don't have proper pens for their animals. The chickens are running around all over the front yard so that guests are tripping over them as they try to get to the door, and the pigs for some reason have taken up residence in the house proper. There are also a number of barking, rambunctious dogs that add to the domestic chaos, in addition to a strange lack of any type of servant. The most shocking breach of etiquette comes when Lady Catherine de Burgh makes her unannounced visit to confront Elizabeth about her suspected engagement to Darcy. For some reason, in this movie, this visit takes place late at night after the Bennets have gone to bed. Mr. Bennet answers the door in his underwear with the rest of the family standing behind him in their nightgowns. Jane Austen is rolling over in her grave. Adding insult to injury, Elizabeth, left unable to sleep after their meeting, decides to venture out into the yard in her nightgown at daybreak where she randomly meets Darcy, who has no hat, no overcoat, no horse or carriage, and no explanation as to how he got there or how long he has been there. Darcy declares his love and the two start pawing at each other. The whole thing is totally bizarre.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with this movie is with the portrayal of Darcy. He resembles ""Droopy the Dog"" from the classic cartoon in everything from hairstyle to tone of voice to character. He is completely unlovable from start to finish, with nothing about him suggesting any type of regalia, dignity, or gentility. He is so like an awkward adolescent boy that I was more invested in Elizabeth getting together with Mr. Collins than with this portrayal of Darcy- and there was absolutely no chemistry between him and Keira Knightley. Had this relationship been more invested, the other sins of the movie could more easily have been forgiven. As it is, it's not worth a second viewing."
"KineticSeoul","Null","1","2","25 September 2011"," Well directed, well acted and poetic...I like these types of films but this just wasn't really for me
","I haven't read the novel but I have read the comic adaptation of this and enjoyed it. Which was the main reason I decided to check this 2005 version out. This was a well directed movie and although I didn't read the novel it seemed like a pretty good adaptation. I didn't like all the choices for the cast in this movie, but for the most part it was superb. The music in this gives off the mood during certain scenes and for the most part I liked the melodic, calm and soothing music in this. Another positive aspect is how the dialogue gives off the poetic vibe like the comic. The cinematography sometimes has a very risky approach of going from one part of the story to another without any cuts which was cool. And because it's difficult to pull off. It's pretty obvious why this story was so remarkable for it's time, even today it stands out. Although the cinematography is vivid the movie seemed to skip around a lot, it just seemed a lot of the parts from the novel is missing so the movie just didn't seem all that well developed and connected. I was never really a big fan of Keira Knightley but she was just right for this role and not just when it came to her looks either. What really stood out to me was the subtle dynamics of this film, that I think captures the novel well. The thing is though is that although I like movies that take place during this similar time period but the movie just didn't capture my attention that well although it got slightly engrossing at times. I sometimes review movies from just my point of view and this movie just wasn't able to grab my attention although there were some music and scenes that stood out to me although few. This is a character driven movie and it captures a lot of character elements with passion. For a movie that is 2 hours it seems to be missing a lot from the novel, but it still captures the essence of the novel. There will be some people that will really love this movie but for me it just wasn't all that great to me. It's a good movie but just wasn't great.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

Interpretations vary and everyone tried to add something new or different to the role and even if not all succeeded it is worth watching anyway!

Brenda Blethyn's less hysteric version of Ms Bennet is enjoyable. Tom Hollander's performance is just splendid.<br/><br/>Having said this much, I must admit that I didn't like this movie even half as much as I liked the BBC version.

"baileymia2003","5","1","2","29 April 2006"," Good entertainment with nice-looking actors and scenery.
","The film was over-all quite enjoyable with decent acting by young Kiera Knightly and equally decent casting for the most part. The scenery and photography are alone worth the while, but I found the film rather brim-filled with symbolism which at times was a tad too obvious and felt contrived.<br/><br/>Though I believe the bar for Mr. Darcy has been set quite high in the past, I have to say that I liked this Mr. Darcy and found McFadyen's performance intense and rather passionate! It doesn't hurt that he is nice to look at, as well. Kiera Knightly's Lizzy was a bit too young in my opinion but I don't want to discredit her performance otherwise.<br/><br/>It must be a pretty thankless job to make a version of Pride and Prejudice as anyone having seen the BBC version, I believe, will automatically compare the two. Though I do think the BBC version stays truer to the novel, this version is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Jane Austen's. It offers some very good rewrites to adapt the novel to a shorter film version and still keep the essence of it intact. The over-use of symbolism is what makes my score a little lower than the film may actually deserve. I still recommend it."

","I have to say, I was extremely surprised at how they didn't try to modern-ize this movie with any extensive love scenes etc. It's nice to see that a movie like this doesn't need that to be a good film. Kiera Knightly is absolutely fantastic. She really embraces the character of Elizabeth Bennet. Matthew Macfayden is one of the only male actors who, in a move, literally took my breath away. Another thing I liked about the movie was that it was almost identical to the novel except of course for some dialogue changes. However, for the most part, it was exactly the same. They did a fantastic job with this movie. It also stayed extremely close to the reality of that time period. If you liked someone you couldn't hug them or kiss them just because you liked them. Therefore, those times that they danced or Mr. Darcy helped Elizabeth into the carriage were their only amount of physical contact. Also, women's only role back then was to marry, it was the only real way they could better themselves in any way. I really liked it a lot and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time."

I was absolutely thrilled to find that he'd been cast as Mr. Darcy beside Keira Knightley's 'Elizabeth', they really do mix well and are brilliant on screen together. <br/><br/>Donald Sutherland is wonderful as Mr. Bennett and I loved Talulah Riley as Mary and Rosamund Pike is lovely. I watched Rosamund in Wives and Daughter and adored her, it's so nice to see her in PP. Keira is wonderful as Elizabeth, too.<br/><br/>If you've not seen the British series Spooks, get it on DVD and watch it, a wonderful, wonderful show with a brilliant cast which Matthew leads for 2 seasons. <br/><br/>When Matthew walks across the fields to Elizabeth in the final scenes I thought of 'Heathcliff', it just evokes images and the scenes of Lizzie and Darcy at night at Pemberley (DVD extra) was heart-beating stuff, why oh why didn't they use it as the movie ending? A better ending than what we have in the film and I'm so glad they put it on the DVD version.<br/><br/>The BBC mini with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was brilliant and I thought that it would be unbeatable but this movie comes pretty damn close...<br/><br/>There are more versions of PP that are worth a serious look:- *Laurence Olivier/Greer Garson version1940 ""Superb"" *Elizabeth Garvey/David Rintoul version 1980 mini ""Brilliant"" *Peter Cushing/Daphne Slater version 1952 mini ""Lovely"" **Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version 1995 mini ""Extraordinary"" ""Brilliant""<br/><br/>These are the next best versions to look for!<br/><br/>The more Jane Austen the better....."

In fact, I only attempted it because it was referenced in the UK comedy series Red Dwarf! Initially all of misgivings seemed justified, and whilst I found the characters to be larger-than-life, the painful stereotypes seemed rather unsubtle.<br/><br/>But then as the plot started to twist, and things that had seemed black and white, became less clearcut, I found myself drawn into a world where people are not expected to socialise, far less marry outside their class.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed by the gradual metamorphosis of Mr Darcy, who managed to move from villain to hero without ever perceptibly altering his persona.<br/><br/>The sheer charm of Keira Knightley is impossible not to love, but for my, favourite character had to be Donald Sutherland, who despite spending scant minutes on screen, managed to add a strength of presence that brought the film to a wonderful conclusion.<br/><br/>I would agree with the comments that have been made about the quality of the filming and costumes, and I particularly loved the misty English morning scene near the end, which shows England as I love it - quiet and beautiful.<br/><br/>A charming and excellent acted piece that stands out amid a sea of lightweight, populist movies. Greatly recommended."

","Keira Knightley as was Matthew Macfeydan,what a revelation in this new film version of Jane Austen's best loved novel. Even my usually Bruce Willis action movies husband didn't mind at all seeing the film. Of course Keira was beautiful and luminous in the role of Lizzie and Matthew to my surprise made Darcy his own. His nuanced portrayal was not heavy handed and my goodness those eyes (swooon)! Keira deserved her Oscar nomination for her rather more fiery, tempestuous portrayal of the independe,ntly spirited Lizzie. I commend Joe Wright for this, the most sensuous (uh, Jane Austen?) adaptation to be put to film. I disagree with others who cannot get their minds out of the 1995 mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. As if there can be no one that can be better. Colin was great as Mr. Darcy. Matthew gave him a more vulnerable, sexy edge. Keira, absolutely fantastic, especially in the proposal scene. They're both wet! That takes care of the Colin pond scene that got girls hearts aflutter. Joe Wright says the time frame is the 1790's which is closer to the date Jane wrote the novel. So it explains the natural waistlines of the clothes the Bennett women wore in the film, except for Jane. She of all the women wear the empire gowns the women were starting to wear at the end of the 1790's. Of course for some reason, at the Netherfield Ball, all the Bennett women except Mrs. Bennett wear the empire gowns. And how does Lizzie traipse all over the rainy and cold English countryside without a bonnet and barely a Spencer coat or cloak to keep from catching cold?"
"Aethelflaed","7","1","2","19 March 2006"," A beautiful film, but not Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice
","****** this comment may contain spoilers *******<br/><br/>Trailing in the wake  albeit 10 years later  of the superb BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, the 2005 film directed by Joe Wright is a lively two hours. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are brilliant up and coming actors who deliver fine performances in the roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy  considering the script they have to work with.<br/><br/>Quite naturally, a film has time constraint and isn't going to convey the story as powerfully as did the book or the much longer mini-series that so faithfully encapsulated Jane Austen's classic tale of true love threatened to be thwarted by those two evils, pride and prejudice. However, the recent film's screenplay focuses on the two main characters - and not all that successfully  and its lack of veracity to Austen's novel leads to further disappointments concerning vital secondary characters and settings.<br/><br/>The parts of the cynical and careless, though likable, Mr Bennet and his awful, neurotic wife; the obsequious Mr Collins; the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourg; the flighty and hopelessly shallow Lydia; whilst well-acted, (apart from Donald Sutherland's atrocious ""English"" accent) fail to be the characters of Austen's book. And what happened to the amiable and all too malleable Mr Bingly, who behaved like a grinning simpleton having a ""bad hair"" day for the duration of the film? As for the scurrilous Wickham, his brief appearance on screen seems hardly enough to develop sufficient interest in the character to vaguely care if Darcy has swindled him out of his rightful inheritance, or to ultimately sense disgust that he is a contemptible scoundrel.<br/><br/>All in all, if one overlooks the lack of faithfulness to the book in the film - where Jane Austen's country gentry are portrayed as bucolic yokels, where an enormously endowed pig wanders through the dilapidated kitchen of what is supposed to be Austen's gracious Longbourn, where her genteel Mr Bennet plays ""Farmer"" - Joe Wright's take on the literary classic is beautifully filmed with settings and costumes that are a delight to the eye.<br/><br/>That's all very well and, if the film was not the retelling of a famous piece of literature, artistic expression could reign free. However, it is impossible to view a film titled ""Pride and Prejudice"" and not expect Jane Austen's characters to come alive on the screen; to see her settings believably depicted.<br/><br/>Ultimately, two hours of watching this latest rendition of Pride and Prejudice buys one little more than the bare bones of the classic story; disordered skeletal remains, at that. Therefore, the film fails to engage the sympathies; fails to enmesh one in the lives of characters of such literary magnitude that they deserve our notice and concern, for in Joe Wright's film they do not exist as Austen portrayed them. Without the natural response of regret for each of her characters' foibles and disappointments, there is no ultimate sharing in Austen's majestic victory of love for another over love of ego."
"shannon_the_caniac","6","1","2","8 March 2006"," Not as good as the one with Colin Firth
","Pride and Prejudice happens to be one of my favorite books, and it's also one of my favorite movies...just not this particular version. It was enjoyable, and Kiera Knightley gives a wonderful performance. I think she is my favorite Elizabeth Bennett, but Colin Firth will remain my favorite Mr. Darcy, even though this one was good as well and also extremely handsome. One of the problems I had was that if felt a bit rushed. If you've never read the book or seen the other version you probably won't notice, you may even think it to be too long. Either way, if you loved this movie or weren't quite satisfied, I urge you to see the 1995 version. Then again, if you thought this movie was way too long, do NOT see the other because it is twice as long."
"filmbuff20","7","1","2","19 January 2006"," A stunning film, even if you only read the book in school.
","I was fortunate enough to attend a gala screening of this film at the British Film Festival here in Israel tonight. I don't generally watch period films of this kind and I thought it would be interesting to try something different for a change, Keira Knighley's presence notwithstanding of course! I have heard many disgruntled fans of Jane Austen's book complain that this film did not do it justice or that it didn't measure up to the 1995 mini series with Colin Firth. If so, I suggest you either read the book again or watch the mini series again because when something is made into a film, it is what it is, otherwise you get the blandness of what was the first Harry Potter. A direct translation. The film is to be shortened and altered to fit whatever vision the writer or director may have, otherwise it is simply what has gone before and what would be the point? <br/><br/>Anyway, to the film. I must admit, though I was familiar with the story, modern times have caused me to look at it differently now, drawing more comparisons with Bridget Jones than it's former incarnations or it's source text. I apologise if that seems sacrilegious. However, as a non fan of this genre, I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are beautifully artistic, the acting superb (and these lines are not easy to give over as naturally and convincingly as they are here) and the script is sharp. I was drawn yet again into this story, which has never looked so rich in my opinion and despite a few scenes that could have been trimmed down for meandering a little, it moved at an acceptable pace. Knightley embodies pure Jane Austen strength while keeping it believable for the period, giving a solid performance and a few Americans turn up with nicely polished accents to add a little spice to the cast. Donald Sutherland for example, in a gentle turn as Mr. Bennett and Jena Malone from Donnie Darko as Lydia. The always wonderful Judi Dench (Lady Catherine) turns up giving us one of the most powerful dialogue scenes of the film, is the icing on the cake. Rosamunde Pike is beautiful and she underplays her character, without bursting into over the top fits of tears and whining as would have been possible. Having said that, she still has too little to do.<br/><br/>Of course, Matthew Macfadyen is not Colin Firth and I'm sure he apologises to everyone for committing this hideous crime, however, he does play Mr Darcy and not Colin Firth, so I assume he can be forgiven. Tom Hollander (I know him as Daniel of Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Lawrence) is toe curlingly ""ridiculous"" as Elizabeth puts it, in his role as Mr. Collins.<br/><br/>I shouldn't think English Lit students would do necessarily well to ditch the book in favour of the film, but I do think this film is a good representation of it's source material and deserves credit where credit is due. Acting, Cinematography and Austen."

","I agree in part with other critics from this site, yes the dress was slightly wrong, yes the language was too modern at times, it didn't have the feeling of authenticity that the BBC drama had but I cant say I didn't enjoy it. I have read the book, am no expert on the period or literature but it felt that this movie put too greater class divide between Bennets and the Darcys/Bingleys. Perhaps this was caused by the unshaven appearance of Donald Sutherland, however it didn't overly upset me. The direction lead to a couple of silly scenes that were pointless and took time away from the plot. Some of the actors' didn't appear to have understood the roles they were playing, for me Lizzy giggled too much. Having said this I enjoyed it very much, and for anyone else who did, and hasn't yet experienced the TV drama and the book, I recommend they watch/read them. I thought Keira Knightly (for all her giggling) looked gorgeous in it, and Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy wasn't too bad."
"Malte006","8","1","2","6 January 2006"," - A pleasant surprise, with Keira shining in the lead.
","Pride & Prejudice <br/><br/>Directed by Joe Wright (2005) <br/><br/>Pride & Prejudice is another adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved novel. It has its focus on the main character Elizabeth, and her family, when their life is turned upside down, due to the new presence of two wealthy bachelors. We get comedy, tragic, and some exciting moments throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Actually this is the 7th version of the original novel, if you include mini-series and TV-movies. I have not seen any of these before. I have not read the novel either, or in fact - seen the two other successful and Oscar winning Austen adaptations: Sense and Sensibility and Emma. Jane Austen adaptations are actually a quite new area for me. And therefore I really did not know what I should expect from this movie, before I saw its ratings. When it came, they were, unlike to my suspicions, quite good! And the reviews followed, and suddenly Keira got some buzz, and then suddenly a Golden Globe nomination.<br/><br/>I have actually always liked Keira Knightley. I first noticed her as the soccer-hotty in Bend It Like Beckham, and from there she went on to a sudden Hollywood success in Pirates and the Caribbean, and a supporting role in the ambitious medieval movie King Arthur. The last movie a saw her in, before this one, was the ""Butterfly Effect""-like twisted movie The Jacket, in which I thought she gave her best acting performance. All these characters really did not have anything in common with a young and inexperienced girl from the end of the 1700th century. How would she do this role? She did a great job! She used her naive looks and beauty and mixed it with the really sharp personality of her role, and delivered a complete character. Keira was defiantly the star of the movie, but that does not mean that she was the only actor shining through in this movie. Matthew MacFadyen delivered a good and solid performance in the role of her equal, Mr. Darcy. The rest of the crew, lead by Donald Sutherland, Rosamund Pike & Judi Dench helped making the overall cast performance have its high acting level. The only one who actually annoyed me a bit was Brenda Blethyn, who I thought, overacted a bit too much. But hey! Maybe her character really is so hysterical..? <br/><br/>The movie was beautiful filmed, and uses long camera shots, mixed with a discreet editing. The art-set decoration captures the spirit of the time well, and especially the costumes fit the characters very good. The score is nice, but not over-used.<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise and a wonderful motion picture debut for the newcomer Joe Wright. Keira shows that she is to be taken serious! <br/><br/>8/10"
"steflondon88","9","1","2","29 December 2005"," Romantic but disappointing
","I thought this movie was cute. And it was well acted by the actor who played Mr.Darcy and Mr.Bingley's sister was very good at seeming extremely snobby. The tension between Mr. darcy and Elizabeth could have been a lot better. I haven't seen much of Kiera Knightleys work, but this movie showcased no talent for her. you didn't feel anything she was feeling with great depth. it was funny the way mr.bingley was so nervous and uncomfortable when trying to profess his love. I like the humor in the movie in the midst of the sadness. And did anyone notice that Mr.Darcy always wears the same bloody blue jacket? oh well.I'm glad i saw it though, however I would not buy it. It is not worth my money. I'd much rather buy a better and more intense love story. but then I'm into the whole pull your heartstrings kind of thing. <br/><br/>Also Elizabeth's sisters were quite excited which was close to the book. I didn't like Lydia, she was so...so superficial and cold hearted. Id give it 6 out of ten. if they made me cry a bit more maybe id give it a seven. but to give it a 8 or 9 I think they should have showed more of the plot between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Created more of a emotional attachment for the viewer if you know what i mean."
"chetley","7","1","2","29 December 2005"," Keira Knightley needs some flesh on her bones
","This is a pretty decent adaptation, with attractive actors and a script that wisely does not stray far from Jane's classic outline. (Isn't is true though how today the plot seems somewhat clichéd? Now when we have two characters who hate each other at first sight, it's usually pretty much a guarantee that they are going to end up either as best friends or partners for life.) There is plenty of lovely cinematography to keep the viewer satisfied: stately homes that were never statelier. And Dame Judi Dench is every inch a Dame. There are probably more farm animals shown in this P & P than in any prior Austen film: at times I thought I was watching Babe III, but I eventually got used to all the pigs and geese.<br/><br/>I just have two quibbling observations. First, Keira Knightley needs some flesh on her bones if she wants to be taken seriously as an Austen heroine. No early 19th century beauty would have wanted to have looked so thin and hungry: there was not our contemporary obsession with anorexic waifs. Second, the keyboard instrument of Austen's time was a spindly forte-piano, not the loud (and metallic) concert grand that thunders on the soundtrack. It was disconcerting to see Elizabeth Bennett sit at an instrument similar to a harpsichord, and have the sound come out as if it's a Bosendorfer!"
"roland-104","8","1","2","25 December 2005"," It may not be recognizable as Austen's work, but it's a good enough movie
","Competently crafted period movie by British first time feature film director, Joe Wright. Jane Austen's novel was adapted for this production by Deborah Moggach, with additional uncredited rewriting by Emma Thompson. Overall, the acting and the photography are good, and the movement of the story proceeds briskly enough that the 2 hour-plus running time does not feel tediously long.<br/><br/>I am not well versed on Jane Austen, so I leave the question of fidelity to the text to the more knowing hand of critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum (writing for The Chicago Reader), who finds that this adaptation has ""hopelessly mangled"" Miss Austen's work. Be that as it may, the movie holds together reasonably well. The costumes and production design are good. The scenes at the ball are especially well done, with good camera movement and a stimulating mix of details and broader shots.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland is highly pleasing to watch as the patient, wise English country squire, Mr. Bennet, who, though he aspires to marry off all of his five daughters in order to ease the burdens of his old age, wants them nevertheless to be well and happily matched, not just gotten rid of to the first bidder, as his well meaning but overly anxious wife (Brenda Blethyn) tends to want to do. Matthew MacFadyen is frightfully dour as Elizabeth Bennet's love interest, Mr. Darcy. But then his longstanding betrothal to the mentally disturbed daughter of Lady Catherine de Bourg (Dame Judi Dench) is reason enough to make a grown man down in the mouth.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is a pleasant surprise here as Elizabeth. I hadn't expected her to carry much weight in a serious role. But, apart from one bad habit, she does a reasonable job throughout, holding her own opposite the grave Mr. MacFadyen. The habit is a wretched, squirrelly little grin: it's more of a grimace, really, all closed teeth framed by thin, squared off lips, a grin like a car's grille, an unbecoming facial gesture that I hope some drama coach eventually will convince her to drop. Simply openinging her teeth would do wonders. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 12/19/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites."
"lorin215","10","1","2","17 December 2005"," Great movie
","I've read this book so many times I've lost track. But in the first few minutes, I realized that each character was perfectly aligned with how I had imagined them. Although there were some minor things that differed from the book, as a true lover of Austen, I felt that this movie really did do her justice. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were perfect together. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy were ideally matched and had a very strong connection on-screen. It was a beautiful film with a great script and excellent, believable characters. I plan on seeing this movie again and buying it when it comes out. I am also excited to read the book again!"
"mike-925","10","1","2","13 December 2005"," Only Mister Bennet to Keep Bounders and Cads at Bay
","Pride and Prejudice has a fantastically fast-moving opening at an Upper Middle Class social gathering and dance. We're introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Bennett and their five daughters in the middle of things.<br/><br/>The Bennet Daughters are there to capture husbands like every sensible woman in late 18th century England. The spirited dancing seems to ape the emotions of the Bennet girls as they wander about.<br/><br/>The dance features not the usual snobbish Brits but rather a free- wheeling group of normal socialites reflecting the carefree, not posh and not snobbish Bennets, their five daughters and assorted friends.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet, Donald Sutherland her besieged, droll rather appalled father. Mr. Bennet, as in the book, is called Mister even by his daughters. Every man is Mister. It makes the movie funnier contrasting the formality of the Misters with the convivial and fun-loving play of the Bennet girls.<br/><br/>Mrs. Bennet is a shimmering pile of unspent emotional fiery. The girls at any moment, mother included, are likely to lose their heads at the sight of a man with 5,000 a year. That is if they're not having a joke at his expense at the time.<br/><br/>At those moments, Mr. Bennent retreats to his study, where he has a new plant to look at.<br/><br/>Only Mrs. Bennet is a straight fortune hunter. The Bennet girls somehow have found time to understand genuine love, though Mr. Bennet seems as unaware of this as Mrs. Bennet. Mr. Bennet seems to have sense you see. How the girls learned of true love is a mystery.<br/><br/>Jane Austen's novel is set in a predatory England. A man with 1,000 pounds will stir interest. A man with 5,000 could drive the Bennet girls to revelries of screaming and shouting.<br/><br/>Austen predates Dickens and the Bronte Sisters, but the Director has managed to include visuals lifted right from the heather of Wuthering Heights and has placed Elizabeth in settings that just do not exist in the somewhat hardscrabble back yard of the lower middle class Bennets. <br/><br/>There is an instance or two of an enormous boar in the house for instance. Elizabeth escapes home with a flock of ducks fluttering about, seeming to imitate her. The image is stolen from the thirties David Copperfield, copied again with great effect in Tom Jones. <br/><br/>The only true snob in the film is Mister Darcy. Poor Mister Darcy, he cannot bring himself to speak to most women, considering them trivial. He boorishly connives to torpedo Elizabeth's sister Mary's budding romance with the handsome though high-haired Mr. Bingley.<br/><br/>At the dance opening of the film, Elizabeth finds Darcy odd at first, then turns squarely against him after encountering his more offensive traits. The audience knows that both are intrigued and Darcy may even be smitten.<br/><br/>There is Mr. Collins, who, spotting Elizabeth at the dance, immediately cocks his hat for her. Only Lizzy is taller than he, his designs on her seem more about money than love, and besides, he and the film are moving too fast.<br/><br/>There's room for one bounder in the shape of Mr. Wickham, who, it develops, knows and dislikes Mr. Darcy as much as Elizabeth and tells her so. A frame or two later he has run off with one of Elizabeth's sisters. Mr. Collins too finds matrimonial bliss in Elizabeth's friend who confides to Elizabeth that she hasn't attributes enough to wait for love to arrive at her door as Elizabeth has.<br/><br/>The new Pride and Prejudice is certain to be compared with the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth. Keira Knightley, who ran away with the movie King Arthur two years ago, owns this film too. Unlike the miniseries, she doesn't really have to share with this Mr. Darcy (Matt McFadyen). Knightley seems to be at once Audrey Hepburn and Winona Ryder. Judy Dench, almost a necessity now in every British period film, plays Darcy's high-handed and very rich aunt with her usual bombast.<br/><br/>Some screen notes say actress Emma Thompson gave this fast-paced screenplay a touch-up that is uncredited except at the end. I laughed more at this film than I did at the '95 miniseries.<br/><br/>I could hear all of Darcy's, Mr. Bennet's, and Elizabeth's lines, but the rest was sometimes too British to understand. Still, one could read body language just as well in many scenes. Director Joe Wright pushed the movie along at a torrid pace. At times his camera moves in and out of doors and windows peering at the bewildering contrasts in attitudes of the many lovers and players in just seconds.<br/><br/>I recommend that everyone see it. Its very funny. When Mr. Bennett learns Elizabeth finally wants to wed Mr. Darcy after all, he becomes teary when telling his daughter why, totally stealing the scene from Miss Knightley. Score one for Mister Bennet.<br/><br/>Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson were Darcy and Elizabeth in the first 1940 version. An Indian Directress who re-filmed Vanity Fair in 2004 put out a Bollywood version of Pride and Prejudice early this year. <br/><br/>The present version, more than the miniseries, reminds that Louisa May Alcott borrowed heavily from Austen's Pride and Prejudice to produce Little Women in 1869. The two novels have nearly the same structure. Pride and Prejudice is a first instance of Chick Lit written in English. Its a story of girls for girls and any male who wants to learn a few things about them they hadn't known."

","I admit to being a big Jane Austen fan and can't get enough of her. The portrayal of Georgian life in the film is wonderful and I will buy the DVD so that I can slow it down and see the details. For the first time that I can remember, we see the gentry romping at a dance -- not like so many other movies which portray the upper classes boringly gliding while the servants are having fun. Some details puzzled me and I would like to know -- e.g., why did Lizzie round a cake with a bunch of sage? Looks nice, but you wouldn't eat it with a sweet cake. This is only my first viewing -- you can be sure other Jane fans will greedily devour this film, cake, sage, and all. Oh, and the acting wasn't bad either."

","I loved this movie in every aspect! I was enthralled throughout the entire film, and the audience along with myself laughed, sighed, cried out at Lizzie, and Darcy, it was a wonderful experience! I do agree that the movie could have been longer with more on Lizzie and Darcy. One thing I did notice and had a laugh from was Kiera's wig or extensions did not cover her very short hairline, therefore leaving a very choppy looking appearance. But in the grand scheme of the movie, it was a minor detail. I thought her giddiness was cute and added to her personality of being a well rounded young woman. I had the impression that the family was more destitute than they actually were, and the time line was undefined. Having not read the book this movie was wonderful! I would not have known any difference had I not read these reviews the day after the viewing. I am renting the BBC version, and plan to read the book now! I am a new fan of Pride and Prejudice!"

I wanted them to get together and declare their love for each other because the entire movie, and the novel for that matter, was inexorably moving that way. I felt that the faults of the characters were their real faults, and not the fault of scripting, acting or directing. I liked the settings; the smallness of most of the interiors of the houses was very real to me. It makes me wonder whether one could do a real, complete but modern Pride and Prejudice. Of course all the Regency scenery was terrific. The photography was beautiful, the close-ups nicely done, the family interactions enjoyable."

I think all the actors did excellent jobs in this adaptation. I can't say that any of them were better then the miniseries. This version is good for those who cannot deal with sitting thru the six hours that the miniseries was.<br/><br/>I did notice that some of the movie was expediated and they seemed to cut out some of characters. I am assuming in the end that they were married, since Mr Darcy(in that day) was scarcely dressed. All in all I would say this version can stand on its own legs away from the mini series, I will say though that Colin Firth will always be the perfect Mr Darcy."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I have to say, it's been a while since I read the book by Jane Austen and that I haven't watched the BBC version of the movie. But this was a masterpiece. THe choice of actors and actresses were good. I liked the setting, and the camera movements that seemed to scan every room in every scene was appropriate because it made the setting more realistic and the viewer could easily feel like they are in the time period. I think this is one of the greatest achievements in this movie that makes it stand out from other pictures that have been made previously about this time. Of course, the story is amazing...the romance is well developed and I can imagine that for someone who doesn't know the story, it will be quite entertaining. I wouldn't think Keira Knightly was the right actress for this role, merely because I'm used to seeing her in more modern movies playing the roles of sporty/tomcat girls. But I must say, with the magic of the director, she played quite well and made the role of Elizabeth Bennet come to life. I think I would recommend this movie mostly to female audiences, although some males might also find it interesting, particularly if they have some background on the time that this movie is about."
"LadyLiberty","7","1","2","27 November 2005"," Pride & Prejudice Does Filmmakers Proud
","Pride & Prejudice Let me state right up front that I've never read Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice (you can chalk that up to the shortcomings of a public school education if you like, but more realistically should blame the fact that such books aren't really to my taste). That, in turn, might make you wonder why I went to see Pride and Prejudice in the first place. The answer, at least in part, is that I really enjoy a well done period piece (I have as much a thing for costuming and authentic sets as I do for special effects). But I'd also heard good things about the acting and the film in general, and figured it was worth the matinée price to check it out for myself.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice takes place in Georgian England where ladies and gentlemen alike endured certain expectations of them from society at large. Deviations were, at best, frowned upon and could even result in the ruin of reputations and families alike. The Bennett family is no exception to these stringent if unspoken rules. With five daughters, Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) has his work cut out for him. His wife, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn), has that work well in hand as she schemes incessantly to get her five girls safely married, preferably to wealthy men.<br/><br/>Though lacking in wealth themselves, the Bennett family is viewed well enough in society to enjoy invitations to parties thrown by others in their rural community. So when the rich and good looking Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) has a ball, the Bennett daughters are among those present. Mr. Bingley and his astringent sister, Caroline (Kelly Reilly) are also playing host to Bingley's best friend, the dour Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). Though the eldest Bennett daughter, the beautiful Jane (Rosamund Pike) finds Mr. Bingley much to her liking, the independent Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) feels just the opposite about Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>With misunderstandings of intentions and feelings cropping up on all sides, Jane tries to hide her emotions while Elizabeth's are all too evident. Matters are only made more complicated when the staid and stiff Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) shows up for a visit to the Bennett estate he's named to inherit. Mrs. Bennett is delighted when Mr. Collins expresses some interest in one of her daughters becoming his wife, believing the family will be safe from being turned out if he's married to one of them. But handsome British leftenant Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) and Elizabeth's good friend, Charlotte (Claudie Blakley) may have a thing or two to say about that! <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy's upper crust aunt, the Lady Catherine de Bourg (Dame Judi Dench) has some marriage plans of her own. But decisions by Mr. Collins, actions by Mr. Darcy, and the inexplicable by one of the Bennett daughters throw virtually everybody's plans and desires into a complicated and potentially catastrophic state. And poor Elizabeth finds herself in the very center of the storm.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly is a very pretty girl and not a bad actress, but her tendency to have what my mother always called ""mush mouth"" makes her hard to understand at times. Rosamund Pike and Jena Malone (as the irrepressible Lydia Bennett) have no such difficulties, while Brenda Blethyn is a tour de force in her role as the nervous Mrs. Bennett. Tom Hollander has Mr. Collins' disapproving looks down pat, while Simon Woods and Rupert Friend are both perfect for their roles. Matthew MacFadyen is all right, too, though I might wish Donald Sutherland troubled himself to have at least some semblance of an English accent.<br/><br/>In Pride and Prejudice, though the acting is all fine or better, perhaps the most enjoyable element is provided instead by a story that should be antiquated, but somehow isn't. Kudos to the screenwriter who provided this latest screen adaptation to include the proper atmosphere even while including drama and humor that were perfectly understandable and appreciable by modern audiences. As I'd hoped, the costumes and the sets were just fabulous. There were also a few really creative edits and some very good direction to round the picture out. The cinematography, too, is spectacular.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is a really enjoyable movie on a number of levels, though I suspect it will be most successful as a date movie or a so-called ""chick flick."" In a way, that's too bad. It's honestly better than that. In fact, it's better than a lot of other movies have been this year. I sincerely hope it's broadly appreciated by audiences who will be in for a real treat when they take their seats for Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pride and Prejudice is rated PG for ""some mild thematic elements."" Although tales of Georgian England are sufficiently ""clean"" to satisfy even the most strict of parents, the language and plot is complex enough that I'd leave the under-12 crowd with tickets to Zathura instead. I also have to admit that teenaged boys aren't much going to care for Pride and Prejudice. For everyone else, though, I recommend Pride and Prejudice without reservation. It's fun; it's funny; it's beautifully filmed; and it's just plain good."

Matthew McFadyen is charming as Darcy. He has the looks and the talent to boot. The chemistry between Darcy and Lizzie is electric! The dialogue is witty and the whole movie, helped by the setting, is absolutely English. The music's excellent as well. Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh is effectively scary."

When they say there was too much romance in the film, I don't agree. I don't think there was enough romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. I also didn't buy Keira Knightley as Elizabeth and Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Dancy.

"warren-1976","4","3","12","27 April 2007"," A Disappointing Adaptation
","It was inevitable that fans would compare this to the much loved 1995 BBC version, however, if we try to view it separately, how does it fare? In many ways it tries hard, but ultimately falls flat on its face in many respects. The traditional length of just over two hours running time, is not a lot, when trying to condense material of this size and nature. However, when the right director and script writer are teamed, it can be achieved. Sadly, this is not the case, with Pride & Prejudice. Instead, we are given a story that feels like it is on fast forward. Things often happen in one scene, that would otherwise have occurred over several. As a result, it often doesn't flow naturally, and instead appears forced. Conclusions, decisions and emotions seem leapt to, without due reason.<br/><br/>Then we have the filming style. True, the tones of the film are lush and vibrant, with lots of detail, however it seems that they borrowed a camera man from NYPD blue. It's toned down, but we are still treated to that 'documentary' style of film making so popular today, intended to make the viewer feel as though things are being filmed live. The camera shifts constantly, just tiny subtle moves, a slight pan to the left, a slight zoom, etc. It is quite simply inappropriate to the tone of the film, and jars the viewer out of the atmosphere. The composition of a shot no-longer seems important, when instead the director can just keep the camera on the move rather than think about what is going on film.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the casting and script. Characters like Bingley are portrayed as a wild haired buffoon, rather than simply a shy and naïve gentleman. The Bennets, while not a rich family, were certainly not poor. However, here they are portrayed practically living in squalor on a collapsing farm. Characters act in ways that seem far too modern, which is admittedly perhaps the goal, to draw in those who couldn't cope with subtler dialogue. Last but not least, we have Keira Knightly. A proficient, and pretty enough actress, but far too lightweight for a nuanced role like Elizabeth Bennet. She would have been far better suited to the role of Lydia, and indeed almost comes over as a flighty, 'giddy teen'.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do what they can with their roles, in most cases well enough, with Rosamund Pike and Tom Hollander standing out. While the normally reliable Donald Sutherland tries his best, in a dreadfully miscast role. Macfadyen plays his part mechanically, but well enough, simply coming over as a different take on Darcy, rather than especially better or worse than others.<br/><br/>Yet to round it all off, we are given a conclusion straight out of a bad Mills & Boon novel (either the American, or British end). Ultimately, it is a disappointment, to see such strong material, simply raced through, and 'spiced up' to appeal to a contemporary audience, who are probably just being under-estimated in their ability to enjoy something with depth and subtlety."

","I wish I had taken the time to read some of the reviews here so I would have known how Austen's masterpiece had been hacked at with a butcher knife. I found myself watching the screen with horror. It was like watching a close friend being murdered. Really, I'm not a religious person at all, but I finally understand what a sacrilege is. This.<br/><br/>I too understand that the filmmakers were trying to make the story accessible to a younger, illiterate generation. My question is, why bother? I'm of the opinion that people under 35 shouldn't read Jane Austen; they haven't enough life experience to understand it. Adapting the story as a teenage romance cliché makes absolutely no sense to me. I can see that a lot of people liked this movie, but it has very little to do with Jane Austen or her novel.<br/><br/>Any fan of Austen's works is likely to be as appalled as I was and my recommendation would be to give this film a wide berth."

"jpschapira","6","2","7","20 August 2006"," Young women with female leads...Keira Knightley
","To write about this movie is almost as difficult as watching it. Jane Austen wrote a novel that became famous in the whole world which has had, as other recognized books (""Vanity Fair"", ""Little Women""), lots of cinema and television adaptations; as well as lot of actors playing its main roles. In these specific novels I mentioned, the main characters are females.<br/><br/>This takes me to my statement about how a young woman can carry with a movie by herself. Recently, Reese Witherspoon starred in ""Vanity Fair"" and she did an excellent job; but she was near her thirties. However, Keira Knightley (Oscar nominated for her role in ""Pride & Prejudice"") is only twenty years old, and Winona Ryder was twenty three when she became the soul of ""Little Women"".<br/><br/>I don't mean to compare, but it's not acting talent I am comparing, but acting situations and character similarity. The acting situation is the chance of walking the red carpet having a nomination with twenty years or a little bit more. I don't know much, but I know that many men have been nominated while being young, but not many women.<br/><br/>In this case, Keira would have more merit for being nominated being younger; but that's not the case. The character similarity is instantly felt. One of five sisters, Lizzie Bennet (Knightley) is not the eldest but probably the wisest about life, the most charming and the most difficult when it comes to love relationships; kind of what Winona's Jo March was like.<br/><br/>Also in both stories, the five sisters have to be presented in society because they may be beautiful, but they are not classy or well known. As I see it on film, Luisa May Alcott's story is more about all of the girls, and Jane Austen's is focused on Lizzie's life. Either way, it's the actress who plays the character that has to stand out.<br/><br/>Deborah Moggach had the task of adapting the novel to the screen, in her first screenplay presented in theaters worldwide. The words the characters speak are beautiful, and she puts them together professionally; I also said it when I wrote about ""Vanity Fair"". But for some reason, ""Pride & Prejudice"" is less bearable than the latter one, which lasts more than twenty minutes longer.<br/><br/>Joe Wright, the director (and also in charge of his first project to be shown in theaters), also did an admirable work (achieving a perfect and unforgettable ending); perhaps too correct as Spielberg's direction of ""Munich"". Mainly, I guess it's the price to pay for adapting a novel in its whole form, or the fact that Winona Ryder and Reese Witherspoon had a noticeable cast behind them, that made the movie more entertaining.<br/><br/>Here we have Donald Sutherland, who seems to be trying for an Oscar with roles as kind, old men (see ""Cold Mountain"", ""The Italian Job"") mostly fathers, which are always acceptable and notable. We have Mathew Macfadyen, who has got the role of his short career as Mr. Darcy, and who slows the movie down at times with his face of sadness; but the viewer understands it's part of his character.<br/><br/>We also have Jena Malone, Brenda Blethyn, even Judi Dench and there's nothing exciting we get to see on screen. It's the incredible Keira Knightley who makes the picture only and just watchable. The young and beautiful actress has done little things with great results, and even though her portrayal isn't the greatest of all time, it becomes the high point of the movie and enough reason to honor her on growing gift."
"Evil_Magus","4","2","7","13 July 2006"," Mediocre Adaptation.
","As far as this adaptation of Jane Austin's classic Pride & Prejudice goes, this one is mediocre at best. It's faults are numerous spread across almost every aspect of the film. It's successes fail to subside the weight of its failures. I'll agree that it's something of an entertaining romp, but this fails to capture and embody the mastery of either the novel or the BBC mini-series.<br/><br/>The greatest fault of this adaptation does not lie in the movie itself but, rather, in the fact that this is a movie. The novel was an expansive work. It had an extremely large cast of characters, an expansive set of locales, a long series of events integral to the plot and the many complicated mannerism of restorative Britain. To accomplish this it spans hundreds of pages. The mini-series took five hours to accomplish the same. A single movie, however, is extraordinarily confined for time. This story cannot be told in a mere two hours. As a result, so many things had to be cut from the movie, from subtle and exquisite nuances of character and society, to whole major focal points of plot. This is not the film-maker's fault, but rather their choice of medium to retell this story. The effect, however, is detrimental; characters become watered-down and bland shadows of what they once were, complicated and nuanced plots lose their flavor and unique form and the world created by Austin turns from a unique dimension to a transient plane that exists simply to take the viewer from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The acting, mostly, leaves much to be desired. The only good performer in the entire cast would have to be Keira Knightly, who gives us a striking and singular performance. But, even then, she leaves much to be desired. Her performance bears a feel that if far to modern for the story. Instead of Elizabeth Bennet being a unique, innovative forward-thinking girl who's ahead of her time, she becomes a modern girl (and all that implies therein) trapped in Restorative Britain. Although this is a subtle difference, it's one that greatly affects the rest of the film. It turns from a film about one woman's liberation from the trappings of her time to one girl's subjugation by the same. This strikes me as a poor choice in direction (similar to Johnny Depp's Portrayal of Willie Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). However, this is still Knightly's burden to bear as an actress.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen gives a rather disappointing performance as Mr. Darcy. He portrays him as too distant, too self-absorbed... to socially deficient. He takes Darcy's faults and character and warps him into a sad caricature. He water's down Darcy from a very distinct personality (a very proud, singular and distinct individual; whose presence is commanding and character impossible to ignore) into a bland and forgettable character, unable to function in the real world and unconvincing as a person. His fault is simply that he takes Darcy's character and goes too far with him.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn does to this movie what Kate Capshaw did for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Her constant over-acting whining and moaning in every single scene she was in did more to ruin this movie than any other aspect of it. Every scene featuring Mrs. Bennet was immediately ruined. You only saw this wretched annoying little thing, without the humanity or reality that Alison Steadman added to the same role in the BBC mini-series.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in Donald Sutherland's job. It was good, to be sure, but not simply up to his traditional snuff. Still, it was a subtle, quiet performance that acted in stark contrast to his character's wife's. He did do a pleasant-enough job. The rest of the cast were tolerable and good enough to escape any particular notice (Although Rupert Friend, who played Mr. Wickham, was clearly chosen for his DeCaprio looks rather than for any acting merit. He's this film's Gerard Butler, in a sense).<br/><br/>The art direction in this film, however, was outstanding. This was by far the film's strongest aspect (and probably the only part that could be called well done). The choreography was sharp, the costumes were gorgeous and the set-design splendid. It certainly deserved it's nominations in the 2006 Oscars for best Costume Design and Best Art Direction. The score, though, was tolerable, but nothing memorable, and I don't feel that it deserved its nomination for Best Original Score.<br/><br/>The final scene at the end that they tacked on is, in my opinion, terrible. It's a contrived mess that attempts to show their intimacy and love. They failed to establish that much in my mind during the last two hours, and certainly failed in the last two minutes.<br/><br/>My overall impression of this film is a terrible mess brought on, primarily by poor directorial choices, largely disappointing (and at times rotten) acting, confining a large story into too short a film and mediocre adaptation. The only god parts of this film are Keira Knightly, the costumes and the set design. I would largely not recommend this film, and recommend instead the 1995 BBC mini-series. However, fans of Keira Knightly and fluffy romances will enjoy this film (Because that's what they turned this into, a fluffy romance starring Keira Knightly). Still, there are better movies to watch if fluffy romances are your thing, and better adaptations of Pride & Prejudice to watch if that's what you came to see."
"cherry88","4","2","7","25 December 2005"," Disturbing in so many ways!
","I have been told that this is a love/hate movie: you either like it or you don't. Personally, I am completely bemused as to why critics liked it so much. I was actually looking forward to seeing it because, well i like everything Jane Austen. I also thought Keira Knightley could be promising as Elizabeth Bennet. I was disappointed to discover that this movie lacks everything i admired and loved about the story. The novel was originally titled ""First Impressions"" and one of the main things i loved about it was its message that people can change. In this movie Darcy simply has NO character, let alone charisma. There is no obvious change in his personality, behaviour or values...no psychological struggle to overcome his pride and arrogance to win Elizabeth's heart. One of my favourite scenes from the BBC production was Darcy's ,(Colin Firth's)first proposal to Elizabeth, (Jennifer Ehle). They both were just NOT ACTING. There was something natural about it...as though someone had smuggled a video camera back into Austen's era. As for Elizabeth...she just seemed so immature! I felt Jennifer Ehle brought a certain wittiness and class to the role, which just isn't in Knightley's performance.I couldn't help but laugh at her use of the word 'sarcasm'during Darcy's proposal, it seemed completely out of place...as were some of the costumes and mannerisms depicted in the movie...there was no trace of the importance of propriety in society and the ballroom scenes were chaotic. I absolutely HATED the statue thing....something i found completely pointless...i mean, why not use that time to develop the plot involving Lydia and Mr. Whicham? it would have contributed to making the movie more than just a love story...it is so much deeper than that! And finally i can't help but comment on the scene where Elizabeth receives the letter regarding Lydia, where she appeared to be on the verge of laughter...!!!I'm not quite sure what could be so hilarious given the situation... I simply cannot help comparing it to the BBC version, not only because i loved it so much but because i felt it captured the essence of the story a lot better. See if you've exhausted all the DVDs available to you."
"justagurl_182","10","2","7","20 October 2005"," Judi Dench saves the day
","I love Jane Austen's novel - in fact, it's my favourite book of all time - and I also love the mini-series. But I was a bit weary, along with many fans I bet, upon hearing that a new adaptation of the novel was being made, considering already that the mini-series is probably the best mini-series EVER MADE! Who could ever forget Colin Firth's Darcy, or THAT wet shirt! Or the great costumes and settings and the fabulous acting! I was expecting that this film adaptation would NOT try to mimic the mini-series in 2 hours. And quite frankly, it did not.<br/><br/>If the mini-series were never made--God bless me!--I mean, if I had never watched the mini-series, then I would say that this film is a great adaptation of the novel. Fitting this timeless story in 2 hours is hard work so it's understandable that certain concepts, scenes, and characters had to be modified and trimmed - and so they were. NO SPOILERS HERE! But I will spoil, though I don't think it would be a surprise, that Keira Knightley did a really good job with Lizzy Bennett's character and I liked it a lot. And when trying to assess Matt MacFayden's Darcy it's hard not to compare it to Colin Firth's Darcy, so for this sake, I won't. Pretending Firth's Darcy had never existed, MacFayden is a delightful and handsome Darcy, very quiet and soft-spoken, which is a very attractive feature in any man.<br/><br/>The film is suited for a modern audience and it did a good job on that. It reminded me of the 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park starring Frances O'Connor - although no explicit scenes and concepts in this one. <br/><br/>10/10 because I'm a fan of Jane Austen."

To begin with, it was a bit difficult to understand, i had to keep explaining what they were saying and meaning to my friend.<br/><br/>The dresses were a mixture of tow different era's so didn't really match the story, which is set in the regency era or early 1800's not the late 1700's! And one of the dresses, the one that Bingley's sister wears to the ball looks like it's just come of a modern runway, in the 21st century. Very disappointing! Even if it is a nice looking dress.<br/><br/>Also in the BBC version, there is a difference between the decor of the houses of Mr. Darcy and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, which shows an important difference of character.

"Tahhh","4","3","14","19 April 2007"," Very Disappointing: Recommend you pass it.
","There are quite a few versions of Jane Austen's masterpiece now, and while no dramatization can completely capture the miracle of Austen's prose, this particular film seems to miss the spirit of the story completely, and offers nothing to compensate for the loss.<br/><br/>I suppose the success of the 1995 version is simply that in five hours, rather than two, the screenplay authors had SOME hope of developing the complex emotional and psychological investment that gives the story its depth, as well as having the luxury of using much of Austen's own dialogue, rather than inventing new words for everyone.<br/><br/>I think that my greatest disappointment is that this film lacks all of the FUN that Jane Austen builds into her work, the satirical, teasing wit that is so subtle that even the most discerning readers may miss a particular quip until the fourth or fifth reading: all of that delicious winking and tongue-in-cheek humor is utterly absent from the film.<br/><br/>It is very hard, for example, to imagine the angry confrontation between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth presented in such a way that we don't at least smile--and yet, in this film, all the deliciously nasty swipes that the two take at each other get lost in a confrontation that leaves us puzzled and unhappy. The film even has it taking place indoors, in a gloomy, ill-lit room, instead of as a walk in the ""wilderness"" beside Elizabeth's house, and Lady Catherine's hilarious exit line about taking no leave and deserving no such attention...all that is simply lost, lost, lost...and for Austen-lovers who are SO looking forward to hearing the immortal ""I am seriously displeased!""--there's nothing.<br/><br/>And in a similar fashion, the film loses ALL of the emotional content of the novel. There's no hope of the ""You are too generous to trifle with me"" scene bringing tears to your eyes--come, admit it: if you're a TRUE fan of Austen, you have never once read that scene without tears welling up in your eyes!--we feel none of the quiet refinement of the Gardiners and their special relationship with their niece, we perceive none of the changes and growing up that take place in the two main characters, and, as another commenter pointed out, the sets and costumes and directorial choices are out-of-keeping with the period.<br/><br/>Another gratuitous mistake that serves as an excellent example of how egregiously the film misses it is a brief scene showing Mr. and Mrs. Bennett talking to one another tenderly in bed, in total disregard of the huge and deeply disturbing revelations that her relations with Darcy cause Elizabeth to experience as she matures and begins to recognize how ill her father has behaved in exposing his wife to the ridicule of his daughters--and how just Mr. Darcy is in recognizing the man's lack of good character, in spite of her love for her father. Donald Sutherland is an actor of enormous power and judgement, and I fault the director and screenwriters more for this--he cannot fight the script here, although I see glimpses of him being one of the few in the cast who brought something fresh to the characters of Austen's novel.<br/><br/>In general, I just can't recommend this film at all--I found it a rather boring mistreatment of the novel, and even the old Garson-Olivier version, with all its faults, captures more of the fun of the novel than this modern treatment.<br/><br/>So my verdict is: FIRST get the novel and read it over and over a few times. And then, enjoy the old Garson-Olivier, if only to howl at Edna Mae Oliver and sip the delicious Caroline in that version. And then treat yourself to the BBC/A&E 1995 version, to see how one CAN do a reasonable dramatization without going too far overboard (although I'd recommend you close your eyes while Darcy takes a plunge in the pool--I still don't know why they did that!) And just pass this one by; it's not worth the time."
"moowhiz","2","2","8","1 September 2009"," Not bad, but ...
","...not great either. Casting was poor -- Keira Knightley was pretty good, Judi Dench was amazing; but a lot of the cast varied from ordinary to poor. Donald Sutherland and Jena Malone in particular looked completely out of their depth. The story was dumbed down; everything flowed very logically, but it left me cold. Part of the problem is that the story is too long for a feature length film; it is more suited to a mini-series format. They've made the right cuts logically; but unfortunately, in the process, killed the soul of the movie. The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at though; they've shot on location -- and every frame is lit beautifully. All in all; it wasn't bad by itself; but it just can't stand up to the 1996 miniseries."

It was enjoyable to watch, but since I've read the book and seen the 1995 Pride & Prejudice miniseries several times, this movie wasn't as enjoyable as it might have been. I guess this movie is more like a ""highlights of"" summary than a whole story. Sure, it does tell the story, but it feels too rushed. If you've read the book, you know that the story takes place over a period of at least a year, so it naturally moves somewhat slowly. The 1995 miniseries did an extremely good job of portraying the slow pace of the story, so anything shorter than those 5 hours really doesn't do the story justice in my eyes. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, because it is good, but if you've read the book or seen the 1995 miniseries, you probably won't like it that well. My recommendation is to just go read the book and then watch the 1995 miniseries."

"purple-accident","2","2","8","2 January 2009"," Capital offense
","A truth, universally acknowledged is that this movie is not true to the Austen book. Not even slightly. I won't go hard on the ridiculous script and director's decisions, though some of the scenes really bothered me. But I promised myself to avoid any comparison to any of the previous adaptations. I must say, though, I'm really disappointed with the cast. I hold no hatred for Knightley, but my opinion is that she's a weak actress. In all her movies she acts the same, moves the same, has the same phrasing. She was not convincing at all. Matthew Macfadyen was even worse. He definitely has the looks but I don't think he succeeded at portraying Darcy. Seriously, half the movie he's plain dull, and the other half he looks like a stray puppy. No dignity, no pride. And I won't go into detail about Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham and other disappointing portrayals. Any man who isn't mental will notice there's something wrong with them, even if he has neither read the Book, nor watched previous adaptations. But after all there were some good things about this movie. I absolutely enjoyed the performances of Rosamund Pike (Jane) and Tom Hollander (Mr. Collins). They did excellent job, each of them seemed consumed in their role. And though they can't make up for the fault of the entire movie, they sure weaken the feeling of absurdity, that took over me 15 minutes after the film had started. And even from the perspective of a chick-flick, the movie is not worth it. Not to mention what a pain it would be to anyone who's fond of Austen's works, or is particularly interested in that time period. My advice is - instead of wasting over two hours of your life, go fetch yourself the book, or even the BBC adaptation with Firth and Ehle. I guarantee neither will disappoint you."

She is beautiful and looks friendly, but spits lines without conviction or emotion.<br/><br/>b) Everyone is ADD, running around, directionless.<br/><br/>c) The screenplay is just off.

","This is the poorest adaptation imaginable. The authors would have done well if they'd placed the action in some other historical period, e.g. in contemporary times. This would have at least spared the picture from many serious blunders concerning the way of life and mores of Regency England. Still it wouldn't make the whole picture much better: the characters they are absent at all. Elizabeth is subtle, and Knightly is an ever jeering ninny. Darcy is proud and haughty and MacFadyen is like a log. Both Elizabeth and Darcy characters are developing as the action evolves, and nor Knightly neither MacFadyen are not, let alone all other personages. P&P is a brilliant, wise and subtle novel. The film is dull. I'm going to once again watch BBC miniseries to wipe out the dusty effect of this picture."

At first I though Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy wasn't quite as 'spunky' as he should be, but as a big strong man, brooding all the time, he did become quite appealing in the end he he. **SPOILERS** The only problem i had with this movie was the ending. I mean YAY we realize that they will be married but the final scene is focused on the father. Where's the big pash fest that should have followed?!?! I wanted to see them marry or at least kiss.

","Absolutely terrible. I mean, if it were not based on a novel, it would have been pretty good, I suppose. There is pathos, the actors are pretty good - or at least, most of them are. I did not like Matthew Macfadyen at all, he looks like a Madame Tussaud's statue. He wears exactly the same expression on his face all the time. The others are OK, I suppose, but let us not forget that this film is supposed to follow the novel by Jane Austen. And it does not. Of course a film which lasts about two hours cannot bear every single scene, fact, character in the book. But the characters are not themselves. A real Jane cannot laugh all the time as if she were a stupid goose. A real Lizzie cannot look nor sound like a girl who only wants to flirt. Mr Darcy does not have the slightest trace of arrogance, Mr Bennet looks like a house-steward rather than a gentleman. As I said at the beginning, it would perhaps have been a good film if it were not based on a novel whose atmosphere it does not convey at all. I suggest Jane Austen's fans see the BBC edition (1995). You feel you are inside the book when you see it, for Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are absolutely perfect, and so is the rest of the cast. Sorry for my English."
"jane12125","1","2","9","29 October 2008"," Unforgivable omission
","The 1995 BBC/A&E production of P&P with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth was what got me started reading (and watching) Jane Austen. It is incomparable, and that's partly due to the fact that it's five hours long. I realize that adapting a novel of this length and complexity for a mass-market studio release is difficult, because it's hard to cram it all into two hours. That said, here's my primary objection to this movie (I have about fifteen others): after Darcy's first proposal to Elizabeth and her receipt of his letter explaining his motives in separating Bingley from Jane and his history with Wickham, the novel focuses on Darcy overcoming his pride and Elizabeth overcoming her prejudice. That's the theme. Literally, the moral of the story. And it is utterly and completely missing from this movie. Gone. Totally. Not there. This is unforgivable. The movie's other flaws, huge as they are, pale in comparison to this willful disregard of the author's intent.<br/><br/>A note to those reviewers who have complained about Mr. Bennet being portrayed as a farmer: technically he was, but more in the sense of a gentleman farmer than one who actually labored in the fields or spent any time engaged in animal husbandry. In one scene in the book, there is a discussion of whether the carriage should be sent for, and the point is dismissed as moot, because the horses are busy on the farm. However, the family is described near the beginning of the book as being the ""principal inhabitants"" of the village of Longbourne, indicating they didn't live cheek-by-jowl with their livestock. The filmmakers got this wrong, with everything else."

"irishdncraks","3","1","3","26 January 2014"," Terrible Version of the Book, Perhaps Good Film on its Own
","First of all, let me just clarify that I know that making books into movies is a difficult task and that liberties generally have to be taken in order to fit said books into one, not too long movie. I also realize that directors will take liberties in order to put their own personal stamp on movie. I get it, I really do. However, for me, there is a point at which one can take too many liberties and this is it. I have seen this film on two different occasions, once close to when it came out and a second time very recently, and I can't say that my opinion of it improved on the second viewing. In fact, I had to pause it several times because it made me so angry. I would classify myself as a purist, one who likes movie adaptations to contain the same essence as the book and looks for authenticity in settings and costume. This film did a horrible job in these categories. The costumes are terrible and cannot decide which time period to belong to and the Bennets' home is an atrocity. When Austen writes that they are ""poor"" it means poor in comparison to OTHER WEALTHY, UPPERCLASS individuals, not poor in the literal sense. They had an estate and servants and land and a decent park, not a bunch of loose animals wandering around or (heaven forbid!) running through the house willy nilly. That would not have happened. Furthermore, another issue I have with this film is its portrayal of the characters. Basically, a lot of it is just wrong. In the beginning of film, Jane actually ventures forth (of her own free will) an ILL OPINION OF DARCY. The Jane portrayed by Austen would never do that--in fact, her flaw is that she cannot bring herself to see the bad in people, causing her to let people walk all over her (they couldn't POSSIBLY mean her ill will) which causes problems later on. My list of character discrepancies goes on and on. To be fair, I'm sure this film has some positive cinematic value, but I am too distracted by its faults to appreciate it. I would not recommend this film to die-hard Austen fans or people who cannot deal with historical inaccuracies."

","Ho-hum, here we go again and the hoards of purists who can't enjoy a decent film or appreciate decent acting because of a lack of adherence to the original book and due to historical inaccuracies.<br/><br/>'Pride And Prejudice' is one of the best and most complex books I have ever read, although it's been a while, so I wasn't expecting a two-hour film to get even a decent part of it right, especially with my pre-conceptions of Keira Knightley's (lack of) ability to carry a role like this.<br/><br/>Of course, the film bounded along far too quickly and stitched emotions together much too conveniently, as well as bumbling through the most important aspect of Austen's work, the dialogue, but that didn't take anything away from my overall enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>As a casual follower of Austen's work, it's a lovely re-cap of her book and a chance for newer and younger audiences to appreciate her work at a previously undiscovered level. Unfortunately, it's also a chance for purists to completely smash it to bits with horrendous 1-star reviews of an almost religious intensity.<br/><br/>I thought the acting, particularly Donald Sutherland at the end, was terrific. I really enjoyed this film which gave me a chance to immerse myself in Austen's world for a couple of hours. It's just a shame so many other potential viewers will be put off because of the horribly narrow-minded 1* bashings, instead of taking a chance on Austen's work.<br/><br/>Although the book is without doubt ten-times better, this film is good.

","I am an avid Jane Austin fan and have read all of her books several times. Her stories never get old. My favorite book of all time is Pride and Prejudice. The story of the romance of Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy is timeless. Whenever a movie comes out that tells the tale of my heroine, I am anxious to give it a look see. This version gave me a fresh look at my favorite. I always measure the film to the trueness it stays to the original. On that score, I was middle of the road. I have to say that the actors chosen for the main characters were a great choice, however Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett is not British and fell short for me there, but in the movie he showed a more caring father than the original character ever was. The little add ins showing him in tender moments with his harpy wife and the scene he had with his bookish daughter Mary were sweet and a surprise for me. Keira Knightly was spot on for Elizabeth. Viewing Longbourne as a true farm sort of shocked me but that's what it really was I suppose, otherwise how is an estate to support itself? Time constraints of making a film two hours already takes out essentials and character development that is essential for a Jane Austin adaptation. Lots was left out and things added. I have to say as a film that stands on it's own, it was a good film and the period costumes and scenery were excellent. However, staying true to the book, it fell short for me."

As a film in its own merit without comparing it to the Jane Austen novel, it was barely passable.<br/><br/>Mr. Darcy spoke so fast you felt he was rushing through the sentences to fit the whole film into its running time. He had so many conflicting moods and moments that you didn't warm to him at all, he didn't seem to know himself what he was meant to be like. He spoke sentences like he was reading them straight from the script.<br/><br/>Elizabeth was so flighty and stupid. I hated the dresses she wore. She often looked a mess and completely irritated me all the way through. She had none of the clever wit that she is supposed to possess.<br/><br/>Mr. Bingley...well! What can I say?! He was such a dolt that no woman with an ounce of sense would want to be seen in his company, let alone get married to him! His complete lack of sense or manners was disturbing to say the least.<br/><br/>Jane was pretty but that was all. I never felt drawn to her character or even interested in her fate.<br/><br/>I couldn't work out which of the girls were Kitty or Lydia, they were like vague shadows with no substance. I realised, of course, who Lydia was when the elopement had taken place with Mr Wickham, but even that was unsatisfactory in the extreme. Mr. Wickham looked awful, and not at all the dashing handsome swindler he is supposed to be. We didn't even get to meet him properly or get to know what he was really like, whilst his past relation to the Darcy estate was hurriedly introduced so there was no time to allow this to sink in or take full effect.<br/><br/>Lady Catherine was much too softly spoken to make a forceful, spoilt woman and her arrival at the Bennet house in the early hours of the morning was just ridiculous. I call it house, pig sty may be a better word. Animals wandering through the house?! <br/><br/>The dances were so crowded it was difficult to follow the story at those points.<br/><br/>Altogether, one of the worst films I have ever sat through.

I didn't expect much from Keira Knightley but she surprised me with some spirited exchanges with Mr Darcy. Matthew MacFadyen looks a little defeated by the demands of his part; he's following two magnetic actors, Lawrence Olivier and Colin Firth, and cannot match them for charisma. Donald Sutherland shows no commitment to Mr Bennet, it's a lazy performance. Charlotte Lucas is played by Claudie Blakley who makes you believe in her desperation.

Even though the film wasn't prefect in its telling of the Pride and Prejudice story, it did pretty well, and I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>The bad points of the film are as follows :<br/><br/>1.

","I think everyone has the potential to need a certain amount of kitsch in life. Now I'm not a person, that is generally inclined towards these kinds of movies. It depends often on little nuances in the developing and treatment of a story. And when it's done right (like here for example, there is the right amount of irony throughout the movie), I like it. This kind of romanticizing would be wrong in stories that try to be realistic or those, which are at least trying to create a close-to-life feeling. But when a film never pretends to be anything else than a fantasy, a fairytale, this romanticism can work. And here it does. Keira Knightley is a gifted actress and absolutely lovable as Lizzy (a deserved Oscar-nomination for her), while the whole ensemble plays very well. The extensive use of dramatic music is also working extremely fine. I would be thrilled to see, if director Joe Wright would be able to make another good Jane Austen adaptation, because this one is a success."

For all of Mrs. Bennet's married lifetime, it is to find suitable husbands for all of her daughters. But for the second one Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) or Lizzie as she is affectionately known, she does not want to be married no matter what.<br/><br/>One day, the Bennets received news that a wealthy bachelor and his friends are coming to take up a summer residence nearby where they are residing. Naturally especially for Mrs. Bennet, this is good news. At the ball, there's Charles Bingley (Simon Woods) and his sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly) and even Bingley's friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden).<br/><br/>So while Mr. Bingley had been taken with the eldest Bennet daughter Jane, Lizzie does not like his friend Mr. Darcy at all. She thought he is just arrogant.<br/><br/>Or is it really the case? <br/><br/>Jane Austen's work of the same name certainly lives up to its film version. With all that beautiful setting which is so Georgian England in Jane Austen's time, it's quite a joy and delight to watch it.

The classic tale of love and misunderstanding unfolds in class-conscious England near the close of the 18th century. Faithful to the setting and period of the beloved novel and filmed entirely on location in the UK, this is the first movie version of the story in 65 years.<br/><br/>The five Bennet sisters - Lizzie (Keira Knightley), Jane (Rosamund Pike), Lydia (Jena Malone), Mary (Talulah Riley) and Kitty (Carey Mulligan) - have been raised well aware of their mother's fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures. The spirited and intelligent Elizabeth, however, strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her doting father. When wealthy bachelor Mr Bingley (Simon Woods) takes up residence in a nearby mansion, the Bennets are abuzz. Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of London friends and the influx of young militia officers, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. Eldest daughter Jane, serene and beautiful, seems poised to win Mr Bingley's heart. For her part, Lizzie meets with the handsome and - it would seem - snobbish Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), and the battle of the sexes is joined. Their encounters are frequent and spirited yet far from encouraging. Lizzie finds herself even less inclined to accept a marriage proposal from a distant cousin, Mr Collins (Tom Hollander) and - supported by her father - stuns her mother and Mr Collins by declining.<br/><br/>When the heretofore good-natured Mr Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens Lizzie's eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr Darcy. The ensuing rush of feelings leaves no one unchanged, and inspires the Bennets and everyone around them to reaffirm what is most important in life."

","The best Elizabeth I've seen in this role, but the actor playing Darcy was wretched. He substituted mere depression for what Austen depicted: social unease and selectivity. Likewise, Wickham wasn't portrayed as a bounder, rather as a handsome, pleasant fellow who perhaps stretched the truth a little. The costumes and sets were superb, as was the writing. Many of Austen's epigrams remain in the script, but some of the marvelous back stories like Charlotte Lucas's philosophy of marriage in contrast to Elizabeth's don't play out. Compared to Charlotte, Elizabeth seems a romantic in this film, hardly Austen's view."

","Funny thing.. I ended up watching this film completely accidentally and I wasn't at all disappointed! However, perhaps it was because I knew nothing of the plot, or watched any previous versions or read the book that accounts for me finding this satisfactory. When discussing the film with an ex literature student you do realise that some facts are omitted or altered. Of course, most of us out there are not literature students and so should be pleased with this. If you want the best version, the read the book obviously! And now that this film has entered me into this world, I for one intend to.<br/><br/>The film takes us back to another era, a time were matters were conducted very differently than our day.. to say the least. My friend and I were rather shocked at some of the things revealed about how women were treated. One of my remarks was actually that : 'that these women lived to get married!' Certainly this film gives us a great insight into a time that some of us know very little about. And you really do get invested in these characters that become so realistic to you. Even if the circumstances at first seem unfamiliar to you, certain matters ,you realise, never change.<br/><br/>Empathy for Lizie and Mr Darcy grow as the plot goes on, so that at the end of every one of their encounters you just wish that the two fools just admit what they feel for each other; despite the hint at the back of your mind that they will do so in the end (that is if you have somehow not heard of the story before, which I really do not know how I have not come across before and probably am of a group of very few people).<br/><br/>Overall a great film, with Jane Austen's work setting the foundations for the many romantic comedies that we have before us today. Well, that is what I have been told from my literature-expert friend! Performances are amazing throughout.. from Kiera Knightley to the younger actresses who play her sisters.<br/><br/>Definitely a film that I would recommend.. especially if at heart you are a hopeless romantic!"
"fwomp","7","1","3","20 April 2006"," A Good (Not Great) Adaptation
","Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has been translated to film several times now  from Robert Leonard's 1940 ""attempt"" starring Laurence Olivier, to the 1980 and 1995 TV miniseries', and now on to a new theatrical release here. Having read the book and seen all of these adaptations, I feel I can comment objectively on what does and doesn't work with regards to director Joe Wright's newest version.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. It's beautifully filmed (from gnarled old trees to stunning sunsets against old English mansions) and the cast performs well. I even liked Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods, FOYLE'S WAR TV series) and the rest of the actors. They seemed to be able to grasp the internal dynamics of their respective characters and pulled in fine performances. Keira Knightley (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, 2002) does a good job as Lizzie Bennett but appears upbeat far too often during a time when love and loss went hand in hand. Matthew Macfayden (WUTHERING HEIGHTS TV series) does an admirable Mr. Darcy but being up against a giant of the English acting world from a previous adaptation made his character representation a bit tougher when it came to comparisons.<br/><br/>Now let's get into my main problem: the pacing. I usually don't mind fast-paced films, but Jane Austen's book is anything but quick (checking in at around 500 pages depending on which publisher you choose). Books of this size tend to be difficult to translate to the silver screen (or TV) because of their scope, and this was the big ""ouch"" for this film. Clocking in at 129 minutes, condensing the book in such a drastic manner meant clipping out chapters and causing a bit of confusion. The confusion comes from the lack of understanding a new viewer might have IF they've never seen any of the previous TV/movie versions or IF they've never read the novel. When Lydia runs off with ""the wrong man"" it is a vital portion of the story that is only touched on and could seem disorienting to the new Pride and Prejudice viewer. We never see what happens to Lydia in London, nor do we see the wedding and where Mr. Darcy's pressure exerts itself.<br/><br/>Comparisons will obviously be made between this theatrical release and the 1995 miniseries (which many, including myself, feel is the penultimate adaptation of Mrs. Austen's book). Some might complain that it isn't fair to make such comparisons because one was designed for television while the other was meant for theater. I'll grant that. But with the lengthy films that've come out of Hollywood lately (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc.), I don't feel that this new version would've suffered in the slightest by lengthening its running time and thus adding a better sense of coherency to many of the side stories. The 1995 miniseries also had an incredible benefit in that Mr. Darcy was played by the estimable Colin Firth (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998), and it is THIS Mr. Darcy that many hold as the high standard for such work. Try putting Matthew Macfayden up against Mr. Firth and you'll see what I mean; there's just no comparing them.<br/><br/>I did give this film a positive review because a) I liked the cinematography, and b) the acting was generally well done. But for emotional impact and excellent character portrayals look to the 1995 miniseries."

Lizze's sis Joan is the prettiest person in the movie. Joan's undying love for Mr. bimgly is also well presented.

","In early 19th century, rural England, opinionated young Lizzie Bennet (Keira Knightley) falls for, and simultaneously despises, the proud Mr Darcy (Matthew McFadyen). If you like a romantic 'bonnet' comedy there's a lot you'll enjoy in the third movie adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. The beautiful Knightley plays Lizzie with just the right measure of fire and youthful intolerance. Opposite her, alas, is a sulky and sallow looking Darcy, who seems to think the movie is called Grump & Prejudice. Nevertheless, the rest of the characters thrive in an atmosphere that's over art-directed, but more pleasantly bucolic than the mimsy elegance of some BBC adaptations. Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet must be old enough to be the girls' grandfather, and Brenda Blethyn, as Mrs Bennet, looks drunk, but, by Jove, they're having fun!"

","I am not burdened by having seen the famous BBC ""P & P"" from 1995, nor have I read the original Austen book. I saw ""Pride & Prejudice"" first and foremost for Keira Knightley, who has bewitched me. She throws herself into Lizzie, and we cheer for her throughout, as she fends off unwanted suitors and interfering rich matrons with equal parts aplomb and sarcasm. Her performance retains the veneer of the period, but her attitudes and behavior as a strong-willed, independent woman are quite modern.<br/><br/>Lizzie's final walk through the fields, an impeccably staged and filmed treat for movie-lovers everywhere, are the most exquisite two minutes I have ever seen in a motion picture. I can not stop watching it on the DVD, over and over again (1:51:40-1:53:53). Thanks, Joe Wright. You and your crew have fashioned a timeless image that hopeless romantics like myself can savor forever.<br/><br/>""I'm sure the feelings which hindered your regard will help you overcome it."""

For this reason, P&P will never be wildly popular in North America even though it deserves to be. But forget them. I've been married for almost 10 years now, and had been a reluctant audience to many a ""chickflicks"", so I'm a semi hostile authority on this genre. For me though, this is the BEST chickflick I have ever seen! Everybody's performance is so good as if their lives depended on it. Keira Knightley is absolutely gorgeous. Angelina who? I would watch it again just to see Keira. Hey, if my wife would watch every Brad Pitt movie, why can't I? The film brings the era to life, and if you allow yourself to be, you would be absorbed into the times. The language shows that English can be just as elegant as French, and it's sad to see it evolve into the sad state it is today.

","Excellent direction, acting, script, character development, sets, photography, editing. I believe Jane Austen would have been well satisfied with this film version of her book. Even though a successful life for a woman in 1800s England was limited to marriage (successful or not) the Bennet family is real, the characters are real, their aspirations are real and what makes Jane Austen's books forever current is that we become the characters in her book and in this wonderful remake of the movie. But, even without sound the movie is a glorious visual feast. Some landscape scenes are beautiful art that could grace the walls of my home. And the brooding scenes of Keira Knightley are not just seen, but also felt. She is the Vivian Leigh of Gone With The Wind. This movie is a classic."

","I was thoroughly impressed with this movie. I am a great Jane Austen fan, and I was afraid that the movie would not follow along with the plot and the time frame guidelines it required to make it work. I was, however, shocked. It was beautifully filmed and written. I felt like I had been thrown into the book itself, and it became reality to me. With beautiful shots of scenery, excellent music, and PERFECT casting, this is now my favourite movie of all time. I have viewed all movie versions of the book, and I am positive that this is the best. Keira Knightley was brilliant, no doubt. She captured our beloved Elizabeth Bennet's prideful character, and her stubborn attitude about submiting to the behaviours of her family. She is seen as a human of thought amongst the flocks of women about her, with only marriage on their minds. Mr. Darcy did not disappoint us as well. He was the rude, cold, and unbearably judgemental being we knew to hate in the beginnings of this story, but we learned of his shyness and honour, as well as his feelings later on, and come to love him as Lizzie does. I felt every character's sincerity as they became the people that make the book and film work smoothly, and the actors make it so realistic and believable, because the plot is so normal, and yet so fantastic. The sub-plots in the story come to great endings as well, leaving movie-goers satisfied long after they leave their theatre seats. A beautiful story that has made me cry every time I've viewed it (23 times so far!), it is a thought-provoking and wonderfully capturing film, that shows the importance in judging someone by first impressions."

It is one of the few stories that has connected with everybody and really staid alive through about two-hundred years. The acting is amazing. Keira Knightley has given some decent performances before but is now amazing and should have taken Reese Witherspoon out for the Oscar. Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, and everybody else are also amazing and Oscar worthy. The direction is also fine and Oscar worthy. He gets everything done correctly.

"EUyeshima","9","1","3","20 March 2006"," Robust Adaptation of Familiar Austen Novel Is One First-Class Production
","You would think that Jane Austen's most famous novel is not in need of another cinematic treatment given the definitive BBC version of a decade ago and the classic 1940 MGM version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, not to mention a contemporary 2004 Bollywood-style musical and according to IMDb, at least six other versions. However, first-time feature director Joe Wright and first-time screenwriter Deborah Moggach (with uncredited assistance from Austen adaptation veteran Emma Thompson) have brought youthful vigor and a wild, Thomas Hardy-like element to the movie, and as a whole, it works very well. It almost makes the overly familiar novel feel revitalized.<br/><br/>For those who have forgotten their required high school reading, the story focuses on the downscale Bennet family - a passive father and a domineering mother, the latter intent on marrying off their five daughters to wealthy families. Eldest daughter Jane becomes smitten with rich but somewhat weak-willed Mr. Bingley and the bookish Mary keeps to her piano, while the two youngest daughters, Kitty and Lydia, are giggly and boy-crazy. On the other hand, the headstrong Elizabeth wants marriage on her terms with an intellectual equal, and she becomes alternately repelled and drawn to the brooding Mr. Darcy. There are several plot lines that interweave precariously toward the inevitable conclusion, but Austen's witty, often insightful dialogue holds the story together organically with grace and humor.<br/><br/>Twenty-year old Keira Knightley is the youthful embodiment of Elizabeth, as her predecessors, Garson in particular, always strike me as too mature for the role. With her beauty subdued in casual period fashion, she manages to convey all the necessary facets of her personality with a natural élan. As Darcy, Matthew Macfayden captures the moody character's insolence and growing romanticism with little affectation. Most all of the supporting players shine with Brenda Blethyn as the exasperating Mrs. Bennet, Donald Sutherland as her introspective husband, Tom Hollander as the priggish Mr. Collins, Rosamund Pike as beautiful and likable Jane, Jena Malone convincingly British as the impulsive Lydia, and of course, in all her scene stealing glory, Judi Dench lends acidic vinegar as Lady Catherine, Darcy's disapproving aunt.<br/><br/>Parts of the film have a subtly stylized quality, such as the way the camera seems to track uninterrupted during the Assembly Hall ball sequence or when Elizabeth's head spins symbolically as she sits on a swing. There are also many well-turned tableaux-style shots that imbue the spirit of the period with vivid but unobtrusive detail. Credit should go to Roman Osin's textured and sumptuous cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's authentic-feeling costumes and Dario Marianelli's flavorful music, all of which capture a decidedly realistic though ultimately romanticized 16th-century England.<br/><br/>The DVD package has several too-short features that provide some background into the production and Austen's characters but hardly enough to provide meaningful insight. Wright provides sometimes interesting commentary on an alternate track that borders a bit on the effusive, and there is an alternative and thankfully excised ending which spells out the plot resolutions unnecessarily. This movie is a joyous celebration of Austen's artistry as a writer whose story themes resonate today."

","Best in 2006<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice, there's only one reason to watch it - Matthew Macfadyen. Kidding. He's great but the reason is Pride and Prejudice is the ""Mother of All Romantic Stories"". Since first published almost 200 years ago, it became a basis for a lot of romantic plots - like Bridget Jones's Diary and You've Got Mail.<br/><br/>Having watched the 1995 BBC production, which starred Colin Firth, my only complaint to this film is that it's too short and fast-paced - but certainly it shall attract more viewers. The story is a combination of humor, witty dialogues and romance; it's a tough road for both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but they learn that they are not always right and changed - for the better. <br/><br/>Watch out for some comical characters - Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins - try not to laugh too much. <br/><br/>This movie I hope would catch attention from our youth and young at heart alike, because the plot was dearly directed to squeeze a 6-hour screening time from the British Broadcasting Company into a 2-hour film. Of course nothing still beats a reading of the book; there are a few misses, as what happens when books are translated into movies, but the hits are WORTH the watch. It's a very interesting starter for those who have been SOOO BORED with English classic movies, because the plot is as FRESH AND TOUCHING as before as it is today. <br/><br/>I had never read a classic book in my life until I got curious with the book the character Kathleen Kelly was reading and talking about with Joe Fox in You've Got Mail. Remember the scene at Cafe Lola when Meg was holding a book with a red rose inserted in it, waiting to meet Tom Hanks? Yeah! That's the book, Pride and Prejudice. Thanks to this slight introduction, I've become acquainted with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, and so much enjoyed reading it, that I named my email after Mr. Darcy, the gentleman in the story. Too much description of them would be a spoiler. <br/><br/>Go watch it!!! Although I personally felt that Kiera Knightley had come on too strong, the movie is still simply awesome. Being nominated in the best actress category, the musical score category, and the best director category, I'd bet for the musical score and the best director. Cheers for this movie!!! <br/><br/>If I can only watch one movie this year - definitely Pride and Prejudice."
"landmpennell","9","1","3","4 March 2006"," Don't Compare P&P 2005 to P&P 1995
","I must say that I love Jane Austen and any fruit from Jane Austen's works. I tend to be more than willing to enjoy a movie based on one of her books. I was very curious as to how successful a 2-hour version of Pride and Prejudice could be and ended up being delighted. I think the best approach a viewer could take to watching the 2005 version is to not compare it to the longer, truer-to-the-book BBC version from 1995. This is two hours of delightful, romantic and humorous diversion with some great lines not previously found in other movie versions of Pride and Prejudice. To streamline the story and reduce this huge and detailed work, the writers chose to limit the Collins role and almost eliminate the Wickham role. This is unfortunate and causes the movie to lose some of its insight into human character. However, the sexual tension between Elizabeth and Darcy is palpable in a way one senses in the book but is not as easily or deliberately conveyed in previous movie versions. Knightly and MacFadyen have chemistry that brings the movie alive. Mrs. Bennet is subdued compared to her character in the book...not faithful to Austen, but more enjoyable to the viewer. Mr. Bennet is also more gently, but not faithfully played by Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>So, watch this movie and enjoy the beautiful music, excellent cinematography, witty dialogue (even if not always completely true to the book--it stays true to the characters) and beautiful conclusion. The European version ends before Darcy asks for Elizabeth's hand from Mr. Bennett. The American version continues on to post-marriage. Which ending would you have preferred?"

"jluis1984","7","1","3","15 February 2006"," Great movie, despite its flaws...
","I went to watch the new adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel ""Pride & Prejudice"" knowing that the lead actress, Keira Knightley, was nominated to an Academy Award. While the Awards may not always be accurate, I had big expectations of her performance in the movie, and sadly, i was disappointed. Despite this, the movie is a brilliant adaptation of the classic and makes justice to Austen's work.<br/><br/>Knightley plays our main character, Elizabeth Bennet; who is a woman with a strong will uncommon in her age. Her family has economic troubles, increased by the fact that her father, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is old, and since none of his five daughters has married, with his death the property will go to the next male relative. For this reason, her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is completely obsessed with getting her daughters married.<br/><br/>Nothing of this matters for Elizabeth, since she has a bad opinion of men, an opinion who seems to be confirmed by Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who has just come to the village with Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods),a rich man who falls in love with Elizabeth's older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). Darcy's apparently is a selfish arrogant man full of pride and this may confirm Elizabeth's opinion about men, or is this just only prejudice? Jane Austen's novel is adapted to screen one more time in the debut of Joe Wright as a director. Deborah Moggach's screenplay is remarkably good and the adaptation is quite accurate. While it is not the most faithful adaptation, it is the most adequate, as it keeps the spirit of Austen's work and its everlasting charm. It is not free of flaws, as the very short screen-time of Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) truly affects the power of later actions of the main characters.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Joe Wright makes a very good job as a director, and he gives us images of enormous beauty and is capable of printing the soul of the written word in film. The superb camera-work is outstanding but at times, its beauty seems to overshadow the cast.<br/><br/>This takes me to the film's weakest link. Don't get me wrong, most of the cast have done a great job, particularly Tom Hollander as the Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins; his performances is remarkable and gives a sympathetic view to his pathetic character.<br/><br/>The problem in the cast, is that the two main characters are very strong and in stands the backbone of the tale, the clash of two very stubborn and strong wills, however, in the film both Knightley and Macfayden lack that strength and make the characters not as believable. Keira Knightley's performance is a bit above average, a disappointment considering she was nominated for this movie, although she manages to carry the film with grace. The problem is that Macfayden gives a very poor acting as he seems unable to transmit Mr. Darcy's powerful presence.<br/><br/>However, this flaw doesn't hurt the film and ""Pride & Prejudice"" remains a great film adaptation. Maybe it won't be the best of all, but is a good version that fits quite well the current times. 7/10"

It did not compare to the emotional suspense that the newer version had included, and I found that the lessened dialogue was beneficial to the overall impact of the movie. The actors were fabulous, and Kiera Knightly did an outstanding performance alongside Matthew McFadyen, who was just as mysterious as Colin Firth in his role. The cinematography was MUCH improved, and the fact that it was condensed made for better viewing without needing to interrupt the movie.<br/><br/>In general, the love is more evident in the newer one, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!"

","I really liked this movie!A few years ago in Serbia & Montenegro the series ""Pride and Prejudice"" had been shown and I liked it,too.My opinion is that the series was better,but it is normal because it is longer and describes situations in many details.I think that this movie could be longer than it was. Acting is more than a great one,especially Keira's.She had showed gentles and truth talent,so in some situations you can feel all love among Elisabet and Mr.Darcy in some wrapped way.Their love hurt themselves and I could have that experience during a movie.I think that this movie shows people what pride and especially prejudice can make to all of us,even break great loves or cause great tragics! So,people,WITHOUT PREJUDICE and PRIDE,you have an example to learn from this movie!The pair escaped the dangerous trap of prejudices,and will you?Try it,it is maybe hard,but is worthy of that!

Rosamund Pike did a good job as well, but several times during the movie, I couldn't help but thinking that she looked to old to play Jane. Was I the only one who thought that? She looked way older than Simon Woods, who plays Mr. Bingley, and way older than the girls who played her younger sisters... But weren't her character supposed to be around 20 years old(she is 26)?

"cwrdlylyn","9","1","3","3 February 2006"," PRIDE & PREJUDICE : Keira Knightley Illuminates The Screen In Joe Wright's Beautiful Debut...
","PRIDE & PREJUDICE <br/><br/>Joe Wright's PRIDE & PREJUDICE is an example of how lush and indulgent a film can be with it visuals, while still balancing a perfectly told story. It's an exemplary retelling of an unquestionably classic story, well suited to today's audience, yet never ""giving in"" to the demands of modern audience.<br/><br/>By steering clear of romanticizing the story and it's setting, Joe Wright has made Jane Austen's classic all the more compelling. The beauty does not entirely lie in the lavish gowns and perfectly decorated houses, it lies in the lifestyles of it's characters. The interaction between the Bennet family... their desire to use the little finances they have and make a luxurious living... their longing for true love, and the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Incredible camera tricks are used to show the passage of time, and they never feel gimmicky or out of place. Overall, this is an incredible debut for a director that shows promise to become a major force in revitalizing the genre of classic literature put on film.<br/><br/>The story evolves around the Bennet family, a middle class family with a mother desperately trying to marry off her 5 daughters despite the lack of a dowry. Though we watch the romantic and social activities of all the daughters, the focus lies in the tumultuous courting of Elizabeth Bennet (played beautifully by the stunning Keira Knightly) by the rigid Mr. Darcy (Matthew McFadyen).<br/><br/>Though the story the center story of Elizabeth and Darcy seems to travel slowly to an inevitable conclusion, the twists and turns that bring us their offer plenty of surprises. And the witty dialogue and dynamite performances managed to keep me guessing as to how these two would ever end up together.<br/><br/>Aside from Joe Wright's direction (and perhaps to be attributed to his direction), the performances of the entire ensemble is perfection. Brenda Blethyn as the matriarchal Mrs. Bennet does exactly what Blethyn always does... but she does it perfectly here. Donald Sutherland brings a serenity to the film with his calm and charming performance as Mr. Bennet. And credit must be given to Matthew McFadyen for taking the role of Mr. Darcy (a role many people argue to be perfectly captured by Colin Firth in the BBC version) and capturing the cold nature of his outer personality, while also conveying the sensitive, lonely, and socially awkward man struggling on the inside.<br/><br/>However, the film unquestionably belongs to Keira Knightley. She has the perfect combination of talented actress and ethereal charm and beauty... with a pinch of tom-boyishness. The eyes are drawn to her in every scene she's in, and half the time I couldn't realize if it was because I was just stunned by her looks or if I was just completely invested into her pin-point portrayal. Only after leaving the theatre did I realize it was for both of those reasons. Every aspect of her performance works, and thankfully Knightley received the Academy Award nomination that her performance certainly merits.<br/><br/>For 2 hours, Joe Wright and his leading lady managed to take PRIDE & PREJUDICE, a piece of classic literature that never interested me, and make me a fan of Jane Austen. Hats off to a job well done, and I can't wait to see what's next in store from this talented director.<br/><br/>... A- ..."
"superratty-tmy","Null","1","3","12 January 2006"," The Fallen Pride of the Critics
","Pride and Prejudice 2005 is a very good film, to put it simply. It is British in every possible way. Perhaps the script has adapted itself a little more than fans would like, it does not mean that the film lost it's 17/18th century English-ness.<br/><br/>Before the film's release, many people expressed grave prejudices over the trailer, stating that it's too sexed up, and over Hollywood-ized. These people include critics and prominent writers. Die-hard fans of Jane Austen books were unable to see Keira Knightley play Elizabeth well. Basically, most of the reviews came before the show itself.<br/><br/>That is a common problem with film today, and after watching Pride and Prejudice, it is easy to see why there are no more ""sexed up"" comments, because the movie is not sexed up at all. There is a genuine British conservative-ness in Pride and Prejudice, and most of the lovers hardly even touch each other throughout the film.<br/><br/>Sexed up? No way. Pride and Prejudice is a cinematic experience not worth missing. With beautiful cinematography, consistent editing, and a very convincing performance all around (especially by MacFayden, who plays Darcy), Pride and Prejudice is a testament to how pre-release hype of negativity can be so utterly embarrassing.<br/><br/>8/10"

If you are under 13 years old don't go see it because you will defiently be sitting in the theater going 'what the heck is going on?' like I did. It is a good movie for adults with big minds though! For big thinkers! I think the plot was cute, but I couldn't understand what they were saying sometimes either. With their accents. I wish I did know what was going on though, because a lot of adults said that it was a really good movie."

","I was bowled over by the revolutionary break from ++elegant++ traditional P&P houses and settings characterizing the earlier P&P versions; absolutely wonderful and so much more what I imagine the reality was of that place - country England - and time. I was very disappointed with some of the dialogue which was so contemporary, and with what the script writer/s left out, some scenes where the dialogue faded away to nothing. Worst of all, for me, the speech was so fast in places it was unrealistic and very off-putting. Lastly, Elizabeth - Kiera Knightley is extremely attractive, but the world's greatest actress ?? Give me a break ... compared to the 1980s and 1990s Elizabeths, Kiera was very superficial. She has an extremely expressive face and is very attractive ... but her voice ... ugh! Overall though, a fabulous addition to the collection of P&Ps!!"
"deathilicious","10","1","3","5 December 2005"," The best movie I have ever watched!!!
","Pride and Prejudice is the BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. The acting is great, the story is easy to follow and the whole movie overall is absolutely magnificent. The story: *In class-conscious England near the close of the 18th century, the five Bennet sisters-Elizabeth/Lizzie , Jane, Lydia, Mary, and Kitty-have been raised well aware of their mother's fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures. The spirited and intelligent Elizabeth, however, strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her doting father. When wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley takes up residence in a nearby mansion, the Bennets are abuzz. Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of London friends and the influx of young militia officers, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. Eldest daughter Jane, serene and beautiful, seems poised to win Mr. Bingley's heart. For her part, Lizzie meets with the handsome and-it would seem-snobbish Mr. Darcy, and the battle of the sexes is joined. Their encounters are frequent and spirited yet far from encouraging. Lizzie finds herself even less inclined to accept a marriage proposal from a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, and-supported by her father-stuns her mother and Mr. Collins by declining. When the heretofore good-natured Mr. Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr. Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens Lizzie's eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Darcy.* Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen did a brilliant job as the roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy respectively. I'll be sure to catch a movie a second time if given the opportunity!"

I also much prefer Colin Firth although Matthew did a fine job....it just wasn't as powerful.<br/><br/>I love the storyline but 2 hours didn't do it justice. I still prefer the 1995 version as the one to beat. I could watch the 1995 BBC version over and over and never get bored. This current version I would not consider seeing a second time.<br/><br/>Again, no problem with their effort...just that they had big shoes to fill...and they just didn't fill them."
"sassyblackgirl","7","1","3","30 November 2005"," good but not great (as compared to the BBC version)
","Overall the movie looked beautiful and was quite well (not very well - quite well) acted, although it seemed to be rushed and may not have been perfectly cast. I did think that Mrs. Bennett and also Judi dench, of course - of course, did particularly excellent jobs. Even before i saw the movie, though, i couldn't quite accept keira as Elizabeth Bennett, she strikes me as being too anorexic to be a Jane Austen heroine but still she did do her best in her role. I think like most other fans of P&P, i may be prejudiced by the BBC version, since that certainly was a longer, more extended, and therefore more faithful version of the novel. The new movie version may have had a larger budget and a more recognizable star roster to it, but as i said before i felt it edited out too much of the book and did not contribute as much character development (even for minor characters) as i would have liked. This actually just may be a problem for all movie versions of great novels, although i did not think this of Emma Thompson's sense & sensibility or the adaption of persuasion. However, the cinematography, costumes, locations, etc. were all great to look at and i did admire the camera work particularly in the ball scenes, which were perhaps better done than in the quieter, more stage-like BBC version. Still the BBC version did have a greater Elizabeth and Darcy, so as I have said before the new version has a lot of prejudice to overcome."

","my dear readers, this lovely adaptation of my favorite jane austen novel once again proves that the words, ""based on a novel by"" (insert your favorite author here) mean nothing less. it is not the novel, and yet people will continuously lambast it for not being so. keira knightly does a splendid job as eliza, as anyone (especially males) will tell you. she is beautiful, strong, funny, loyal, and everything that eliza was meant to be. matthew macfayden as darcy is also quite effective. yes, he is played as painfully shy, but he does show the snottiness that we loathe him for in the novel. i think that the depth of feeling expressed in this adaptation is uncharacteristic of previous screen plays that are not so much based on as slaves to jane austen's novels and the public's rather staid image of them. it was meant to appeal to the masses, and not only to those that can understand and adore the subtleties of georgian English. herein lies the rub. it is funny. it is charming. it is romantic and entertaining. and it is NOT the novel. if you want the novel, my dears, go read the novel. i cannot see how either can fail to satisfy."
"Ada_Wong65","10","1","3","13 November 2005"," My review on Pride & Prejudice
","This film is absolutely beautiful. I love it, I love it, I love it. Anyways, the entire scenery of the movie was great. I really felt that I was actually in the movie, eavesdropping on everything.<br/><br/>I think I may have found my future husband in Matthew Macfayden. X.X He just is Mr.Darcy! I have seen the BBC adaption and I found Colin Firth's performance to be absolutely awesome but I believe there's now room for two Mr.Darcy's.<br/><br/>While Macfayden is excellent, Keira Knightley is just superb. Many people have thought of her to be tolerable in other films. I believe she has proved herself since she first started movies such as Bend it Like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribeann, The Jacket, and more. With similar looks of a combined Natalie Portman and Winona Ryder, Keira Knightley is Lizzie Bennet.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are fine as well. Rosamund Pike is great as the shy and modest, Jane. Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland are just great as usual. Judi Dench is nothing short of excellent. The other sisters are cute and giggly. Mr.Bingley is funny and great. I had a good laugh at Mr.Collins.<br/><br/>In short, I will definitely be seeing this again. Adios!"
"Sweet_Ophelia","8","1","3","5 November 2005"," Delightedly surpassed my expectations
","I took many prejudices into my viewing of this film. I, like numerous others, am a huge Jane Austen fan and 'Pride and Prejudice' is a favorite, as is the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle BBC version. I was critical of the need for a remake of this classic, since I thought the BBC couldn't be topped and Colin Firth was the quintessential Darcy Â– let me tell you, I was wrong and proud to admit it!<br/><br/>Deborah Moggach has written a screen-play which competently allows both newcomers and Jane Austen buffs plenty of enjoyment. The time limit for film (127 minutes) means that Moggach had to develop Darcy and Elizabeth's affection fairly quickly, so that it doesn't seem strained when they begin to make doe eyes at each other towards film's end. Moggach makes clear their liking from the get-go, Darcy shyly eyes Elizabeth at his introductory ball and Elizabeth is clearly wounded when she overhears Darcy's sharp remarks about her to Bingley. From there it is easy to see, through carefully placed side-ways glances and meaningful quick touches that Darcy and Elizabeth have chemistry, though both are too stubborn to admit it in the beginning. This immediate attraction will no doubt make the rest of the story more plausible for first time viewers. <br/><br/>The cast is perfect, and I say this having previously had deep concerns about the very young, very modernly attractive and somewhat inexperienced Keira Knightley playing Lizzie, and the very un-Colin Firth, Matthew MacFadyen as the infamous Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is absolutely wonderful as the rebellious and quick-witted Lizzie Bennett; she has a certain charm and warmth that radiates and immediately seduces but also a deep wisdom behind those almond eyes which gives her a fine maturity. I honestly do not have enough praise; this is her first lead in a movie and she carries herself with perfect grace, her role also clarifies that despite her exceeding beauty, it is her talent which will see her survive longer than any other current 'it' girl in Hollywood. I still have a somewhat mixed attitude towards MacFayden, who is little known outside of the U.K for his role in the TV series ""Spooks"". No doubt he exceeded my expectations, but I still wouldn't give him boundless praise. He did bring a sweet, alluring shyness to the often stiffly stern character of Darcy, but there were still some moments when his delivery was cardboard and his voice monotone. Undoubtedly and unfortunately MacFayden won't please everyone, perhaps through no fault of his own but rather audience unfairness; but for my part I think he gave a satisfying performance but wasn't able to really set himself apart from any other former or future Darcy's, his performance simply wasn't 'remarkable' or really individual. However, the character of Darcy is very much adored, and MacFayden did have big riding boots to fill, sometimes the character is just too gargantuan for any actor to really do them justice, this is no doubt the case in this film. <br/><br/>Lizzie and Darcy aside, I was really impressed with the minor cast for this film. Brenda Blethyn as the effusive social-climber Mrs. Bennett is absolutely fabulous and hilarious, while Donald Sutherland beautifully portrays a very loving and kind-hearted Mr. Bennett. The two of them together are a perfect match, and I particularly liked seeing a real affection between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett in one small scene, which beautifully and subtly explained why they put up with each other. Simon Woods's Mr. Bingley is so fantastic; he was clumsy and awkward but so sweet and adorable, his performance got many laughs out of me. Tom Hollander was very funny as Mr. Collins, not through outlandish slap-stick as some actors feel necessary for such a character, but through subtlety; scenes which showed his short 5' 5"" stature beside 6' 2"" Matthew MacFadyen or when he bought an earnestness to Mr. Collins's ridiculousness. I also feel the needed to praise Claudie Blakley as Lizzie's friend Charlotte who marries Mr. Collins; Deborah Moggach included a very poignant and telling scene in which Charlotte tells Lizzie of her engagement, to which Lizzie replies with shock and horror. Illuminating the undercurrents of novel and film, about social hierarchy and the role of women in the Georgian era, Charlotte near tears expresses her fear at being 27 and unmarried with no prospects but Mr. Collins, and her guilt at still being a burden on her parents. Moggach does well at including these small but intricate scenes, another is when Lydia (Jena Malone) kneels in the carriage as she waves her family goodbye, but is quickly pulled down by Wickham (Rupert Friend), the scene is shot through a dirty window, but we can glimpse for a moment the sort of life Lydia will lead with the devious Wickham, as we watch him tersely tell her off. <br/><br/>If I have any complaints about the film it would be Joe Wright's direction. Sometimes the grandeur of the sets is lost and unable to be admired as he has an obsession with close-ups; certain scenes (like the ball-room ones) would be better done in wide-lens. Also, the close-ups are sometimes shaky and not of the best quality; the ball-room Darcy and Elizabeth dance sequence gave me a headache as it remained on both their faces as they relayed in a lengthy and taut conversation while the blurry tops of other dancers heads in the foreground whizzed by. Though Wright's camera techniques are questionable, the cinematography by Roman Osin is not. The sets are beautiful- sweeping English countryside assure that this is most definitely the world of Jane Austen, and one particular scene of Lizzie atop a mountain rock (I thought that billowing dress would blow her ass over tit!) is absolutely glorious!<br/><br/>This really is a delightful film; fans of Jane Austen's novel will be pleasantly surprised and newcomers to Pride and Prejudice will be seduced- highly recommended!"

"r_d_finch","7","2","10","5 September 2007"," A good but not great version of a great novel
","Having just watched the most recent version of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I must say that although a respectable effort, this version is in every way inferior to the 1995 mini-series. The only element that measures up to that landmark version is Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth, and I couldn't help noticing how closely her features, gestures, facial expressions, and line readings resembled those of Jennifer Ehle. One problem is that the movie is just too short to adequately capture the atmosphere of the book. The first third of the movie is particularly irritating. It seems to have been constructed for viewers with the attention spans of ten-year olds. Thus we have a series of overly condensed, hyperactive, almost ""short-hand-like"" scenes that completely fail to engage the emotions. The rushed, clipped line readings are especially annoying, and both they and the frenzied pacing prevent any significant interaction between the characters. The movie improves when the pace finally relaxes, about one-third of the way through. Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench are well cast, although both of these actresses seem obvious choices who could play these roles in their sleep. And there are other more serious problems. Aside from Elizabeth, the Bennet girls are only sketchily defined. (At least the incessant coughing of Kitty has been eliminated, about the only improvement on the source material.) I particularly missed the close, confidential relationship between the two oldest sisters. Donald Sutherland seems a poor choice to play Mr. Bennet; his wonderfully written dialogue never once sounds natural, and his close relationship with Elizabeth and respect for her good sense and intelligence are not adequately conveyed. The Bennets are far too countrified and peasant-like, and their house too much a mucky working farm, not the shabby-genteel urban home it should be. Why would Mr. Collins covet such a run-down, undesirable property? Matthew MacFadyen is never more than adequate as Mr. Darcy, a result largely of the sketchy writing, not the performance. He looks right for the role (although probably too young--Austen heroines always seem attracted to older, more mature men), but he is never on screen long enough to make much of an impression. Thus his actions seem to be the result of arbitrary mood swings, not those of a complete but mysteriously contradictory person, as they should be. Elizabeth's rejection of Mr. Collins' proposal comes off as unnecessarily brusque and cruel; it almost makes Mr. Collins the more sympathetic of the two. The scene with Elizabeth on the precipice seems to belong in another movie altogether, perhaps a later David Lean spectacular, not the intimate, house-bound chamber piece that ""Pride and Prejudice"" should be. The scene with the nude statues at Pemberley introduces an overtly erotic element that seems incongruous with the tone of Austen; isn't her persistent theme the superiority of sense over sensuality? And really, Burghley House as Netherfield? Altogether too grand for an unoccupied county residence let for the summer. Despite its shortcomings, worth watching for fans of the novel. Just don't expect it to measure up in any way to the still-definitive 1995 version."
"ndhoang","6","2","10","19 March 2007"," Poor rendition of the original novel.
","The PP (2005) gave the original Austen novel a new, modernized interpretation. The effort was average at best. While the dialogues, social setting, and story were slightly changed to make the movie more modern, the movie failed to set the main themes of the novel. The ""pride"" and the ""prejudiced"" aspects of the novel were not fully developed. The father, Mr. Bennett, was portrayed more like a drunk rather than a country gentleman. The mother was painted more vulgar than the one in the novel. Mr. Colin's role in PP 05 was confused and vague. The Bennett girls, including the shy, beautiful and good nature Jane, were much more shrewd and scheming. I guess I was spoiled by the BBC version of PP of 1995. If you did not read the novel then you would have a hard time understand these key characters and their ""pride and prejudice"". My final scores: Suitable selection of actors/actresses: poor Interpretation of the original novel: poor Acting: average Cinematography: above average Scenery: above average<br/><br/>If you want to watch ""Pride and Prejudice"", my recommendation is not to waste time with PP05. Do directly to PP95. It is longer, but a much, much better movie. I gave a 6 to PP05, and 9.5 to PP95."

Judi Dench turns in yet another ""tiny"" role that could get her Oscar nominated once again, the last time being for a mere 13 minutes on screen in ""Shakespeare In Love"". Donald Sutherland is wonderfully convincing, he IS Jane Austin's vision of Mr. Bennet! From the moment we meet the Bennet sisters we are drawn into their lives, their joys and their disappointments.

","I have been a fan of the book since I was 16 and was hooked to the BBC television series. When I saw the trailers I was desperate to see it, yet apprehensive too. Would Keira Knightley be a great Elizabeth... would Darcy be enigmatic and properly Darcyish?? So many things had to be cut(from the book) due to the time limits, but I think they did it amazingly well. They kept all the essential parts you would need to promote the Darcy Elizabeth relationship. Wickham did lose out, but I think that worked.<br/><br/>The shooting of the film brought a really new dramatic and Romantic depth, the movement was superb..as was the excess animals around the Bennets home.<br/><br/>The developing relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth was exhilarating. Darcy in this version was no Colin Firth, but he was wonderful all the same. As for Keira Knightley she was a superb Elizabeth, witty, proper, yet desperately human. I did come out of the cinema thinking perhaps we should all be going for long treks in the rain.<br/><br/>My only disapointement was at the end, that after the fathers approval (and shock) at Elizabeth's attachment, the credits roll and you don't see them get together. However, for all true fans, I suppose that is left to the imagination.<br/><br/>This is definitely one to see again and to own on DVD."
"wall_e91","6","2","12","9 April 2007"," Not the same without Colin
","Had I never seen the '95 mini series of Pride & Prejudice, I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. But I found myself comparing every scene to the stunning performances of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and frankly, it did not compare.<br/><br/>Macfadyen's performance was commendable, however, I did not feel that he conveyed enough emotion. True enough, Darcy is meant to be withdrawn and ""strong and silent,"" as it were, but I think that for the majority of the film - even in the kiss scene - he simply looked bored.<br/><br/>Compared to the 95 version, where Firth struck up the balance perfectly. He showed pride and nobility, but we can see undercurrents of emotion through his eyes, smouldering looks at Lizzie, and flashes of good humour.<br/><br/>I also felt that the film did not capture the essence of the period. It quite irritated me that Keira wore her hair down in many scenes, as women of that status and age in that period simply would not have done in public. I also felt that we see too much of Lizzie and Darcy - the book focuses on many different story lines, and many of the more minor characters were completely overlooked, particularly Mr Bennett, who has an important role, and Mr Collins, who is not nearly so odious as I imagine him to be through reading the book.<br/><br/>However, I have given the film a commendable 6 out of 10, because I feel that it stuck to the storyline quite faithfully, and the settings were quite beautiful. I particularly enjoyed the scene at the Meryton Assembly Rooms, which captured the novel very well. The film is well worth watching for Knightley's performance; I thought she made a very good Lizzie.<br/><br/>But as good as this film is, if you want true Pride & Prejudice - stick to the 95 version."

The setting is wonderful; Longbourne is beautiful in it's 17th century glory, the set for the Meryton assembly amazing and Chatsworth as Pemberley breathtaking. The music is beautiful. The costumes are at times extremely elegant.<br/><br/>But. The casting is slightly off. Keira Knightley is good, Rosamund Pike spot-on; I love Brenda Blethyn to death, but something about her is not quite right here. Matthew Macfadyen, perfect in Perfect Strangers, is more a contemporary face and lacks the kind of strength and sexy charm I associate to the role. The younger Bennett girls... Tallulah Riley is too pretty and the other two too childish. And Donald Sutherland - who thought casting him would be a good move? Also, the adaptation fails. The very basic storyline is there, and nothing else. The characters are oftentimes wrong, as are the dynamics of the family. Mr Collins and Mr Bingley are nothing like their literary counterparts, and Mr and Mrs Hurst have been deleted entirely. The Bennett family has been made much poorer than they are. The whole Wickham storyline is pushed aside too soon, as if the writers didn't know just how important it is. And so on... On the whole, I had the feeling that it was done in rush, and as short as possible.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is full of all sorts of modern blunders. Too many to mention.<br/><br/>I have heard that before being assigned to direct this film Joe Wright had never read the book; he didn't fully understand his subject, or the importance of portraying certain things faithfully to it, and that has given this work a slightly sour aftertaste."
"Simlady","6","2","12","8 August 2006"," Not bad, but not the Best
","There are some who see this and say it is better than the '95 version, but it just is not, and there are several reasons. The first and foremost reason it cannot touch the other is Colin Firth. And I do not mean because Colin got dunked in the lake, and looked sexy all wet. That bit is not in the book, and I wonder to myself why it was put in. That same scene in this movie is ALSO not like it is in the book - will we ever see them meeting by accident in the stables? But that aside, the reason Colin carries the other is because he just *is* Darcy. When we, as viewers, look at his face, we can see why Elizabeth is misreading him, but we can *also* see what he is really thinking. This is acting! In this movie, when Darcy proposes the first time, he BLURTS OUT most of his feelings to her . . . half the fun of the story is how they misunderstand each other, and when Darcy pulls back and puts up walls, she cannot see into his mind. This Darcy tells her part of what is actually told to her later by letter, and then they have him write the letter anyway. Stupid, IMO. Either have him tell her, or have him write it, but why both? <br/><br/>The second reason the '95 one is better is the length. That one is what, five hours long? It tells the entire story. This one is the Reader's Digest version and that always leaves things out.<br/><br/>The story itself, of course, cannot be ruined. It is Austen's best and most readable novel, and unless it is completely taken apart, it is going to continue to be a great story. But this interpretation leaves something to be desired. For one thing, the Bennets seem little more than dirt poor farmers, whereas I took it from the novel (and the '95 version) that they were comfortable, if not rich. The problem was not that they were poor now, but that the estate was entailed away from the female line. In other words, Mr. Bennet could not leave the estate to his wife and daughters, so his nephew, the simpering Collins, was going to get everything. Having five daughters, the mother spends all of her time wondering how they will live after her husband dies. That is one of the main points of the story (and in fact, Bennet was known to point out to her that SHE could very well die before him!). If the daughters are not married off well, they would be one day be destitute, but for the moment the family was comfortable enough. In the '95 version Lizzie makes it clear she is the daughter of a gentleman - the *mother* is the commoner.<br/><br/>In this one, the house is a run-down farm, and their clothing is little more than rags. And the fashions are decidedly UN-Austen - just look at Sense and Sensiblity, and you will see that their dresses match very well to the '95 version, but neither look anything like what they are wearing this movie. What year is it supposed to be? I can't make it out. It just does not look right for the period. They do mention having servants, but their hair is mostly undone and sloppy, as if left to do it themselves.<br/><br/>As for Keira - God Bless her, she does try. Her attitude as Lizzie is fine, but she is much too thin for the time period. Jennifer Ehle may not be as fashionable to ""modern audiences"", but that is what women looked like then. Someone as thin as Keira would have been seen as sickly.<br/><br/>On the upside, I loved Donald Sutherland, and Judi Dench can never disappoint. I just do not know why this needed to be made. The other was perfect. No one is ever going to do Darcy as well as Firth - why even try?"

","I had not seen this film prior to ordering my copy of the DVD over the Net. If I had, I would not have bothered buying the DVD.<br/><br/>This particular story is a favourite both of my wife and myself: with the BBC's 1995 version on both tape and DVD, and at least the Greer Garson black & white film version on tape in our possession. Against the BBC's 1995 version, this latest travesty doesn't stand up. I fully appreciate that I am comparing a feature film of 2 hours duration with a serialisation of almost 3 times that length; but the actual production of this latest version leaves so much to be desired. It is disjointed, devoid of some of the main features and speeches, the majority of the cast seemed to have no ides of the story or of what they were supposed to be doing with it, and quite frankly, I considered the film a total disappointment: giving it only 2 marks out of 10 - both of those for the simply superb acting of Miss Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>Miss Keira Knightley, who plays Elizabeth Bennett in the movie, was nominated for an Oscar for her role here. I can well understand why. Apart from Miss Knightley's superb acting, and that of Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine DeBourg, the film would, in my opinion, have been a total disaster. I doubt I shall bother running my DVD again before passing it to the same charity as Miss Knightley passed her Oscar Dress to.<br/><br/>To vote on all 3 versions now in our collection, using the name of the Elizabeth Bennett Actress to name the version, I give marks out of 10 as under:<br/><br/>For her part as Miss Elizabeth Benett: Greer Garson 10, Jennifer Ehle 10, Keira Knightley 10.<br/><br/>For the Production as a whole: Grear Garson Version 10, Jennifer Ehle Version 10, Keira Nightley Version 0 (plus the 2 I give it for Miss Knightley's work.).<br/><br/>R.P.Q."
"RomanceNovelist","9","1","4","6 April 2017"," Love it, superior to the 1995 mini series
","I think ones tastes depends on which movie was seen first. I am a huge fan of Austen and the Bronte Sister, and yes, I have read the books.<br/><br/>I had no interest in seeing any adaptation, as I was never sure I would come to like them. The book, a commentary on the treatment of women, whose lives and social status depended upon having a suitable husband and marriage. It is also a book about perception, prejudices based on first impressions.<br/><br/>This movie was passionate, and lush, with beautiful cinematography. Keira Knightly was outstanding, as was Matthew McFayden as Mr. Darcy, the towering man of wealth, suffering unrequited love of Elizabeth Bennett, who despises him. The entire cast was stellar, and Rosamund Pike as Jane was lovely, and her acting superb. This was a very well-rounded cast. Mrs. Bennett was as shrill and nervous as expected, and Mr. Bennett as indifferent and dismissive as I expected him to be.<br/><br/>Keira delivered her lines with such aplomb, I can watch this movie over and over again. I would have loved to her with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy,, can you imagine how outstanding that would be? That said, Matthew McFayden is EQUALLY fantastic as Colin Firth in this role. But far more sympathetic to me than Firth's Mr. Darcy. McFayden's Mr. Darcy almost seemed too vulnerable and lovelorn, but his performance makes up for the liberty taken with this aspect of Mr. Darcy's character.<br/><br/>My thoughts on the 1995 version... Ehle smirked too much. And at inappropriate times. And her eyes wandered, she often looked away from the other actors when speaking to them in scenes. Almost like she is lost in thought. And that bothered me. Elizabeth is a fiery spirit, and Ehle was far too passive in her depiction. I feel that Keira embodied everything I imagined Elizabeth Bennett to be. I felt that Ehle's acting was below average. But she was the first to tackle our beloved Elizabeth, so she receives more credit than she deserves for the role. I also found the final proposal from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth a bit perfunctory, and unromantic. But I blame the director, not the actors. They didn't even look at each other. Ehle spouts her dialogue, like an 8th grader in a school play. Though, in some scenes she excelled. Firth was everything I expect of Mr. Darcy. Jane, from the 1995 version, was not the beauty the book wrote of, and I found her face and smile off-putting, if you'll forgive me for saying such a rude thing. She's fine, but not what I imagine Jane to look like, Ehle was much pretty when Jane was supposed to be the prettier of the sisters. I felt 2005 got this right, while managing to cast a stunning beauty like Keira in the role of Elizabeth, muting her attractiveness just enough so that Rosamund Pike could truly shine."

For starters the entire movie centers on several girls getting married (which is kind of sickening by itself), which I could be fine with, but there's no real climax. There's no action. There's like two real things that happen in the whole movie. One of the only scenes that really held my attention was a scene where the main characters were arguing (that's no lacking in action this whole movie was). Secondly, I've watched a lot of movies from similar eras as this and English has always been one of my strengths.

"kurth-nata","9","1","4","16 February 2014"," Pride & Prejudice - A must see!
","It's not every day that we fall ardently in love with a movie. Pride & Prejudice, a film based off of Jane Austen's most prominent novel, alludes to the most compelling desire of humanity. The desire for authentic love. Under the direction of Joe Wright, the 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice has everything we want – the lovable heroine and the picturesque estates allow this powerful love story to capture the hearts of many. <br/><br/>The acting was uniformly flawless throughout the film. Although arrogant in the early scenes, Matthew Macfayden who plays Mr. Darcy, must choose to shed his pride in order to gain Elizabeth Bennet's affection. As a dynamic character, he starts proud and prejudiced, but his love for Elizabeth changes him. This can be seen through his ignorance towards her at the first ball and the subtle touch of affection he offers as he reaches out to help her into the carriage later in the movie. Macfayden's composition becomes noticeably softer as his love for Elizabeth deepens. I truly admire Macfayden's acting transformation because he brings Mr. Darcy to life, and the realism of the romantic heroine's emotions have us falling hopelessly for him. <br/><br/>Along with this, Keira Knightley's acting as Elizabeth comes off as independent, humorous and free spirited; allowing the audience to easily identify with her. Her independence from societal norms is easily recognizable when she refuses to marry for security. Knightley's acting showed that you do not need to conform to society. Strong and prejudiced by nature, Knightley's tone and directness made her stand out from the other characters. <br/><br/>If I haven't convinced you to consider watching Pride and Prejudice yet, let me take a different approach. Visually, Pride & Prejudice was stunning. Under the direction of Wright, the use of space, cinematography and set design was remarkable. The realistic landscaped gardens, country houses and enormous mansions effectively represented the society of the early 1800s. Free spirited, Elizabeth was shown numerous times escaping the confinement of society. Wright captured and incorporated magnificent scenes that showed her walking along the countryside and relaxing with a book. Not to mention, all of the significant, heart-rending and romantic scenes occurred in striking locations. The raw and impassioned proposal soaked the characters in a soft rain, and Mr. Darcy ventured early with the sunrise one morning just to see her. The settings of these scenes are just breathtaking. <br/><br/>If you are still reluctant or entirely against Pride & Prejudice, I challenge you to take this opportunity to give it a chance. Discover for yourself why this powerful, authentic love story has such an enduring appeal to many people. It is not likely to disappoint and a more satisfying 129 minutes will be tough to come by."

","Jane Austen's perennially popular story of the game of love among the British upper classes returns to the screen in this polished film adaptation entitled,Pride And Prejudice.It depicts five sisters from an English family of landed gentry as they deal with issues of marriage, morality and misconceptions. Keira Knightley stars in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, while Matthew Macfadyen plays her romantic interest Mr. Darcy. Brenda Blethyn,Donald Sutherland,Tom Hollander,Rosamund Pike,Jena Malone and Judi Dench play key supporting roles. <br/><br/>The Bennets are the parents of five daughters near the close of the 18th century. Comfortable within their means but well short of rich, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are looking for suitable husbands for their girls, and they are encouraged to learn that an eligible young bachelor from a wealthy family, Charles Bingley, has moved into a nearby estate. Eager to see if a match can be made, the Bennets bring their daughters Elizabeth and Jane to a ball thrown by their new neighbor to see if sparks will fly. Jane seems to like Charles, and he appears to feel the same, but Elizabeth takes an immediate dislike to Darcy, Charles' egocentric best friend. While Elizabeth is infatuated with military man Lt. Wickham and finds herself courted by William Collins, a well-meaning but drab man of the cloth, fate causes Elizabeth and Darcy to frequently cross paths, and while they don't care for one another, they can't stop thinking about each other, either.<br/><br/>As historically authentic-looking as Pride & Prejudice is, it has far more invested in emotional authenticity as you feel engaged every moment.It is a boisterous, loud, dance-mad kind of place, full of ruddy- faced peasants, dirt and hay. The whole thing feels like it was art- directed by Bruegel on holiday.Also,it's a great adaptation of cinema's fave Jane Austen novel, but key performances and a modern film- making sensibility make this familiar period piece fresh and enjoyable.Finally,it is a gorgeous and well-acted adaptation."
"milagro1975","1","1","4","23 April 2010"," Sappy nothing
","I first saw the movie soon agter the release in a cinema, was utterly disappointed as any Austen fan or simply anyone in the least know of history and literature must be, and just tried to erase the memory of it. After a while, having read a lot of raving reviews I decided to give it another chance as non-adaptation. Well, I really tried. Didn't work either. Setting aside numerous inaccuracies and liberties taken with a masterpiece, I simply don't understand what the appeal of the movie is to so many? It lacks logic, consistency, character development and humour. The story is abrupt and hard to follow if you don't keep recollecting the book's plot. For instance, why Mrs Bennet tells Mr Benner what happened at the assembly if he was present there? Who is Mrs Forster? how did Lady Catherine come to know that Lizzy is going to be engaged to her nephew and how in this world could he possibly know her opinion if he was in Longbourn that very day, sorry, NIGHT? And so on. The scenery and locations are fabulous, I admit, but God created Discovery channel for a reason, so why bother filming this? <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a mere boy-meets-girl story, the boy is depressed and shy (and we get no explanation why, no change either), the girl is obstinate (the same comment here). The sidelines (Charlotte's, Lydia's) are negligible, bring no sense and serve only as minor difficulties on the lovers' path to ""understanding"" (BTW did they actually understand each other? I don't think so, they seem quite as immature and absurd in the end as at the beginning). Given no reasonable development, no insight into the characters it is just boring to watch.<br/><br/>Acting is average provided there is nothing particular to act. Knightley gives quite convincing image of a not too bright teenager ""in luv - in denial"". McFadyen as Mr Darcy acts only if he can't avoid it. Sutherland is a treasure in this boring film - it is very refreshing to watch him and try to guess what part from what piece he is acting this moment and what accent he is now faking :) Other characters are so disposable that their acting doesn't count really. The actress who played Jane is very pretty, though.<br/><br/>""Romantic"" picturesque doesn't help much. It works when one sees inner reasons of a character which this movie fails to show. I am not even saying how far this kind of picturesque is from Austen's vision and style...<br/><br/>To summarize, the film is 100% fan fiction of a lower stamp using beloved names and some random details but totally free of any meaning except hormone-driven replay. The infamous US ending shows that perfectly. <br/><br/>I don't advise to see this shallow production to anyone who has any eye-brain connections at all."

","I love the book and I read it a few times until now. I also liked the BBC version from 1995 because in my opinion it really respected the story and the characters. When I first saw this version I was shocked to hear lines of one character in the book...said by another one in the movie. Some times the whole meaning was completely changed... After a while I thought that maybe I did not give it a fair chance...that could be a nice movie even if the story and lines are not just like in the book...so, last night I watched it again but I was still disappointed. Most of the movie I had the impression that the actors were in a hurry to say their lines in the 2 hours limit. No feelings, no emotions...just lines. Mr. Bingley has a lot of difficulties in talking. Why? There is no mention in the book of him being retarded... Nevertheless Keira is quite cute. With a better written script she could have make a great role..."
"long-ford","Null","1","4","24 January 2009"," Skillful Austen adaptation and a deeply romantic period drama.
","This film served notice of a new talent Joe Wright. His next film was the outstanding 'Atonement', but we can sense his talent in this version of Pride and Prejudice. The film tries its best to be cinematic (always difficult with Austen), and on the whole does well. The camera constantly moves and architecture is very skilfully filmed, conveying a wealth of information on what the characters are feeling. Keira is annoying initially, but her character slowly grows on you. Macfadyen is a bit bland. The rest of the cast is competent. The film works both as a first rate Austen adaptation, and as a deeply romantic period drama.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"
"johnnyboyz","6","1","4","15 January 2009"," Joe Wright brings his visual style to a very old piece of text but that cannot save the film form being slightly humdrum.
","Here we go then, another Pride & Prejudice adaptation; a novel that's been around the block so many times even the popular Indian cinema film-makers amongst the British film industry have put their own spin on things, that little episode being 'Bride' & Prejudice. That particular film came out a mere year before Joe Wright's period romp debut and this take on things from Jane Austen's novel was obviously deemed by its director a pretty good place to start off, coming from a man who'd made some shorts and done some television work but here he gets to play amidst the big fish by taking a relatively large and well-known cast; a lot of money and is let loose amongst some top quality locales. It's a shame that the result is all very here and there.<br/><br/>I think Wright identified that the best approach, at least in his mind, for a debut is to take on someone else's subject matter or text and bring it to life in the way you deem worthy. It's a safe choice and to be fair, Wright brings the text to life with a string of attractive camera angles and shots, drifting into vast Georgian England rooms that see the mise-en-scene on most occasions just drip off the screen; wowing us with locations and sets that ooze of the authentic. But it was all an appetiser for Wright's following film Atonement, which is actually about something and actually contains a pinch of emotion complete with a connection to the characters. If whenever someone comes up to you and states Pride & Prejudice is better than Atonement, swiftly correct them.<br/><br/>So what is this film? It's an updating of a decades old tale for the 21st Century; whether that's a good thing or not is still up for debate. The Bennett sisters Jane (Pike); Elizabeth (Knightley); Mary (Riley); Catherine (Mulligan) and Lydia (Malone) are growing up much to the delight of their unnamed mother played by Brenda Blethyn and their father who's played by a slightly miscast Donald Sutherland  his job is to pop up every now and again and offer advice to his daughters in a sort of Jiminy Cricket role. Despite all these characters and this big overall family, it's only Elizabeth that is given much of the attention and it's only her we're really interested in.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the initial sense that these five girls are 'up for grabs'. Some girls rush into relationships and some get burnt in the process, disappearing and becoming confused whereas Elizabeth is more conservative and adopts a more mature stance in the sense she wishes to wait a while longer for that 'true' love sensation. The overall theme to do with coming of age and that mistake you might make with first impressions is clear: Elizabeth initially dislikes a certain Mr. Darcy (Macfadyen) but along the way, she will learn and mature and what have you before realising that certain things are not what they first appear.<br/><br/>I'd be lying if I said you don't let off the odd yawn during Pride & Prejudice. It's a tale about women; about love from the perspective of women with perspective being the key word in that sentence and I guess the easy thing to say would be that I'm not of the correct audience it's aimed at. Wright's second and most recent film, Atonement, was about a certain female perspective and it too had permutation's to do with love or lust. It was a distorted and immature perspective, one that was too young to figure out what was going on and I had no trouble with that film at all.<br/><br/>But when is all said and done, that cannot hide the film's ho-hum approach to its narrative. There are the early exchanges; the glances; the gazes and the touching of the said person as one helps the other to mount a horse upon leaving the manor house. What keeps the film afloat for most of its time is its direction, the highlight of which in a visual sense is an unbroken take as the camera waltzes through a gathering of people, switching from ground level to head height as the camera adsorbs the costume and the setting it is so lushly presenting to us, proud and prestigious indeed.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed is that the film avoids, or at least did it sparsely enough for me not to notice, rendering one or any of its characters objects of the gaze. This is a theory built around the construction that certain characters or 'types' of characters are shot provocatively with the camera in order to subliminally force the audience into assuming them to be attractive. From what I saw, Pride & Predujice avoids doing this and for that I commend it, something very few films in the genre that would revolve around women, love, wanting to love and relationships would be successful in doing.<br/><br/>Towards the end and once Elizabeth has started to come to her senses, the film does run out of juice somewhat. Wright grows tired of the inventive camera angels and showing off the fancy mise-en-scene and the film needs Judi Dench's character to re-raise a little bit of interest as the climax nears, some welcome antagonism in the form of an old battle-axe role that Dench basks in. Whether the dramas of love and relationships are actually captured here and that it's just a fancy, period drama vehicle with flashy visuals and camera work remains debatable but you have to commend the film on what it does do well."

","This rendition of Pride and Prejudice is a sheer delight for not only the mind by bringing a beloved Jane Austen book to the screen again, but is the most visually splendid film I have seen in a long time. The colors used in every single scene give the eye spots to highlight on without a sharp contrast unless superbly useful for the impact of the dialogue or event occurring at the time. The gowns each of the ladies wore for the ball scenes vary in color to give an idea of what might have been seen at the time, but also are subtle enough in texture to differentiate the singleness of each person in a crowd. The color of the rooms in each of the respective houses gave credence to the personality of the inhabitants. The farm-ish spread of the Bennett house with the browns and 'working blues' and on to the stark royal colors of Rosings Park signifying wealth and lavish embellishments. Mr. Bingly's house is a temporary type hotel feel with no homey trinkets, but just enough color to show the wealth of the inhabitants but not the feel of permanence. The main colors are tans and whites with gold accents, with Darcy, of course, contrasting starkly in his black suit. The humble abode of the clergyman and his new wife give the feel of a subservient man with just enough to have what he needs without flash but giving rise to his position. My favorite two scenes are with Lizzie by herself for the most part. The first one is of course the one used in the opener on the DVD with her standing on the rocks with the vast land spread out behind her in rich gold's and subtle gray and her skirt billowing in the wind behind her. The other is her in the small rotunda in the rain with the vivid green grass surrounding her just soaking up the rain's sustenance and the shimmering black pond in front of her contrasting with the gray stone of the rotunda."

"cathyb350-1","5","1","4","26 March 2006"," Bronte version of Pride & Prejudice
","Just watching the trailer for this movie made me cringe. It was so Bronte (I was thinking -- is this Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre?). Which I thought was hilarious given Jane Austen made fun of the melodramatic Bronte novels during her time on this earth (she did not like their novels at all). So, bad, bad move by the adapter of this great piece of literature. Note to Moggach: Jane Austen would have hated this adaptation as much as her readers.<br/><br/>But, Jane has been dead now for quite some time and life is about progression so I watched this (as the book is one of my top ten of all time and the 1995 BBC version is still my favorite to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon) as it was free on a recent long airplane flight. I laughed out loud at the over-the-top ""dramatic"" scenes as they were so forced and definitely meant to appeal to either the 13 year old girls or silly women who like those stupid Harlequin Romances. BUT, there were a few things I did like and I feel are very worthy to mention and also why I gave this a 5 out of 10 instead of a one.<br/><br/>First, not positive (I would give this a big 0 if I could individually rate performances), is I could not stand Kiera Knightely's interpretation of the role of Lizzie. She was silly and stupid and I especially hated her forced ""tomboy"" quality. Think of how much great Jane Austen dialog or plot development was skipped with that stupid scene of her spinning around on a swing -- was the director trying to ""convey"" the changing seasons? Really bad choice. So much wasted time -- really bad editing. But the scene I hated her the most in was when she goes to Pemberly after rebuffing Darcy and when he asks to accompany her back to Lampton she does this stupid girlish giggle/smile and almost screams ""no"" as she runs away. I'm thinking -- ""run Darcy, dump this immature idiot girl!"" Now, does that sound like the Lizzie we all know and have loved? Nope, the writers and Keira totally screwed up this role and ruined Lizzie for the 13 year old female adolescents who so badly need the real Lizzie on the big screen for a role model. Jennifer Ehle is by far the best Lizzie up to this point in time. <br/><br/>I liked Darcy -- very attractive. A bit brooding but definitely a nice touch to modernize this version. He was very well acted -- I thought he was a very good Darcy.<br/><br/>I liked Jane -- she was very pretty and that was nice improvement from the 1995 version of Jane. She played a very good adaptation of the book Jane. I definitely liked her much better than the 1995 BBC Jane.<br/><br/>Bingley -- huh??? Good actor, crappy writing. Caroline Bingley -- good.<br/><br/>I really, really like Mr. and Mrs. Bennet - I thought this adaptation was a nice, slightly more positive version than the book and the 1995 version. I felt the 1995 version was too harsh on Mrs. Bennet as the book definitely alluded to the affection she had for her daughters as well as Mr. Bennet's affection towards her (although not as positive as this movie portrays). But it was a nice touch and I really like both actors who played these roles, very good casting.<br/><br/>Mr. Collins & Wickham -- could have used a bit more of both on screen, Tom Hollander is excellent in everything and he was perfectly cast as Mr. Collins. Finally a drop dead gorgeous Mr. Wickham, I think the screen adaptation could have definitely made more use of his importance to the substance of the plot but I like this Mr. Wickham because he is incredibly attractive and able to lie very easily (a tribute to the actor) so he could have been much more pivotal -- more of Mr. Wickham, less of Lizzie twirling around on a swing.<br/><br/>Mary Bennet, Kittie and Lydia -- Mary Bennet was perfectly cast as was Kittie and Lydia although Kittie acted more like the Lydia in the book version. So again, no discount to the actors, just an awful writing.<br/><br/>The scenery and ""period"" nature of the film were very well done. So kudos and a big ""10"" for cinematography. I did enjoy the Bennet house and yes, I do think pigs probably walked through a portion of the homes and I also think Mrs. Bennet probably helped with the cooking if you were to digress in ""real time"" 18th century. So although Austen purists will hate this portion, I loved it because I think that is probably the reality of that time -- as was the drunken state of the party goers at the different balls. 18th century politeness and manners aside, when people have too much to drink, no matter what century, they always make fools of themselves and the 2005 movie did a nice job showing that.<br/><br/>To be honest, I would have given this movie an 8 if someone else would have played Lizzie.<br/><br/>I too wish Emma Thompson would adapt all the Jane Austen novels for the big screen. She is the only person I can see who truly ""gets"" Jane Austen. Similar to the screen plays on the Lord of the Rings movies, you recognize those who capture the essence of the books. This adaptation tried to capture the essence of Wuthering Heights and shove it into Pride and Prejudice. Making it even the worse because Jane Austen loathed the Bronte novels."

","This version will inevitably face comparisons with the 1995 BBC miniseries which was a complete delight. I don't mind seeing different interpretations of any classic. Shakespeare and Shaw, Ibsen and Chekov come alive on stage countless times and every new cast and director would bring a fresh view to a time honored story. <br/><br/>First the good. The casting worked.All of it. People say Keira Knightley was too beautiful to be Lizzie Bennett but in the period the film is set,the blonde, gentle and not too slender Rosamond Pike would definitely be the family beauty. Keira is a modern day stunner but in Jane Austen's time she would be considered too skinny, gawky and boyish to count. Darcy too fit the bill. It's unfair to compare him to Colin Firth who's made himself something of a legend in the role.<br/><br/>Now the not so good. It was a bit of a mess. Did the Bennett household have to look like a grubby barnyard? They were a genteel family and Mrs Bennett had upper class ambitions, so it didn't quite work to see her as a frumpy slattern. The youngest pair tended to overdo the shrieking and giggles. There didn't seem much difference between the maids and the ladies of the house. If they'd only costumed it and showcased it like Ang Lee's exquisite Sense and Sensibility this would have been a production to remember. And yes, we'd have liked the couples to kiss. Even Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle obliged all those years ago!"

","I just saw this movie yesterday with 6 of my good friends and we all absolutely positively loved it!! I came into it knowing nothing but what I had seen in the trailer, and I was absolutely enchanted as soon as it had begun. I had never seen any previous versions and had never read the book, and I was breath-taken by the scenery, costumes, and brilliant acting. My friends and I sat in the front row cheering on Keira Knightley as sharp-tongued, witty Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Bennet, swooning over Matthew Macfayden as the snobbish, rich Mr. Darcy, and laughing at Brenda Blethyn's marriage-obsessed Mrs. Bennet and Tom Hollander's awkward and hilariously short Mr. Collins. I was amazed at the insight they put on Lizzie and how they showed their insight (i.e. Keira Knightley standing on the cliff looking out at the positively gorgeous landscape). 4 out of 6 of my friends (including me) came out stamping our feet, pouting and whining ""we want a Mr.Darcy"" (to which Matthew Mcfayden played an extremely sexy, rugged, and endearing leading man), and 5 out of 6 of my friends by the end of the movie were screaming ""KISS HER!! KISS HER!! KISS HER ALREADY!!"" at the screen (and getting ""shh!""s and popcorn thrown at them for their screaming). An irrefutable 10 out of 10 by far!!"
"Imhotep77","7","1","4","5 December 2005"," Not the Definitive Version
","It is always hard to adapt even a medium length novel to the screen satisfactorily due to time constraint. It is doubly hard to adapt a literary novel as opposed to a potboiler because often case, literary novels are less about advancing the plot than about character development. In this case, the words are of paramount importance. Understanding such pitfalls, I've limited my expectation beforehand even though I was quite eagerly looking forward to have a good time. Well, it IS moderately enjoyable, especially if you compare it to many of the mindless action movies (the bad ones, not the good ones). However, it just cannot hold a candle to the superb 1995 A&E version. (One of the reviewers here pointed out that the BBC version is actually from the 1980s and the 1995 version is not produced by BBC but by A&E.) <br/><br/>I tried not to compare this to the '95 version and judge it on its own merit, but I simply couldn't and having made the fatal mistake of rewatching the '95 version a month before this movie opened, it was well nigh impossible not to do so. There is only one character that I think is better portrayed here than the '95 version: the inestimable Judi Dench. Her Lady de Bourgh is far more formidable. Everyone else from this new version is inferior. Even from the first trailer, I've thought MacFayden's Darcy looked sickly and now I think he looks both sickly and constipated (and what a humongous forehead he has). He doesn't convey pride so much as confusion. Much has been said about Colin Firth's superb interpretation of Darcy but not enough credit (or at least it wasn't mentioned as often by the ladies) is given to Jennifer Erle incandescent portrayal as Lizzie Bennett. She is the quintessential Lizzie to me. True, Knightley is closer in age to the character (19 to 21) but Erle is only all of 26 when she made the series. Erle's Elizabeth has the spiritedness but acts with the right propriety and she cuts a much better figure than Knightley. Both Kitty and Lydia are played the same way that I couldn't tell them apart. Charles Bingley has really puffy modern hair and acts way too silly. But the one character that absolutely fails is that of Mr. Collins. Tom Hollander has simply no nuance and having no screen time doesn't help. David Bamber from '95 has such great body language and comic timing that he brings alive Mr. Collins's servility and sycophancy. He provides many priceless comic moments in the series. <br/><br/>Aside from the actors, what's with the technical problems? The film seems grainy and dim and the color washed out. The Bennetts are portrayed as dirt poor. The house is run down. It has a been a while since I read the novel, but I don't remember them living on a farm with live stocks running around! The social chasm between them and the Bingleys and Darcys are simply too great for them to socialize if that's the case. Charles dropping in on Jane when she is in bed in her night gown!?! And numerous other faux pas already pointed out.<br/><br/>So, if given a choice between Aeon Flux and P&P, of course one should choose P&P however disappointing it may be in comparison. However, better rent or buy the '95 version and enjoy a near perfect presentation of Jane Austen's timeless novel in 5 hours than watch this watered-down verison in 2."

","Reimagined as a chick flick for today's romance-starved independent women, this paean to the days when marriage was both a means of financial security and the only sanctioned way to get your freak on bursts with fecundity and virility. A naughty shot of a well-endowed hog sets the lusty tone; the disquiet of adolescent hormones pulses through every frame. Dame Judi Dench is the only showstopper in terms of acting, but the other performances are serviceable. Keira Knightley looks most beautiful and sympathetic in repose; she already has a few too many tics for such a young thespian, but that makes no nevermind when you've been anointed as the Next Big British Thing. The lush cinematography serves as a travelogue for the great houses (and champion trees) of Britain."

","This version of P and P is outstanding! It is difficult not to compare it with the BBC version, but I found myself doing so and enjoyed the light and fun of this take more than the thoroughness of the former. The cast is well chosen and Mr. Darcy is just as I imagined him to be. The movie is light and fun when the novel dictates, and serious and passionately moving at the proper times. The relationships between the characters are right on and the movie moves through the novel brightly. The scenery is gorgeous and the rain is romantically placed. The audience left smiling. It is a good interpretation of the novel; the author would surely approve.<br/><br/>-- that was my mom's comment. let me add ( : it is a truly refreshing movie and I highly recommend it! Please forget you ever saw the BBC series! They are too different to be compared. Really, 6 hours vs. 2 hours... its going to be different! Though I like the BBC series, (alot) this movie has a completely different, lighter feel. THis Mr. Darcy was so much more human! I love Colin Firth, but he was just so arrogant and unlikable. (in a likable way) This Mr. Darcy was just like he was in the book... I'm sure he read it! I am no fan of Knightly but she was as okay as she could be. I was really disappointed that they chose her for Elizabeth but she pulled it off well, in fact, just like she was in the book.(but she was WAY too skinny. its not even attractive. they would have considered her SICK in the 1800's!)that's way beside the point (: JANE IS PERFECT! the BBC Jane bothered me sooo much. I laughed every time they said she was pretty. this Jane is beautiful and just perfect. The rest of the cast was great too! the feel of the movie was so much like the book... happy and quick. - ending too soon.( : I will say that the ending of this movie bothered me. I felt like a wedding scene would have been appropriate or a simple kiss. not all that ""mrs.darcy"" stuff. it was uncomfortable. for those of you who aren't in the US or Canada, you didn't miss anything! that's where Keria Knightly really started to annoy me. Definitely a movie worth seeing! like I said before, please!! stop comparing it to the old one! I like them both.. it is possible to do that folks. lets not be so prejudiced!!"

","Pride and Prejudice is not only my favorite book of all time but I am also a die-hard fan of the BBC mini-series. Having said that I have to say that I loved this movie! There were a few incidences when they messed up some of the most important and iconic lines but on the most part they did a very good job and I was giddy at the romance in the end. I have seen every version of Pride and Prejudice that has been made, from the 1940 version with Lawrence Olivier and Greer Garson to the 1985 BBC version and I have found something to love in all of them. The mini-series is above-all the best version ever made but you have to remember that it is 5 hours long and the average movie is around 2 hours. For the time they had to work with this movie is absolutely wonderful and a must see for all Jane Austen enthusiasts. Go see it and enjoy the wonderful filming as well, because not only is this movie a good adaptation it is also a beautifully filmed work with wonderful colors and camera work."

","Few of us who go and see this movie will have missed the BBC mini-series starring Colin Firth as the definitive (yes, better than Olivier) Mr. Darcy. One cannot help but liken this new Darcy more to a Heathcliff than to the rather stiff-mannered Darcy Jane Austen describes.<br/><br/>However, his portrayal was met with no objection from my movie-going companion, who had neither read the book nor seen the BBC version, in fact, she loved it.<br/><br/>Therefore I must count myself prejudiced in liking Darcy and Elizabeth from 1995 better than these two (with tiny-chested Knightley a rather unlikely candidate for ""famed beauty"" in the 19th century).<br/><br/>However, I do have one reason for thinking it worthy of a very good rating: Bingley and Jane. Their chemistry is palpable, the stumbling Bingley is absolutely charming and believable, Jane is as beautiful and demure as she can be...their besottedness enchants the viewer.<br/><br/>Of course, as is always the case with feature-length films made from long books, many of the nuances and intricacies Austen supplies the reader with went missing; yet this film does a creditable job of covering all the major plot points in small time without actually changing any of essence, a remarkable achievement."
"sbretti","8","1","4","1 November 2005"," I liked it...
","I read too many reviews of this movie before seeing it, and was almost put off by it.<br/><br/>I have never read the book nor watched the much talked about mini series, so I didn't know too much about the movie other than the hammering it seemed to take in the reviews about how it didn't live up to people's expectations et cetera.<br/><br/>But for me, I thought it was a fun movie. There was good chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. When Elizabeth hated him, you feel hate for him, when she liked him, so did you... Mr Collins was a real laugh and Judi Dench was scary as ever. Great support cast for the two main actors. From everything I have read in the posted reviews about there not being enough emphasis placed on the support characters - for me, there didn't need to be. The two main characters were complex enough to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>Great movie for me, really enjoyable. I'd recommend it to anyone without any problems."
"ijclark","10","1","4","31 October 2005"," A really good adaptation of the story to film length.
","I was interested to see how Joe Wright could fit the story into 2 hours when th 6 Hr BBC series had trouble fitting it all in, and the film has done really well - keeping the tone and mood of Jane Austen's story while making sensitive adjustments (like leaving out Bingley's married sister and her husband, changing the famous Lady de Bourgh scene in the shrubbery etc) Matthew McFadyen is Colin Firth's equal and very different so it's a pleasure to have them both. I saw the 1930's Laurence Olivier version - it was a cross between Paint Your Wagon and Gone with the Wind, and the story adaptation was astonishingly ridiculous. Still worth a look so you know what good quality is when you see Joe Wright's P&P. I liked the way Matthew McF's Darcy used haughtiness simply in order to cope with life - basically he's a shy lad, with a desperate wish to have a great woman make a man of him.... I loved Jane - just perfect. Keira was a bit light, but okay in the end. Bingley was just fine too, and Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland were superb (although Donald's teeth were a bit American bright white for an old man.) I like Caroline Wilton too."

","The sensuality, beauty, and love of detail used to create this masterpiece make it a must for the ""cultured"" moviegoer. The casting, cinematography, music, costume, as well as period etiquette used to create this film make it a work-of-art of utmost beauty.<br/><br/>The world of Jane Austen has been portrayed in such wonderful way. The social and psycho- social conflicts of Austen's time are reflected in an uncorrupted way from Austen's point of view. It is an uncorrupted reflection of early 19th century upper-class Europe. The hardships and emotional rigidness of the time are almost unbearable for today's viewer. Truly, the conflict and heart-ache which Austen experienced is portrayed wonderfully in this film. <br/><br/>Sit back and let yourself be bathed in visual and musical beauty!"

Pride and Prejudice is known to be a classic love story but I believe that there needed to be at least one kiss between the two main characters. I did love it however. The actors were great and Mr. Darcy's blue eyes were hot! Kiera Knightly was very good too, as were her sisters. The whole movie and story was fantastic, and I'll be sure to read the book and see the previous movie. But overall, I absolutely loved this one!! Two thumbs up!!"
"RJamesSumner","9","1","4","29 October 2005"," Pride & Prejudice 2005 is a treat.
","Considering the acclaim of the 1995 BBC production of Pride & Prejudice, I went to the cinema wondering what new delights first-time director Joe Wright could bring to this oft-told tale.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report he and his production team succeeded by adding vitality and flavour to the mix. Examples of this are the claustrophobic cavorting of the Meryton knees-up and, a little later on, the post-Netherfield 'hangover' scene.<br/><br/>By sweeping away much of the novel's clutter (not, of course, from the Bennett household) this adaptation is tidy and to the point whilst retaining its humour and observation.<br/><br/>I know fans of Jane Austen will complain about 'axed' characters and scenes that have been either omitted or wrongly sited, but nothing has been lost as a result. Indeed, Darcy's first proposal is all the better for its re-location in the rain. What red-blooded man wouldn't want to reach out and kiss Lizzie at that moment - and could she have resisted Darcy had he done? I think not.<br/><br/>The casting was spot-on. It would be churlish to single out any one performance; everyone dazzled. Combined with wonderful settings, the whole thing is a treat.<br/><br/>It is pointless trying to make comparisons between this and the earlier TV version. Adaptation for film is very different to television - the silver screen has only two hours at its disposal, the box had five. Some critics seem not to understand this. Yes, one might prefer Colin Firth's Darcy or Keira's Elizabeth, but such arguments are purely subjective. And if you are a real purist, stick to the book! Those who have given this film a wide berth because they don't enjoy costume drama should cast aside their prejudice and give it a go. It's superb."
"koffeekonundrum","Null","1","5","21 October 2012"," I absolutely adore this film!
","One thing I have learned is that when a book is adapted into a film you should never go into that movie comparing it to the book. Obviously a movie will always be in the shadow of the book. Books are completely subjective to our own imaginations and when you watch a movie you get an entirely different person's interpretation of that book. Who really knows how Austen would have felt about the book, she might have been more enthralled with the iPod for all we know. Whining and griping about it wont change anything and it certainly doesn't deter me from going and seeing any movie.<br/><br/>I loved the novel. Not my favorite Austen novel, I rather liked Persuasion better. As far as adaptations go though I loved this version most. The 1995 BBC version was horrible and annoying to me. I couldn't get through the first episode without skipping through to my favorite parts. And even then it was lacking and far too drawn out. How could I even begin to compare it to my imagination, or of what MY Mr. Darcy looked like, acted, or sounded? When I saw it, I saw Colin Firth, not Mr. Darcy. In this version, I saw Mr. Darcy. You can truly appreciate a film when you notice not which actors are playing the characters but when you forget altogether that they are actors and get lost in their characters.<br/><br/>This version, while yes considerably shorter and omitting many parts made me feel more at home. Wright and I were more on the same level. The movie felt more romantic and I was glad not to see so many of those god awful high waist-ed dresses, which were an absolute eyesore along with those ridiculous bonnets. I understand its not ""historically accurate"" but how enjoyable is it to watch a film only for accuracies? The change ups were brilliant. The first time Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth is fast, raw and deliciously human. I rather liked the fact that they were so carried away with themselves. So angry that it felt like moving at very fast speeds and not knowing when it would happen but that you would crash at any second and burn. That is emotion, and that makes a good movie.<br/><br/>The U.S. ending is perhaps my most favorite part of the film. It is totally original in that it is not at all in the book. I felt that it was a perfect ending. Just the right amount of sweet to end the savory and sometimes bitter journey I had just been on. The way in which Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are openly displaying their affections feels genuine and just a taste of that happily ever after that we are always left to imagine at the end of any good story.<br/><br/>So I would ask that anyone would take away their prejudice from this film from any negative reviews. It would be much smarter if you judged it for yourself. If you don't like it then at least it is honestly and not on the back of someone else."
"shannon-228-780770","10","1","5","2 December 2011"," Outstanding performances
","I have only watched two adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. This one and the 1995 mini series. When doing a book adaptation it's impossible to please everyone especially on a book so widely beloved this one pleased me.<br/><br/>I've seen some reviews that nitpick this movie to death for historical inaccuracies. If you're looking for an adaptation faithfully accurate to the times this one might fall a bit short and the mini series might be closer to the mark.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie that captures the essence of Elizabeth and Darcy this is the one. <br/><br/>This shortened version leaves out some charming scenes and lines from the book. However when given the excellent portrayal of the characters (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) I find that easy to forgive.<br/><br/>If you loved Colin Firth's Darcy. This one might not be for you. Personally I like him as an actor but as Darcy he went from cold fish to love sick pup and right back to cold fish again. The final scene between Darcy and Elizabeth in the 1995 version is abut as warm as an ice cube on Darcy's part... not so here.<br/><br/>I felt Matthew Macfadyen did a much better job of capturing the essence of Darcy and brought his inner struggle across rather than merely appearing devoid of emotion entirely. Keira Knightley was stunningly captivating as Elizabeth and the chemistry between the two cannot be surpassed.<br/><br/>Really I can't find much fault in the portrayal of any character that was included from the book except Miss Darcy... it was a charming portrayal but not at all true to the book's description of the character. I feel Miss DeBerg looked a little too healthy and handsome also. Neither will trouble you if you haven't read the book or perhaps watched a different adaptation."
"lhhung_himself","6","1","5","16 August 2007"," Actually pretty good except for one scene...
","This is much like the 1940s version in that it does not try to portray the characters in their time period but more through the prism of the time of the audience. The balls are more rave-like than formal; the father softened and much closer to his daughters; Mr Collins more nerdy than unctuous; Elizabeth more girlish and less worldly; the romance just happening rather than developing. The pace is a little fast - it is a bit hard to keep up but the key elements are all there. The second ball scene in particular is used to excellent effect to quickly develop the characters.<br/><br/>Personally, I did not like Kiera Knightley's affected laugh, and I found her to be a very shallow Elizabeth - but that's just my taste. One scene, however, which nearly ruined the movie was the almost kiss in the gazebo. It was completely out of place and out of character and just very lazy scripting. It broke the illusion for me.<br/><br/>If you want a thorough, more true to the book experience - the 1995 version can't be beat but this is a pretty good update especially for those who wouldn't normally have the patience for Austen."
"kosmasp","5","1","5","9 July 2007"," Mr. Sutherland spoils us ..
","I wouldn't say that Donald Sutherland is my favorite actor. What he shows here though, although very good, does spoil the movie. Why you ask? Because whenever he's on screen, you get the feeling, what real acting is like! He could've centred the movie, but he's shown to little in it, to help it (this was of course on purpose, to elevate his performance, when he's on screen), on the contrary he's spoiling it!<br/><br/>The other actors (most of them younger) are good or rather can be good, and they showed it in other movies (I'm sure), but not here. But that's not all, the back and forth on many subjects on display here and the direction of the movie (which I don't really see getting anywhere, without taking too many detours), destroy all the romance that could've been there (or indeed was there for a little while). I never believed in any of the emotions the characters where trying to convince us they had (except Sutherland). And if I don't believe them, then there's no movie that I could like more better!"

","If it were just the acting in this adaptation that were top-notch I might not be compelled to GUSH about it quite as much as I am. But no...not only do Keira, Matthew, Donald, Brenda, and the ENTIRE cast give heartfelt and loyal performances, but the MUSIC...the cinematography (scenery)...the locations...the film techniques...it was all such a refined and excellently assembled package that I think the actors could quite have read the phone book for lines and I would have been thinking it wasn't a bad film at all.<br/><br/>But no, they had Jane Austen's wonderful dialogue to deliver, and that, on top of the rest, made this film a delight that I have already shared with the next generation, and hope she will share it with her next generation.<br/><br/>If I had to complain (and I don't!) it would be that while they had all these fine actors assembled they should have filmed hours and hours and hours, filling in all the wonderful details that were left out...cut it for distribution and add all the cut scenes back in for the DVD. I would gladly sit before my television for 6 hours worth of this film."
"bostonlatin","10","1","5","5 March 2006"," Excellent adaptation but kinda Jane Austen ""Lite""
","Director Joe Wright has created a visual and musical enchantment. Keira Knightley deserves her Oscar nomination. She captures the movie's essence and the movie revolves around her persona. The English country side photography and set designs are beautiful. The big ballroom scene is classically done with the camera following the main characters each in their own little world perspective.<br/><br/>I later watched the BBC version and I can understand why the BBC stalwarts are defensive. Colin Firth is Mr. D'Arcy so anybody would have big feet to follow those footsteps. The BBC version at 5 hours is 90 minutes too long and the movie version is 45 minutes too short. The 5 TV hours allows for character development but is quite draggy in many parts. In the movie version it is very difficult to pick up the nuances especially if you don't know the story. The movie D'Arcy doesn't hold up as well and the pride doesn't show up as much as self doubt and hesitancy. I also agree that the movie Bingley is a bit too floppish and idiotic while the movie Mr. Collins is far superior to the TV version. Boy, this is getting confusing.<br/><br/>The bottom line for people could be; do they like a 20 year old Lizzie Bennett or a 27 year old Lizzie Bennett. Mature or college age.<br/><br/>Overall a beautiful story well made in both the movie and TV versions."

For those who have not read Jane Austen, this modern adaptation is a excellent way to recruit newcomers to familiarize themselves with her work.

Moreover, the movie is abrupt towards the end.<br/><br/>The second is that some parts of the script are too modern, straying away at times from Jane Austen's style. There were also minor inconsistencies between the actual time period of the book and movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the performances of Keira and Matthew was very good. Both brought something new and interesting to the role of Darcy and Elizabeth...and they had incredible chemistry.<br/><br/>If you are a die hard Austen purist that expects the movie to follow every detail of the book, you may not like it.

","I love this movie. Before it came out, I was so excited that I was a little afraid that I was raising my hopes and expectations too high. Surely, this movie does not compare to the A&E version, but it also had less time to play with. I think that this film portrayed the book in a refreshingly new way. The only aspect of the movie that I can complain about was how fast it went. The action moves from one problem to another without giving you time to take a breath. I could have sat in the theater for another hour, but any die hard Pride and Prejudice fan would have as well. This movie is trying to appeal to a bigger audience. In many ways, I think that this movie showed the income difference between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth better than in the A&E version. Knightly and MacFadyen did a great job. I cannot wait until I can see it again in the theaters, and it really will not come out on DVD soon enough."
"annie-186","9","1","5","27 October 2005"," A first class adaptation
","This edition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the truest adaptation I have seen of Jane Austen's famous novel. I was surprised that the movie was made in the reasonably recent wake of the very popular BBC TV mini series with Colin Firth's Darcy, but I'm glad it was.<br/><br/>The film, like the series, had awe inspiring landscapes and stately home settings. My favourite was a scene in the Peak District with Keira Knightley just standing on some rocks on a hill. The difference between this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and the others was the faultless acting. Keira captured Elizabeth Bennett's persona as I had read her: highly intelligent, opinionated and with a strong sense of playful mischief. Matthew MacFadyen had Darcy's arrogance, but also a credible sense of vulnerability which made one believe that Elizabeth could have fallen for him. I was left wondering in other versions how on earth Elizabeth could have any feelings beyond gratitude for Darcy because he still remained very contained. Brenda Blethyn was perfect as the mother: a role very easy to overact as Mrs Bennett's character is so crass.<br/><br/>Another aspect I liked about this film is that it truly reflected the family in their status of genteel poverty. They have a lovely home, but it is rather the worse for wear. One thing I had to chuckle at though was the state of the farm. I can't believe that anyone would let their yard get into such a scruffy state, no matter how little money they had! A surprisingly good film. My husband enjoyed it very much also, ergo not your standard period drama for the girls.<br/><br/>9/10"

We both enjoyed every minute of this film. We found ourselves totally immersed in this beautiful film,the many fine acting performances, excellent use humour and, of course,the intense love themes.

I know that trying to squash it all into two hours means some things had to be left out, but overall it was an excellent adaptation. I've seen the so-called 'iconic' mini-series and I didn't like that at all. Jennifer Ehle was too old - she made Lizzy seem fat and matronly. Lizzy is only 20, Ehle was just too mature for the part and her stupid smirk (she does it in everything I've seen her in) really annoyed me. I did not find the movie lacking in humour and I did not find Collins and Lady Catherine flat or devoid of character, neither was the portrayal of Bingley a failure. Quite the opposite. The audience I shared my viewing with seemed to find Collins very amusing and loved Mr Bingley. Keira Knightley was superb. Her performance was a delight. You could see why Darcy - and Collins, and Wickham - were captured. As for the comments about making her look 'plain' - why would that be needed? Elizabeth Bennet is described as pretty and the second most attractive of the Bennet sisters after Jane. Why would Knightley have had to be made to look 'plain'? I loved the period depiction. It was so refreshing to have the cast speak naturally instead of putting on false airs as is often the case in period movies. The country setting, the squalor of the Bennet household, the mud, the dirty hems and the rest helped bring it all to life. I loved it, I wish it had been longer, but that is my only criticism."
"leigherrington","9","1","5","18 October 2005"," Better than expected
","Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest books I've ever read and as an adaptation, the BBC's production had a lot to deliver. In turn the film adaptation had to be even better!!<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>I still believe that the roles were written for Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle but Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFayden were great. The BBC's production had the luxury of being able to tell the story in 6 hours where as the film could only realistically be 3.<br/><br/>All of the important aspects of the book were present in the film but even here there were changes. The film was generally romanticised and truly emphasised the difference between rich Mr. Darcy and Poor Elizabeth Bennet. <br/><br/>Some say that Pride and Prejudice isn't a love story but I disagree. I believe it is a story about the time and the society but most of all that you can't always trust your first impression and definitely a love story!<br/><br/>Having read the book several times and watched the BBC's adaptation I knew the ending- and yet I was still on the edge of my seat! I suppose I'm just a hopeless romantic.<br/><br/>I was, however, severely disappointed that the wet shirt scene didn't feature! Other than this lack of a very important scene the film adaptation is worth seeing, if only to prove that it's not as bad as you think it's going to be."
"MrSkeffington","8","1","6","8 May 2006"," Incomplete but a wonderful viewing experience
","Trying to condense Jane Austin's most complex story into two hours requires a dramatic short-hand so severe that viewers who don't already know the story might be lost. However, it's such an elegant, deft short-hand that you might not care. Almost everything about this film is breath-taking and delightful, from the characterizations to the cinematography to the set pieces, and it presents all this without the energy-sucking solemnity that often mars film-interpretations of 18th and 19th century novels. The truly Herculean efforts are the actors' burdens: None of them get enough screen time to really develop their characters, but the excellent and considerably large cast does a lot with what they have. The film makers allow Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) to be played, for once, close to the age she's supposed to be; she's allowed to be a bit giddy now and then instead of the wise, bookish character most versions go for. It's only her age and perhaps a quirk of temperament that makes her more mature than her younger sisters, and her line, ""I do love to laugh,"" finally makes sense. As Mr. Bingley, Simon Woods is perhaps a bit too goofy in his efforts to be the all-around jovial fellow, but there's no question that he savors his bucolic life. Matthew Macfadyen is handed the always-difficult task of playing Mr. Darcy, a fabulously wealthy man whose social awkwardness and insecurity is interpreted as haughtiness. He almost gets it right, but he could hardly have done better within this script. The excellent Brenda Blethyn plays Mrs. Bennett only slightly less hysterically than most versions, and the character is better for it. In one telling moment, Mrs. Bennett giggles along with her daughters as a regiment of handsome soldiers marches by; it defines Mrs. Bennett in one ten-second shot. As usual, both Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are played 20 years older than they would have been in life. I would say that Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg are wasted, except that they do so much with so little that they're a pleasure to watch. In Sutherland, the film makers avoid making Mr. Bennett the affable, easy-going old gentleman that Hollywood loves, digging instead for the rather feckless man of leisure who is both too comfortable and at loose ends, rather feckless, resentful of his spouse and weakened by the fact that he has no control over his own destiny. Judi Dench is a cipher as Lady Catherine, but she does make every line count. Special kudos to Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins, who avoids the easy route of the foppish, self-important cliché, going instead for an under-socialized parson of ridiculous but almost frightening intensity. He makes for an all-too-believable nerd. Except for Lizzie and Jane, the sisters get no character development whatsoever. One of them scandalizes the family for about 15 seconds, one of them is a bit serious, and one of themdoesn't and isn't. They all seem like terrific actresses, so it's a shame that they don't get to strut a little more. The cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous, and the sets are rich with detail and atmosphere, from the Bennetts' respectable but rundown abode to the excitement and clamour of a country ball. If anything, some scenes are perhaps too heavily populated; it's hard to believe that all of rural England held as many people as are seen in Merriton. There are shots and pans that alone are worth the time to watch the entire film, and there are several very neat traveling shots that are there simply to show off, as in a party scene during which the camera meanders like a guest from one crowded room to the next, giving us a tiny piece of plot or character every few seconds, in one long shot. The nods to popular taste are jarring and inappropriate  here comes Mr. Darcy like Heathcliff through the mist, his shirt open halfway to his navel, to claim Lizzie alone on the moors  but they're mercifully infrequent and forgivable. In general, this is a delightful version of the story, more energetic and accessible than most, sinning no less against the original than other theatrical versions, delightfully romantic and a terrific way to spend an evening."
"blpetras","Null","1","6","21 April 2006"," name of statue?
","Loved the film. Ms. Knightly is brilliant in her ability to convey so much with such subtlety. I was surprised that I enjoyed Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy more than Colin Firth's. His warmth and vulnerability was more realistic, though Firth's iciness was. The catch-my-breath scene, for me, has to be at the very end as he's walking toward Elizabeth in the early morning mist. That is the BEST walk!!! <br/><br/>In the scene when Elizabeth and the Gardiners tour Darcy's Pemberley house, they all end up in a brightly lit room full of marble statues. There is one in particular that is, as Jane Bennett would say, ""breathtaking"". Does anyone know the name of the statue Elizabeth Bennett is looking at, that is of a female, standing, wearing a veil with a crown of flowers? Is this a real piece, or one that was made solely for the film?? She looks at this statue right before we see the marble bust of Mr. Darcy. Anyone?"
"kimvera","5","1","6","20 April 2006"," Enjoyable but where is Mr. Darcy?
","I really enjoyed this film and would say it certainly exceeded my expectation. However, I must say the New Darcy was not satisfying at all and don't understand how some of people say this young actor portrayed Mr. Darcy well enough. He had his own charm and looked handsome but he was not Mr. Darcy at all. He was just a shy and romantic guy who can make women swoon but not arrogant and proud Mr.Darcy. I'm not even comparing him with Colin Firth. I enjoyed Keira but there was too much giggling that I hated. The both actors seemed to suit together in the movie but all in all they were not Ms. Bennet and Mr. Darcy that I expected.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie had some faults but still enjoyable."
"YorkvilleGirl","5","1","6","8 December 2005"," Entertaining, but not Jane Austen
","One saving grace of any film that takes place two centuries ago is that there's no product placement to annoy me.<br/><br/>Well, this movie was fine. It entertained me and the actors acquitted themselves well. On the other hand, the director seemed to believe that the witty, sharp-edged dialog of the Jane Austen novel needed more of a modern punch, written by second-rate screenwriters. Apparently, we modern folk are incapable of understanding words put down more than 20 years ago.<br/><br/>The film deliberately de-glamorized the era - the country gentry apparently never brushed their hair, kept pigs in their manor houses and wore shabby, sack dresses over their stylishly anorexic figures. Who knew? Nobody said this adaptation needed to be faithful to the book...but at the very least, offer us something original in exchange.<br/><br/>The oddest thing, however, was that tacked-on American ending. My gosh...I thought I was watching the final scene from the movie ""Sixteen Candles,"" that old Molly Ringwald teen classic. In fact, it was so visually similar, I half-expected Lizzie Bennet to thank Darcy for getting her panties back.<br/><br/>Seriously. I'm not kidding!"
"katee_the_quick","10","1","6","25 October 2005"," Simply enchanting
","In all honesty I walked into the theatre (1 out of 3) with a great deal of apprehension wondering the same thing that doubtless others were - do we really need yet another adaptation of this beloved Austen classic? Being a stalwart fan of both the book and the 1995 BBC mini-series I wasn't expecting much from Wright's film. I have never been happier to be wrong.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is simply enchanting. I am quite sure that there are Austen fanatics out there who are dying because the film did not emulate the novel in every single way, but this is an 'adaptation'. And it brings something wonderfully new to the story - the film, unlike the almost satirical novel or the comedic mini-series is realistic. The Bennet household is cluttered and run-down, the assembly hall is something less than grand; there is a distinct 'country' feel to the film that was lacking in the BBC adaptation. The attention to detail is impressive, where Lizzie actually hits off-keys when playing at Rosings (sadly lacking in previous adaptations).<br/><br/>The highlight of the film however is not the stunning cinematography or the gloriously evocative soundtrack but the characters, many of whom are explored on a level which was completely untouched by both the book and previous adaptations. Mr Bennet is portrayed as a loving, but cynical father who at many times simply cannot be bothered to intervene when his wife and daughters are concerned. And yet, we see him holding Mary during the Netherfield ball displaying his love for all his daughters, rather then just Lizzie and Jane. Likewise, Mrs Bennet is both irritating and delightful at the same time - Blethyn's performance allows for empathy and a better understanding this character. Charlotte's 'spinsterhood' is more pronounced in this adaptation, but her character is infinitely better for it. The scene between her and Lizzie on the swing is of particular note, bringing out sides of the characters which were untouched in the BBC version.<br/><br/>And of course there are the simply superb performances from Knightley and McFayden. Keira Knightley, an odd choice for the role of Lizzie, is a delight to watch. She truly commands this film, playing a far more fiery and witty Elizabeth Bennet. She brings a youthfulness about the character, and her flaws and outbursts are much more marked then Jennifer Ehle's calm and in-control interpretation. Finally! We see the side of Lizzie who feels, and more importantly displays, guilt and frustration and anger and grief - and yet always remains in character. The major change to the script, where Lizzie does not confide in her sister Jane about what conspired in Kent, was inspired. This added so much colour and depth to her character. The scenes of her snapping at her family (after the visit from Lady Catherine), her reaction towards Charlotte's news of her engagement and the actual fight between her and Darcy after he proposes the first time (also a high point for McFayden) all display more humane aspects of her character.<br/><br/>McFayden is wonderful. His interpretation of Darcy is softened which personally I found much, MUCH more attractive. His lofty and aloof, yet vulnerable portrayal is utterly believable. There is no doubt about it, he comes out with flying colours over Colin Firth. The slow-building chemistry between Knightley and McFayden is superb and had me squirming in my seat with delight.<br/><br/>Even the 'cliched' scenes of Darcy and Lizzie fighting in the rain and the final scene with the pair reconciling in the mist of the morning is still exquisitely romantic. Clichés they may be, but we love it all the more for it. This adaptation is not meant as a study of 18th century society, but at heart, is a love story. And these scenes do convey that sense beautifully.<br/><br/>Patricularly for a two-hour film, this is outstanding. Don't watch this film expecting to see a reenactment of the mini-series or the book - this is not an Austen duplicate. Watch it for what it is - a truly, truly beautiful love story."
"X-Ice","9","1","6","19 October 2005"," A more casual, less proper Pride and Prejudice
","I loved the look of the new 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice: people perspire, have bad haircuts and there is dirt visible in the Bennet house. Sometimes, in the dance scenes, the dance floor seemed actually crowded! Even with several servants, the Bennets' lives looked as imperfect as Mrs. Bennet often describes them. <br/><br/>As a confirmed Janeite, I had trouble at first accepting the modified dialog. I love Austen's prose and each character has his or her own voice; but the new screenplay shortened long exchanges that would have slowed the action. I realize now that the incredible achievement of fitting the plot into two hours would not have been possible if the original wording of my favorite scenes had been preserved. None of the major plot points were cut and only a few brothers-in-law and aunts were left out. This script also makes the story more accessible to a new audience. I know folks already are starting to read the book as a result of having seen the film.<br/><br/>Although satisfied, for the most part, with the casting, I was interested by the ages of the actors and actresses. Susannah Harker played Jane Bennet in 1995; she was born in 1965 -- too old! Rosamund Pike is 26, and those four years make quite a difference in believability. Regardless of her true age, Jena Malone was so bratty, she never seemed a minute over 16. Keira Knightley captured the combination of the vivaciousness of someone barely out of her teens and the wisdom that makes Elizabeth Bennet my favorite fictional character. In 1940, Greer Garson played Elizabeth; she was 36! However, if Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were married young, as Jane Austen said they were, Blethen and Sutherland are too old to have children the age of the Bennet girls. Judi Densch has been playing women younger than herself for quite a while; and who else could possibly have portrayed Lady Catherine as well? <br/><br/>I think the ridiculousness of Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were toned down a little too much in this screenplay, although Tom Hollander presented a wonderful combination of self-importance and self-deprecation that is the essence of his character. As for Darcy and Bingley, Colin Firth (P&P, 1995) and Naveen Andrews (Bride and Prejudice, 2004) are such favorites of mine, it is difficult to comment, but I particularly appreciated the lack of confidence of both of these characters that the actors allowed us to glimpse in this new version. <br/><br/>Some literary purists may disdain this new, big screen adaptation, but remember, a feature film is not a mini-series any more than it is a book and this production is far more faithful than was the last one (1940). In many ways it is a perfect introduction for the uninitiated. After all, Jane Austen began writing Pride and Prejudice more than 200 years ago!"
"Philby-3","8","1","7","22 October 2005"," Another spin in the Austen
","Ah! Another spin in the country in the old Austen! Here we come, Hertford, Kent and Derbyshire (and a few other locations as well). The two most striking things about this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" are the liveliness of the direction and the exuberance of the cast. Keira Knightley, whose flawless beauty at 20 years old can stand the closest of close-ups, can act as well, and, despite the odd anachronism in Deborah Moggach's script, she gives us an appropriately spirited Elizabeth Bennet. Matthew McFadyen (""Spooks""), battling against the definitive image of Colin Firth in the role in the 1995 TV version, gives us a Darcy to compare, if not match.<br/><br/>The Bennet family is a lively, noisy lot and Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet manages to make her something more than the comic upstart matchmaker of previous versions. I thought Donald Sutherland as a Canadian Mr Bennet something of an anomaly (it was very hard to expunge memories of Benjamin Whitrow in the role) but even if he does not quite convince as an English gentleman with a large family and in reduced circumstances, he handles the fond father bit very well.<br/><br/>The minor characters do not disappoint either; Tom Hollander does a superb Mr Collins, a little man in every way, and Judy Dench, although more of a termagant than a monster of aristocratic hauteur, packs plenty of punch as Lady Katherine De Bourgh, Collins' patroness and Darcy's aunt. I didn't care for Rupert Friend as Wickham the cad, who seemed to have wandered in, pony tail and all, from the set of a another movie, but Simon Woods gave us a nice eager, but not over bright, 5000 a year Bingley, the catch for sister Jane.<br/><br/>There are lots of people, lots of dancing, busy muddy farmyards and crowded market places. This is a very busy, bustling film as the makers shoehorn the novel's story into less than two hours, but there are some occasional moments of tranquility, including one scene where Elizabeth, standing on top of a rock, dress fluttering in the breeze, gazes out onto the rugged landscape. It was a straight steal from somewhere  a version of ""Wuthering Heights"" I suspect.<br/><br/>This is entertainment and not Eng Lit. Not all the best lines are there but the necessary production values are  good acting, fine costumes, well-paced direction by Joe Wright, good locations, dynamic cinematography and appropriate music (if at times a little too well played to be authentic). Really, there's not a lot to complain about, certainly not while Keira Knightley is on the screen.<br/><br/>It is a paradox how a series of novels so specific in their time, place and social milieu can have such universal appeal. Austen has been exploited in all sorts of ways by film-makers, from the straight re-telling of the story as in the 1995 TV version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to the embedding of the story of ""Emma"" in the teen flick ""Clueless"" (not to mention the Indian version ""Bride and Prejudice"" and the shameless rip-off of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"". Not doubt Jane herself would have remarked ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single film producer in possession of a good budget must be in want of an Austen script"". There are a few miles left in the old Austen yet.<br/><br/>Note, for our transatlantic readers ""Austin"" was an English make of uncharismatic motor vehicles which after 70 years of production faded away in the early 90s."
"FilmFANnatic","8","1","7","26 September 2005"," P&P is excellent
","I would just like to say I think Pride and Prejudice is an excellent film. I am only 16 and at first wondered what was the point in watching a movie that was a U and therefore contained no sex/language/violence however P&P is great in so many other ways. It is visually stunning and well acted and I believe it appeals to an audience who would normally not be interested in a film version of a classic. Far from bogging the watcher down with confusing dialogue and an overcomplicated plot it told the story in an authentic way without alienating a younger audience. Although I wouldn't recommend this to very small children I would definitely tell anyone not completely repulsed by the idea of a Jane Austen novel on screen, to watch it."

This adaptation is not done well at all. <br/><br/>They leave out a lot of the wit and sarcasm that makes this story so great. At times they change key parts of dialogue that was once great to lackluster, mindless drivel.

No, it's Jane Austen's soap-opera nonsense for the 19th century that is so often chosen for literature classes all over the (English-speaking) world.<br/><br/>A bunch of hormonally-stricken, very bored sisters (there was no TV or internet back then) play a game of ""who-gets-whom"", while a parade of men strut around, hoping their alpha-maleness and/or cash will impress the lonely/solo/unpicked/free females that surround them and regularly foam on the mouth.

Don't be fooled by the pretentious title, all ye who art uninitiated. This is NOT a ""deep"" account with insightful or dare I say philosophical aspects. It's your average 25-cent pulp novel all wrapped up in nice (read: old = respectable) clothing. Occasionally, some character will say something semi-intelligent, but it's not much more exalted than the usual fortune-cookie stuff.<br/><br/>The cast. Keira Knightley is an unbearably poor choice to play the ""hottest"" sister, the female lead. She is as unsuitable for this role and time period as she is to being an actress. Very little talent, and ""charisma"" that consists of the viewer feeling sorry for her for her anorexia and lack of breasts. She is, however, at her most annoying when she SMILES: she does look like an alien in those moments. Watching her silly-shaped mouth form a smile made me squirm and sweat, and believe me it wasn't sexually exciting or anything like it. But why wonder? She is the daughter of successful actors, i.e. the doors were all open for her from day one. Jena Malone was cute and lively, Brenda Blethyn is a good actress, Macfadyen is a good choice for the ""legendary"" Darcy, but all of that isn't nearly enough to save this crap.<br/><br/>Pride?

The main story is girl likes boy, boy likes girl, girl gets mad at boy, then finds out he isn't so bad after all, and takes him back.<br/><br/>On a side note, I thought it was really annoying for almost everyone to refer to someone else as Mr. or Mrs. instead of first names.

"abalakov","3","0","2","5 January 2020"," super review of the film
","Pride and prejudice (drama) - a film by Joe Wright, based on the novel by Jane Austen, which starred famous actors: keira Knightley, Matthew McFadden, Rosamund pike, Donald Sutherland and many others.<br/><br/>The film is set in England in the late 18th century. The parents of the five Bennet sisters are concerned about getting their daughters married successfully. And so the regular life of a respectable family is turned upside down when a young gentleman - Mr. Bingley-appears in the neighborhood. Of course, among the friends of the new neighbor is a lot of refined aristocrats who are not averse to court the charming sisters. However, it's not that simple. Headstrong Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, the handsome and arrogant Mr. Darcy, and a serious confrontation breaks out between them, the result of which can be both love and hatred.<br/><br/>The film leaves much to be desired. Incomprehensible plot. The appearance of the characters did not match the age in which the film was set. The film doesn't match the book. The actors did not play their roles to the maximum. Of course, this is my personal opinion. I, as a fan of horror, science fiction and Comedy, can not advise you this film. And whether to watch a movie is up to you to decide.<br/><br/>If the Director had made not a film, but a multi-part series, in which every page, every line of the novel was transmitted, then the plot would have turned out to be more interesting. The film, written on the plot of any book, should convey the colors of the plot, and not cut the plot itself. A film based on a novel is a representation of the entire plot, but not in the head, but on the screen."

Visually, it is breathtaking. The cinematography is BEAUTIFUL but with that being stated, that is all that is good about it. The problem, of course, is the attempt to modernize Jane Austen's story, which SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TRIED. Her story is imbedded with the customs of the time and those customs are what shaped the story AND its characters. You CANNOT change what -should have been the foundation- of the film without destroying the story as a whole. The THREE unforgivable scenes, imho, are: the pigs running through the house, the barn dance and ... Elizabeth in a wet field in her underwear. Her underwear? Really? A well-bred lady? Not to mention the risk of pneumonia in an era when it can kill you (no antibiotics yet, folks). I just can't get past the historical inaccuracies. They are too blatant. The 1995 BBC rendition is just about perfect. If you REALLY want to watch Pride & Prejudice, please give it a try. Better yet, read the novel. Her style is priceless."

And the special effects are equally as good. But the truth is this movie is absolutely hilarious. It's funny because aside from adding zombies, kenjutsu and shaolin boxing, the writers kept everything else as faithful to Jane Austin as possible. I have seen Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen quite a few times and much of the dialogue is identical, indicating that both versions stayed close to Jane Austin's original text. When real dialogue from the Pride and Prejudice is given while girls are cleaning muskets and sparring, it becomes gut wrenchingly hilarious. Zombie action, comedy and horror with some classical literature mixed in.
Oh and Bonus Lena Headey and Lily James ""shwing"" ."

","I watched this with my 6-year-old daughter and we had a great time, laughed a lot, mostly at the same things and found it very entertaining. It's a more frivolous, less faithful version, with little sense of the social repression of the time it's supposedly set in, and some of the incongruities are a bit difficult, but it's funny and there are some good performances (Tom Hollander's Mr Collins stood out for both of us for sheer comic value and we found ourselves rewinding his bits). It will inevitably meet with criticism from some Austen fans (of which I am one), but it has its niche; I would probably only watch it again under similar circumstances but would do so happily."

","Far less worthy that ""Pride and Prejudice"" screening from 1995. The words the actors say are entirely the same as in the former movie, hence the goal of the remake, as it appears, has been merely to make a full length movie from a series of episodes. The abridged version is no better than the old one. Say, when Elizabeth and Colonel Forrester are speaking, and she finds out about the role that Darcy has played in her sister's loss of her admirer Mr Bingley, the scene takes place during their solitary walk in Pemberley grounds (1995). This creates a nice atmosphere, where nothing gets in the way, and viewers can hear the conversation well. On the contrary, in the 2005 movie the same circumstances are being relayed to Miss Elizabeth in a church, where Mr Collins is reading his sermon. This adds nothing to the understanding of her feelings towards Mr Darcy, and their change. It merely serves to shorten the movie, and is for no other cinematographically sensible reason. As for the actors, Keira Nightley is far too attractive to play Elizabeth, and she looks sometimes too light-headed (as in the scene where she enters to visit her sister Jane when the latter is ill, her looks are so seductive, and her hair so deliberately arranged, one would never think she just walked 3 miles. And we never actually get a glimpse of her ham, ""16 inches deep in mud"", as in the earlier movie). And even though Matthew Macfadyen does splendidly for a Mr Darcy (not equal to Colin Firth, but quite proud and aloof), his speeches are so abridged as well, that we can hardly call his character persuasive in the movie. I can also but wonder, as other reviewers have pointed out, at Wright feeling it appropriate to create that ""in-the-mist"" scene in the early morning, where Elizabeth confesses her love to Mr Darcy. I hardly think it is plausible given the conventions of the Victorian times, in which the novel was set, that a woman would walk out of her home in such clothes, and the adaptation of the novel into the movie hardly demands such amends. One can only but conclude that the movie was never intended as anything more than a re-make of the former series, and it added nothing more to the screening of the novel than new faces in place of old ones. Which is very unfortunate, as the novel has a lot to convey, and this has already been decently done in the 1995 film. The new one merely reiterates it, and not too masterfully."

","I watched this and although I loved the way Mr. Darcy was portrayed by the actor I didn't really like the way they depicted Elizabeth. Over all I thought the film missed too many scenes and it felt really rushed. KN played Elizabeth as a giddy and naive girl that made me question if she suffered of depression or anxiety instead of just a misunderstanding and having too much pride like Mr. Darcy. The BBC episodes set too high a standard for any film that followed (6 hours verses 2). Collin Firth played a very proud Mr. Darcy but he makes you fall in love with him even after all these years. I recommend watching the 1995 version over this one but overall I rate this a 7 since I love the story."

","If you are not familiar with the original story, you may actually enjoy this, but if you are a big fan of the book and both of the BBC series, you may find yourself wanting.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is great and done very well. The actors do their part fairly well, but there are some things I find annoying which I will mention below. Matthew Macfadyen does a decent job as Mr. Darcy and is definitely handsome enough. Keira is OK Elizabeth, but I don't think that is her fault.<br/><br/>The part written for Charles Bingley was most annoying as he comes across like a bumbling idiot. It is very hard to watch his scenes without being annoyed at how stupid he comes across. I would expect more of a friend of Mr. Darcy. Keira as Elizabeth is OK, like I said above, but she doesn't come across as sensible as the Lizzy in the book as fan of the book would expect. <br/><br/>The interpretation of the story I find somewhat lacking as so many details are left out, and key characters seem to be missing and/or glossed over, such as the part Wickham plays in the story. I realize they probably had to cut some of the content to make it 129 minutes, but in this day and age they probably could have afforded another 30 minutes to do it a bit more justice, as so many movies today do, or even split it into two parts.<br/><br/>All in all, if you've never read the book, or have not been spoiled by both BBC series, then this may appeal to you for face value. It does have its moments where it really shines, but compared to what has come before it, it pales."

","Even though Pride & Prejudice is a typical 18th century romance story, modern filmmaking keeps the audience glued to the screen. In a sense, the film was created as an action picture, not with the intention of wowing audiences with flashy effects, but engaging them with the same type of intensity. The brilliant creators of Pride & Prejudice composed some of the best cinematography Hollywood has ever seen. In addition, audiences see some of England's most regal estates. These century-old mansions are so magnificent; today, one may need an admission ticket to get a peek inside. Another equally important aspect of the filmmaking is the attention to detail. No matter what is happening in the scene, the audience's eye always has something entertaining to view.<br/><br/>The characters in Pride & Prejudice are what make the film the ultimate love story. Audiences will be swept off their feet as each character takes them on an amazing journey of conflict and emotion. What I find so captivating is the complexity each one possesses. Every unique personality helps the audience fall head over heels for the plot line.<br/><br/>The believability and realism of Pride & Prejudice comes from the brilliant actors who portray these marvelous characters. They all deliver a unique, consistent performance that makes the story so appealing and real. Much of the delight of watching this movie comes from Keira Knightly, who plays Elisabeth Bennet. In many ways, she is perfect for the iconic, beloved heroine. Her less famous co-star, Matthew Macfadyen gives a most outstanding performance as one of the greatest romantic heroes of all time."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","2","24 July 2015"," The shortest way between two hearts is never a straight line ...
","Most of the delight provided by Joe Wright's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is that the late 18th century material of Jane Austen's celebrated novel is handled with a subtle but imperceptible modern touch. <br/><br/>It is as though the heroines were not much different from high school girls of two centuries later, not that the movie was modernized in such a way it betrayed Jane Austen's spirit but in its clearly stated intention to target a younger audiences, it found the perfect note and tone to that, much more with the perfect actresses. It's not even a coincidence that all the plot-driving Bennett sisters are played by future A-list players: Carey Mulligan, Rosamund Pike and last but not least, Keira Knightley. Today, they gathered more Oscar nominations together than Donald Sutherland... in one of his most charming and endearing roles as a father stricken by the blessing (or the curse) of having only daughters.<br/><br/>Watching these sisters interact during the film reminded of this cliché of teenage girls gossiping, wondering if the school heartthrob said this or that, or how they can approach him without looking too pushy or needy. It's all the same game in ""Pride & Prejudice"" but it works even better in the film because the stakes are higher than a simple flirt or a date, the film is about marriage and we all know what it meant in the 18th century, for girls as much as men. A man with a profession and a good fortune had to be married, at eighteen, a girl had to find such a man, all she had to do was to be pretty, fertile, other considerations such as wit and personality were more or less important. The point was that anyone with a daughter had to make it a matter of honor to prevent her from being a spinster, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Betthlyn) had five daughters, so it wasn't a part-time job, she would know no rest before she'd marry the youngest one, and yes, they had to be married in order, in order not to show that one had been passed over.<br/><br/>It's a whole marketing process where money was at stakes as well as love matters. With five daughters, only a male distant cousin of the family, the boring Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) would inherit from the Bennett's landowning fortune. There are parameters to be taken into consideration and urgency is one of them. And the intelligence of the film is not to overdo the 'modernity' card. Indeed, had it ever tried to criticize them indirectly, that would've been too artificially feminist for its own good, but even Lizzie, who is the most free-spirited sister, accepts the obligation of marriage as part of life requirements, because she's also, like any girl of her age, in quest of a true love, and she's not deprived of bad looks. Keira Knightley is perfect with that unique combination of youthful full-bloom beauty, mature intelligence and that cute smile that oddly distorts her lips and shrink her eyes, a sight that melts my heart every time. She's typically the girl any man would fall in lover with, but obviously, she's not for any man. One of the most painful moments is when Cousin Collins, as boring a pastor as vertically challenged, asks her for marriage and she finds the proper words to put him in his place, diplomatic, polite but final.<br/><br/>She does so, because if not her heart, her mind is still invaded by the figure of Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFayden) a handsome and smoothly brooding friend of the more sociable and jovial Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) who just moved next to the Bennetts and seems to have grown a mutual fondness with the older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). Jane, as a naturally shy girl, doesn't express her excitement enough although she likes Bingley, and at the risk of not appearing needy, she dangerously lets her attitude slide toward a form of cold distance during the crucial ball scene. Meanwhile, a few exchanges between Lizzie and Darcy showed the obligatory dislike at first sight but one of a peculiar sort that can't fool us, it's acted in such a way that we can't believe these two persons aren't made for each other. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the growing romance between Jane and Bingley allows Lizzie and Darcy to meet more regularly despite their official façade of animosity. Of course, the romance won't go without a series of misunderstandings, properly set as narrative obstacles, the most memorable involve a dashing young captain named Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) in contention with Darcy and a domineering aunt, played by Judi Dench, who has other plans for Darcy. The movie is a powerful illustration that the shortest way between two hearts is never a straight line, but neither the bitchy aunt or the presumptuous captain are as effective antagonists in the film as the titular pride and prejudice, prejudice hurts one's pride and a hurt pride paves the way to prejudice, and most the excitement comes from watching these two hearts trying to get out of that vicious circle...<br/><br/>... that, and seeing Mrs. Bennett desperately praising her daughters' charms and virtues as if she was trying to be the saleswoman of the month."
"ketandra","9","0","3","15 June 2015"," The Best Adaptation of Well-known Novel
","Pride and Prejudice is a very famous book. Written by Jane Austen, this novel is unique and unrepeatable. It has been adapted a few times, and the adaptation of 2005 is my favorite. I love the book, I may even say it is my favorite book, and I loved the film when I saw it too. The action happens in England, in the end of 18th century. The parents of five daughters are concerned of how to marry them. The rich aristocrat, Mr. Bingley, has moved into their neighborhood. While he started to like the eldest daughter, Jane, his friend, Mr. Darcy, clashes with the second-eldest daughter, Elizabeth. <br/><br/>Firstly, this adaptation has a well-chosen cast. Keira Knightly is very suitable for her character, Elizabeth. She ironic but also tactful. She playfully pointed at her cousin's excessive flattery while dinner and he did not even notice it. Keira Knightly is a good actress to show Elizabeth's growing confusion and then loss when she realizes how she has misread her feelings. For me she makes only positive impression. Matthew Macfadyen is the best choice for Mr.Darcy role. He is an aristocrat who was trained from childhood do not express his feelings. In a scene where he bursts in Collins' house to talk to Elizabeth shows how he is vulnerable to feelings that he cannot control. After watching the film, I do not imagine anyone else for it. Even his appearance is suitable. He is tall, elegant, with interesting facial features like big blue eyes. The most feelings these actors showed not by words but eyes. <br/><br/>Secondly, I like the beauty and quality of the film. There are fascinating landscapes. Lakes, mountains, English village, fields are all impressive, because it looks very real. It is nice to look at them. I enjoy the camera movement. I like when it slowly moves from one place to another, by making one video frame, because it looks more vitally like I am just watching on the action by my own eyes. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I like how that film shows the atmosphere of those times. The dialogues are excellent. They show the traditions and etiquette. Both inside and outside of the palaces are charming. For example, the view of Lady Catherine's palace (when Mr. Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are hurrying to visit her) is incredibly luxurious, because there are painted walls, silk furniture with gold coating, gilded candlesticks, carpet on the floor, big chandelier. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to everybody. It does not matter you have read the book or not. Everything in this film is very beautiful – actors, doings, relationships, nature and all combined with amazing music. Jane Austen showed all feelings through the book and the director Joe Wright through the film."
"rmax304823","7","0","1","6 June 2015"," The Heart Has Its Reasons.
","A proper English romance among the hills and the dales and the fens and the stately homes. The men bow, the women curtsy. The proprieties are always observed. The roles of class and gender were tautly drawn, and Jane Austen really gets down on the predicament of women. They couldn't DO anything on their own. Austen herself would let no stranger catch her in the act of writing. The only means of advancement was through marriage.<br/><br/>That's the topic she deals with here. How are Mr. Bennet's five daughters going to marry well when Bennet's own estate is in debt? Powerful men aren't supposed to be interested in women of lower background. A convoluted conundrum.<br/><br/>Yet the distinctions of class between the Bennet girls and the men who are attracted to them, or the other way round, are strictly middle class in nature. We learn nothing about the poor. Dickens would come eighteen years after ""Pride and Prejudice."" It's not difficult to figure out who is going to wind up with whom, at least not where one of the daughters, Keira Knightley, and one of the men of greater social esteem, Matthew MacFadyen, are concerned. We know more or less right off the bat because the two of them don't get along at first, due to a misunderstanding, and they are two handsome people. At least I suppose MacFadyen is handsome. I'm SURE that Keira Knightley is handsome -- or somewhere beyond handsome, in some celestial orbit of beauty where she dwells with the ghosts of actresses like Audrey Hepburn. Yum.<br/><br/>I have the same problem with Jane Austen that I have with much of Shakespeare -- not that I'm that familiar with either. But both writers produced all kinds of succulent prose and poetry. The difficulty is that the stories aren't all that good. And she's often confusing. Even her habitations are confusing. One guy in a chat room produced a photo of an ordinary Georgian brick home and claimed it was Jane Austen's house. I argued with him because I'd visited the house of Jane Austen and it was a thatch-roofed English cottage. We finally had to agree that she might have actually lived in two different houses.<br/><br/>""Pride and Prejudice"" on film is an epic soap opera, and the only thing that can lift it out of the doldrums is Austen's marvelous prose, which we can't read, and her dialog, which at least we can hear. And the performers have to be very good to come up with a successful production -- and that they do.<br/><br/>It's really well done. I find it hard to believe that real people spoke the way Austen has them speak, but the actors and actresses do a convincing job of it. Such elegance! All of them are minimally of professional caliber. Judi Dench is a standout. Make up has given her a whirling hair style that looks like some kind of cartoon but is perfect for her arrogant and snobbish character. Kiera Knightley does very well by the role of the confused eligible daughter. She should leave her face to the British Museum. Her left eye slants upward and outward at an alarming angle and her chin is determined. Her features, in combination with her model's neck, lend themselves to a display of either fright and vulnerability or sassiness and even something worse. She'd make a great Catwoman or Supergirl."
"jasminenikhwai","10","0","1","28 May 2015"," Brilliant Adaptation of Jane Austin's Novella
","This is and will remain my favourite film of all time. If you have not yet watched it, I highly recommend you do - especially if you are a lover of classics, romantic tales and happy endings. This 2005 adaptation of the Novel written by Jane Austin, for me personally, does the book justice. Of course like many books that have been made into films, there are possibly significant scenes or moments that are not included. Nonetheless, the film is still a great watch and I guarantee you'll feel content at the end.<br/><br/>Another reason why this is a solid 10/10 is the casting choice, but also the locations used for the living quarters of each character/family. It is clear the producers took much time in finding specific accommodation that suites Austin's portrayal of each home. If your DVD has the bonus of the locations, watch it! It's interesting but also adds an extra, realism to the film.<br/><br/>The last comment is the alternate ending (or US ending). I feel this was a very neat idea as it adds an almost modern element to such a vintage story. The fact that they do finally kiss makes their relationship not seem so 'unrealistic' or such a 'fantasy' as it had before. For those who don't believe in destiny, this ending will ensure you of their affection for one another. <br/><br/>So if you ever get a spare few hours or are looking for a film to watch. Pride and Prejudice (2005) would be an amazing choice. (Trust me, I have seen it at least 9 times and still it does not bore me!)"

The girls, either they're giggling excitedly or they are talking emotionally. I was falling asleep while seeing this snooze fest. I am not joking.<br/><br/>OK. I'll explain what I understood. Five girls and their mother and father. Girls are dying to fall in love and marry someone. They all go giggling and excited like hell when they see cute guys (or men). From time to time, someone would come to the room in which this family is sitting and would announce that they wished to talk to someone in that room privately. Then everyone else would vacate the room. This thing takes place probably a thousand times. Is that really how people behaved during the olden times? If it is so, I'm glad I am living in this era. From time to time one of the girls would talk angrily. The mother does a lot of overacting and the father is there for reasons only god knows about. The background score goes on giving grand music. Then some grand shots of epic scenery. Movie just goes on like that. <br/><br/>I don't know why my classmates were laughing or applauding for certain scenes. I neither found them funny nor found them romantic. It was awfully boring. I mean, the music and camera is good.

Wright makes Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same name come to life on the silver screen with his brilliant direction for the film, and not only that he also uses a great cast which includes Keira Knightley in an Oscar nominated performance, Rosamund Pike as the oldest sister Jane who gets proposed to by Darcy's best friend Mr. Bingley (played by Simon Woods), Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth's parents (but to me Blethyn's performance is a little over the top). and many more people. This movie as I mention in my summary is that this movie is one of the best romance movies ever made, along with Out of Africa (1985), and Days of Heaven (1978). Even though there were a few performances that were a little over the top I still liked the movie."
"SimonJack","8","0","1","7 April 2014"," Very good film version of Austen novel
","This modern version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is very good. It's sure to entertain all but the most ardent Jane Austen fans. And, but for the remarkable 1995 BBC mini-series, this movie might even win the hearts of most die-hard Austen fans. <br/><br/>The movie has several small weaknesses, but some strengths that mostly make up for those. Among its strong points are the roles of several of the actors. Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike are excellent as the oldest Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Brenda Blethyn is very good as Mrs. Bennet, and Claudie Blakely does very well as Charlotte Lucas. Matthew Macfadyen is very good as Mr. Darcy, and Judi Dench plays Lady de Bourg very well. The roles of other major players are so-so, and most of the lesser players are not developed enough. The other strong points of this film are its cinematography, makeup and sets. All are excellent. <br/><br/>This movie is considered a modern adaptation of Austen's novel in the language, manners and personal behavior of the characters. Films made about stories that take place in the past – however along ago, should reflect those times and their culture and customs as closely as possible. When they do so, they serve a great value. As such, they are windows into the history and culture of those past times. They educate movie goers about the times, their customs and events. But, if they are not accurate, they give false impressions about the past. The modern tinges to the script and roles in this film are not such that they would significantly mislead viewers about Austen's late 18th century England. <br/><br/>But, the script and direction overall have some pluses and minuses. The general strengths are in the liveliness of character roles. The weaknesses are mostly in the portrayal of the Bennet family, its home, and the community. In this regard, the costumes and settings also are questionable. The character of Elizabeth is a little too silly early on – she is more closely akin to the younger girls than to Jane. But the younger girls – Lydia and Kitty are just shown in their girlish behavior briefly. And, between Elizabeth and Darcy, we see almost instant attraction for the first meeting. This comes on far too strong and too early in the film. <br/><br/>This movie is 11 minutes longer than the 1940 film, and is able to get more of the story on film. Still, several of the incidents are crowded to the point of possibly confusing viewers. Events are rushed in places, and anyone not familiar with the story may get lost or not know what is going on in those instances. This is especially true toward the end of the film. The film fails to develop some of the characters enough, so the viewer's interest is barely aroused in Mr. Wickham, Georgiana Darcy, the Gardiners and some others. <br/><br/>One thing that struck me as very wrong had to do with the early scenes at the community dance and the first ball. The setting, costumes and music made me think that I was watching a barn dance in the American colonies. The later ball scenes were more refined, and more likely attuned to the landed gentry. Along these same lines, as noted by some other reviewers, are the barnyard atmosphere around the house with chickens and hogs moving freely around and even inside the house. The Bennets had a cook and other servants. So would family members have been doing the laundry and other chores as implied in the film? With all the mud around the house, we saw people coming and going all the time, but no mud tracked on the floors, and no sign of people taking off their shoes. <br/><br/>A small estate like that of the Bennet's may surely have had barns, corals, and servant's lodgings and outbuildings. But those would have been removed a short distance from the house. And the family members of the estate wouldn't have been trudging through the mud and farmyard. <br/><br/>One interesting scene stands out all alone in this regard. Elizabeth is sitting on a swing that is suspended from rafters in a drive-through farm building. The ground all around her clearly is a mess of mud. So, she should have had very muddy boots, shoes or feet. Yet we see her twisting in the swing with her bare feet sticking straight out. They look quite clean. <br/><br/>This is an entertaining version of Jane Austen's great novel by the same name. If you enjoy this film, you will be enthralled by the 1995 TV mini-series starring Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth and a host of other marvelous actors. It runs 5.5 hours and gives full treatment to most of the characters and situations of the novel."

Knightley is easily the best part about this movie. Dench, Sutherland, and Macfadyen also have great moments throughout. But I found the mother to be incredibly annoying and unwatchable. I wouldn't agree with the tag line of 'Greatest love story of all time' but I did like the chemistry between actors. This movie really got me thinking about how lucky I am to not have to be involved with any traditions of ""Arranged Marriage"". I cant believe what people had to go through back then.

","As a lover of this story, both in its original book form and the 1995 BBC TV production which so faithfully stuck to the book, I initially found the many surprises contained in this film somewhat off-putting. But my reaction to a second viewing was decidedly positive. Love the pithy new lines in the script, the unique slants on the characters, and the whole thing feels more accessible and based in reality than the older production. My main complaint is that it does feel abbreviated; those unfamiliar with the story may even find it incoherent.<br/><br/>Several characters are substantially better cast and portrayed in this film than the 1995 production. Judi Dench has the presence we expect of Lady Catherine, and Rosamund Pike is drop-dead-gorgeous as we imagine Jane. In 1995, Julia Sawalha isn't silly enough as Lydia, and Mrs Bennett, Mr Collins and Miss Bingley are too over-the-top. Darcy and Elizabeth are great in both productions, although quite different. Firth's Darcy is handsome and aristocratic, but Macfayden's is younger, less aloof and less sure of himself. Ehle is a little too old as Elizabeth; Knightley is just right.

","I saw Laurence Olivier, David Rintoul and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. At the first I did't want to watch this film. I know the story. It was in the other versions on television several times. Who wants to see that ? After all these actors, after Colin Firth ? But this version is different. The is no Mr.Darcy like before. Now there is a normal man named Mr.Darcy, played by Matthew Macfadyen and whole new Elizabeth Bennet played by Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>Film is edited fast and clear. Low DOF, natural light and warm colors, actors are well guided. Almost every scene is composed like a painting of that time. I love hand held camera tracking. Dance scene is like in new modern music videos, without a unnecessary cuts, filmed in one take. Brilliant !!!"

","The 2005 British romance movie, Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's novel about five sisters in Georgian England. Keira Knightly stars as the main character, Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew MacFadyen plays her romantic interest. The story follows the second oldest of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth, as she encounters issues of manners, morality, and marriage in the early 19th-century England society.<br/><br/>Pride and Prejudice is about the Bennet sisters finding suitable gentleman to marry and living their lives in Georgian England. Mr Bennet, an English gentleman and his overbearing wife continually look for suitable husbands for their five daughters. When Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Bennet, a spirited young woman and a single, wealthy Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) meet for the first time, a connection is made even though she swears that he is the last person on earth that she'll ever marry. Their fate become intertwined in a journey that they never expected.<br/><br/>I really liked the acting in the movie. I think the Bennet family interactions made the whole film more interesting to watch because in Jane Austen's novel, the characters seemed flat to me. Keira Knightly did a wonderful job portraying Lizzy because she is headstrong, stubborn, and graceful as well. Matthew MacFadyen really brought out Mr. Darcy's aloofness and his rigid manners. We can see a physical chemistry between the two characters when they touch hands and their eyes interlock.<br/><br/>This film makes the audience voyeurs. The story begins with the opening shot of Elizabeth walking home reading what is assumed to be Austen's First Impressions. It is like a story within a story. The viewers also look over her shoulder to see her turning the page. Through the camera's lens, we follow her into her home and through the rooms. The audience also sees characters through the windows, eavesdrop on them through doors, and stand behind them during conversations. It gives the film another layer to depth and transports the viewers into the story. The director, Joe Wright, uses a variety of camera angles and shots to portray Darcy and Elizabeth's chemistry and eventual love. One of the amazing shots that we see is when Elizabeth faces the mirror after turning down Darcy's proposal and the passage of time can be seen by the techniques involving the soft and dark lighting. The viewers can gain an insight of Elizabeth's internal confusion by the use of blurred long shots, close ups of the characters and the letter that Darcy writes to Elizabeth after their argument. After Elizabeth realizes that she has misjudged Darcy, her best friend, Charlotte (Claudie Blakley), comes into the room and asks if she is alright. Elizabeth responds with, ""I hardy know."" It leaves the audience questioning what she meant by that response.<br/><br/>The background music and the setting was a very important aspect during the powerful moments in the film. *SPOILER* When Mr. Darcy was coming toward Elizabeth in the misty field at dawn, I was moved by that scene because they were finally together and what Mr. Darcy's aunt tried to do actually confirmed their feeling for one another.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and I have watch it many times. It never fails to emotionally move me. It is a beautiful movie filled with beautiful scenes, intense moments, and love. It is my favorite movie and if you are a fan of romance, then I highly recommend it!"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","0","1","10 July 2013"," Great main story and aesthetics, the subplots drag it down a bit.
","Despite how much I disliked the messy and contrived Atonement, I've always been a little intrigued in giving Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice a chance. I've never read the novel, so I thought it would be an interesting introduction to the source material. Unfortunately, although I do know the premise, I struggled to follow the first half of the film, having to pause and look up the details of what was going on. However, once I got into it, I was enthralled by the complex main plot and characters, even if the excess subplots held the film back a notch. The performances are great and subtle, particularly in the two leads Knightley and Macfadyen, who's chemistry and charm are electrifying. The hyped cinematography is great for the most part, but during some of the smaller scenes, the choice to do little zooms is baffling and takes us right out of the time period, but otherwise it captures a rich and authentic atmosphere.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I like period pieces as much as the next guy, and even though this is one of the most influential books by a female author of all time yadda yadda, this movie is rather bland. Kiera Knightley is the only real saving grace of it because she is adorable and delightful. She and Donald Sutherland are the only ones who seem to put any effort into their characters; the rest are stereotypical one-note roles. I liked reading the book in high school, but it's honestly nothing special to me. I watched this when it first came out since it was released right around the time I read it, but even with another viewing it only seems decent.<br/><br/>The sets and shots and scenery still do it much justice for a period piece, so you might take a fancy to them."

","I have read the original novel before and seen the 1940 version starring Sir Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, but this adaption is simply fabulous. Keira Knightly as the free-spirited and independent Elizabeth Bennett is a real treat to see (especially for men). Elizabeth embodies the kind of woman what many girls long to be like in the Victorian era; free to choose her future and go wherever the wind takes her. Miss Knightly's co-star is a grand foil to her independent character. He is the typical gentleman of the time; a man who is uninterested in free-thinking young women and disdains all of society, but seems to mask a need for affection/love. A British literature fan will fall in love with this story and feel free upon the finale of this film."

From the opening music, cinematography and long, long, long shot of a beautifully drab Lizzy walking home across a field she loves while reading a book she loves (girls just don't do this anymore, do they?), to the clash of pride and prejudice between herself and Mr. Darcy at X and Y and Z along their tortured path through misunderstanding to slow revelation and final love, I'm just am agasp at how happy the movie makes me.

"hellraiser7","10","0","2","23 June 2012"," Love and Misunderstanding
","Despite how much money and treasures one has, it can never fill one's emptiness that needs to be full, that emptiness is love.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the romance genre there are very few stories I really like and love. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my favorite romance story because it's one of those rare cases of a romance story done the right way of it's sense of honesty, romantic tension and banter, but most of all the universal effect it's had on most other romance stories done right like the TV show ""Castle"" as well as the Japaninese Anime TV show ""Macross"" which in a way is a sci-fi retelling of the literary story, and plenty more out there and to come.<br/><br/>The cinematography and location is great. We see from the wide shots to some medium shots, the look and feel of a 17 century England long ago. From the wide lawn the characters cross, weather conditions, open space of where the houses are located, to the interiors of ballrooms or of the wealthy. One memorable moment in the film that stood in my mind the most like the ballroom scene, when both of them dance with one another and soon everyone else fades from the room, as if both can for a moment see into each others hearts. The music score it is just beautiful just fits into the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Thanks to perfect casting everyone seems to portray their characters with accuracy and understand them. Keira Knightly one of my favorite actresses was just perfect as Elesbeth Bennet because she literally is the character. What's there not to love about her; Liz is beautiful inside and out from her intellectual interest in books and art, she never lacks courage, has some fire in her, prideful, funny, and kind. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy is portrayed just right; brooding, just as interested in the same things as Liz, prideful also, but a bit of an loner and shy, which is why on the surface he looks a bit stiff. One moment with him which I always thought was funny was when he walks in a room immediately to talk to Liz but he kinda chokes in the moment by not saying anything or just can't think of anything to say he even looks like he was going to sweat, and then just walks out quickly like he's going to run. I thought that was funny because it was true I've been there a few times before, to some talking to someone of the opposite sex for the first time is easy but to people like Darcy and me that are men of few words not so much. Though it really is easy by nature it just doesn't look that way at first.<br/><br/>Consciously both think they dislike each other, yet subconsciously both have an undying attraction and fascination with one another. Even though LIz says she swore to loath Darcy for all eternity she doesn't really take her words seriously. That feeling of dislike is really nothing more than a mask for what they both really feel for each other which is love. Like most of Austin's stories the pacing does come off a bit slow but you get use to it because it helps in order to create a suspenseful but gradually build up. We want both of them to get together but like in most romances they have to go through common obstacles like totalitarian like restrictions, personal politics, or even falling in love with the wrong people in the guise of the right person. As well as the steps of taking off that mask of theirs and learn to like and love one another. It's a matter of patience but it's well rewarded and leaves us with a good feeling which is something I don't get much. <br/><br/>True love is closer than we think.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","I'm currently watching the 1995 version with Colin Firth, and I keep having flashbacks to the beautifully shot 2005 version with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. Can I just say that no one portrays shy, awkward, confusing love as well as Matthew Macfadyen? It's a wonderful movie, indeed. It's a great retelling of a classic love story. I found the edits made to the plot line in order to ensure it fit within the time frame quite pleasing. They left out material, but nothing substantial to the development of the plot or the characters. I've loved this movie for such a long time, but it wasn't until recently that I gave a second thought to Macfadyen's portrayal of Darcy. He plays Darcy with such subtle grace, such amazing technique that the man IS Darcy to me."
"TheReviewPerson","7","0","1","15 May 2012"," Delicate, moving, with a much-needed touch of comedy
","This is, was, and will always be THE film that irreversibly attached me to historical dramas. The costume, set, music, chemistry between the characters, the characters themselves, and the story all contributed to a visually stunning and moving adaptation of the novel. Firstly: the costume. If you are going to do a costume drama, you've got to make great costumes, and this one particular section of production I have always been personally very critical about, but I must say, these costumes were amazing, however I did notice that they replicated the fashion of the 1820s rather than the 1810s, which was when the book was set (1813). 9/10 Secondly: the set. In every scene in the film, the set was well-thought out and was appropriate. 10/10 Thirdly: the music in this film was beautiful, and very well-researched in context to the time! 10/10 Fourthly: the chemistry. The relationship between the protagonist Elizabeth and her love interest Mr (Fitzwilliam) Darcy is slowly building and extremely believable, and will take the viewer on a dramatic emotional journey from start to finish. Finally: The characters. Matthew Macfadyen's interpretation of the character Mr Darcy is rather different to other actors' interpretation. He shows a more vulnerable, though less proud but more likable Darcy, and so in this case, his relationship with Elizabeth makes more sense. Knightley didn't bring anything new to the character, and neither did she view the character in a different way, but it is safe to say her acting was good and convincing in this adaptation, although I do believe Macfadyen's performance supported hers well, and it was his that made the whole film, so in that case, I give this film a well-deserved 9/10!"
"chtellez","10","0","1","7 November 2011"," Interesting choices
","This is a beautifully shot movie, with lovely music and amazing piano playing by Jean-Ives Thibaudet. If you are not very familiar with the novel or the 1995 BBC TV version, you will enjoy it outright. If you belong to those viewers who are Jane Austen fans, you will need to see this version more than once to overcome the barriers imposed by a rushed and drastically summarized script and the odd--and I dare say-- unnecessary distortions of Austen's milieu and social mores. However, with each repeated viewing you will sense that the scriptwriter embeds layers from the excised scenes into the dialog, the gestures and the facial expressions, as if days and months would pass by in seconds inside the mind of the characters. If you have read the novel in depth, you may be able to project those layers unto the characterizations in this movie. <br/><br/>All the criticisms I have read in this site are on the mark. Indeed, Knightley seems too modern and disheveled; Bingley can barely speak intelligently; Wickham, although attractive, is reduced to a minor character. MacFadyen seems too shy and awkward at first, although his eyes are incredibly expressive, his voice is beautiful, and he is ultimately convincing. People are dressed with so many styles that one cannot tell the time period; perhaps this was one more way to establish class differences and historical style transitions. And still, in the end, these criticisms do not affect the ultimate success of the movie. The psychological transformation of Darcy and Elizabeth as they overcome their pride and prejudices(the true message in Austen's novel) is achieved beautifully, in a manner that will make the viewer return to this film time and again.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the cinematography is special, with beautiful planes of light and color that emulate early Romantic paintings, and unexpected time-lapse sequences with music, such as the one with Lizzie in the swing through the seasons or observing herself in the mirror after Darcy's first proposal. <br/><br/>I must also say that, in spite of her anachronistic sleeveless dresses, this is the best Caroline Bingley I have seen. She is beautiful, fashionable and snobbish, not older or unattractive, like in other productions; in short, a true object of contrast as a class-conscious potential rival for Darcy's attention.<br/><br/>The final ""Mrs. Darcy"" kisses are an indulgence for the American market that could have been handled much better. Both characters could have been still dressed and behaving with the modesty suited to the historical time, as a credible transition between their previous life and what is to come. Instead, it is enjoyable and tender, but also jarring, even within the range of compromises already made in the movie.<br/><br/>If you accept that the masterful Austen novel must be seriously abridged for the purposes of a movie, you will enjoy this ""Pride and Prejudice"" on its own terms, and it will get better and better with repeated viewings."

","''Pride & Prejudice'' is certainly a very nice movie. Joe Wright directed this movie very nicely. Other movies of Mr Wright, such as ''Atonement'', are also nice, but ''Pride & Prejudice'' is different. It's a completely interesting and excellent movie. I read the novel by Jane Austen long time ago, and I think this movie adaption was the best adaption of the novel. The casting and the music was excellent.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley played the heroine, Elizabeth. Certainly Keira acted nicely in this movie. As did other actors like Matthew Macfadyen and Donald Sutherland. But I would especially like to praise the performance of Brenda Blethyn, who played Mrs Bennett, the funny mother of Elizabeth, in the movie. Keira Knightley and Brenda Blethyn, according to my opinion, gave the best performances in the movie. Rosamund Pike, who played Elizabeth's elder sister Jane, also gave a nice performance. In short, the casting was very good.<br/><br/>If you like Jane Austen's novel ''Pride & Prejudice'', then you should watch this movie, because it's a perfect adaption of the novel."

","My sister actually encouraged me to watch the BBC mini-series starring Colin Firth because she said it was closer to the book and she thought it was really good. Now I normally prefer TV series over movies do to the series being longer, giving someone the time to get an appreciation and understanding of the true characters, however I found myself appreciating this movie more after seeing the TV series. I found the TV series quite dull. Actor/Actress at times lacked showing certain emotions. Emotion that should have lined up more with what they were saying. I didn't feel the love connection between Elizabeth and Darcy at any time during the series, however Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen have incredible on screen chemistry that I felt the attraction the characters had for each other. Even through the characters awkward silences you felt like there was so much being said. In the series I actually remember saying to myself ""OK, This is boring. Can one of you please say something or can you not remember your lines?"" Keira Knightley brings real wit and charm to the character. She is prejudiced which is an unlikable quality, but somehow she still isn't unlikable. In fact I got even a deeper understanding in how Darcy could actually love her despite her fortune because I feel in love with her despite her prejudice acts. With her last name as Knightley it seems as if she was meant to play a role in a Jane Austen story. I have never read the book and I don't plan to which I believe is a important fact because I think not reading and appreciating the book gives me a bigger appreciate for this movie. I believe it truly helps to appreciate the TV series if you love the book the fact that the series is closer to the book than the movie despite the series lacking in real energy. I love this movie more now than I did before so I also recommend you try to watch the mini- series with Colin Firth has well. The series does give you more information on certain events that take place in the movie. I think this movie is the best out of the other Jane Austen American version films that have been made."
"VReviews","8","0","1","22 May 2011"," Full Picture of the Bennet Family
","Jane Austen affected a sea change in the novel in the early 1800s. Before that time the novel was limited to rather far-fetched adventure stories like Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. In the early 19th century, writing about everyday events was quite out of the ordinary, and Jane was the first to successfully portray the behind the scenes workings of the ladies and gentlemen of the English countryside. <br/><br/>Watching a new adaptation of a Jane Austen novel is like seeing Shakespeare's Hamlet, there are no surprises in the final outcome. Rather the entertainment comes in the particular adaptation, actor's skills, and production qualities. Austen's Pride & Prejudice is one of her most popular novels, and each time it has found it's way onto the big screen and into DVD it's created a lot of passion for and against the adaptation. <br/><br/>Universal's production has had a number of disappointed viewers as evidenced by many an online review. This disappointment typically seems to stem with having something to do with the casting decisions and the perceived lack of chemistry between the principal players. Conversely, some felt there was too much chemistry, or not enough propriety in the manner in which the Bennet's conducted themselves. Or that the Bennet's were incorrectly shown to be struggling financially and therefore didn't live or dress up to the idealized version of English gentility. <br/><br/>To the chemistry of the actors, I believe the casting in Universal's version was excellent. Matthew Macfadyen perfectly portrayed the aloof, shy, yet emotionally caring Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is a surprise in this role, for she is able to capture the strong-willed, hastily opinionated and yet free spirited Elizabeth Bennet quite well. But more importantly, this adaptation develops the full picture of the Bennet Family, with all five Bennet girls, with their individual personalities vying for the best dress, or introduction. Both Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet are superb in their timing, and comedic needling of one another. Judi Dench as the controlling Lady Catherine de Bourg, is pleasingly condescending wicked. <br/><br/>Screenwriter Deborah Moggach portrayed the Bennet family in a very real and grounded environment. While she may have packaged Austen's novel in a less glamorous light than is typical; she was able to reflect the troubling circumstances people of that time had to deal with. After all, the financial fix and worry of having five girls with no inheritance in 18th century England was the very point of view and experience that Jane wrote from. <br/><br/>Between Director Wright and screenwriter Moggach, this version of Pride & Prejudice is deeply thought-provoking, and portrays the ups and down, moral questions, dilemmas, and hardships of being in society in the 18th century."

","Definitely the best Pride and Prejudice adaptation is the BBC series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. That wonderful series just ruined all other P&P movies for me:). So I think that doing a movie after the huge success the BBC series had is a very courageous thing to do and pretty risky too. <br/><br/>So in spite of the good acting from Keira Knightley, of the original approach of the character of Mr. Collins (he's a real cheeky pervert!), Mrs. Bennet (first time you see that this woman is indeed a loving mother, who worries over the fate and future of her 5 daughters) and Harriet (she's an old maid and a burden to her family, so for her marrying Mr. Collins is a blessing and an escape), of the little symbols and details (the 5 virgins living in a house surrounded by a river, like a castle or convent), the absolutely superb British landscapes and the sometimes perfect filming technique (I love how he shows the different windows of the house and we can see what each one is doing), there's still something missing...and I guess it's due to 2 things: first, the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth is not so obvious at times, mainly due to the actor playing Darcy (forgot his name); second, Keira is playing Elizabeth as such a powerful personality that poor Darcy just gets crushed under it and gives you the impression he's just Prince Charming waiting to come in and swoop the princess. The conflict is all in Keira, none in Darcy, which is so sad since Darcy is one of the most beloved romantic characters in literature, alongside Heathcliff, Rhett Butler and Romeo. <br/><br/>It's a really good movie, but personally I feel that it does not manage to surpass the brilliancy of the BBC series and the amazing on screen chemistry between Colin and Jennifer. Colin especially had such looks sometimes that you got the shivers down your spine and knots in your stomach. Didn't feel much of that here except perhaps the Pavilion scene..."

","Pride and Prejudice has an amazing plot line that keeps you guessing until the last scene! I felt that each character was beautifully cast, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy in particular. The chemistry between the two actors could not be any better, and I thing thats what makes the movie so intriguing. There were however, some parts in the movie that seemed a little dull. Because it was set in the early eighteen hundreds, it can sometimes be difficult to to decipher whats going on. I had to watch it multiple times (some with subtitles), to really understand all of the different story lines in the movie. What I enjoyed most about this movie was that the characters who loved each other, were together in the end. Unlike Becoming Jane, where the two main characters were unable to be together, Pride and Prejudice made it possible to love with out worrying about social restraints."

","I'm crazy about the romantic movies. Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite movies. This is the most sensitive movie to stimulate my feelings by wonderful cinematography. I can't forget the full screen of green grass in which Elizabeth is walking alone for a long time and the scene of arguing Elizabeth and Darcy exploding with anger in the rain. The beautiful melody softly continues which is playing on the piano. The British actors' sound full of pride, which gives feeling as if I live in Georgian period. It is far better in visual, audio and conveying feeling than when I read it as a book.<br/><br/>The story is well known by Jane Austen' novel. Lots of films were made based on the novel until now. The latest film directed by Joe Wright and acted by Kiera Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen in 2005 released is my favourite one, because I think all kinds of cinematic techniques go well with the story. Lovely music and camera angles to try to catch lovers mournful eye contact.<br/><br/>Mr. Darcy(Matthew MacFadyen) looks silly and rude to me in the first part of the film, but he is a kind of person who is very sensible and a pure of heart. He misunderstands Elizabeth, when he meets her at a dance party in a small village in which Elizabeth lives, as a young girl who wants marry with a rich man without love. Time goes on, Mr.Darcy gets attracting to her smartness and enthusiasm. He loves her so much, and then he recognize his thought for her is wrong. He changes his mind and help her when she gets problem with her elder sister. <br/><br/>Elizabeth who has very good relationship with a father and sisters has a very strong will, so she doesn't want to marry without love. When she meets Mr.Darcy first time in the dance party, she thinks of him as a kind of person who is rude and selfish, but she falls in love like destiny. After they throw away pride and prejudice they could love each other passionately. In the film, lots of sweet romantic dialogue were heard with love or pain, I really love these expressions. Whenever I repeat these words I can feel I'm in love with some guy. It makes me happy and cry, until now I'd like to quote these lovely and painful words. Love and Pain is the closest friends, so we can't get love without pain. This is one of the best favorite dialogue from the movie.

","Pride & Prejudice is a more than adequate adaptation of Jane Austen's perhaps most famous book. It marries her classic writing with an excellent cast, great sets, and beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>For me, the movie begins and ends with Keira Knightley. If she wasn't in it, I doubt I ever would have been compelled to watch it. But knowing how good of an actress she is and how she excels in period movies like this, I was happy to give it a shot. And she was wonderful, as usual. It's hard to imagine a better modern actress to portray Elizabeth Bennett. She was, of course, supported on all sides by fine performances from Donald Sutherland, Rosmaund Pike, Judi Dench, and several others. But it was undoubtedly Knightley's show, and there was nary a hitch to be seen. <br/><br/>The other standout element in Pride & Prejudice is the dialogue. This is no surprise, as the script was lifted directly from Austen's lauded prose. Good writing made the novel a favorite for over 200 years, and it makes this movie a success, as well. <br/><br/>I can't imagine anyone who has enjoyed the book thinking that this is anything other than a fine adaptation, all around."

","I can't say anything horrible about this adaptation, in fact it's good. BUT if you've read the book or have had the wonderful luck to have seen the 1995 BBC version with Elizabeth Ehle and Colin Firth, then you will be underwhelmed. As you must be since this is only acceptable as a 2 hour version. The story is just too complex to be truncated down to this point. But I must say it's pretty well edited in its form.<br/><br/>Just two appearances by Mr. Wickham, Lady Catherine de Bourgh doesn't receive enough play up to the climactic confrontation, everybody's sisters are mostly irrelevant, and Mrs. Bennet does not hold up to the portrayal by Alison Steadman; furthermore, the chemistry between Knightley and MacFadyen DOESN'T BEGIN to approach that of Ehle and Firth, among other issues.<br/><br/>The production company should've known what they were getting into after all. So, if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. On the plus side, it is beautifully photographed with excellent cinematography and I owe someone a nickel because Keira Knightley can act."

Although I attempted to judge this opus on its own merits, I found myself subconsciously comparing every aspect of this remake to the 1995 version (which is inherently unfair, because this was only a movie and the 1995 version was a miniseries).<br/><br/>It is said that 80% of directing is casting (which, I suppose, means that if you have good casting you have good character interplay, and the directing takes care of itself), and the casting for this move was done well. However, the unfair comparison to the 1995 miniseries rears its ugly head: I found myself preferring the A&E/BBC portrayal of the characters of Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins (even though this short film version couldn't give the actors who portrayed these enough time to fully exhibit their characters).<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like was the dancing scene where everyone disappeared, leaving only Darcy and Elizabeth: it looked unnatural, since their heads where not bobbing up and down like they would have been if they were really doing these dance movements. A couple of other scenes were, I believe, more influenced by our notion of romance than what Jane Austin had in mind: when Elizabeth rejects Darcy and they almost begin making out, and at the end when Elizabeth comes out to meet Darcy in her nightgown; perhaps the next remake of the film can have them living together instead of getting married (but then what would Lydia and Wickham have to do to scandalize and shame the family?). But seriously, these two scenes would probably not have been realistic for the pre-Victorian English gentry.<br/><br/>Besides these nitpicking details, I thoroughly enjoyed this remake of P&P. It is perhaps the best portrayal of this story in the short time allotted. I give it a 8 out of a 10."

","When I first saw the movie last year, I've just seen the mini-series by BBC for a third time in a row, and I simply love the mini. So when I sat down to watch the movie, I compared it with the mini and everything about the movie was wrong. The Bennet's house was dirty, Elizabeth was too silly for my taste and the dialogue between Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy was too fast. Like they were in a hurry. And a lot of things was wrong in my mind. I just hated it. After a little while, getting the mini-series out of my mind, I saw it again. I didn't like it then either. But then I read the book a couple of times and laid down the whole Pride&Prejudice-story and forgot more or less about the it. But for a while ago I picked it up again, I watched the mini-series and read the book. And last night I saw the movie for the third time. And my feelings was quite the opposite. I laugh, I cried and I was very pleased by the whole movie. But still there are things in the movie that irritates me, but I no longer hate it, and that's a good thing because I just love the story. But I must say that for me, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, who played in BBC's miniserie, is the perfect Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy."
"theguildhall","8","0","1","26 February 2007"," Strengths and Weaknesses
","By and large I found this a very enjoyable film. It is visually stunning, has some very touching moments and features a truly bewitching hero. I like the scenery, the music, the buildings and the way they are filmed. It is a charming film all over, beautiful, atmospheric and emotional.<br/><br/>One might wonder though, how much it actually has to do with Jane Austen's novel. I am not a purist and have no problem with a film making considerable changes to the plot, settings or characters of a novel. But I believe there should be a noticeable effort to capture the general spirit of a book. Watching this film and listening to the director's comments, I wondered if he had read the book at all. Where, for example, did he get the idea that the Bennet's are such a wonderful warm and loving family? In Jane Austen's novel, the Bennets are a particularly dysfunct family and the only relationship in it that is not fraught with problems is that between Elizabeth and Jane.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Austenian language is largely missing from the film, and the whole pace, attitude and feel of it is a far cry from the subtle and witty elegance of Austen's prose. The film is dramatic and romantic, rather than enlightened and ironic.The style of it would be more suitable for an adaption of Wuthering Heights! I also have great difficulty with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett. Visually, Jane Austen describes Elizabeth as light and lithe, and pretty in an unspectacular way. Knightley's figure is too awkward and angular to fit that idea, and her scowls and black eye makeup make her look too dramatic. Elizabeth's personality is very complex and multi-layered, but Knightley seems to just alternately frown, stare and giggle. I find her convincing in the scene when she explains her love for Darcy to her father, but that is only at the very end of the film. Compared to the vast variety of gestures and facial expressions that Jennifer Ehle gave to the character, Knightley does a poor job.<br/><br/>Matthew Macfadyen, on the other hand, presents a touchingly vulnerable Darcy that is bound to charm the socks off anyone who hasn't got a heart of stone. By far the best performance in the whole film. I also liked Claudie Blakley as Charlotte Lucas and Rosamund Pike as Jane. Donald Sutherland makes a very nice father - though he certainly isn't Jane Austen's Mr Bennett! Some of the other characters remain underdeveloped, largely due to lack of time on screen. I understand the need for cuts, but I cannot help to regret the loss of so much of the roles of Caroline Bingley, Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mr Collins, Mrs Gardiner and Lady Catherine. I would have loved to see more of Anne de Burgh! Lastly, the film didn't make me laugh or even smile. While that is okay in general, it's a strange feature for a Jane Austen adaption!"
"coolfasho-1","8","0","3","22 October 2006"," Analytical perspective of ""The Ball"" in this film
","In Pride and Prejudiced authored by Jane Austen, we find a social event that sets the stage for the remainder of the book. Mrs. Bennet gives a party at Meryton in order to find husbands for her five daughters. One of the guests is Mr. Bingley, a rich young bachelor from Netherfield Estate. He proves to be a lively agreeable gentleman whop dances with many girls but seems to have his head turned by Jane, one of the Bennet sisters. The protagonists, Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy clash for the first time at this first ball at Meryton.<br/><br/>At the ball, Elizabeth is refreshingly frank to Darcy. Darcy offends her with his aloofness and elusiveness practically dubbing her ugly in public. Elizabeth rebuffs him rejecting his offer of a dance. As the wealthy and handsome Darcy is unaccustomed to effeminate remonstrance he becomes intrigued by Elizabeth's demeanor. To cover his confusion he continues to insult and banter Elizabeth He cannot help but contrast her honesty with the worshipful adoration to which he is usually subjected and which bores him tremendously.<br/><br/>At subsequent social events Darcy begins to notice Elizabeth's attributes- her wits, intelligence, her refreshing and impressive personality, even her attractive eyes. Elizabeth has been poisoned by Wickham. Wickham has fed Elizabeth the mendacious saga that Darcy purloined his hereditary affluence. Following the ball, Elizabeth engages Darcy in verbal bouts in which he endeavors to outwit him in cleverly expressed views always spoken with utmost courtesy. Darcy is unaccustomed to such braveness from women. In a subsequent ball, Elizabeth and Darcy dance together, but Elizabeth and Darcy consists of politely phrased put-downs.<br/><br/>As Darcy grows more interested in Elizabeth and as she resumes her verbal diatribes with him, her original bias towards him brought on by Wickham's fabrications, begins to disappear. When Lidya runs away with Wickham and thus exposes her family to scandal, Elizabeth's resistance to Darcy inevitably evaporates. He pays Wickham's gambling debts with as much as $10,000 pounds inducing him to elope with Lidya, thus isolating him from the ignominy of scandal. When Elizabeth realizes that it was Darcy rather than Mr. Gardner who saved her family from scandal she is deeply moved. This leads to Darcy's acknowledgment that it was he who put up the money out of love for Elizabeth.<br/><br/>The ball at Meryton while not an elaborate affair, occupies a level of surreptitious auspiciousness in the novel, for it is at the ball that Elizabeth and Darcy, the protagonist and the temporary antagonist, meet for the first time, setting the stage for the development of their relationship which stems throughout the novel and establishes that the relationship founded on antipathy and prejudice can eventually turn into mutual affection. It lays the grounds for the immense satirical relationships of the time. Prior to Austen, romantic novels consisted of beautiful and insipid heroines, ready to throw their lives away on men. Elizabeth Bennet's boldness sets her as an audacious apostate, so that the novel instead of degenerating into a tabloid romance becomes a classic with confrontation between the hero and heroine rather than prolonged capitulation."
"jenra","9","0","3","24 June 2006"," An excellent movie!
","I love this movie! All the actors and actresses are so good,and Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley fits so well as Lizzie and Darcy. But I do think it's kinda weird seeing Donald Sutherland as a quiet,family dad,but he does the role so good,that I can't think of any other who could have done it better. Brenda Blethyn,I guess she was good,but I don't think that she fits like the mother,and Carey Mulligan was (sorry,to Carey and those who like her) horrible as the next youngest sister.It felt like she was much younger than Jena Malone as Lydia. Rupert Friend,(doesn't he look a bit like Orlando Bloom?) was pretty good as Mr Wickham,can't say anything else about that. Tom Hollander,did the role of Mr Collins well,but I didn't feel like he was Mr Collins,and same with Claudie Blakley as Charlotte Lucas. When I read the book,I didn't at all,picture her,looking like that. Talulah Riley,was excellent in the role of Mary Bennet,except from that in the book,she wasn't pretty,and I think that Talulah is pretty good looking.But it's not I who should judge that. Judi Dench as lady Catherine,was an excellent choice,I think.She's so(whats the word..) definite(?),but really great in the role.Okey,I admit that I just think so for her role as M in James Bond,but so what?I just happy that,however come up with the people's roles,that it worked out between the most characters.<br/><br/>I agree with what another person said,that it couldn't be so easy to take the book into making a film,ya know. But every thing is very well,light and walls,clothes and just every thing^^ <br/><br/>But i dislike that they have taking away all the walks in the garden.But you can't expect that every thing should be in the movie,right? (And it's to bad that Matthew,Mr Darcy,doesn't smile more i the film,cus he's very,very handsome when he does smile)<br/><br/>Love the film,and think that every one should see it!"

","The English movies, almost without exception, are signposts of acting perfection. The Brits know how to act, and they are proud of this reputation rings true in this movie too. Sadly, though I had trouble following the dialogue,almost hoping for subtitles, yes, in English.....of course it is never done, and I accept that. So I watched the movie twice to pick up the continuing story outline. Good,in its adaptation of the book, this screenplay was devoted to the emotional and romantic aspects of the life and times of the sisters and unfortunately played a little too long in that regard in my estimation. This is definitely a chick flick, and even with all its sophistication it had comedic highlights as well. I felt after viewing the DVD that I had eaten an Oriental dinner and a half hour later I was hungry for a more substantial story telling that would have carried me through an emotionally satisfying experience."
"cschazen","8","0","1","8 April 2006"," Flawed but fascinating
","An interesting film, but caveat emptor.<br/><br/>This current version of P&P, while enjoyable, lacks the satirical and moralistic spirit of Jane Austen's novel. The focus in this film was on the romantic -- a genre Austen, a clergyman's daughter, deplored. Her novels emphasized common sense and character refinement, although, certainly, physical and emotional compatibility was important, especially to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there was other problems in its presentation. The Bennetts, though in the book financially embarrassed, are shown here as downright impoverished and somewhat coarse. The girls appear ill-groomed, drab, and wanton. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett looks like a crazy old man. I doubt animals would just roam through the house. Certainly, the earlier film versions might have prettified the era, but emphasizing the dirty rural environment here -- things that Austen had taken for granted -- is cynical and mean-spirited. (Why must the historic past be deconstructed?) P&P belongs in a drawing room, not a barn.<br/><br/>Granted the film had to condense events, but it did not allow time for Wickham, who is scarcely on screen here -- the entire catalyst in Elizabeth's view of Darcy -- or other characters like Bingley's sisters. Maybe had the film been longer -- even by a half hour -- there would have been more development of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy's nemesis.<br/><br/>There was a problem I, an American, had with the dialog. It simply could be that almost everyone spoke too fast (a typical American perception of British speech). However, while the earlier versions of P&P relied on ""standard"" British accents, the characters in this film, including Mr. Darcy, at times lapsed into dialect that I couldn't follow. Also, as was noted in other posts, some of the dialog was jarringly modern, as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to accommodate the MTV generation.<br/><br/>That said, I think the film had more merits than flaws. For openers, it is lush and sensual. With the exception of Donald Sutherland, as mentioned above, it seemed well acted. While Laurence Olivier's Darcy was intense, and Colin Firth's more virile, Macfayden was downright sexy. (And those eyes!) His portrayal of Mr. Darcy of someone shy, though a tad sullen, rather than pompous and arrogant, differed slightly from the usual perception of this famous character. When we first meet him, at the village dance, the way he rigidly strolled about the hall reminded me of a guy at a singles event awkwardly checking out the territory. In the scene in the rain, when he first proposes to Elizabeth, he looked like some doofus, befuddled and lost.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley gave a good portrayal of Elizabeth, though, again, given the film's time constraints, the script did not allow enough of this character's rapier wit. It's the verbal repartee that made the novel sublime.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are portrayed here sympathetically. This is a definite departure from Austen's book, in which the characters are either smart or foolish. Mrs. Bennett here is simply a worried, rather than silly woman, who understands that a daughter, depending on whether she has a fortune, is a commodity or a liability. Again, the blander depiction of these characters makes the film lose its satiric edge. Nevertheless, it is easier to view these people in a different perspective.<br/><br/>Generally, I would give this film a thumbs up. Although the 1995 version remains the definitive, in my view, as far as the era and mentality of the book, and will inevitably remain the benchmark, this newer one has a somewhat artistic interpretation which should just be enjoyed for its own sake."
"sigismond","8","0","2","2 April 2006"," The real stars of this film. . . .
","In this year's Academy Awards, Keira Knightley received a nomination for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett, the headstrong young woman who misinterprets the character of the man she loves, Mr Darcy, as being proud and arrogant. Although she did a good enough playing Lizzie, the performances by Carey Mulligan, Jena Malone and Talulah Riley were much better, especially Talulah and Carey.<br/><br/>The two British actresses conveyed the emotions of their characters without resorting to the temptation to overplay their roles. Miss Riley actually has, in my opinion, what I consider the best scene. Her character, Mary, is found by her father(Donald Sutherland), on the verge of tears because he interrupted what she considered to be her best effort to display her musical skills. She plays that scene so well, as does Carey with her role. In the case of Jena Malone, she is already an established name, whereas Talulah and Carey aren't. I think that these two in particular should be regarded for the sheer talent they bring to their performances as major stars of the future."
"mymaoyao","7","0","3","29 March 2006"," Interesting but not very good
","I don't like this movie much. Maybe I am just too fastidious, but in my opinion, the leading actress is not beautiful enough and Mr. Darcy is not handsome enough, either. Many people might disagree with these comments I ruthlessly made about these two, but I think those who have seen the famous 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice would agree with me. The cast in the 1940 version was truly a masterpiece and very convincing. Needless to say, the cast for supporting roles were even worse in this version, especially that for Jane and Mr. Bingley.<br/><br/>Acting is also a problem for this movie. Elizabeth lacked the natural grace and was more immature in this new version and Mr. Darcy adopted a mien of coldness both too deliberately and indifferently. And just too many photographing gimmicks in this picture, which tired me in the end.<br/><br/>It might be a pity that I happened to have seen the older version before this new 2005 version, because the latter was completely overshadowed by the former. Moreover, Jane Austen's novel and the script in the movie accordingly were of course very witty and engaging, but unfortunately people seldom laugh twice at the same joke.<br/><br/>The dance scene should have been the most delightful part in Jane Austen's movies, like what I saw with immeasurable pleasure in the 1997 Emma, however, in this movie, these scenes were always so noisy, crowded and confusing that hardly caused any delight. On the contrary to being beautiful, these scenes conveyed to us some kind of uneasiness, which is really disappointing.<br/><br/>I think as a novelist, Jane Austen was very successful, otherwise how could her works be interpreted again and again in screens? But like almost all best-sellers, these novels were full of conversations that are too witty and spicy and darted forth too quickly and freely from the actors' mouths; this feature not only lessens the credibility of the whole story, but also impairs the depth and seriousness of its artistic value. Somehow what is hidden and inexpressible should eventually turn out to be the most powerful, while words, however witty or smart they are, still lack real strength.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of beautifully-shot moments, mostly consisting of those fabulous landscapes, which seem almost too beautiful to be real. The color in this movie was also very rich and almost splendid in some scenes. But all the merits mean nothing in a movie which is supposed to be warm and touching yet remain noisy but cold and indifferent; this alone is enough to make this movie a failure. <br/><br/>I rate this movie 7 out of 10. mymaoyao@hotmail.com"

Lizzie was a bit too skinny for the part, in my opinion, and they did get a very cute Mr Darcy, but poor Mr Bingley! they made him the village rich-idiot!!! and then they cut off one of his sisters+husband!!!! not good!! so Instead of having those long, boring field scenes, or making up whatever absurdity they did, they could've just sticked to the book, and it would've been a little bit better!!! Can you imagine a Lady making a a call in the middle of the night!!! and Lady Catherine de Bourg, nonetheless!!!! it was a nice movie in the overall, but the 1995 BBC mini is still top of the line, and as close as possible to the book as I've ever seen!!! but then, they had 5 hours to do it... so they might as well!!!"
"owlglass","7","0","2","27 March 2006"," Enjoyable but flawed
","First of all, I enjoyed this version; I really did. What it got right is a more distinct sense of the darker and chaotic side of Jane Austen's worlds. There's a lot of melancholy here, which wasn't rendered in the preceding TV series. The Brits--though this time contaminated by French input, which didn't help at all; it seldom does--can do Austen very well indeed when they put their minds to it. The BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale was so much superior to the boring Paltrow cinema version.<br/><br/>Where does this latest production of P&P fail? The first problem coming to mind is the script. Adaptation is an art all of its own, and while the TV series had time to plot out most of the significant narrative strands of the novel, two hours of film doesn't. Purely from a scripting point of view, significant characterizations--'significant' in the sense that they contributed to the explication and bringing-to-live of the central characters--were far too 'pro forma', almost as if they were thrown in because the writer felt that they needed to. The result was that many of them had no function at all, and cluttered up the action and diffused the narrative focus.<br/><br/>The second problem had to do with direction. The first half, with the aid of the muddled script, was confusing, unconvincing and occasionally annoying. I loved the deconstruction of the decorous superficiality that adhered to the TV series, and the occasionally chaotic social occasions; but in the end it got too much, and the interactions of the main characters were lost, instead of, as the director presumably intended, contextualized. Also, the sound was awful. The deliberate toning-down and made-hard-to-hear-above-the-din of individual conversations may have had an element of realism, but the strain of the listener, having to work out just exactly what was being said, didn't help one's becoming engrossed in the tale. The vacuous sisters and mother and their hysterical carry-ons also became annoying and were overdone and for too long.<br/><br/>Third problem: Keira Knightley. She's a cool actress, who fits perfectly into King Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually--but here she was very much miscast. If the producers had had any guts they would have cast the incomparable Rosamund Pike in that role, instead of wasting her in the nearly-invisible part of Jane Bennett. Rosamund was the one saving grace among the women of Die Another Day, and here, too, she basically stole the show without even trying hard whenever she appeared, whether she said or did much or, as was the case for the most time, not. Keira, by contrast, needs to act-by-effort since she doesn't as yet have enough depth of personality. Too much 'star' and not enough 'character'; quite unsuitable for this part. She battled her way through it valiantly, and I admire her for that, but it just wasn't 'right' for her. The mis-casting was rivaled only by the casting of Katie Holmes in Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Fourth problem: just about all the male characters, except for Donald Sutherland, who can do no wrong. That the film should fade out with a shot of him was an unexpected stroke of genius. I wonder if it was scripted that way or a directorial decision.<br/><br/>Having said all these basically negative things, I'd like to finish on a positive note, which is that in the second half, when the 'busy-ness' started to abate, the film actually acquired depth and became quite touching. The final scene between Elizabeth and her father was the crown, and if an ending is what makes a movie, it makes me forgive many other mistakes.<br/><br/>But just imagine if, instead of Keira Knightley it had Rosamunde Pike who had been doing that scene with Sutherland. It would have been near-perfection.<br/><br/>4 stars solely because of the second half and a great attempt to take the saccharine edge off the movie-incarnations of Austen's novels.<br/><br/>Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP"

","I immediately fell in love with the movie and cant help myself watching it over again, paying special attention to the confrontation or rather the confession of love and marriage proposal of Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth and the dawn scene. The dialogue/script were so 1800! I imagined myself living during that period, as if everything being said is a part of a poem. I enjoyed listening. Though many times how I wished Mr. Darcy could have expressed his feelings more through meaningful gestures, or were those per director's instructions? One thing that increased the excitement was the lack of intimate moments between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth such as a kiss after the confrontation (where it seemed that there should have been a kiss) and also during their moment at dawn. That excited the imagination of viewers so much more! Moreso, for me, the end was so abrupt, leaving everything again to our imagination. Lastly, Matthew Macfayden was so appropriately chosen for the role. He was so handsome with the long hair. Reactions, anyone?"
"lanaileila","5","0","2","21 March 2006"," as good as it can possible be for a 2 hour movie
","Although, in my mind, no Pride and Prejudice movie could compare to the 1995 BBC miniseries, this version has some definite good points to it, as well as some disappointments. Lets start with the good. The movie had a rustic feel to it, it almost felt like I could smell and feel the English country side. In the 1995 version, i believe it was too clean, too pristine. This version made the home life more believable, or rather more understandable as to what position in society these girls were born into. The fact that the actors were much younger and appealed more towards today's standards of beauty than in the 1995 version was much easier to relate to, and comprehend the meanings of society. I remember watching the BBC version for the 1st time being slightly jarred by the fact that the women i was seeing did not coincide with my ideals and thoughts of their looks, while reading the novel. That said I still strongly believe that the casting of Kiera Knightley had something to do with her Resemblance to Jennifer Ehle. The girls actually looked the age their are represented as in the book. The roles of the sisters were very well played, and the younger didn't look older than the elder sister (as was in the BBC Version). This movie was visually very satisfying, but then again all the other big budget Hollywood movies are. The scenery was amazing, and at times breathtaking. If nothing else, this movie is great for all the richness in the imagery. Very important to mention that the ending is a bit more satisfying than in the previous version. Also the attraction tension between the two main characters is nicely played out. Now here are some of the problems that bothered me: The costumes... looked like a hodgepodge of eras all thrown together. The story takes place before 1813, not in 1850's or1870's or so on... for a movie that satisfied be visually, this was a throbbing eyesore, for me which for many this may not be a problem. The screen play, or rather the lines of the actors... It seemed forced, in many cases I felt that they tried too hard to make it sound of the time by putting in a whole slab of words that are usually seen on the SATS or any other standardized tests. Although that is how the book is, it is evident that in many cases the language has been simplified in order for it not to sound like the BBC version. Some of the conversations seemed hurried and for those who haven't read the book, a bit confusing. All in all some parts were kind of awkward in terms of language. <br/><br/>Mr.Darcy's character, was dry. And although I do blame the speech-writers, the acting was just, at times, painful to watch. Truth be told, I am prejudiced, I don't think that Colin Firth could be topped in this role. To see what I mean, Rent the BBC version, you all will love it. Then it's the mother.. this woman is hysterical, she knows she's hysterical, but here, it was like looking at a completely different character. Her actions were over explained and henceforth not as funny. However, with all its tiny shortcomings this movie was satisfying enough to see it a couple of times."

Some of the cinematographic devices used, such as the isolation of Elizabeth and Darcy during the second ball are simply inspired.

"TxMike","Null","0","4","18 March 2006"," A nicely watchable adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.
","It has been well-established that a 2-hour movie can contain only a small fraction of the novel it is based on, so I suspect the various versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" over the years have different significantly in their ""focus"", all the while attempting to be true to the spirit of the novel. I am not a great fan of this genre, but wanted to see it for the acclaim received by its star, Keira Knightley. In real life she seems to be quite a sharp wit, so this was a perfect role for her, the sharp-witted and independent Elizabeth Bennet. I enjoyed the movie very much. <br/><br/>The basic story involves a family with 5 daughters, and the mother (Brenda Blethyn in one of her patented roles) is eager to marry them off to men of at least some wealth. Four of the daughters are fairly compliant, but Liz is too independent and strong-willed to marry someone she doesn't love, a concept which amuses her father (Donald Sutherland). <br/><br/>While mum tries to facilitate the union between her daughter Jane (pretty blonde Rosamund Pike) and the wealthy suitor, Liz happens to meet sullen Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) and they hit it off badly from the very beginning. Liz finds out other things which make her even less eager to ever see Mr Darcy again. So the rest of the movie has all the main characters visiting here and there, the mysteries of courtship in the middle of it all. It seems that the whole preoccupation of the young ladies is finding a husband and living that life. I suspect it was back then.<br/><br/>The SPOILERS FOLLOW. Liz eventually and gradually finds out that much of what she first learned about Mr Darcy were exaggerations or lies and that, in fact, he is a very generous person. Also he is shy and, after he knows someone, breaks out quite a bit. Add to that, he has fallen deeply in love with Liz. As she also falls for him, we see the mechanics of their working it out and the movie ends with them married and sharing small talk."

","I must strongly disagree with ehenders from Australia, on almost every point. I am a huge Jane Austen fan and have watched three versions of Pride and Prejudice (the one with Keira Knightley included) and though BBC has been my favorite for a long time, I was really impressed with this last one. Sure it's shorter, but if you can display someone's pride in six scenes, Joe Wright did the same in one or two. The point that the story was rushed was perhaps, the strongest point made. Besides that, this movie was FAR more emotionally and passionately done than any other adaptation. This movie's strong point is its ability to pack the heart and soul of a story into a shorter amount of time. There was more than enough chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth and that was more than clearly displayed. Displayed beautifully and sensitively, too. The cast was great - Mr. Bennett grew on me very quickly, and made a touching father. And my completely favorite actor in all three versions for all the characters cast was Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy. He captured the outwardly proud/inwardly sensitive type better than I've seen yet. He showed the soft side of himself more effectively, and the managed to look proud without looking egotistical. I thought he made the story."

She is a woman of our time, I suppose. Her ways of thinking is a bold one. A bright mind, indeed. Keira Knightley is perfect for this role. I can not think if there is anyone who suits better for the role of Lizzie Bennet other than her. I heard that this movie was heavily compared with the old BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I think). I haven't watched it. I am quite sure it was good also. But I guess, Ehle's Lizzie would be different than Knightley's Lizzie.<br/><br/>The filming locations are great!! I don't know much about England. But who cares, all the places in the movie are beautiful. Great views! The most romantic thing about this movie is they do not input a lot of kissing scenes. As a matter of fact, I think the only kissing scene is only by Mr and Mrs. Bennet (UK version of course). And I don't think that counts as romantic kissing. The actors and actresses express their love mostly by body-language and facial expression. I suppose it is harder to show the feelings contained inside by focusing on the little events, like the way Darcy held Lizzie's hand. Or how they stared at each other, and so on. Matthew MacFayden as Mr Darcy is superb. I guess a lot of people agree with me. :P I'm really glad that he has the looks combined with the talent. Good looks without talent is very boring.<br/><br/>Speaking about the other characters, well, the movie wasn't alive without them. Character of Jane, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia Bennet. The mother who was a bit of irritating (for the role, I mean, I'm a bit annoyed seeing a mother who treat her daughters like that, but for the actress, she's great!!). The father, Donald Sutherland played a wonderful part. Lizzie wouldn't be the same without her father. The Bingleys are great too. And Wickham.<br/><br/>It is too bad that such a long story has to be made into a movie with only 2 hours duration. However the director did a great job by making this successful.<br/><br/>P&P has a perfect ending too. I love the UK version. I think it is best ended with Mr Bennet, celebrating the day."

","Jane Austen may or may not have approved of the Costume...Heavens. WHO said the tale must be told in REGENCY style. I doubt very much that the details of love were lost in such legalistic trappings...More likely that Miss Austen would be delighted that her story was 'interpreted in such a manner. She was not a woman who wrote with the dedication to KEEP IT JUST THIS WAY...but she wrote to amuse. Therefore.... It is my opinion that this new version accomplished just that. I found the movie Lavish in beauty...ridiculously romantic..and I shall treasure it. I happen to love period pieces even if they are not PURE.

"louisahc","10","0","3","12 March 2006"," A Gem even for a Purist - but for God's Sake Reshoot the Balcony Ending!
","I loved this movie because it gave me, a purist, some joyous chances to relive the book and to see it from fresh angles - something I would not have thought possible before, given how well I know and love it. Let me just say that the world created by Jane Austen is so self-sufficient, rich and orderly that one feels that physical description supplied in interpretation cannot taint it but merely ""brighten it by exercise,"" as Darcy said of Lizzie's eyes.<br/><br/>In the book, Darcy had no doubt that he would be accepted when he first proposed; ""He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security."" MacFadyen's Darcy faced a modern audience with even less patience than an insulted and injured Elizabeth. Since they do not share Georgian convictions on class stratification, they would have hated a jerk who acted like he was God's gift to earth. I don't think Austen herself would have been able to give us a sympathetic Darcy if she had only 20 pages before the proposal scene kicks in. MacFadyen's Darcy therefore does not act out the complacency but only the incredulity by saying out loud, ""Are you laughing at me? Are you rejecting me?,"" in order to embody the subtler descriptions of the book."" <br/><br/>After watching it a few times, I was struck by the way in which MacFadyen first reels off the obstacles to his love: ""the expectations of my family, your inferior birth, my rank,"" where the laundry list delivery is so mechanical and yet his drenched despair so Brontesque I laughed: you can see that Darcy has been reciting these objections to himself so many times, and his conflicted love is so hermetic, that he makes the fatal error of combining the two: He already believes that she loves him so absolutely that he can be perfectly honest with her and share his doubts with her. And come to think of it, isn't this what Austen's Darcy did, in a certain way? And isn't it very human to do so? The selfish preoccupation with his own concerns is more forgivable in this light; his arrogance stems in part from the nature of unrequited and unacknowledged love: the lack of any input from the object of one's desire. I have always loathed Mr. Darcy just a bit in this scene, but now I have even more reason to believe Elizabeth's assertion that ""in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just."" <br/><br/>And I challenge those who criticize the script to show anything in Hollywood or even indies to rival this these days. The arrogance of purists who say that Knightley comes across as being merely sharp rather than incisively intelligent goes beyond anything Darcy ever dreamed of: a tenth of Austen more than suffices. Elizabeth teased Lady de Bourgh about ""sisterly affection"" and her age, satirized idle and insincere social exchange during her dance with Darcy, saw through her own reaction of wounded vanity at the Assembly  frankly, Britney Spears could have said these things and she would have come across as brilliant. That's how good our Jane is. And Ms. Knightley did very well with what she got. <br/><br/>On people's dislike of the post-nuptial ""drivel"" - there was plenty of sentimentality during Austen's time, and just because she wrote ""Northanger Abbey"" we cannot suppose she therefore wants that part of human existence obliterated. She merely chooses to eschew those grounds  very wisely. But I have always wanted to hear exactly was said at this time: <br/><br/>The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do...he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable. <br/><br/>For God's sake, what's the payoff of getting into such a perfect intellectual union, if it were not in part the romancing that comes after-wards?! For Darcy to have said ""you have bewitched me, body and soul"" is probably still understated in the hyperbole of the day. I have not seen the balcony scene yet, but in view of the above I think we can forgive a bit of the filmmakers' licence  Austen did not want to go there, but we do, and given her perspicacity about our foibles I think we would have had her blessings for going there. However, it is heinous of the filmmakers not to use the post-second-proposal discussions as the fodder for the balcony dialogue: <br/><br/>ELIZABETH'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. ''How could you begin?'' said she. ''I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?'' <br/><br/>'I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation...I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.''<br/><br/>You can look up the rest. If this has been used instead of ""Mrs. Darcy,"" they could have kissed until Kingdom Come and I would have watched them  the intellect, affection and wit of the exchange are so powerful they are, like one reviewer said, ""forces of nature."" This part does deserve the ""dumbing down"" criticism. Reshoot the ending!"
"marissas75","9","0","3","12 March 2006"," Exuberant, emotionally resonant version of a classic story
","Joe Wright's film of ""Pride and Prejudice"" has tough standards to live up to: it's based on one of the most beloved novels of all time, and comes just 10 years after an acclaimed miniseries version of the same story. I'll leave it to other reviewers to give this new movie low marks for its supposed historical inaccuracy or betrayal of Jane Austen's intentions. As someone who admires Austen's novels, but admires good film-making even more, I found this ""Pride and Prejudice"" highly successful.<br/><br/>At 2 hours, the movie obviously can't flesh out its supporting characters or provide quite as much social commentary as the novel and miniseries do. But because of its need to tightly focus on the main plot line, it conveys the emotional life of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, better than the other versions of this story. The intelligent, opinionated Elizabeth has so much to deal with over the course of six months or a year: her family includes a silly mother, sarcastic father, and flirtatious younger sisters; her beautiful older sister Jane gets her heart broken; and she must contend with characters like the sycophantic Mr. Collins, the judgmental Lady Catherine, and, of course, the haughty Mr. Darcy. Watching this movie, you relate to Elizabeth's problems on a more personal level.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie (more than the miniseries) is very cinematic, smartly using visuals to tell the story. The dance sequences are some of the best I've ever seen in a period film--the dancers don't merely go through the motions to add background detail, but look like they're truly having a fun time. The camera effortlessly moves through the crowds, following first one character and then another, but always showing exactly what we need to see. Darcy and Elizabeth's first dance together is filmed in an almost haunting way that makes the tension and attraction between them clear.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen both find fresh approaches to their iconic characters. Knightley's Elizabeth is dreamier and less vivacious than usual. She delivers many of her witty comments with a serious undertone, and there are plenty of shots of Elizabeth alone, lost in thought, trying to find solace in the beautiful landscapes that surround her. MacFadyen plays Darcy not as a fully-formed romantic hero, but as a young and imperfect man who has just as much to learn about life as Elizabeth does.<br/><br/>Brenda Blethyn and Jena Malone have great fun with two of the showiest roles, Mrs. Bennet and Lydia Bennet, respectively. I'm not sure what to think of the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet. He gives a fine performance, but at 70 years old, he looks more like the Bennet girls' grandfather than their father. However, his white-haired cragginess underscores the poignancy of the fact that when Mr. Bennet dies, his family will lose their home.<br/><br/>Maybe Sutherland stands out so much because otherwise, this is truly a young person's ""Pride and Prejudice."" Knightley and MacFadyen are younger than the typical Elizabeth and Darcy, and their performances make clear that a major theme of the story is how both characters mature by coming into contact with one another. And the film-making has the youthful energy and boldness that is necessary in order to tackle filming such a famous novel--and to come out a winner."
"esmirff","10","0","3","11 March 2006"," It's a love story.
","When I found out my sister rented it, I said, ""they should never have tried to do it again, because however much I like the movie -- and I doubt that I will -- Mr. Darcy will always be, and can never be anybody but, Colin Firth."" I was wrong.<br/><br/>Jane Austen's beautiful piece of literature was a social commentary spun with cynicism and wit, style and confidence, and just a little humility BUT, and here is where I interject: the book was written by about love and Jane decided, against all cynicism and tongue-in-cheek, against all probability, to give it a joyful ending. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett get married. And live happily ever after. Happily ever after is why we remember Mr. Darcy; it's why single women whisper to each other, ""I am waiting for my Mr. Darcy."" As a writer, I maintain that the single most important factor in a story, is the story-telling itself. A good story-teller cannot be ignored and those that told Pride and Prejudice this way, in this movie, told it like they've been telling stories since they were born. Perhaps it lacked some of the humor, but what it skipped in chuckles, it made up for in droves with emotion. It is a perfect love story. It appeased the cynic in me, and the idealist. While a lot of 19th century literature takes a step back in that it relays life with an objectivity comfortable and humorous, it is endearing because we know beneath it lies a well of emotion, of hurt and passion. This movie is that emotion.<br/><br/>I believed Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I believed they were in love."
"valadas","7","0","2","8 March 2006"," It's so good
","It's so good to wash our eyes and souls watching such a charming romantic movie after tons of bloodshed, violence, wars, horror, robots, special effects made by computer, etc. It's like to see something human after all. Well but I must comment on the merits of the movie itself and not dwell upon my filmic nostalgias. And besides it I don't want to give the impression that I don't appreciate many of those modern movies with bloodshed, robots, etc when they are good indeed. This movie tells us a story of the clash between the aristocratic way of life and values of England in the beginning of 19th century and that of the middle classes against the background of rural atmosphere. The members of the often impoverished middle classes aspire to imitate the aristocracy and if possible, to become its members one day too. For the girls however, the only hope is to marry noblemen preferably rich because at the time girls had no other choice for they were economically dependent since their birth because they were not allowed to get any profession or job that could bring them a substantial income. Therefore the parents of five girls like the one in the movie, whose income was rather low, had the hard task of marrying them all above their social status to avoid disgrace and ruin to the whole family. A hard task indeed. Well but human beings have feelings and sentiments and young men and girls tend to love one another irrespective of their social positions and that collides with such materialistic ideas. And the substance of romanticism is precisely this collision which was of course much more acute at the epoch portrayed in the movie than nowadays. This movie gives us that atmosphere through the good performance of its whole cast and the various scenes and dialogues where all these contradictions are shown and the sentiments are sometimes revealed sometimes concealed because of strict social and mundane or etiquette rules. In formal terms the images and sequences either interior or exterior are beautiful enough, express adequately the general atmosphere of the movie and are faithful to the portrayed epoch in every aspect."
"marionmclaverty","Null","0","2","8 March 2006"," My thoughts on Pride and Prejudice
","Pride and Prejudice has been my favourite book since I was a teenager (quite a few years ago!). I can remember the black and white BBC version staring Alan Badel as Mr Darcy. He was magnificent! I watched with interest the BBC version staring Colin Firth as Mr Darcy and found that he lived up to the standard set many years ago by Mr Badel.<br/><br/>I also remember seeing the Laurence Oliver version many years ago and thought it was absolutely ghastly! So I was interested to see the new film version, wondering what they could do with such a masterpiece in just a couple of hours.<br/><br/>It took me a little while to get through Ms Knightley's ""Posh"" pouting and the very dour Matthew Macfadyn as Mr Darcy, but I came away quite liking it and decided to go again. After the second time, I came away a big fan having thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>How do you squeeze a book such as this into a 2 hour, or thereabouts, slot? For many years I was a P&P purist, but now I just see this as another take on a brilliantly written story. It would be impossible to develop all the characters in such a short time and who do you leave out? I am glad that the director chose to give us Mr Collins (brilliantly acted) which was perhaps at the expense of Wickham. However, I do agree that Bingley was too foppish in this version.<br/><br/>Having now seen it again on DVD, I think Matthew Macfadyn, although different, was a great Darcy.<br/><br/>I loved watching the film on DVD with the director's comments. Quite amusing. I congratulate him on a job well done.<br/><br/>The last thing I would like to comment on is the superbly uplifting music by Dario Marianelli. The only criticism I have of the CD is that the pieces are not long enough!"
"elsinefilo","Null","0","3","6 March 2006"," worth watching though some characters look like being misinterpreted
","I don't know whether any other work in English literature has been adapted into silver screen so many times.I know to make a comment of comparison doesn't sound good but I couldn't help myself comparing this fairly recent adaptation with the Bollywood adaptation ""Bride and Prejudice"". First of all this adaptation is as much loyal as it can to the work of Jane Austen. Keira Knightley performs well as Elizabeth.If you read the book you know what makes us admire Elizabeth: Her honesty,her quick-witted answers her feisty nature but we also know her with her her sharp tongue and tendency to judge quickly.The difference is right here. Aishwarya Rai in Bollywood adaptation can't give that quick-witted but honest Elizabeth. She seems more like a haughty self-centered lady who likes humiliating her interlocutor. Brenda Blethyn reflects the mother,who is consumed with the desire to see her daughters married no matter what,in excellent acting.Donald Sutherland as the self-possessed but irresponsible father is not bad either.Jane is the most beautiful one of the sisters and I guess they made some efforts to make Rosamund Pike(Jane) more beautiful than Elizabeth(Keira Knightley). I can't say they are unsuccessful. But what really caught my attention is that...we know Bingley is well-intentioned fun guy but in the movie he seems like a(what is mot juste here?)I don't know he just seems too too easygoing. He is not like Bingley in the book. We also know that Darcy is a class-conscious cold guy but Matthew Macfadyen walks like a half-fainted body(especially his eyes) all the movie even when he proposed Elizabeth the second time.Just being cold isn't necessarily having a dead-pan face.(But William Darcy in Bollywood adaptation looks cool and cheerful this must be worse to interpret Darcy's character)And last Sylvester Morand as Mr. Collins seems like a sensible guy at many points.He is just a pompous, idiotic obsequious clergyman!! In Bollywood adaptation the guy paying him looks really idiotic. All in all it's a chance to visualize Jane Austen's work. Not perfect not too bad worth watching!"
"HallmarkMovieBuff","Null","0","1","4 March 2006"," Upon first impression, it helps if you've read the book
","In some early scenes of this film, the dialog is so helter-skelter and subservient to the music in the soundtrack that all I could think was, ""Who's this Darcy character and why did he come to visit, when he clearly doesn't want to be here?"" One has to wait for the post-party parlor scenes for the dialog to become fully intelligible. By then, the question has gone unanswered, so one can but accept his presence and learn from later events. Indeed, during the various party scenes, one must rely largely on body language rather than English to tell the story.<br/><br/>One curiosity in this production has the respected Canadian actor, Donald Sutherland, affecting an English accent, standing out among the genuine Brits in the cast as much as if he were U.S.-American. Still, his performance as the rational, lovable, and understanding father provides a bit of comfort food amongst the class-structured madness which characterizes novels of the period.<br/><br/>Another appearance I found interesting here was that of Carey Mulligan in her maiden role as Kitty Bennet, having just seen her in her subsequent role as Ada Clare/Carstone in the BBC's 2005 production (one I recommend highly) of Charles Dickens' ""Bleak House,"" which recently completed a six-week run on PBS. Too many portrayals of Dickens' characters come across as caricatures, but not these. This to me is one of the best screen tellings of a Dickens tale I've ever seen. But I digress.<br/><br/>There are several outstanding performances in this well-mounted production, from Brenda Blethyn to Matthew Macfadyen, but clearly Kiera Knightly's grounded and unaffected Elizabeth is a stand-out among stand-outs. Surely, a more natural Elizabeth never was...and this coming from a totally devoted fan of Greer Garson, who owned the role in 1940.<br/><br/>Of course, one can't overlook the love story. Macfadyen and Knightly as Darcy and Elizabeth call forth so many other romantic couplesOlivier and Oberon as Heathcliff and Cathy in 1939's ""Wuthering Heights"" come to mind in particular.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are a fan of Jane Austen, as you should be, two hours spent viewing this film can hardly be better spent (except, possibly, in reading the book)."

All the SUBTLETIES of the original text are LOST in this adaptation. On a brighter note, Keira Knightley was fantastic as Elizabeth. She was both stunning and elegant.

This can be a very emotional film as well - so if you are one who doesn't like ""sappy"" love stories then this is not the film for you to see.

","Plot Outline: The story is based on Jane Austen's classic love story set in 18th century England, the family of Bennets including five daughters whose future is dependent on finding well-settled husbands. The Bennets brush with high society sophistication when the eldest (Rosamund Pike) is to be engaged to a wealthy Mr. Bingley whose friends include the wealthy, handsome and snobbish Mr. Darcy. The unfolding drama portrays pride, judgmental reactions and finding real love in the perspective of the beautiful and individualistic Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley).<br/><br/>Comment: The thought of watching a classic had made me initially apprehensive about watching the movie. But as soon as the characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth start taking life, it is difficult not to get absorbed into the story. Although I haven't read Jane Austen, I must say that the screenplay is excellent and captures 18th Century England, its picturesque landscapes and formal societies well. Elizabeth is the strongest character of the movie and Keira Knighley has done a wonderful job although de-glamorized.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of noteworthy moments; especially the comical one's involving the poor Mr. Collins and the exchange of words between the Bennett parents. Rosamund Pike looks lovely and Keira character also considering the fact that she is 20 something is intriguing and absorbing and is the protagonist of the story. Mcfadyen has done justice to the role of Mr. Darcy a true blue-blooded gentleman. The movie is recommended for those who love well-made classics or even for just watching Keira Knighley.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

But enough of this.<br/><br/>I expected something when I read and heard a lot about this movie. But what I finally saw came out as a surprise. There is some much that can be done about those old books to make a movie .. well .. best describe it as a movie only a middle aged woman would like. But thanks to Joe Wright, he didn't do anything of this but did all right.<br/><br/>And though the story hadn't much left for surprises, even if you didn't know the book, it kept me bounded to the end. Keira obviously did a fabulous job. Though there were some scenes like the one at the pavilion in the rain, which felled not really great I just loved her cockiness, her smile, her irony. I loved her play with Donald Sutherland, were a look did say more than 2 pages of phrases. And of course I'm gonna dream about big .. huge dark eyes tonight. Honestly, I would probably pay for a movie which had nothing in it but 2 hour close up of her face, her smile and her eyes. But back to the movie.<br/><br/>Brenda and Donald as the parents were hilarious. The father, plagued with a house with 5 teenage daughters and one furious wife. Brenda, who seemed to do anything to get her daughters married. And the 4 other daughters, each of whom had her role in this one. And filled it perfectly. Oh, and I almost forgot about the grand dame of English cinema, Judy Dench. The angry and old school (of course) Lady de Bourg.<br/><br/>My advice if you're a man: Grab your favorite girl, take her to the cinema and watch this movie. Or buy/rent the DVD. She'll love you more than before for taking her to this one and you also will have a great time."

","When I went in to see this movie I was expecting to tear it apart. I have always loved the 1995 mini series and I couldn't imagine another Darcy or Elizabeth. I was shocked to find that they were not the improperly cast characters. I absolutely abhorred their choice of Mr. Bennet. He lacked the friendly wit and sarcasm. Mr. Bingley was slouching all over the place. He actually guffawed and at the Netherfield ball, I'm almost certain that he touched Jane's butt. In short: He wasn't Mr. Bingley! During the scene in which Darcy first asks Elizabeth to dance the camera motion really distracted from the action of the scene. At the end the swooping artsy-shwartsy camera angles just seem pretentious and made me rather nauseous. In some places, were we need to be close to the characters, the camera is far out. On the whole, I think the actors were excellent but the cinematography held them down. There is however one breath-taking shot of Elizabeth walking in the fields. It is absolutely gorgeous. <br/><br/>I thought Keira Knightley was brilliant. She completely embodied Elizabeth Bennet. The scene in which Darcy first asks her to marry him is so charged. Viewers can feel the passion floating off the screen in waves. The two of them were excellent. Some of the best acting I have ever seen. Toward the end the writers got a little carried away. Pride and Prejudice takes place in a time of repression. They should not be all over each other!"

","I loved the film. It is a modern interpretation of Austen's novel, yes, but I think those who see this as detrimental to its overall quality misunderstand the true definition of film-making as an art form. And it should be clear to any viewer that this particular interpretation of Austen's novel is intended to be artful, if not completely historically accurate; the numerous, lengthy, and varying scenes of English countryside might pass for and stand alone as their own art, nevermind the sparse yet insightful dialogue and beautifully understated wardrobe, which are obviously all coordinated to emphasize the love story between Eliabeth and Mr. Darcy. To my point: art is meant to be interpreted, and although it is legitimate to hate this movie, to do so solely based on the fact that it isn't an exact copy of the 1995 version, or of the novel itself is perhaps both prideful and prejudiced; to me, the unique fusion of modern values and dialogue with Austen's original vision is the film's most remarkable and appealing quality."

My mother and I have been Pride and Prejudice fans for many years. We have seen 2 different versions of it prior to this one. The second one we saw, an A&E production released in 1995, included a lot of what was in the book by Jane Austen, but lacked realistic clothing as well as demeanor.<br/><br/>So, being the fan of Pride and Prejudice that I am, you can imagine how excited I was for this production to make its way into theaters. In fact, my mother and I drove an hour just to get to a theater that it was playing. Let me tell you, that we were not disappointed!<br/><br/>The Bennett family, especially the daughters were extremely realistic. Kiera Knightley did a top notch job portraying independent yet still beautiful Elizabeth. While I thought that her character was a bit peasant-like compared to the other girls, overall it was a good job. Rosamund Pike did a good job as Jane, quiet and congenial. The other girls were very much like you would expect them to be, Talulah Ridley the pessimistic Mary, Jena Malone and Carey Mulligan the immature, boy-crazy Lydia and Kitty. <br/><br/>I thought that Matthew Macfayden did a great job playing the antisocial, yet sweet on the inside Mr.Darcy. And wow! Simon Woods and Kelly Rielly really stood out(in a good way)as redheaded brother and sister Bingleys. Mr. Bingley's appearance only added to his carefree and joyful spirit, and Ms. Bingley was a sort of mini-villainess.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie was absolutely beautiful, the rocky British countryside, one of the most romantic places in the world.The clothing as well as the dwellings were very realistic for the time period, and the beautiful music only adds to the splendor. <br/><br/>I would recommend you going to see this if you have not done so already, but also note that this movie is best enjoyed in a place and at a time where you can watch it in its entirety without interruption, because the sheer beauty of this movie should be undisturbed if it is to be enjoyed to its fullest extent.<br/><br/>Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"

","I thought this version of Pride and Prejudice was by far the best; I've seen other versions. I thought the actors Knightley and Macfadyen played their parts well, although I think Ehle and Firth aren't bad actors, I didn't think the 1995 version was true to the social, historical and cultural context. The costumes in the 1995 version weren't as good in comparison and quite revealing. The 2005 enactment of Pride & Prejudice was more sympathetic towards Mrs Bennet, I recall Mrs Bennet saying something like ""You don't what it's like to have 5 daughters to provide for/marry off."" It's the first time she was portrayed as a harassed and worried woman rather than a toadying, match making mama. In the book she is depicted as a woman of little sense, who can be vulgar and inelegant. Lydia is amusing and a credit to Jena Malone's acting skills. I was disappointed that a lot of Wickham's (Rupert Friend's) scene's were missed out but it was balanced by the general excellence to the film. The clothing, particularly the pashmina scarfs were more genuine and representative of women's fashions than the 1995 version. Do watch it, it's out on DVD."

","Beautiful country scenery, but the performance is a little bit abrupt. Pride and Prejudice(1940) is one of my favorite movie, I have seen it several times. So I really expected to see the new version of it in 2005. It makes me feel despair somehow, because i was looking forward to it. This movie won't let me watch it for a second time. But I still love the story and the gorgeous rurality view.<br/><br/>In my view the Pride and the Predudice in people's character is a kind of inherent thing inside one's heart. And It could be seen from his or her manner and behaviors. this film represent the dramatics personae characters more verbally than body or expression language. So I was thinking this film leave less space for the audience to imagine. It tells the story but not present it and not leave adequate impression on us."
"E Canuck","9","0","1","2 February 2006"," Bringing the characters out of the costumes
","I have to scout for (mostly female) friends to take in a drama like P&P as my mate won't go with me to ""costume dramas."" Now this 2005 version of the Jane Austen classic outdoes the previous dramatizations to the degree, I can see now, some of his objections to many stories set in European drawing rooms, especially those fussy with decorative but mercenary matchmaking. Joe Pike's P&P puts many formulaic or less than excellent period pieces in the shade.<br/><br/>P&P's characters wear their costumes rather than being worn by them, dominated by ""period"" gestures and stereotypes. P&P frees the characters from confinement in a quaint past, when women's independence was laughable and their lives and happiness were gained through scheming strategies to attract husbands.<br/><br/>In Joe Pike's P&P the arch statements, the simpering younger Bennett girls and endless conversational references to the annual incomes of wealthy bachelors play out in a context of normal and recognizable human behaviour. Every raised eyebrow and fingered ribbon is naturalistic, the characters not mere types from a lamentable era whose strictures we shudder at.<br/><br/>The casting in this film is sublime. Donald Sutherland is seldom used so much against type, and so well. Judi Dench is authoritative, as always, but not overpowering the feisty Miss Bennett. Keira Knightley has remarkable presence and strength (it's almost prejudicial to say, in such a young actor.) Add a convincing recreation of pastoral English countryside and country dances at which the dancers robustly enjoy themselves. Add also a finely rendered musical score, mostly of solo piano, integrated into the story line. And the panoramic sweeps of the camera, from the character's viewpoint, putting the viewer, too, at the centre of the experience. Well, as you can see, I'm just like a duck on the pond on Mr. D'Arcy's grand estate. Lots to feed me there, and I can certainly see going for a return visit or two."
"jaskier-1","10","0","1","1 February 2006"," Why would anyone want to make yet another Jane Austen movie?
","Why would anyone want to make yet another Jane Austen movie? If you think that it is a smart question to ask then you are utterly wrong. Why? First there are many different ways to make an adaptation of Austen's novels, and second, somehow the costume movies, with some shameful exceptions, tend to get better all the time. The new adaptation of Pride & Prejudice proves it very persuasively. I am not going to summarize the plot because every genuine fan of Austen's novels would treat it as a grave offence. So let's assume you know the story and let me tell you instead what makes this particular project so successful. Actually, a number of things: first of all much attention was given by the crew to very careful and convincing depiction of the historical setting. I have to admit that my knowledge of Georgian England is rather limited, yet as a professional historian (almost there!) I am very suspicious whenever a period movie comes out, because ""life as it used to be"" is usually portrayed in a carefully sanitized and rather simplified way. Remember those ugly plastic artefacts in Hollywood classics of the sixties? Fortunately, it does not have to be the case anymore. The director and his staff really made a remarkable job: the actors are a bit shaggy and it becomes obvious even affluent ones had a limited number of stockings, dresses and shirts. Their dwellings, both simple mansions and luxurious palaces, do not like museums rented for a day of shooting, but actually have a feeling of being inhabited. Even poultry, pigs and other animals play an important part in the movie and make it much more authentic. In other words, there is a touch of real life in the movie. A few words about the actors: the major character, Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet) is just fine. What she does is not exactly exciting, yet the role is a very difficult one, and Keira certainly did her job well. Actually, the character of Elizabeth Bennet is used as a focal point around which the action revolves. As a result, other characters draw more attention, at least in the movie. The roles of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins, Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg are simply remarkable. Mr. Bennet has been portrayed as a slightly inner looking and withdrawn gentleman, who only seldom crosses his way with his shaving utensils, preferring instead to spend most of his time in his enormous library. At the same time Mr. Bennet is very fond of his eldest daughter, which forces him to openly confront his wife. Mrs. Bennet has been presented as an old, talkative, tactless and sly hen that would use and abuse any means to make sure her daughters merry suitable parties as soon as possible. Brenda Blethyn is simply marvellous in this role and the character she plays is so convincingly overwhelming, that the audience might wish to strangle her with the strings of pearls she wears in the movie. The role of Mr. Collins, a one time candidate to Elizabeth Bennet's hand is especially challenging and Tom Hollander put all his skills into it. The result is very convincing, funny and rewarding. Very good job indeed! Judi Dench (Lady Catherine de Bourg) is as great as ever. And Mr. Darcy? I'm not a woman but let me tell you this - Matthew Macfadyen is shamelessly good looking, a bit rude and yet disarmingly charming. He fits in perfectly.<br/><br/>The movie is really very good and I believe it is one of those movies you can watch again and again. Even though you know the story, it does not matter, because every time it gives you a real visual pleasure. I'm looking forward to getting it on a DVD and hopefully there will be some unreleased scenes and other goodies"

","You know, I've read Pride and Prejudice countless times, I remember laughing at Mr Collins when I was eight years old. I love and understand Jane Austen and no, I don't mix her up with the Brontes. <br/><br/>I'll debate with any Austenite - this was a great movie, even when you compare it to the six hour BBC adaptation which I own and love. Okay - Bingley shouldn't have been in Jane's bedchamber and what was Lady Catherine doing at Longbourne that late at night? Nevertheless, Jane Austen is considered a great author not because of her faithful documentation of manners, people. It's because of her astonishing and insightful mapping of the human heart. That's why we are privilege to read her still today and that's why any adaptation has got to reflect that. I love the BBC adaptation as much as anyone else, TRUST ME, but Matthew McConnaghy got to the reason people love Darcy instinctively.. because he is a good, decent vulnerable man put too early in a place of authority and he's in the thrall of killer emotions for a woman he's not sure about. And he eventually acts with decency and integrity.Good God, his every move shows this! This movie is all about the emotion behind the manners, and does exceedingly well in conveying that, in the direction, cinematography, acting. Any other consideration is secondary. Get off your high horses and understand why people actually make movies.Go back and look again."

","Joe Wright creates a brilliant visual of Jane Austen's classic novel. The imagery of the film is quite breathtaking itself. The setting of the scenes range from the British countryside to the extravagant ballrooms.<br/><br/>The music provides the film with the sense that the story is something is bigger than the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Though the motion picture does not strictly follow the novel word for word, the dialog added or removed from the script gives the film a sense of originality that I have found other adaptations of the novel lack. Keira Knightley's performance makes Elizabeth Bennett appear as a woman trapped within the rigid rules of Georgian English society, which I believe Wright was vying for. Matthew MacFayden gives an astounding performance as the aloof Mr. Darcy. However, he portrays the passionate side of Mr. Darcy just as well as the arrogant.<br/><br/>Overall, Joe Wright's adaptation has to be my favorite of the many versions of Pride and Prejudice for its impressive visuals and for the quality of the acting."
"marcin_kukuczka","7","0","1","29 January 2006"," The movie has got ""something"" that many other modern films lack
","Jane Austen's novel PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been brought to screen several times so far. Unfortunately, I have not seen any of the adaptations except for this one, made by Joe Wright recently. So I state clearly that I am not going to compare it to anything else but I will rather treat it as a separate work. Therefore, I went to see it not to judge if the film is consistent with the novel or if it changes the content. I went to see the film hoping that I will find some true art in a modern film of this genre. And I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I have to say frankly, in spite of the criticism that the movie received, that Wright's film is a pleasure to watch because it has got something artistic and at the same time realistic throughout (these two do not always go in pairs, of course). Although some scenes may seem chaotic and some of the content not particularly interesting, you get involved in watching it till the very end. It is a must to state here that PRIDE AND PREJUDICE perfectly shows the reality of the England of that time. There are a number of moments when we clearly see the lives of different people, their fears and struggles, their dreams and hopes. Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) wants her daughters to get married to rich men so that their future can be safe and stable. Such a viewpoint seems dated to us nowadays, but that's how all parents thought of their children's marriages at that time. And this plot is filled with humor in the film in order not to make the content vague and sluggish. ""Oh my goodness! Everybody behave naturally,"" which is said by Mrs Bennet at an unexpected visit of Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy. Another serious matter emphasized in the film is the clash between viewpoints of the people of different upbringing and social status. The conversation between Lady Catherine De Bourg (Judi Dench) and Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) perfectly proves that. Consider this moment... At the same time, artistic pictures are embedded in many realistic scenes, some of them may be long but they really add a wonderful atmosphere to the movie. Filmed in mystical landscape of the British Isles, the film's locations are a feast for the eyes. But there is art in foremost one significant aspect, the performances.<br/><br/>Most of the cast do great jobs in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Young and beautiful Keira Knightley gives a reverent performance as Elizabeth. I liked her acting throughout, particularly in the moments of her conversations with Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). Tom Hollander gives a reverent performance as Mr Collins, a typical man who cares mostly for his personal image in the society. His facial expressions when dancing on a ball drove me, and the majority of audience in the cinema, to gales of laughter. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy is maybe not that great in the role but at some moments, his acting is also worth considering. The Bennet sisters are portrayed by young actresses, some of them surely do not have the experience on screen, but who particularly shine in their roles are Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet and Brenda Blethyn as his wife, Mrs Bennet, the mother of the girls. It's a must to see the scene when Mrs Bennet asks her husband to reprimand his daughter Elizabeth for refusing to accept Mr Collins' hand ""...Your mother is angry because you refused..."" And the final shot - quite unexpected but how wonderfully played. Brenda Blethyn memorably presents a panic of a mother who heads her daughters to find proper men. Consider her total change when it turns out that Lydia disappeared and is not wandering somewhere but has just got married...<br/><br/>There is one more aspect of the film that I feel an undeniable need to discuss, the way it shows love between a man and a woman. We all know what most modern films concentrate on in this case. It is mostly based on sexual desire and on no taboo in exposing it. There are even some people who have so much got used to such a view that they cannot imagine a film which does not show any nudity or sex. And in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, there is nothing of that. However, this fact is made more paradoxical by one important issue. Almost everything in the content has to do with love between a man and a woman... yet, there is even no indication of sex. This is presented really artistically ... love having to do with safety, (sometimes, unfortunately money for some characters), dignity, honor, gentleness, and sympathy. Therefore, I may allow children to see it without fear of any harm that it could do to them. In this respect, I highly appreciate this film.<br/><br/>Honestly speaking, I really enjoyed the film and am going to see it once again. It led me to a very nice atmosphere and I really relaxed while watching it. Surely no masterpiece, but a brilliant little cinema work of the early 21st century. 7/10"

","Much to my surprise 'Pride and Prejudice' is really rather enjoyable. Keira Knightly makes a suitably petulant Elizabeth Bennett, Matthew Macfadyen a bemusedly surly Mr Darcy, and the supporting players are generally very good. Even ten years on this version has been compared constantly with the 1995 Andrew Davies BBC adaptation, unfavourably in most cases. I think this is a little unfair. Jennifer Ehle was too old for the part of Elizabeth by a good ten years, and Colin Firth's Darcy delivered surly by the bucketful, but lacked the underlying sense of social awkwardness which makes the character ultimately sympathetic, and Davies, typically, tweaked the plot on more than one occasion to 'improve' (sic) on the plot. There are quite a few liberties taken in the current film adaptation, of course, but these appear to narrative abridgements and occasional simplifications of Jane Austen's dialogue, and, I have to say, there are no real linguistic clunkers to offend fans of classic lit. Actually a few anachronistic contractions, etc., are fine by me. If they were to occur in a Readers Digest abridged edition I'd be irritated, as this would go against the intention of the author  this stuff is supposed to be read, after all. Film is different  sometimes a single silent shot says more than ten pages of dialogue. By resisting the temptation to incorporate every one of Ms Austen's witticisms and aphorisms, and relying on character the script seems more organic than Mr D's: Austen's jokes and jibes are great on paper, but as dialogue simply make characters seem more snide and self-satisfied than is really required. The sense and sentiment of the original is retained, which is the important thing. The Bennett sisters are nicely  if fleetingly  drawn (even poor earnest Mary, normally neglected in adaptations), and Brenda Blethyn, 'though not the glorious comic grotesque Alison Steadman created for the BBC version, is allowed to flap and flutter her head off. Donald Sutherland is good, too, as Mr Bennett, and my only real complaint in this adaptation is that more time isn't given to the relationship between Elizabeth and her father. Their exchanges in the novel are, understandably, pace-killers for the scriptwriter, and I can understand why they are simplified or excised here  but, that said, they are really rather nice. Knightly and Sutherland work well together, and it's a pity they weren't allowed to do more. No doubt the staggering inappropriateness of her casting as Domino Harvey (reviewed yesterday) was designed to steer wee Keira away from English Rose/Period Drama Queen stereotyping. If this is anything to go by, then she should stick with that archetype for a tad longer: a few good, solidly written stereotypes might turn her into a decent actress."

","The only comment I have is WHERE IS COLIN FIRTH!!!!!!I love this movie, but it just is not the same without Mr. Colin Firth. Maybe because the TV short series of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in Britain has just been implanted in my head. Mr Darcy equals Colin Firth. Especially seeing him play the role Mr. Darcy in Bridget Jones, I guess I had expected Colin Firth to play Mr. Darcy again. I know he is not getting any younger. But I still think he would play Mr. Darcy so well that we won't notice the age. It was still a good movie. Gotta love the directors. They do such a good job with cute comedy/love story. I really love the fact that they can make a wonderful comedy/love story in a everyday life situation like. No need to use the 3D or computer effects."

","This is easily Keira Knightley's best project to date, largely because of the timeless character of Lizzie Bennet, the intelligence of the script, and a supporting cast of unsurpassed talent. All the players are flawless. And the director, an old pro from the BBC, is full of inventive ideas that will tickle you.<br/><br/>Purists will kvetch. But this movie takes chances with a classic ... in an unexpected way, it reminded me of watching a Godard or Altman flick for the first time, wondering what they'd think of next. The landscapes are stunning and often reminiscent of ""Barry Lyndon,"" but without the self-important glossiness Kubrick imparted.<br/><br/>It is difficult to single out anyone, but I predict that Rosamund Pike, who plays the eldest sister Jane, may emerge as the Next Big Thing.<br/><br/>And Donald Sutherland and Brenda Bleythen make you wish there'd be a sequel: ""Mr and Mrs Bennet,"" about the empty nest they occupy after the girls leave home. Sutherland has two scenes with Knightley that will glisten your eye, and his sneaky performance inspires tired fathers everywhere to be better parents."
"sarastro7","9","0","1","14 January 2006"," Not for Austen purists - the rest of us love it!
","When I studied English lit in college we were supposed to read Pride And Prejudice. I only got through a third of it. Jane Austen is a writer you either love or hate, and I belong in the latter category. This bourgeois ad nauseam obsession with manners and marriage is extremely far removed from my own experience and my preferred way of life. I like classic literature, but in my opinion Jane Austen's work usually doesn't qualify.<br/><br/>This movie, however, creates a proper, worthwhile narrative, loaded with classic symbolism, taking the basic plot from the novel, and doing something quite different with it. In this movie Elizabeth and Darcy are forces of nature, undergoing an evolution towards a union based in poetic beauty, as is conveyed by the long scene at Darcy's estate towards the end, admiring the sculptures, etc. (a scene not in the book).<br/><br/>I have seen most of the other Jane Austen movies and TV series (it saved me reading the books), and this one is the first that properly translates the substance of a novel from the literary medium to the movie medium. It uses imagery. It establishes a highly visual and visceral setting. The cinematography here is capable of making a dung-heap look good! The panoramic beauty of the camera's movement across a breathtakingly authentic late 18th century semi-dilapidated farm and grounds is a bloody cinematic triumph. This era and the financial situation of the Bennets is presented infinitely more believably and interestingly than in past adaptations, and together with the scarce use of the original dialog and the fairly sketchy representation of the original plot, the end result is a lingering visual feast that gains far more than it loses. If you think, like me, that Austen is wildly overrated, then this movie actually succeeds in making her story palatable. My hat is off to the incredible rapport that must have emerged between the screenwriter and the director in the production of this movie. It is a thing of cinematic beauty.<br/><br/>I feel I should add, though, that I was not at all as taken with Knightley's performance as everyone else seems to be. She was adequate, nothing more. The meat of this movie lay in the cinematography.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","I've always liked Donald Sutherland's work, but I think his role here is by far his best. As with many British movies in my experience, the audio was difficult to understand because of background noise - an annoying and all-too frequent occurrence in British TV and movies. I haven't read the book (yet) but the movie was directed with a deft touch and good British humour - not afraid to poke fun at themselves. The scenes with the daughters were especially delightful, especially with their father. I think Sutherland gets the best line when she turns down the parson's offer of marriage, and he says to Lizzie ""Your mother won't see you again if you don't marry him, and I won't if you do."" Perfect deadpan delivery. Question: In the end credits, what was the ""thank you"" to Emma Thompson for?"
"NatalieNicole","10","0","1","13 January 2006"," A Classic in the Remaking
","This version of Jane Austen's beloved story is one of the best marriages to date (pun only slightly intended) of integrity to the time and, simultaneously, modern day cinematography. From a film-making standpoint, the shots are both as beautiful and colorful as those in the most recent rendition of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", but as honest and real as ""Bridget Jones Diary"" or ""Life or Something Like It"". The truth of emotion and relational dilemmas is well displayed as one might expect with this film's producer connections to ""Love Actually"".<br/><br/>Special attention should be drawn to the way wide angles are avoided when unnecessary, giving us a chance to walk along-side characters for long shots that continue through doorway after doorway, nearly Dragnet like but for the crowd and doors being open already in most instances. Dollhouse shots outside the Bennet home give a sense that we've truly stepped back in time and are viewing the ghosts that once possessed the classic homes we now walk through as museums.<br/><br/>Casting was also done remarkably, with actors selected and costumed so that viewers might not fall in love with characters until the appropriate time, making us, perhaps, realize our own prejudices and letting us progress past them just as the characters themselves do.<br/><br/>T'would be a pity if this film is not adopted into the realms of such classics as ""Anne of Green Gables"" since it is equally wrought with social lessons and remains family friendly while still addressing very real issues people of all ages face, even in current times. The film offers men more than a few lessons on how (and how not) to go about proposing, and women a greater understanding of wit and self-confidence as assets to femininity, as they're seen embodied so well in Keira Knightley's Lizzie. In an age where aggression and road rage are prevalent, it may also benefit modern-day men to see how MacFadyen masters being both powerful and genteel at the same time.<br/><br/>As a testament to this fine adaptation, true in all manners of acting, photography and writing, a friend (who usually cares little for period pieces, I might add, and had to be somewhat talked into going) that I took to the film just today said to me as we left the theatre, ""I forgot I was in the cinema!"" What more could a director hope for in the minds of his audience, male or (in this case) female?<br/><br/>A 'thank you' is deserved by Wright, Knightley and MacFadyen and the others who all daringly took on a daunting project and delivered it faithfully in a refreshingly new package."

I loved Keira Knightly's Elizabeth and as much as I adore Colin Firth, I really enjoyed the new Mr Darcy. I found them both to be very refreshing as these characters.

","First of all, the movie as a whole was extremely well acted, well scripted and faithful. It was a relief to see that the humor was not missed and was also not overplayed. I would easily have rated it 9 out of 10 - possibly even 10 out of 10, except...<br/><br/>About a quarter of the way into the movie my wife leaned over and whispered to me, ""I'm feeling a bit dizzy - I may have to leave."" Within less than a minute we both realized why she was feeling dizzy. It was the movie's cinematography! By the time the movie was over, we had come to the firm conclusion that cinematographer Roman Olin had devoted the first half of the film to a concerted effort to instill vertigo in the audience. In my wife's case, he succeeded.<br/><br/>We understand full well that there are all sorts of devices available in the film world to influence the audience's perception - from sound to color to lighting to framing and on and on. Skillful use of these devices creates a mood or underscores a message without the audience being consciously aware of the device's presence, let alone its impact. But what one filmmaker employs as a surgical tool, another may use as a blunt instrument to bludgeon unsuspecting victims, er, viewers.<br/><br/>Mr. Olin uses spinning, swooping, off-balance shots in such a heavy-handed surfeit during the film's first half that he risks inducing nausea. And while the movie was so very well done overall, we unfortunately left the theater with only one burning question - WHY? If this was to convey a message, what was it? I'm afraid we missed it, and given that the device was so overused as to become a gimmick, it must have been an awfully important message Mr. Olin was trying to drive home - drive as in sledgehammer, not as in Ferrari. Are we that dense, that we did not get the point? Or did we miss it because our faces were being shoved in it? Perhaps Mr. Olin meant to convey Elizabeth's confusion and misapprehensions. If so, then we can certainly observe that subtlety is not a word in his vocabulary. If not, then, well, what the heck was he doing? Thankfully, whatever his intent (perhaps mission would be a better word), he suddenly abandoned it about halfway through the film, which was a true blessing. But it is sad that, for us, this one manic gimmick threw a bit of a wet blanket over an otherwise splendid and thoroughly enjoyable movie-going experience. Dramamine, anyone?"

","I am an Austen fan and have seen as many P&P adaptations as it possible for me to see--I found a few TV ones listed that were not possible for me to find, but this makes the fourth adaptation I've seen, plus having read the book again and again, so I think I'm fairly qualified to give a good opinion.<br/><br/>I love this story. It is my favorite book in the world. I have to admit here to a personal bias to the 1995 miniseries, but I went in willing to give this movie a chance (without very high expectations). I was pleasantly surprised in many respects--and disappointed in some others.<br/><br/>First the bad things: the dialogue. I was VERY disappointed with the script. Obviously much of the story had to be cut down, and I thought they did a fairly admirable job of getting the whole plot in under the time constraints, but the dialogue they did leave wasn't Austen's dialogue, it was some semi-modern version of it that I believe was supposed to appeal more to the modern romantic-comedy audiences they thought would be viewing it. The whole heart and soul of P&P is the witty dialogue, in my opinion, and when they took it out, I thought it lost so much, it took all of the good points I mention to counterbalance that. Another disappointing thing was the (possible?) historical inaccuracies my friend and I saw. I don't claim to be a historian, but my interest in Austen and her world has led me to research the Regency period a bit, and as far as I could tell, it didn't seem as if this film had been researched fully. The sisters would go out with their hair down, and the fashions didn't always look quite right (the waistlines looked too low on a lot of the dresses). Minor details, but kind of important in making a period piece.<br/><br/>I also have a few minor issues with the casting--overall, I thought it was fine...Donald Sutherland, excellent; Judi Dench, excellent; and I liked Rosamund Pike's Jane as well. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth was not bad on the whole, but there were a few parts where I (personally) thought she was a little too gentle or soft and ought to have been a little snappier...but then again, I grew very fond of Jennifer Ehle, who had a lot of spark, and Ms. Knightley may have had a different interpretation of the character entirely. Matthew MacFadyen did a very creditable job, I thought...NO ONE holds a candle to Colin Firth, if you ask me, but after watching David Rintoul is the 1980 miniseries, I don't think I could find worse. He did a nice job of warming up for the Pemberley!Darcy.<br/><br/>Now for the GOOD things: the direction was wonderful. It was very original and interesting; it was something you came out of the theater remembering. There were some truly stunning shots in there--I remember one specifically where the servants were closing Netherfield as Bingley was leaving. As I said before, I'm a little biased when it comes to adaptations, so I will never see Pemberley as anything but Lyme Park, but this Pemberley was very nicely-chosen--the lake was beautiful; all the locations were very well-chosen, I think. The music was also fantastic...I especially liked the piece Georgiana played.<br/><br/>All in all, for what it was meant to be--a modern-day romantic comedy that just happened to be set in the past--I think they did a creditable job of it all. I recommend it for Austen fans and P&P lovers...but it will never replace the book itself (or my favorite adaptation)."

There isn't too much kissing stuff like in The Notebook that you just get sick of after a while, but it still keeps you hoping that Lizzy and Darcy will end up together. I'm not reading the book and I can't wait to get it when it comes out on DVD! This movie stays true to the book which is even better because I find when you read a book and then watch the movie like for example The Notebook or Harry Potter, they are a lot different than the movie which disappoints me. But Pride and Prejudice even took lines out of the book which makes it very similar. I've seen it in the theaters a couple times so I strongly suggest you see it!"

","I love Jane Austen, and took the opportunity to see this movie in London while I was there, before the movie opened in the U.S. In England, the movie ended with Donald Sutherland saying ""if any young men come for Mary and 9I forgot the other sister's name) I am entirely at my leisure."" The American version has a cheesy add on scene with Elizabeth and Darcy. Like, are we Americans so dumb that we couldn't have figured out it was a happy ending without the hackneyed kiss? The film makers deserve a big Bronx cheer. <br/><br/>Aside from the different ending, which really irks me, this was an interesting adaptation, especially the relationship between the parents. In the book, Mr. Bennet can't stand Mrs. Bennet, who he clearly thinks is an idiot. Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland, who were excellent, played this entirely differently."
"ellen-137","6","0","2","4 December 2005"," An alright movie!
","This movie was very heavily weighted because it had to live up to the very successful TV series made in 1995. However I think Keira Knightly was the an alright choice for the role because she but it over well but had a hard job to follow the TV show.This movie was a. There was some humour in this movie which made it more light hearted and warming.Brenda Blethyn who played Mrs Bennet was very good, as well as Donald Sotherland who played Mr Bennet. Mattew Mcfaden who played Mr Darcey was very dashing as Mr Darcey should be, and played the part really well.The scenery was very realistic and the camera work was excellent. Even though Iliked it I can't see it being as popular as Harry Potter which was out at the time because it appeals to a restricted audience and it's an love or hate movie. I have watched this movie a few times over and I like it more than when I saw it in the cinema. A down side would be that the movie wasn't as planned out as the original but it was a film and they couldn't have it this long as well as keep the viewer entertained for so they had to cut it short. Overall a good movie."
"Aaron-401","6","0","2","1 December 2005"," Now that's better!
","On the whole, i think that the Harry Potter saga has been a disappointment for the fans of the books. This is now being corrected by the producers of the latest instalement to the Harry Potter series. The acting is now at above average level and the story line was much better. They managed to keep in all of the action bits and loose the bores, without damaging the main plot. Daniel Radcliffe made a good effort this time, and, as usual, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, were their usual excellent selves. Although some of the more famous actors got a bit of the short straw, most of them were easily recognised for their performance. I wasn't impressed by the book, however the film version has made the whole story-line much clearer."

","i remember reading pride and prejudice in high school and finding it rather dry. i understood that rules of propriety during austen's time put restrictions on any overt gestures of passion, but my appreciation of this did not do much to assuage my feelings of disappointment that i was not moved as others by what had been described to me as one of the most romantic love story in all of English literature. <br/><br/>a friend recommend that i go see this new version of p&p, and much to my surprise, i loved every minute of it! my friend was absolutely correct when she described it as the most colorful, passionate, true to real life version of pride and prejudice ever made. the risks the director took with presenting characters with flaws, quirks and idiosyncrasies ultimately are what finally made me really understand, connect, and come to love these characters. i believe this heartfelt and touching film will bring this beautiful story to a whole new generation of people who might not have ever come to appreciate jane austen. <br/><br/>traditionalists who see the 2005 version as an aberration or bastardization of what is nearly a sacred text in the English canon should understand that this film is just that--a VERSION, a single interpretation. and what of it if this film includes a (very sweet and by today's standards, innocent) kiss at the end? compared to the very explicit films which are commonplace today, i found this work to be tender, refreshing, charming, touching, and very subtle. i believe the mark of a true classic is it's ability to endure--through generations of change in societal customs. <br/><br/>for example, the work of Shakespeare is continually adapted, some productions being very traditional, some extremely avant-garde. the avant-garde productions i have seen do much to show that the true nature of humanity prevails without regard to time period, place, or tradition. the lens through which we examine ourselves may change, but we as the subject remain the same. the rules of propriety during austen's time were the lens through which she examined everything--it perplexes me that there are those more concerned with the lens than the subject. <br/><br/>pride and prejudice, while a novel of manners, was ultimately a testament to the power of true love--and whether we be traditionalists or modernists, is the desire for this kind of love not a measure of our common passion? darcy and elizabeth overcome constraints and challenges to find their love for each other--why celebrate this and then cling to the rules and restrictions that kept our hero and heroine apart for so long? <br/><br/>long live mr. and MRS. darcy!"
"jemmytee","7","0","3","26 November 2005"," Keira Knightley was perfection...and they mucked her up.
","For those who go see this new adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" and come out disappointed, I have to say, ""Lay the blame at the feet of Joe Wright and Deborah Moggach."" What those two were smoking when they made this movie, I don't know, but don't let them near it, again.<br/><br/>They slashed important parts of the book's storyline and characterization in order to fit the story into little more than two hours yet still allowed plenty of time for nice long lovely dollies and pans. They took D'Arcy from being a proud but remarkably handsome young man and made him merely shy, leaving the whole blame for the misunderstandings on Elizabeth's shoulders (damned near unforgivable!) They ignored some of the most telling lines in the story -- i.e. Mrs. Bennet's perfect comment as regards Mr. Bingley's sudden departure from Jane, ""My only solace is she'll die of a broken heart and THEN he'll be sorry,"" (or close to that effect) -- and dropped some major moments -- like Mr. Collins' VERY uncomfortable visit with the sisters after Lydia's disgrace -- but then took ten minutes to wander through Pemberly. Major characters are relegated to bit parts (Caroline Bingley, Mr. Wickham) but then suddenly have MAJOR importance in the outcome of the story...and the short shift given Lady Catherine is inexcusable.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously -- it is NOT impossible to make any of Jane Austen's books into good two- hour movies. Emma Thompson did it with ""Sense and Sensibility."" And Aldous Huxley wrote a remarkable interpretation (not a slavish one but one which perfectly captures the book's spirit and sensibility) of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for MGM in 1940. And with that one, even though the time period is wrong and Greer Garson is a good ten years too old to play Lizzie, she catches her spirit and own vague arrogance perfectly. Then to top it off, you've got Lawrence Olivier as D'Arcy, who gives a perfect reading of Austen's line -- ""I am in no mood to give consequence to the middle classes at play,"" (ANOTHER line missing from this tripe of a script). So it's just the ineptitude of the two main creators of this new version that messes everything up, so far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Seriously, I cannot really fault anything else on the movie. The period is caught beautifully in look and style (I especially like how even Lady Catherine's wigs were not waxed into perfect place...which also points out exactly how involving the movie was NOT). The acting for the most part is good (albeit not great), excepting Keira Knightley, who is just right as Lizzie. I don't even bash Matthew MacFadyen for his bland portrayal of D'Arcy; he was doing the best he could with a wrongly written role -- though in the hands of a more seasoned actor it might (only MIGHT) have been pulled off -- and he is a nice-looking puppy.<br/><br/>It's funny, but this version of the book reminds me more of that God-awful version of ""The Scarlet Letter"" made with Demi Moore than anything from the BBC. It's like Joe Wright and Deborah Moggach didn't think they needed to worry about people who'd actually read the book and wanted at least the essence of that story in the film. It's like they thought, ""It's old; it's been done; let's muck around and see what we some up with."" And in doing so, they proved only that they have a tin ear for storytelling and no idea of beauty or grace. Too bad...because Keira Knightley absolutely was close to perfection...and for mucking her up, they ought to be shot."
"mkeisner2001","7","0","3","25 November 2005"," Everything good but the last scene
","Everything about this movie was great, except the last scene. I thought the director did a great job of condensing the story into a movie by not trying tell Jane Austin's (the goddess of literature) detail through words but to tell it through images and feelings. For example, the gentrified but rural England was captured magically. However all the improtant dialogue was there, taken right from the book. The tension between Lizzie and Darcy and her realization of being in love worked great. Then the movie ended with a sappy scene not in the book that was totally out of character. When the movie was over I said to my wife ""If Jane Austin saw that scene she would puke."""
"clawpack","8","0","1","12 November 2005"," An out of the ordinary treat
","This is my first exposure to the story of Pride and Prejudice, so I can't comment on the movie's faithfulness to the novel or how it compares to previous film versions. I can only judge it as an individual film, and I found it to be a winner. It draws you into the setting (early 19th century England) and presents some interesting characters too. Focusing on a family with five unmarried sisters, it's about the rituals of courtship and marriage that involve a great deal of wit, calculation, suspense, and deviousness. Oh, and occasionally, some actual love and affection, provided that concerns about finances and reputation have been satisfied.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays Lizzie, the second eldest of the five daughters, and she plays her very well, making her tough, smart, and resourceful without any loss of feminine charm. Lizzie is still young enough to do some giggling under the covers with her sisters, but she can also hold her own in witty banter with elite gentlemen and ladies. That dialog is perhaps the chief asset of the film. Gratuitous insults were allowed in polite society, provided they were expressed in a calm voice with proper English. Watching language be used as a weapon can be very entertaining, and the fighting in this film is often quite fierce. The only problem with Knightley is that she is really too beautiful for the role. Lizzie is supposed to be attractive, but less so than her elder sister.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I have to say I found the ending to be rather unsatisfying. In a modern Hollywood story, people who try to use wealth to get what they want would be thoroughly frustrated while the beautiful girl ends up in the arms of an ordinary schlub with a heart of gold. Such an ending is impossible here, because there are no ordinary schlubs in the film at all. I watched this movie to see something outside of Hollywood's formula system, but I found out that I've become awfully conditioned by those formulas about the right way to end a movie."
"vicvaris","10","0","1","11 November 2005"," Great job condensing the story we all love!
","This is a great story everyone should see and read. Keira Knightley (Elizabeth) was absolutely great as was the new Darcy, Matthew MacFadyen. This was a wonderful 2 hour endeavor to master the complexities of Austen's book and A&E's masterpiece adaptation with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br/><br/>A&E P&P fans will be both happy with this version and rest knowing the mini-series still is secure as the best of breed in all the Pride and Prejudice interpretations through many years.<br/><br/>Two things bothered me- one to no end.<br/><br/>Casting Donald Sutherland as a Mr. Bennett with an accent more out of Georgia than 18th century England was unforgivable. It reminded me of the vain attempts of Brad Pitt to master accents in ""Seven Years in Tibet"" (redeeming himself in ""Snatch""). That aspect of Sutherland was distracting until his final scene with Keira, which was masterful due to great writing and direction. If you cast an American in such a closely scrutinized film as this was bound to be, at least let's be sure to find actors that can do an English accent. Surely they passed over some great ones to do Donald a favor.<br/><br/>Secondly-- I had a love-hate relationship with the cinematography. It was incredible and annoying. The scenes shot were so masterful, but reminded me a bit of a great novel employing every literary clichÃ©. It was a little like watching a play of the Last Supper where all the actors at one moment freeze into the positions of the famous painting by the same name. Except, they were so often it seemed like a strobe- one after another.<br/><br/>Like I said, I loved it and hated it. I'll have to think about it some more, and be sure to study the DVD. Probably it represented a really creative departure from convention that I just need to watch again.<br/><br/>On the other hand the creative complexity of many scenes was amazing. Joe Wright directing, really told much of the story normally found in Austen's dialog, simply by framing a seemingly unrelated passing glance by one character in a scene focusing on another portion of the story. That was flawless.<br/><br/>I believe Wright will get a best director nomination, as will Knightly for her portrayal as as Elizabeth. I also suspect the edgy cinematography will get a nod too.<br/><br/>Lots of other good stuff, but too much to mention.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"tash1962","Null","0","3","24 October 2005"," Passionately Beautiful
","The cinematography, costumes, buildings, homes, decor etc etc are absolutely fantastic. I really loved this movie and all credit to Joe Wright the Director, I think he nailed it, thank you so much.<br/><br/>Of course one can't help compare to the 1995 mini series so once home I immediately put the DVD on and skimmed through it and with that in my mind everyone, here are my comments.<br/><br/>The latest version is better because there is more emotion and a sense of realism in it which comes from the costumes and homes etc. Keira puts more emotion into Elizabeth than Jennifer ever did. I have always thought Jennifer portrayed Elizabeth with too much pride and arrogance and one almost found it hard to believe she loved Darcy. With Keira I totally believed she loved him and she was certainly falling in love with him well before visiting Pemberley. Matthew v Colin is a difficult one but I think Matthew has pulled it off. I will certainly be buying the DVD once it is out.<br/><br/>All the other characters too in the latest version are superb, my only negative here is Lydia, but then Julia Sawalha was exceptional in the 1995 mini series and of course had far more screen time.<br/><br/>If you like period drama/romances then P&P is a must see. A great love story with laugh out loud humor also..what more could you ask for !"
